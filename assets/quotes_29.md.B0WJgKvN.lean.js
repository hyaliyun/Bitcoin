Australia's largest artificial lake by volume, Lake Argyle was completed in 1972. It has not been economically successful; $1.45 billion has been spent on the Ord Irrigation Scheme for a return of 17 cents on the dollar, and only 260 jobs created. The lower reaches of the river support an important wetland area known as the Ord River Floodplain, a protected area which contains numerous mangrove forests, lagoons, creeks, flats and extensive floodplains. The traditional owners are the Miriwoong Gajerrong peoples who have inhabited the area for thousands of years and knew the Ord river as Goonoonoorrang.. In a letter to the Surveyor General, dated 12 October 1959, Miss Louise Gardiner, Secretary of the Nomenclature Advisory Committee wrote: “’Cununurra’…means ‘Black Soil’. It is the native name for Ord River. Perhaps it may be the native name for any big river, but according to Mary Durack it is definitely the name for the ‘Ord’.” https://sites.google.com/site/kimberleyhistory/research/naming-kununurra Naming It was given its current name in honour of Sir Harry St. George Ord GCMG, CB, RE, Governor of Western Australia from 1877 to 1880, by Alexander Forrest on 2 August 1879. Forrest's journal states. > We are still 300 miles from the telegraph line, and cannot of course tell > what difficulties may not yet be in store for us, so I feel bound to push > on, at the same time no one can regret more than I do that I am unable to > follow this magnificent stream to its mouth which I have no doubt will be > found in Cambridge Gulf–the whole of its waters in that case being in > Western Australian territory. I have named this river the Ord, after His > Excellency the Governor of Western Australia, who has taken so great an > interest in this expedition. Marked a tree F 158. The headwaters of the Ord river are located below the 983 metre Mount Wells and initially flows east and around the edge of Purnululu National Park before heading north through Lake Argyle then passing west of Kununurra and discharging into the Cambridge Gulf, which is at the southern extremity of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf, Timor Sea. The river has 35 tributaries of which the five longest are Bow River, Nicholson River, Dunham River, Panton River and Negri Rivers.  Ord River Irrigation Scheme  crossing the Ord river at Kununarra c1960 Ord Diversion Dam under construction c1962 The idea of damming the Ord was first mentioned over 100 years ago, when the Western Australia Commissioner of Tropical Agriculture, Adrian Despeissis, suggested, > Substantial wooden dams constructed on a double row of jarrah piles driven > into the bed of the river, with a core wall of puddle clay between, would > appear to form suitable weirs. Between 1935 and 1942 drought affected the Kimberley Pastoral Industry providing the key motivation for the Ord Scheme. The focus in 1937 was that a dam on the Ord could supplement the pastoral industry. = Ord River experimental station = Then Minister for Lands and Agriculture, F J S Wise, in 1937 wrote > ..we set a plan in motion during the past twelve months in connection with > the establishment of experimental areas on Ivanhoe Station somewhere near > Carlton Reach. Carlton Reach was the largest waterhole in the Kimberley, being naturally dammed and held back by the Bandicoot Bar, a quartzite rock bar that held back the waterhole for many miles forming a natural permanent lake. In 1939, Michael Durack and Isaac Steinberg traveled to the region to investigate its suitability for resettling Jewish refugees. Any resettlement scheme would have involved irrigation works on the Ord. By 1941 the Carlton Reach Research Station, also known as the Ord River Experimental Station, was set up by Kimberley Michael Durack for the Western Australia Department of Agriculture with funds, supposedly \\"siphoned off\\" from the Kalgoorlie pipeline and assistance from the Western Australia Public Works Department (PWD). = Ord River dam surveys = During August 1941 the newly appointed Director of Works, R. J. Dumas, spent three weeks in the East Kimberley, > ...accompanied by F. Forman (Government Geologist). T. Brennan (Acting > Engineer for the North West), K. Durack, J. Walker (a half caste aboriginal) > and a full blood aboriginal, Jacko This party travelled by horseback along the Ord River and through the Ord River gorges in the Carr Boyd Range, selecting several possible dam sites. Work continued at the Carlton Reach experimental station for Kim Durack with assistance from his brother William A. Durack, on various agricultural experiments, centred on supplementing the pastoral industry. = Involving the Commonwealth = Early in 1944 Dumas wrote to the Commonwealth Government, advising of the soil, botanical, erosion and engineering surveys about to take place in the East Kimberley, explaining, the project must become largely a national one and any assistance from the Commonwealth would be welcome. By May 1944 there was a large body of agriculturalists, botanists and surveyors carrying out investigations in the vicinity of Carlton Reach. The Aborigines who lived in the Ord River basin were decimated through killing and the spread of introduced diseases.Land of Promises: Aborigines and Development in the East Kimberley by Herbert Cole Coombs, Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies, Australian National University, 1989. = Establishment of the Kimberley Research Station = It would be another two years before the Commonwealth Government became involved, with the establishment of a joint CSIR and Western Australia Department of Agriculture facility. As the Carlton Reach, Ord River experimental station site was river alluvium (red soil) and most of the surveyed agricultural land was \\"Cununurra Clay\\" (blacksoil - Volcanic soil eroded from the Antrim Plateau Volcanics), it was moved to a new site further down river and the new Kimberley Research Station (KRS) was established in 1946. = Justifying dam construction = In 1951, The KRS Supervisory Committee (KRSSC) indicated that sugar and rice were two cash crops that could justify dam construction. Over the 13 years between 1946 and 1959 various agricultural experiments were undertaken at KRS and in April 1959 the KRS Supervisory Committee recommended the establishment of a pilot farm. In August 1959, the Commonwealth Government made a grant of £5m to WA Government, most to be used for the Ord River Scheme. =Origin of the Ord River Irrigation Area= Pumping station, river and irrigated fields The Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA), which was originally known as the Ord River Irrigation Scheme (ORIS) or Ord River Project, when it was approved by the Commonwealth Government, late in 1959 and began in 1960 with the establishment of the town of Kununurra, which was gazetted a town on 10 February 1961. = The first dam – Ord River Diversion Dam = The construction of the Ord River Diversion Dam started in late 1960 and was officially opened in July 1963 by then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies. The Ord River Diversion Dam holds back Lake Kununurra, which gravity feeds the Ord River Irrigation Area with water via the Main Channel (M1C1). The main channel is visible in the photograph with Lake Kununurra, Ord River (formerly the Carlton Reach waterhole, Ord River) in the background. = The Ord River pilot farm = To test the commercial viability of the ORIA, the WA Government, passed an act of parliament, known as the Northern Development (Ord River) Act, and in October 1960, ratified an agreement with the company Northern Developments, Ord River Pty. Ltd. to set up and run the first \\"pilot farm.\\" This was backed by the WA Government but was to run as a commercial farming venture. By November 1960 the first 200 acres had been chain-dozed and cleared, a channel and pumps were in place, to irrigate the first commercial rice crop that had been planted on the new pilot farm. This was almost three years before the completion of the Ord River Diversion Dam and main channel, so the pilot farm irrigated by pumping water from the Carlton Reach waterhole. = Commercial irrigation farming = Allocation of commercial farm land during Stage 1 of the project was allocated in stages, with the first group of farmers arriving in 1962 and final allocations completed in 1966. 30 farms produced mostly cotton, however pest problems soon became apparent. The early 1970s saw the application of large amounts of pesticides on crops. The primary pest was the caterpillar Helicoverpa armigera which developed resistance to the pesticides. The resulting low crop yields combined with a drop in world cotton prices led to suspension of the commercial cotton industry in the region. = The second dam – Ord River (Main) Dam = Work started on the main Ord River Dam in 1969 and was completed before the official opening on 30 June 1972 by Prime Minister William McMahon, when he said.. > This marks the beginning of Ord stage twoFilm – Building the Ord River Dam – > Water Authority of Western Australia The main Ord River Dam, known locally as \\"Top Dam\\" holds back the waters of the Ord River in Lake Argyle. The Ord scheme created Lake Argyle, which is Australia's largest dam reservoir, covering an area of 741 km2. =Disputed views about economic value of the irrigation scheme= Until the mid-2010s most reports of the scheme derided its lack of economic return. In 2013, the Wilderness Society estimated that $1.45 billion had been spent on the Ord Irrigation Scheme for a return of 17 cents for every dollar spent.Tristan Knowles, Economists at Large. The Wilderness Society. 2013. Rivers, rivers, everywhere. The Ord River Irrigation Area and the economics of developing riparian water resources. Prepared for the Wilderness Society, Economists at Large, Melbourne, Australia. In 2016 the Auditor General for Western Australia reported that \\"The sustained social and economic benefits underpinning the decision to proceed with this $529 million investment have not been realised. Nor is there a plan to track and assess them.\\"Ord-East Kimberley Development. Report 20 of the Office of the Auditor General for Western Australia. 7 September 2016. https://audit.wa.gov.au/reports-and-publications/reports/ord- east-kimberley-development/auditor-generals-overview/ The Australia Institute reported that \\"Attempts to develop northern Australia by subsidising capital- intensive industries like irrigated agriculture have a long and unimpressive history. An example is the Ord River Scheme which currently supports just 260 jobs despite $2 billion spent and decades of effort.\\".Dam the expense.

The Ord River irrigation area today  The Ord River dams provide water for irrigation to over 117 km2 of farmland and there are plans to extend the scheme to allow irrigation of 440 km2 in the near future. The main Ord River dam also generates power for the local community of Kununurra. By 2009 more than 60 different crops were grown in the Ord catchment area. One third of the area is used for sugar cane cultivation. In 2012 the release was approved of an additional 74 km2 of Stage 2 Goomig lands for irrigated agriculture, while the same year the West Australian Department of Agriculture conducted soil and water investigations of the Cockatoo Sands (red loamy sands) near the Ord River Irrigation Area, Kununurra. These investigations identified about 65 km2 of Cockatoo Sands and about 24 km2 of Pago Sands on Carlton Hill Station suitable for fodder or perennial crops. The Cockatoo Sands have great potential because they are well-drained and have capacity to support agriculture throughout the wet season. As part of the Water for Food government program, the Department of Agriculture also investigated an additional 300 km2 of Cockatoo soils north of Kununurra for possible expansion. In 2009, the Rudd Government and Colin Barnett announced a development plan for the area. The plan emphasised community and infrastructure development including upgrades of Kununurra Airport and the port at Wyndham. =Power generation= The Ord River Dam Hydro Scheme is a privately funded, owned and operated power system in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia. It consists of a new 36 MW hydro electric power station at Lake Argyle interconnected, by lengthy 132 kV transmission lines, with existing diesel fuelled power systems at the Argyle diamond mine and the Kununurra township. The scheme can currently only produce 1% of the power the Snowy Mountains Scheme produces. The power station was constructed from 1995 to 1996. =Environmental effects= CSIRO research conducted in 2008 found that the water quality in the lower reaches of the river was good and that planned activities were not an ecological threat. Salinity and erosion are also becoming an issue in the area, due to the rising of the water table in the area. The use of groundwater drains has been suggested by hydrologist Dr Tony Smith, as a possible remedy to salinity problems. Some concerns have been raised that the large body of water created by the dam could attract Asian insects and birds which may transmit dangerous viruses such as avian influenza. Like so many other experiments in tropical agriculture the scheme initially failed because of difficulties growing crops and attack from pests. Today the irrigated areas successfully produce a variety of fruits and vegetables, with the most recent crop being sandalwood. Associated wetland areas have been preserved within the Lakes Argyle and Kununurra Ramsar Site. Ord water quality and flow contributed to the disappearance of the Common Banana Prawn (Rachel Carbonell, \\"North Queensland irrigation plan could 'destroy' prawn fisheries in Gulf of Carpentaria, producers warn\\", ABC News – 27 March 2014) The site forms part of the Ord Irrigation Area Important Bird Area (IBA), so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for wild birds, especially estrildid finches. =Logistics= Much of the produce is exported to South East Asia. Sugar, which was produced from the late 1990s until the end of 2007 in the ORIA was trucked to Wyndham where it was exported to a Korean-owned food manufacturing plant in Surabaya, Indonesia. Fruit and vegetables are sold to domestic markets and are trucked to all capital cities. The ORIA is also home to the largest commercial Indian Sandalwood plantations in the world.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 17, 2002. In the episode, the Simpsons buy a satellite television system, which Bart spends so much time watching that he does not study for an important achievement test. He scores so low that Principal Skinner demotes him to third grade, while Lisa does so well that she is moved up to third grade. The two are placed in the same class and become rivals. During a trip to Capital City, they get separated from their class and are forced to help each other in order to find their classmates. Plot Homer buys a satellite system with over 500 channels. He and Bart become addicted to it, and Bart does not study at all for an important upcoming achievement test, even as Lisa is spending all her time preparing. Once the test is done, Principal Skinner announces the results at a school assembly. Not only does Bart fail the test and is demoted to the third grade, but Lisa aces the test and gets promoted to the third grade, where they meet their new teacher, Audrey McConnell. Interestingly during class, Bart performs well on tests (having memorized the answers from his previous experience in the third grade), while Lisa has a hard time adjusting to the class. Audrey decides to clamp their desks together after Bart answers a trick question he had seen the previous year, as the teacher thinks Lisa needs Bart's help. Later, Bart gets an A on a map test while Lisa only gets an A–. Bart says that the test was easy and recites all of the answers to Lisa, which he had memorized from last year in third grade (because he claims that the answer key never changes). Lisa proclaims that Bart cheated but the teacher did not hear Bart's recitation and tells Lisa to stop being jealous. Bart and Lisa are made field trip partners as part of the buddy system on a field trip to Capital City. When they are there, they hear that the flag for the state Springfield is an embarrassment (it contains a Confederate flag, despite the state being from the North), and their teacher assigns for homework an assignment to design a new flag. Lisa calls Marge as she designs her flag, which says \\"To Fraternal Love\\". On the phone, she complains about and makes fun of Bart, unmindful of the fact that Bart is overhearing the conversation on another phone and getting very angry about her comments. The next day, Bart, Lisa and the other third-graders hand over their flag designs to the Governor. When the Governor sees Lisa's design, she starts to cry and displays the flag which now reads \\"Learn to Fart\\". This appalls Lisa, as Bart innocently admonishes her for making the Governor cry. Later, Bart again teases Lisa and they get in a fight and miss the bus heading back to Springfield. The fight brings them out of the parking lot and into the forest. As a result, the two wind up getting lost. Lisa tells Bart she is hurt by his behavior and Bart sounds somewhat apologetic, though he also adds in the interest of full disclosure that he wants to say he is sorry for using Homer's steamroller a while back to crush Lisa's bike, which he then blamed on Gypsies. Back in Springfield, Principal Skinner informs Homer and Marge that Bart and Lisa are missing. They go to Capital City to find them. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa have been confronted by a family of hillbillies, who save them by driving them back to Capital City. Marge is ecstatic on seeing her children safe and sound. Principal Skinner, worried about the effects of placing Bart and Lisa in the same class, suggests that they return to the \\"status quo ante\\" – both Simpson kids go back to their proper grades. Production \\"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons (2002–03). American singer Tony Bennett is credited as guest starring in the episode, though his lines were taken from archival audio. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 17, 2002. It was viewed in approximately 7.47 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 7.0, the episode finished 44th in the ratings for the week of November 11–17, 2002 (tied with new episodes of Becker and Boomtown). It was the highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, beating shows such as King of the Hill, 24, and Malcolm in the Middle. On December 6, 2011, \\"Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade\\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Fourteenth Season. Staff members Al Jean, Tim Long, Ian Maxtone- Graham, John Frink, Kevin Curran, Steven Dean Moore, Mike B. Anderson, and Michael Price participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode \\"opens with a TV-based segment awfully reminiscent of Season Two's 'Homer Vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment' and doesn’t get much better from there. As usual, we discover a few laughs along the way – particularly when Bart tries to teach mnemonics – but these are less plentiful than I’d like. This ends up as a wholly mediocre episode.\\" Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest called the episode \\"memorable\\".

Prior to 1 January 2011, it was known as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA). The Act is the legislative vehicle for competition law in Australia, and seeks to promote competition, fair trading as well as providing protection for consumers. It is administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and also gives some rights for private action. Schedule 2 of the CCA sets out the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The Federal Court of Australia has the jurisdiction to determine private and public complaints made in regard to contraventions of the Act. Application of Act The Competition and Consumer Act (CCA) is an act of the Parliament of Australia and so its application is limited by section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which sets out the division of powers between the federal and state parliaments. As a result, most of the CCA is drafted to apply only to corporations, thus relying on Section 51(xx). Some parts of the CCA have a broader operation, relying for instance on the telecommunications power (Section 51(v)) or the territories power. The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is applied as state law through the Fair Trading Acts in each Australian State and Territory, to extend the application of the ACL to individuals. The Act exempts the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments from some provisions of the Act. The immunity from the Act does not generally derive to third parties who deal with the government: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare.. The article: 'Consumer Protection Law in Australia' (LexisNexis 2011) by Ven. Alex Bruce ('Tenpa') was the first Australian text to critically analyze the most extensive changes to consumer protection law embodied within the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.Bruce A. Consumer Protection Law in Australia. LexisNexis 2011 (2nd edition due 2013) Provisions =Establishing Parts= The CCA establishes four organisations with a role in administering the Act: * Part II establishes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) * Part IIA establishes the National Competition Council * Part III establishes the Australian Competition Tribunal * Part IIIAA establishes the Australian Energy Regulator =Part IIIA: Access to Services= Part IIIA of the CCA deals with third party access to services of facilities of national significance. For example, it covers access to electricity grids or natural gas pipelines. The aim of this part of the act is to encourage competition in upstream or downstream markets. This part of the Act allows services to be 'declared' and for parties to negotiate terms and conditions of access. The National Competition Council and the ACCC are both involved in registering agreement and assessing what is fair (to owners, to public, to users). As an alternative to declaring a service, it may be subject to undertakings registered with the ACCC. =Part IV: Restrictive Trade Practices= The restrictive trade practices, or antitrust, provisions in the CCA are aimed at deterring practices by firms which are anti-competitive in that they restrict free competition. This part of the act is enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC can litigate in the Federal Court of Australia, and seek pecuniary penalties of up to $10 million from corporations and $500,000 from individuals. Private actions for compensation may also be available. These provisions prohibit: * Most Price Agreements (see Cartel and Price-Fixing) * Primary boycotts (an agreement between parties to exclude another) * Secondary boycotts whose purpose is to cause substantially less competition (Actions between two persons engaging in conduct hindering 3rd person from supplying or acquiring goods or services from 4th) * Misuse of market power – taking advantage of substantial market power in a particular market, for one or more proscribed purposes; namely, to eliminate or damage an actual or potential competitor, to prevent a person from entering a market, or to deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive conduct. * Exclusive dealing – an attempt to interfere with freedom of buyers to buy from other suppliers, such as agreeing to supply a product only if a retailer does not stock a competitor's product. Most forms of exclusive dealing are only prohibited if they have the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market. * Third-line forcing: A type of exclusive dealing, third-line forcing involves the supply of goods or services on the condition that the acquirer also acquires goods or services from a third party. Third-line forcing is prohibited per se. * Resale price maintenance – fixing a price below which resellers cannot sell or advertise * Mergers and acquisitions that would result in a substantial lessening of competition A priority of ACCC enforcement action in recent years has been cartels. The ACCC has in place an immunity policy, which grants immunity from prosecution to the first party in a cartel to provide information to the ACCC allowing it to prosecute. This policy recognizes the difficulty in gaining information/evidence about price-fixing behaviours. =Part IVB: Industry Codes= Part IVB allows the Australian government to prescribe Industry Codes, and breach of these codes is a breach of the Act. The ACCC administers ongoing compliance with these codes. There are currently three codes made under this part: * the franchising code * the oilcode, and * the horticulture code. =Part VII: Authorisations, Notifications, and clearances in respect of restrictive trade practices= A unique feature of the Competition and Consumer Act, which does not exist in similar legislation overseas, is that the ACCC may grant exemptions. The ACCC may grant immunity based on assessment of the public benefits and anti-competitive detriments of the conduct, through the 'notification' or 'authorisation' process. Such exemptions do not apply to resale price maintenance or misuse of market power. The ACCC maintains a public register of authorisations and notifications. In 2006 the Act was amended to include a new Division 3 to Part VIIA providing a process for formal clearance and authorisation of mergers. =Part VIIA: Prices surveillance, Notification, and Monitoring= Part VIIA enables the ACCC to examine the prices of selected goods and services in the Australian economy. The ACCC's functions under this part are: * To hold price inquiries in relation to the supply of goods or services, and to publicly report the findings to the responsible Commonwealth minister * To examine proposed price rises on 'notified' goods, subject to instruction from the Minister. This allows some control over price rises * To monitor the prices, costs and profits of an industry or business under the direction of the minister and to publicly report the results to the Minister. Australia is a free market economy; consequently, the Act does not establish the ACCC as a price-fixing body. An example of the use of this section is that, under a direction from the Minister, the ACCC monitors the price of petrol. However, the ACCC cannot set the price of petrol, which has led to complaints that the ACCC is a \\"toothless watchdog\\". =Part IX: Review by Tribunal of determinations of commission= Part IX allows the Australian Competition Tribunal, established in Part III of the Act, to review certain decisions of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Part X: Liner shipping Part X provides immunities for liner shipping from the competition provisions of the Act contained in Part IV. Upon registration of agreements with the registrar of liner shipping, shipping operators may discuss and fix prices, pool revenues and losses, coordinate schedules and engange in other conduct that would otherwise breach Part IV provisions. =Part XIB and Part XIC: Telecommunications Regulation= The Act also regulates aspects of the Telecommunications market. In Australia the previously government-owned Telstra, now privatised, has traditionally dominated the telecommunications sector. Telstra owns the copper network infrastructure. The market was partially deregulated in 1992 with the introduction of Optus as a competitor. In 1997 deregulation continued when new entities were permitted to enter the market (see Communications in Australia). However, a feature of the Australian telecommunications market is that it is neither feasible nor efficient to have multiple networks, for example, of fibre-optic cables or of copper cables. For this reason, sections XIB and XIC of the Act exist to ensure that competitors (downstream users) have access to Telstra's networks. Part XIB of the Act allows the ACCC to issue a Competition Notice to a carrier (telecommunications corporation) if it has reason to believe the corporation has engaged in \\"anti- competitive conduct\\". \\"Anti-competitive conduct\\" refers to the restrictive trade practices in Part IV of the Act (Sections 45, 45B, 46, 47 or 48), or when a carrier with a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications market has taken advantage of the power with the effect, or likely effect, of substantially lessening competition. If the conduct continues after the issue of the Competition Notice, the ACCC can seek an injunction and financial penalty through the Federal Court. Competition Notices also allow third parties to take legal action. Part XIC is a telecommunications-specific access regime. The object of Part XIC is to promote the long-term interests of end- users of telecommunications carriage services and services that facilitate the supply of such carriage services: s152AB. The extent to which something promotes the long-term interests of end-users is assessed by having regard to three, and only three, objectives, namely: * promoting competition in markets for listed services; * promoting any-to-any connectivity; and * encouraging economically efficient use of, and investment in, the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied. Under Part XIC, the ACCC can 'declare' particular telecommunications carriage services if it is in the long-term interests of end-users: s152AL. Suppliers of declared services must comply with standard access obligations: s152AR. Persons can obtain access to declared services on terms and conditions set either: * by agreement with the supplier of the declared service, * by an ordinary access undertaking given by the supplier of the declared service, or * through arbitration by the ACCC. =Schedule 2: Australian Consumer Law= The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is based on the proposition that low consumer power or lack of information is a market failure which needs to be addressed by interference in the market. These parts deal with: * Unfair Practices (including unconscionable conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct and unfair contracts) - Chapter 2 and Part 3-1 * Conditions and Warranties in Consumer Transactions – Part 3-2 * Product safety and information - Part 3-3 * Product Liability - Part 3-5 Misleading or Deceptive Conduct Misleading or deceptive conduct (s 18 of the ACL, formerly s 52 of the TPA) is one of the most important consumer parts of the act. It allows both individuals and the ACCC to take action against corporations who engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive. Misleading or deceptive conduct carried out by companies can also be prosecuted by the state (under Chapter 4 of the ACL). Unconscionable Conduct The inclusion of unconscionable conduct in the Australian Consumer Law is a codification and extension of the equitable principle of 'unconscionability' which was later clarified as a cause-of- action.. The High Court of Australia held that an act was unconscionable if a party to a transaction is under a 'special disability', the other party is or ought be aware of that disability, and that other party acts in a way that makes it unfair or unconscionable to accept the offer of the weaker party.. Section 20 codifies the common law by referring to the \\"unwritten law\\" (i.e. the common law). However, the inclusion of section 20 allows for remedies under the Law. Section 21 bans unconscionability in consumer transactions. Section 22 gives factors that indicate unconscionability. This clarifies the application of unconscionability and circumstances where a consumer is at a \\"special disability\\". Other Unfair Practices The Australian Consumer Law also prohibits a range of other unfair practices including bait advertising (advertising a product that is not reasonably available), pyramid schemes (Division 3 of Part 3-1 of the ACL, formerly Division 1AAA of Part IV of the TPA), and certain misrepresentations (e.g. a misrepresentation as to price). Consumer Guarantees (Division 1 of Part 3-2) The Australian Consumer Law implies into contracts with consumers certain guarantees (these were formerly known as warranties). Similar conditions are implied by the State Sale of Goods Acts, but these acts have slightly different jurisdictional limits (e.g. 'consumer' and 'goods') and the legislative phrases may have been interpreted slightly differently. Under the Trade Practices Act implied conditions and warranties are mandatory: they cannot be excluded by a contractual intent to the contrary. The implied conditions are as to title (s 53 of the ACL, formerly s 69 of the TPA), quiet possession, freedom from encumbrances, fitness for purpose (s 55 of the ACL, formerly s 71 of the TPA), supply by description or sample (s 56, s 57) and that the goods are of acceptable quality (s 54 of the ACL, formerly s 66 of the TPA, which used the term \\"merchantable quality\\"). As a caveat, where the consumer guarantees are not that of title, undisturbed possession or undisclosed securities, they only apply if the goods or services in question are supplied in trade or commerce. The most important of these to a consumer is likely to be acceptable quality. If goods or services fail to reach a basic level of quality (considering the price of the goods/services) – that is they are defective, break, or do not do what they should do – then the ACL has been breached. =The Dawson Report= The Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act (Dawson Report) was released in January 2003 and received 212 submissions. The scope of the report was quite broad, with recommendations regarding mergers and acquisitions, exclusionary provisions, third line forcing, joint ventures, penalties and remedies, and the functions and powers of the ACCC. As a result, some amendments have been made to the Act.

The poem \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\" is set against the dark background of child labour that was prominent in England in the late 18th and 19th centuries. At the age of four and five, boys were sold to clean chimneys, due to their small size. These children were oppressed and had a diminutive existence that was socially accepted at the time. Children in this field of work were often unfed and poorly clothed. In most cases, these children died from either falling through the chimneys or from lung damage and other horrible diseases from breathing in the soot. In the earlier poem, a young chimney sweeper recounts a dream by one of his fellows, in which an angel rescues the boys from coffins and takes them to a sunny meadow; in the later poem, an apparently adult speaker encounters a child chimney sweeper abandoned in the snow while his parents are at church or possibly even suffered death where church is referring to being with God. The poem from Songs of Experience was set to music in 1965 by Benjamin Britten as part of his song cycle Songs and Proverbs of William Blake.  Poems  \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\" (from Songs of Innocence) \\"The Chimney Sweeper\\" (from Songs of Experience) Analysis In 'The Chimney Sweeper' of Innocence, Blake can be interpreted to criticise the view of the Church that through work and hardship, reward in the next life would be attained; this results in an acceptance of exploitation observed in the closing lines 'if all do their duty they need not fear harm.' Blake uses this poem to highlight the dangers of an innocent, naive view, demonstrating how this allows the societal abuse of child labour. In Experience, 'The Chimney Sweeper' further explores this flawed perception of child labour in a corrupt society. The poem shows how the Church's teachings of suffering and hardship in this life in order to attain heaven are damaging, and 'make up a heaven' of the child's suffering, justifying it as holy. The original questioner of the child ('Where are thy father and mother'?) offers no help or solution to the child, demonstrating the impact these corrupt teachings have had on society as a whole.

The formerly independent municipality is approximately 4 km south the city centre of Mysłowice, close to the neighbouring city of Imielin. In the course of a major re-organisation of municipal borders in Upper Silesia it was incorporated into Mysłowice together with Wesoła and Dziećkowice. It has an area of 5,17 km2 and in 2012 had a population of 3,480. History The first mentioning of Kosztowy is in an old document from the 14th century. During that time it belonged to the Duchy of Ratibor. In 1391 Duke Johann II (the Iron) gave the large forests surrounding Kosztowy, Imielin and Gross Chelm to the Bishop of Kraków. Since the bishops were also civil administrators of their areas, Kosztowy did not become part of Silesia until 1742. In 1772 it became part of Prussia and from 1792 it belonged to the newly formed district of Imielin. In 1807 it became part of the Principality of Siewierz governed by the French marshal Jean Lannes. In 1817 it was returned to Prussia. The upper-silesian village of Kosztowy had 718 inhabitants in 1885. From 1818 to 1922 it was part of the Kreis (district) of Pless until it was turned over to Poland in 1922. Facilities Near Kosztowy there is a FM- and TV-transmission facility with a guyed mast.

The mineral is extremely rarely found as a pure substance, and usually has to be synthesized in a lab. It was named in 1819 after M.A. Ludwig Hedenberg, who was the first to define hedenbergite as a mineral. Contact metamorphic rocks high in iron are the primary geologic setting for hedenbergite. This mineral is unique because it can be found in chondrites and skarns (calc–silicate metamorphic rocks). Since it is a member of the pyroxene family, there is a great deal of interest in its importance to general geologic processes. Properties Spray of variegated green and lustrous Hedenbergite crystals to with rounded garnets Hedenbergite has a number of specific properties. Its hardness is usually between five and six with two cleavage plains and conchoidal fracture. Color varies between black, greenish black, and dark brown with a resinous luster. Hedenbergite is a part of a pyroxene solid solution chain consisting of diopside and augite, and is the iron rich end member. One of the best indicators that you have located hedenbergite is the radiating prisms with a monoclinic crystal system. Hedenbergite is found primarily in metamorphic rocks. Composition and structure Pyroxene quadrilateral The pyroxene quadrilateral easily records the compositions of different pyroxene's contained in igneous rocks, such as diopside, hedenbergite, enstatite, ferrosilite.Lindsley D. H. and Munoz J. L. (1969) Solidus Relations Along The Join Hedenbergite – Ferrosilite. American Journal of Science. Vol. 267-A, pp. 295-324 Hedenbergite is almost never found isolated. From the chemical formulas above, we can tell that the main differences in the compositions will be in terms of calcium, magnesium, and iron. D. H. Lindsley and J. L. Munoz (1969) did such an experiment in order to figure out exactly which combinations of temperature and pressure will cause particular minerals to combine. According to their experiment, at 1000 degrees with a pressure less than two kilobars the stable composition is a mixture of hedenbergite, olivine, and quartz. When the pressure moves to twenty kilobars, the composition moves towards the clinopyroxenes, which contains trace amounts of hedenbergite if any. For temperatures of 750 degrees Celsius, the compositions move from hedenbergite with olivine and quartz to ferrosilite with a greater amount of hedenbergite. If you combine the results of both of these sets of data, you can see that the stability of hedenbergite is more dependent on temperature as opposed to pressure. Hedenbergite with andradite garnet from the Cyclades Effects of chemical composition on elasticity Pyroxenes are essential to the geologic processes that occur in the mantle and transition zones.Kandelin J. and Weidner D. J. (1988) Elastic Properties of Hedenbergite. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth and Planets Vol. 93, pp.1063-1072 One crystal was oriented with the C axis, and another perpendicular to the C axis. The elastic strength of a polyhedron is determined by the cation occupying the central site. As the bond length of the cations and anions decreases the bond strength increases making the mineral more compact and dense. Substitution between ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+ would not have a great effect on the resistance to compression while substitution of Si4+ would make it much harder to compress. Si4+ would be inherently stronger than Ca2+ due to the larger charge and electronegativity. Occurrence in chondrites Chondrites are meteorites that have experienced very little alteration by melting or differentiation since the formation of the solar system 4.56 billion years ago. One of the most studied chondrites in existence is the Allende meteorite. Hedenbergite was found to be the most abundant secondary calcium-rich silicate phase within Allende chondules and is closely associated with other minerals such as sodalite and nepheline.Kimura, M., Ikeda, Y. Anhydrous Alterations of the Allende Meteorite in the Solar Nebula II: Alkali-Ca Exchange Reactions and Formation of Nepheline, Sodalite and Ca- rich Phases in Chondrules. Proc. NIPR Symp. Antarct. Meteorites, 8, 123-138, 1995. Kimura and Ikeda (1995) also suggest that hedenbergite formation may have been the result of the consumption of CaO and SiO2 as plagioclases decomposed into sodalite and nepheline as well as alkali-calcium exchange before the condrules' incorporation into the parent body. Occurrence in skarns Hedenbergite can be found in skarns. A skarn is a metamorphic rock that is formed by the chemical alterations of the original minerals by hydrothermal causes. They are formed by large chemical reactions between adjacent lithologies. The Nickel Plate gold skarn deposit of the Hedley District in southern British Columbia is characterized by hedenbergitic pyroxene.G.E. Ray and G.L.

Origin of the name There is some debate about the origin of the village's name; one theory is that there were once two villages named Clawson and Claxton, which grew together and became Long Clawson. History of Long Clawson, Accessed 27 December 2009 The \\"Long\\" part of the name may have arisen from it being over in length, although the main road through the village has 14 sharp bends. History The village is featured in the 1086 Domesday Book as Clachestone, but there is evidence of much earlier settlements.

Religion Church of St Remigius The village churches include the Anglican church of St Remigius, a Methodist church,Long Clawson Methodist Church , 21 January 2009. and a Baptist church dating from 1845. The last two congregations are now served by 20th-century red brick buildings. The former Primitive Methodist chapel of 1868 is now a private residence. The parish church of Saint Remigius dates from around the 14th century. Its walls, like those of the nearby manor house, are made of a rich red local stone. It contains a medieval effigy of the crusader William Bozon. The church was restored in 1893 and seats 300. The present Methodist Church was opened in 1956. Methodism was introduced into the village by a Mrs Hind through her contact with the Wesleyan Society in 1797. After joining a small society at Nether Broughton, she formed a society in Long Clawson, meetings being held in the kitchen of her home. Later a licence was obtained and William Parkes's home was registered for public worship. It became known as the Consecrated Barn. The first chapel was built in 1801 and in 1816 improved by the addition of a gallery. In 1840 a new chapel was built on the present site at a cost of £1100. A new schoolroom and a Minister's vestry were added in 1873, and a manse built alongside the chapel in 1887. In 1954 the chapel burnt down. A committee was formed to raise funds for a replacement and on 25 June 1955 the foundation stone for the new building was laid. The new chapel opened on 29 September 1956. Long Clawson Dairy One of only six in England where Stilton cheese is manufactured, Long Clawson Dairy was founded in 1911 by 12 farmers from the Vale of Belvoir.

In 1844, however, Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle placed several species in the genus. More were added in 1867 and 1871, when P. namaguanum and P. Lealii, respectively, were added. In 1882, John Gilbert Baker identified the first species of the genus from Madagascar, P. rosulatum. Several more species from Madagascar followed shortly afterwards. The first monograph on Pachypodium was published in 1907 by Julien Constantin and Georges Bois. It listed 17 species in the genus, 10 from Madagascar and 7 from central Africa. 20 species were listed in 1934, of which 14 were from Madagascar and only 6 from central Africa. By 1976, the number had returned to 17, with 12 of those being from Madagascar and 5 from central Africa. Several new species were added in the 1990s, and several classifications previously reduced to synonym or subspecies were elevated to the status of distinct species.

It is sited at Rukuhia, which was the name of the Royal New Zealand Air Force base on that site during World War II.  Passenger numbers  In the year to 30 June 2011 the airport had 316,000 domestic and 46,000 international passengers. In 2017/18 there were 353,000 passengers, all domestic, 54% of them to Wellington and 37% to Christchurch. Hamilton is the eleventh-busiest airport in New Zealand by passenger traffic. History The airport is on land owned by Samuel Steele (brother of William Steele, who brought militia-settlers from Sydney to Hamilton in 1864) from about 1880. By 1929 there was a landing ground on the farm, though a site close to the city was also considered. In 1935 Steele's aerodrome was sold for expansion into an airport and opened by the mayor on 12 October. As the world prepared for war, it became clear that a landing strip needed to be constructed in the Hamilton area. By 1935, the air strip was already in service, as a stopover for military aircraft that would land after a long journey. Services provided refueling as well as food and rest for the incoming pilots. Travel by air began to blossom soon after the war was over, and, in 1950, the airport received its first commercial flight. The main runway was sealed in 1965, and turboprop flights began to Hamilton that year, with NAC's Fokker Friendship aircraft operating. The runway was further lengthened to accommodate Vickers Viscount, 1970, and ultimately Boeing 737 aircraft types in 1975. In 1989, the New Zealand government sold the airport to councils representing Hamilton City (50 per cent), Waikato District (15.625 per cent), Waipa District (15.625 per cent), Matamata-Piako District (15.625 per cent) and Ōtorohanga District (3.125 per cent). This development led to unprecedented growth for the airport. Ansett New Zealand built an independent passenger terminal to the south of the main building, equipping it with a 'Golden Wing Club' lounge and food vending machines. The airline's Ansett NZ division operated flights to Wellington from Hamilton from 1995 until 2000, when Ansett NZ was sold to a New Zealand business consortium and rebranded Qantas NZ, with their own New Zealand domestic flights division. Qantas NZ operated at the airport until 2001, when it went into receivership. The terminal was then occupied by Origin Pacific airlines. This airline operated domestic services until it too went bankrupt in 2006. The small terminal was then left unused. In 1998, Hamilton Airport Motor Inn was developed to cater for travellers using the airport. A NZ$15.3 million terminal expansion begun in 2005 featured a 60 per cent increase in floorspace with improved baggage handling areas, better international and domestic check- in space, and passenger security screening. It was completed in late 2007. Hugh McCarroll was the airport's chief executive from the early 2000s until retirement in February 2006. The current chief executive is Chris Doak, formerly growth and development general manager for electricity utilities company WEL Networks. =Trans Tasman services= In 1994, the airport became a terminal for Trans Tasman air routes, with charter flights provided on Boeing 727s by Kiwi Travel International Airlines (not to be confused with the United States-based Kiwi International Air Lines) which served Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. New Zealand's Kiwi went bankrupt in 1996, but by that time Freedom Air had begun flying the same routes with Boeing 737 aircraft. They also, briefly, operated flights to Nadi, Fiji, in 2005. Freedom Air ultimately decided to make Hamilton International Airport their company hub until parent company Air New Zealand closed the airline down on 30 March 2008 operating its own full service instead. By then, the Airbus A320 was being operated. When passenger numbers dropped to an unsustainable level in August 2009, Air New Zealand ceased services to Australia. Virgin Australia attempted to fill the need for a trans Tasman service later that year with twice-weekly Boeing 737-800 flights to Brisbane; however, passenger numbers remained low and Virgin Australia ended flights on 27 October 2012. No further international flights have been made from the airport since that date. =Flight training= Hamilton Airport is home to the New Zealand Training Centre of L3Harris Airline Academy. L3Harris Airline Academy is the British flight training division of L3Harris that provides freshly trained airline pilots to numerous airlines throughout the world, mainly within the United Kingdom, most notably EasyJet, and also including British Airways, Qatar, Flybe, Thomson, Oman and, formerly, Thomas Cook and Monarch Airlines among others. Most of the non-passenger traffic at this airport is generated by L3Harris training flights, in single-engined Diamond DA20 and Cessna 172, and twin-engined Diamond DA42 Twin Star aircraft. The Waikato Aero Club has been based at Hamilton Airport since 1933. The club provides a full range of flight training from recreational flying in Light Sport Aircraft through to commercial Multi-Engine IFR. Capabilities The airport currently accommodates many different types of aircraft, from piston-engined light aircraft to commercial turboprop aircraft such as the ATR 72. The airport can handle all light business jets as well as 40-to-80-seat regional jets such as the Embraer E195 and Bombardier CRJ200. Several airliners can operate from the airport including the 100-200 seat Boeing 737, Boeing 757 and Airbus A320. The largest aircraft authorised to land at Hamilton is the 150-to-250-seat Boeing 767. Plans to increase runway length from 2,195m to 3,000m to attract larger aircraft and start Asian regional flights, have been considered. The airport operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In August 2011, approval was received by Hamilton International Airport to extend its runway up to 3,000 metres—the same size as secondary airports in other parts of the world, such as the Gold Coast. It will finish before 15 years' approval ends. The airport has a single terminal building and 6 tarmac gates. The apron is capable of accommodating up to five A320/737-800 aircraft at once.

Black May, or Bloody May (; ), is a common name for the 17–20 May 1992 popular protest in Bangkok against the government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon and the military crackdown that followed. Up to 200,000 people demonstrated in central Bangkok at the height of the protests. The military crackdown resulted in 52 government-confirmed deaths, hundreds of injuries including journalists, over 3,500 arrests, hundreds of disappearances, and eyewitness reports of a truck filled with bodies leaving the city. Many of those arrested are alleged to have been tortured. Background On 23 February 1991, Army Commander Suchinda Kraprayoon overthrew the democratically elected but openly corrupt government of Chatichai Choonhavan. The coup-makers, who called themselves the National Peace Keeping Council (NPKC), appointed Anand Panyarachun as prime minister. Anand's interim government promulgated a new constitution and scheduled parliamentary elections for 22 March 1992. A government coalition with 55% of the lower house was formed and appointed General Suchinda as prime minister. Massive public protests immediately followed. On 9 May, Suchinda responded by saying he would support a constitutional amendment making individuals who had not been elected to parliament ineligible for the premiership. Tensions dissipated, but the truce was short-lived. Popular protests On 17 May 1992 the two leading government parties announced that although they supported the constitutional amendment, they also favoured transitional clauses that would permit Suchinda to serve as prime minister for the term of the parliament. It became clear the government parties would not honour their word, and plans went ahead for a strike on Sunday, 17 May. =17 May= Obviously concerned about the people's mounting anger, the interior minister ordered provincial governors to prevent people from travelling to Bangkok to join the rally. Suchinda threatened to sack the governor of Bangkok for allegedly assisting the anti-government rallies of the previous week, while the army hastily arranged a competing \\"Anti-Drought Musical Festival\\" to be held at the Army Auditorium.Bangkok Post, May 17, 1992 Radio stations were banned from playing recordings by several popular singers who had voiced their support for the demonstrations.The Nation, May 16, 1992 Nevertheless, the rally was the biggest since the downfall of the Thanom regime in October 1973. At its peak, 200,000 people filled Sanam Luang, overflowing onto the encircling streets. At about 20:30, Chamlong Srimuang, Sudarat Keyuraphan, and Dr. San Hatthirat led the protesters on a two-kilometre march to the Government House to demand Suchinda's resignation. As they reached the intersection of Rachadamnoen and Rachadamnoen Nok Avenues, they were halted at Phan Fa Bridge, which had been barricaded with razor wire by the police. At 23:00 a group of demonstrators attempted to break through the barricade, but were repulsed by water cannons from four fire trucks blocking the way. The protesters then tried to commandeer one of the fire trucks, but were beaten back by riot police armed with batons. Protesters replied with stones and Molotov cocktails. Chamlong used a loudspeaker to urge the marchers not to attack the police, but his words were ignored. In this initial clash, about 100 protesters and 21 policemen were injured. =18 May= By midnight two fire engines had been set on fire, and the situation was spiralling out of control. Some 700 troops had been called in and the fighting fanned out from Phan Fa Bridge. At 00:30 Suchinda declared a state of emergency, making gatherings of more than ten persons illegal. The government urged people to go home. Hospitals in the area were already receiving the injured, including four with gunshot wounds who died that night. Chamlong remained near Phan Fa Bridge and nearby Democracy Monument. At about 04:00, soldiers threatened the nearly 40,000 protesters by firing M16 rifles into the air. An hour and a half later, they began firing again. By the morning, the army brought in more troops, and crowds grew larger in other sections of the city. Early on the afternoon of 18 May, Suchinda publicly accused Chamlong of fomenting violence and defended the government's use of force. Shortly thereafter, troops firing continuously in the air moved in to surround Chamlong. He was handcuffed and arrested. However, the crowds still did not disperse, and violence escalated. When government troops secured the area around Phan Fa Bridge and Democracy Monument, protests shifted to Ramkhamhaeng University in the east of the city. By the evening of 19 May, about 50,000 people had gathered there. Royal intervention Royal intervention on the night of 20 May. Left to right: Chamlong Srimuang, Suchinda Kraprayoon, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (seated). Early on the morning of 20 May, Princess Sirindhorn addressed the country on television, calling for an end to the violence. Her appeal was rebroadcast throughout the day. That evening, her brother, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, broadcast a similar appeal. Finally, at 21:30, a television broadcast of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Suchinda, and Chamlong was shown, in which the King demanded that the two men put an end to their confrontation and work together through parliamentary procedures. In the broadcast, the King addressed the two generals: > The Nation belongs to everyone, not one or two specific people. The problems > exist because we don't talk to each other and resolve them together. The > problems arise from 'bloodthirstiness'. People can lose their minds when > they resort to violence. Eventually, they don't know why they fight each > other and what the problems they need to resolve are. They merely know that > they must overcome each other and they must be the only winner. This no way > leads to victory, but only danger. There will only be losers, only the > losers. Those who confront each other will all be the losers. And the loser > of the losers will be the Nation.... For what purpose are you telling > yourself that you're the winner when you're standing upon the ruins and > debris? Suchinda then released Chamlong and announced an amnesty for protesters. He also agreed to support an amendment requiring the prime minister to be elected. Chamlong asked the demonstrators to disperse, which they did. On 24 May 1992, Suchinda resigned as Prime Minister of Thailand. Press censorship The front page of the International Herald Tribune's 20 May 1992 issue was blacked out with felt tip pen, as was an editorial of the Bangkok Post of the same date, though other articles relating to the demonstrations remained untouched. The English-language newspaper The Nation and two Thai- language newspapers were shut down on 21 May though the order was rescinded a few hours later. Aftermath The violence resulted in 39 reported deaths, hundreds of injuries, and many disappearances. Security forces \\"...intentionally fired on and killed many unarmed demonstrators and inflicted savage and gratuitous beating on hundreds of others.\\" Over 3,500 people were arrested. A House of Representatives Special Committee and a fact-finding committee led by Sophon Rattanakorn shared the same conclusion: the government of General Suchinda used excessive force to crack down on the rally. Some facts from the investigation, such as names of military officers and military units responsible for rounding up, killing, and torturing of protesters were revealed to the public. It is believed these facts were recorded in the report of the Ministry of Defense's Fact Finding Committee led by General Pichit Kullawanit, but it is still kept from the Thai public. The military constitution of 1992 remained in place until 1997, when a replacement was drafted and promulgated. Street art memorial near Khaosan Road Chamlong later apologized for his role in the events: \\"I wanted a peaceful rally,\\" he said. \\"I can't deny some responsibility for the damage and loss of life. I feel deeply sorry for those families whose members were killed in the incident, for those people who were injured and their families.\\" Nevertheless, he noted, \\"We were right in what we have done.\\" He then retired from politics, eventually to return during the protests against the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. Suchinda was later appointed chairman of Telecom Asia (today known as True Corporation), a company which received a concession to install two million telephone lines in Bangkok during the Anand government. Anand later became Chairman of Saha-Union Group, which had received an independent power producer concession during his government.

Prior to 1997, heulandite was recognized as a mineral species, but a reclassification in 1997 by the International Mineralogical Association changed it to a series name, with the mineral species being named: * Heulandite-Ca * Heulandite-Na * Heulandite-K * Heulandite-Sr * Heulandite-Ba (described in 2002). Heulandite-Ca, the most common of these, is a hydrous calcium and aluminium silicate, (Ca,Na)2-3Al3(Al,Si)2Si13O36·12H2O. Small amounts of sodium and potassium are usually present replacing part of the calcium. Strontium replaces calcium in the heulandite-Sr variety. The appropriate species name depends on the dominant element. The species are visually indistinguishable, and the series name heulandite is still used whenever testing has not been performed. Crystallography and properties Crystals are monoclinic. They may have a characteristic coffin-shaped habit, but may also form simple rhombic prisms. Frequently, a crust of fine crystals will form with only the ends of the rhombs visible, making the crystals look like wedges. They have a perfect cleavage parallel to the plane of symmetry, on which the lustre is markedly pearly; on other faces the lustre is of the vitreous type. The mineral is usually colourless or white, but may be orange, brown, yellow, brick-red, or green due to inclusions of celadonite. It varies from transparent to translucent. Isomorphous with heulandite is the strontium and barium zeolite brewsterite. The Mohs hardness is 3-4, and the specific gravity 2.2. Heulandite is similar to stilbite. The two minerals may, however, be readily distinguished by the fact that in heulandite the acute positive bisectrix of the optic axes emerges perpendicular to the cleavage. Heulandite, Berufjördur, Suður-Múlasýsla, Iceland. Clusters of pearlescent, curved heulandite crystals cover the vuggy, thin basalt matrix. Heulandite crystals are up to 2 cm. Discovery and occurrence Heulandite was first separated from stilbite by August Breithaupt in 1818, and named by him \\"euzeolite\\" (meaning beautiful zeolite); independently, in 1822, H. J. Brooke arrived at the same result, giving the name heulandite, after the mineral collector, John Henry Heuland (1778–1856). Heulandite occurs with stilbite and other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic volcanic rocks, and occasionally in gneiss and hydrothermal veins. Good specimens have been found in the basalts of Berufjörður, near Djúpivogur, in Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the Deccan Traps of the Sahyadri Mountains of Maharashtra near Mumbai. Crystals of a brick-red colour are from Campsie Fells in Stirlingshire and the Fassa valley in Trentino. A variety known as beaumontite occurs as small yellow crystals on syenitic schist near Baltimore, Maryland.

It is one of the best examples of Italian modern and contemporary architecture. The house was conceived around 1937 by the well-known Italian architect Adalberto Libera for Curzio Malaparte. Malaparte actually rejected Libera's design and built the home himself with the help of Adolfo Amitrano, a local stonemason. Description Casa Malaparte is a red masonry box with reverse pyramidal stairs leading to the roof patio. On the roof is a freestanding curving white wall of increasing height. It sits on a dangerous cliff 32 metres above the sea overlooking the Gulf of Salerno. Access to this private property is either by foot from the town of Capri or by boat and a staircase cut into the cliff. Casa Malaparte's interior and exterior (particularly the rooftop patio) are prominently featured in Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film, Contempt (Le Mépris). Map of Capri with Villa Malaparte in the East corner of the island Renovation The house entrance access was carved itself through the outside staircase in its center but the owner bricked the entrance and moved it to the side of the house in 1940. Casa Malaparte was abandoned and neglected after the death of Curzio Malaparte in 1957. It suffered from vandalism and natural elements for many years and was seriously damaged, including the desecration of a cocklestove, before the first serious renovation started in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The building was donated to the Giorgio Ronchi Foundation in 1972. Malaparte's great-nephew, Niccolò Rositani, was primarily responsible for restoring the house to a livable state. Much of the original furniture is still there, because it is too large to remove. The marble sunken bath in the bedroom of his mistress still exists and functions. His bedroom and book lined study are still intact. Many Italian industrialists have donated materials for the preservation. Today the house is used for serious study and cultural events. The furniture of the house is the subject of an exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in 2020. Access The house can only be reached by traversing the island. The last twenty-minute walk is over private property, belonging to the Giorgio Ronchi Foundation. It takes an hour and a half to walk there from Capri's Piazzetta at the summit of the funicular from the Marina Grande. The house can be reached by sea, on calm days only, as the waves are cast upon treacherous rocks and there has not been an official pier for many years. From the sea, one must climb 99 steps to reach the house. Malaparte gave his friend and boatman money to open a restaurant which is run by the boatman's son today. It is the only restaurant one would pass on the path from the Piazzetta to the promontory where Tiberius built his palace, Villa Jovis. The book Malaparte: Casa come me (A House Like Me) edited by Michael McDonough, includes drawings and essays by many prominent artists and architects, such as James Wines, Tom Wolfe, Robert Venturi, Emilio Ambasz, Ettore Sottsass, Michael Graves, Willem Dafoe, Peter Eisenman, Wiel Arets and many other luminaries of arts and letters.

He was the Grand Admiral (Kapudan Pasha) in command of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, where he was killed in action. He also served as the governor of Egypt from 1563 to 1566. Background He was the son of a muezzin of possible Albanian descent, hence his epithet Müezzinzade (\\"son of a muezzin\\"). He was a favorite of Sultan Selim II and of the women of the seraglio who admired his voice as a muezzin, and he married one of Selim II's daughters. From 1563 to 1566, Ali Pasha served as the Ottoman governor of Egypt. He was reportedly a very ascetic Sufi man, wearing only \\"coarse woolen clothes\\" and paying many visits to the tombs of saints in the City of the Dead necropolis in Cairo. Ottoman conquest of Cyprus Ali Pasha, with a fleet eventually numbering 188 galleys, fustas, transports and other ships, carried the main land force, commanded by Lala Mustafa Pasha, for the Ottoman invasion and conquest of Cyprus from Constantinople on 16 May 1570 to Cyprus, where they landed on 3 July. While Lala Mustafa commanded the eventual capture of the island from Venice, Ali Pasha took the bulk of his fleet to Crete and then to Morea, thereby effectively preventing any Christian relief fleet from coming to the aid of the besieged defenders of Cyprus. Battle of Lepanto and death A print from a 1571 anonymous German broadsheet after the Battle of Lepanto of the same year, where Ali Pasha was wounded and killed in action by being shot in the head and beheaded. The print ostensibly shows his \\"true likeness\\" in the foreground, while his head is displayed on a pike on an Ottoman battleship in the background. Ali Pasha was commander-in-chief of the Ottoman naval forces at the Battle of Lepanto on 7 October 1571. Selim had entrusted him with one of the most precious possessions of the Ottoman Sultans, the great \\"Banner of the Caliphs\\", a huge green banner heavily embroidered with texts from the Qur'an and with the name of Allah emblazoned upon it 28,900 times in golden letters. It was intended to provide an incentive for him and his men to do their best in battle. Ali Pasha was more of a land soldier than a naval tactician, and his failure to keep his lines together and keep his individual squadrons from charging like cavalry units in a land battle allowed the Christian forces to penetrate his battle line in various places and to surround and defeat the isolated ships. He was also somewhat of a firebrand and almost immediately sought the direct confrontation with his opposite number. His flagship, the galley Sultana, battled head-to- head with Don Juan's flagship La Real, was boarded and, after about one hour of bloody fighting, with reinforcements being provided to both sides by other galleys in their respective fleets, was captured. In the ensuing battle, Ali Pasha was slain and his head was then displayed upon a pike. This, and the capture of the Banner of the Caliphs by La Real, led to a collapse in Turkish morale, greatly contributing to their rout in the battle.

He also played football for his hometown club Bradford City. Early life and education Born in Bradford, Yorkshire, Bairstow excelled at school in several sports, and he played football several times for Bradford City, but eventually he settled on cricket, and played his first county match against Gloucestershire in 1970 after taking an A-level at 6am in order to play. Career He played for Yorkshire throughout his career, and captained the club from 1984 to 1986, though this was a far from happy period.A History of Yorkshire CCC, Tony Woodhouse Nicknamed \\"Bluey\\" on account of his red hair, influential for his aggression on the field and for his playing statistics. He was particularly well loved by the Yorkshire crowds for his ability to turn round limited over games by his late-order swinging of the bat. In 459 first- class cricket matches he scored 13,961 runs at an average of 26.44 with a highest score of 145. He snared 961 catches and 137 stumpings and perhaps stands second only to Jimmy Binks in the annals of Yorkshire wicket-keeping. He played 429 one day matches, scoring 5,439 runs at 20.68 with one century. Bairstow played for 21 seasons, three of them as club captain. He was a popular figure with the Yorkshire crowds. He played four Test matches for England, though was usually behind first Bob Taylor and later Paul Downton in the selectors' minds. He had more opportunities in One Day Internationals on the strength of his batting in domestic cricket - he made ten first-class centuries - but consistently failed to break through, and never scored more than 23 in his twenty ODI innings. He played for Griqualand West, during the winters of 1976 and 1977, appearing rather surprisingly as a seam bowler on two occasions and taking 3–82 against Transvaal B.report of match viewed on 6 August 2006. Retirement and death After retirement from playing in 1990, Bairstow became a popular radio commentator. However, he engaged in arguments with the Yorkshire management, and also suffered from depression. In late 1997, Bairstow took an overdose of tablets, and although he survived, a few weeks later he hanged himself at his home in Marton-cum-Grafton, Yorkshire. The coroner in the case recorded an open verdict, saying that he was not convinced Bairstow had meant to kill himself, and that his actions may instead have been a \\"cry for help\\". His wife, Janet, and children, Andy (22), Jonathan (8) and Becky, soon left Marton-cum-Grafton and moved to Dunnington. Family His son from his second marriage, Jonny, went on to play as wicket- keeper and batsman for both Yorkshire and England. Jonny's chosen squad number, 51, is a tribute to his father's birth year. His son from his first marriage, Andrew, played first-class cricket fleetingly for Derbyshire.

Six of these nurses, including Vivian Bullwinkel, were in the group which was massacred. Bullwinkel is standing sixth from the left. The Bangka Island massacre (also spelled Banka Island massacre) was committed during World War II in the Pacific, on Bangka Island, east of Sumatra in the Indonesian archipelago. On 16 February 1942, Imperial Japanese soldiers machine-gunned 22 Australian Army nurses and 60 Australian and British soldiers and crew members who had survived the sinking of by Japanese bombers. South Australian nurse Sister Lt Vivian Bullwinkel and two soldiers were the sole survivors. Not reported to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 nor included in subsequent re-tellings was the rape of the nurses before they were killed in the massacre. This was uncovered by research in 2019. Massacre On 12 February 1942 the royal yacht of Sarawak left Singapore just before the city fell to the Imperial Japanese Army. The ship carried many injured service personnel and 65 nurses of the Australian Army Nursing Service from the 2/13th Australian General Hospital, as well as civilian men, women and children. The ship was bombed by Japanese aircraft and sank. Two nurses were killed in the bombing; the rest were scattered among the rescue boats to wash up on different parts of Bangka Island. About 100 survivors reunited near Radji Beach at Bangka Island in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), including 22 of the original 65 nurses. Once it was discovered the Japanese held the island, an officer of the Vyner Brooke went to surrender the group to the authorities in Muntok. While he was away army matron Irene Melville Drummond, the most senior of the nurses, suggested the civilian women and children should leave for Muntok, which they did. The nurses stayed to care for the wounded. They set up a shelter with a large Red Cross sign on it. At mid-morning the ship's officer returned with about 20 Japanese soldiers. They ordered all the wounded men capable of walking to travel around a headland. The nurses heard a quick succession of shots before the Japanese soldiers came back, sat down in front of the women and cleaned their bayonets and rifles. A Japanese officer ordered the remaining 22 nurses and one civilian woman to walk into the surf. A machine gun was set up on the beach and when the women were waist deep, they were machine-gunned. All but Bullwinkel were killed. Wounded soldiers left on stretchers were then bayoneted and killed. Shot in the diaphragm, Bullwinkel lay motionless in the water until the sound of troops had disappeared. She crawled into the bush and lay unconscious for several days. When she awoke, she encountered Private Patrick Kingsley, a wounded British soldier from the ship who had survived being bayoneted by the Japanese soldiers. She dressed his wounds and her own, then 12 days later they surrendered to the Japanese. Kingsley died before reaching a POW camp, but Bullwinkel spent three years in one. Bullwinkel survived the war and gave evidence of the massacre at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal) in 1947. =Evidence of sexual assault= Recent evidence collected by historian Lynette Silver, broadcaster Tess Lawrence and biographer Barbara Angell, indicates that most of the nurses were raped before they were murdered. However, Bullwinkel was not permitted to speak about the rapes after the war, saying that she had been \\"gagged\\" by the Australian government. According to the Australian government, the perpetrators of the massacre remain unknown and \\"escaped any punishment for their crime\\".  Commemoration  In South Australia an annual commemoration known as the Bangka Day Memorial Service has been held at the Women's Memorial Playing Fields, St Mary's on the Sunday closest to 16 February since 1955. A plaque commemorating the South Australian Army Nursing Sisters who died, including Drummond and six others was erected at the site.

Dirtsurfing is the sport of riding a Dirtsurfer brand inline board. This new Australian boardsport is correctly known as inline boarding because Dirtsurfer is a trademark protected brand name. A Dirtsurfer is composed of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. Footstraps are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry where the front wheel pivots from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control. Another feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed. Inline Boarding was made an official race class by the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) and Gravity Sports International (GSI) in 2005. The 2005 IGSA World Cup Champion inline boarder is Nihat Uysal of Germany. Nihat rides the Silver GP-X (see below) Models The first board was designated the GP (general purpose) and was available in black, red and blue colour options. Initially it was sold without brakes, which were later made standard as an addition to the existing frame, and utilised a retro fit \\"calf lever\\" operating system. A Limited Edition model was made of the GP, which offered a silver anodized frame, V rim wheels and a signed certificate and number. The next board made available was the GP-X, which came with a silver anodized aluminium frame, blue anodized deep V rims, fully integrated calf brake with moulded plastic lever, increased ground clearance, disc brake caliper lugs on the frame, and disc hub on the rear wheel for easy conversion to disc brake use. Two alternative versions to the GP-X were produced. The first, called the Road Racer, used the same frame as the GP-X in canary yellow powder coat finish, with black V rims and slick tyres. The other was a UK specific beach racer model, with sealed bearing hubs, Black V rims, disc brake as standard, and beach tread tyres. In 2003, Dirtsurfer introduced the Flexideck, a newer concept with an epoxy/fibreglass/maple composite deck connecting the front and rear frame to absorb jumps. Made available in powder coated lime green frame with purple anodized V rims, and disc brake as standard, it offered greatly increased ground clearance and a reinforced frame for jumping. Dirtsurfer has updated their line-up with two new models for 2006: The Flexi Pro Downhill (DH), an updated Flexideck; and the all new Freestyle board (FS), a scaled down Flexideck with 16 inch wheels. Both models feature the new adjustable metal calf brake lever, rear disc brake, and new thermofibre deck. In addition to updating their flexideck boards, dirtsurfer also updated their line of General Purpose models (GP). Both are manufactured from HT steel. The new 16\\" GP comes in white, with the new braking lever and disk brakes. The new GP 20\\" come in black and also has the new braking handle and disk brakes. Movement A unique feature of the Dirtsurfer is that it emulates the feel of carving as on a snowboard. This is achieved by the front wheel being mounted to a single pivoting point, allowing the axle of the wheel to be above the board. Think of the idea as being very similar to riding a bike that does not have handlebars and cannot independently create speed. A Dirtsurfer comes with a leg operated brake, either as a disc or a V-Brake as used on many bicycles. The Dirtsurfer will never experience a speed wobble normally associated with other bikes or board sports. Because all of the weight is below the hub of the wheel and pulls down on the hub as opposed to pushing down actually changes physics. Propulsion The Dirtsurfer can be used as a downhill sport on or off-road, using just the power of gravity. The Dirtsurfer may also be \\"skated\\" in flat areas. \\"Skating\\" the Dirtsurfer means to push yourself forward with one foot while standing on the Dirtsurfer with the other foot the way you would a skateboard. Many Dirtsurfer riders also use a kite, sail or a kitewing, sometimes called wingsurfing to propel the Dirtsurfer in flat areas with adequate wind. Disciplines =Downhill= This discipline is similar to mountain biking, where the Dirtsurfer is ridden off-road down varying grades of tracks, from forest roads to technical singletrack. =Road Riding= Many Dirtsurfer riders enjoy the fluid feel of carving down long asphalt roads, usually found in mountainous areas. High speeds at over 70 mph have been achieved, with riders limited only by turns in the road and their own sanity (and, to a lesser extent, speed limits). Boards are often modified with slick tyres for this purpose. Riders are often found wearing motorcycle leathers and full face helmets to try to prevent road rash in the event of an accident. An international race circuit has been growing since 2001 with major events held annually in Canada, the US, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Austria. =Kiting= Dirtsurfing with a kite or kitewing is called wingsurfing and is performed on flat open spaces such as beaches or fields. Utilizing the wind, riders can achieve incredible air time and perform tricks that would otherwise require a massive ramp. It is even possible to ride uphill with sufficient wind. Unlike powerkiting with a mountain board, the Dirtsurfer is unidirectional; that is, it only goes one direction. However, it is possible, using the power of a kite or kitewing, to tack and gybe, much like a boat or windsurfer to change direction. Unlike a windsurfer however, it is not practical to change sides when coming to the end of a run in one direction. To overcome this, most riders can make the transition from \\"heel-side\\" to \\"toe-side\\". Riding toe-side means that your toes not your heels, point towards the floor as you lean forward into the wind, with your kitewing or kite behind you. This is not as difficult as it sounds. Due to the gyroscopic stability of the Dirtsurfer, speed is limited only by the wind, with recorded speeds well over 40 mph on a flat surface. Equipment *Dirtsurfer *Footstraps: Vital for achieving a strong rider/board interface. *Helmet: An extremely valuable piece of safety equipment. Many riders prefer the safety of a full face Helmet, and others like the comfort of a skate style lid. The choice is personal and often dependent on the rider's preferred riding style. *Pads: Knee and elbow pads are the most widely used. They help to prevent injury in case of a fall. Wrist guards are also recommended. *Footwear: A strong pair of shoes or boots. Skate style shoes are the favourite among dirtsurfer riders as they offer comfort, strength, and padding.

It flows generally eastward and southeastward, through Woodward, Major, Dewey, Blaine, Canadian, Oklahoma, Lincoln, Pottawatomie, Seminole, Hughes, Okfuskee, Okmulgee, and McIntosh counties, through the cities and towns of Woodward, Oklahoma City, and Shawnee. It is dammed near Canton to form Canton Lake in Blaine County, and in Oklahoma City to form Lake Overholser. It flows into the Canadian River in McIntosh County as part of Lake Eufaula, which is formed by a dam on the Canadian River.  Oklahoma River  A portion of the river flowing through Oklahoma City was renamed the Oklahoma River in 2004.Oklahoma River . This portion has several locks that have created a series of small lakes in which rowing, kayaking, and canoeing regattas take place (hosted by the Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation, Chesapeake Boat House,Chesapeake Boat House. and Oklahoma City University). Regatta activities include: 2.5 mile head races, 2000 meter sprints, and 500 meter sprints. It is the only location in the US conducting officially sanctioned night sprints under lights. The Oklahoma River was profiled in The New York Times on April 22, 2008.  Variant names and definitions  The name \\"North Canadian River\\" has sometimes been applied to the Beaver River and one of the Beaver River's headwaters tributaries, Corrumpa Creek, extending the North Canadian River's length into New Mexico and Texas. The U.S. federal government used that definition from 1914 to 1970: A 1914 decision by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) defined the North Canadian River as including both the Beaver River and Corrumpa Creek as part of its course. A 1970 USBGN decision revised the 1914 definition, defining the North Canadian River as beginning at the confluence of the Beaver River and Wolf Creek. The USBGN's Geographic Names Information System lists \\"Beaver Creek,\\" \\"Beaver River,\\" \\"Branche Nord de la Riviere Canadienne,\\" \\"Honih'hiyo'he,\\" \\"North Fork Canadian River,\\" and \\"North Fork of Canadian River\\" as historical variant names for the river.

He was dubbed \\"The Caribbean Gauguin\\" for his use of bold colors and depictions of island life. Botello is considered one of the greatest Latin American post-modern artists and recognition and demand for his artwork continues to grow today, fetching unprecedented auction prices. Ángel Botello never attached to any particular artistic school or movement and was a protean artist: he developed his own artistic style. Botello was a versatile and many-sided artist who worked in all artistic media at his reach: oil paintings, drawing, printmaking, bronze sculptures, wood carving, photography and mosaics.  Life and work  Angel Botello was born in the small town of Cangas do Morrazo in Galicia, in the northwestern region of Spain. Botello was one of six children (four girls and two boys) of Angel Botello y Suárez, a businessman in the fish canning industry and Bonis Barros y del Amo. Botello's father died in 1918 after contracting the Spanish influenza. In the 1920s and, after the bankruptcy of the family business, his mother and siblings moved to Bordeaux, France, and lived there until 1935. While in France, Botello's mother wanted Angel to become a farmer but he wanted to be an architect. In France, architecture is considered a fine art rather than a science and students must take art courses. Botello and his younger brother Manuel studied during four years at the École des Beaux-Arts, from which they graduated with honors and where they excelled in drawing, painting and modeling. In 1935 Botello returned to Spain where he applied and was accepted with a scholarship at the School of Art of the San Fernando Academy in Madrid. The few paintings that remain of the young Botello's work in France and Spain reflect an immediate break from his strictly academic training to the impressionist and post-impressionist concepts and techniques that shaped his development. The Spanish Civil War started in 1936, which made him leave his studies and join the Republican Army as a cartographer. He fought in the Spanish Civil War together with his brother Manuel, who died in the war field. In 1939, the Spanish Civil War ended with a victory for General Francisco Franco which made it impossible to stay in Spain, Botello eventually returned to France to meet with his family who were in a refugee camp. The family decided to leave Europe and move to the Dominican Republic where he was warmly received. The community of Dominican artists included him as one of their own and many of the paintings created at this time were presented at the \\"Latin American Art Exposition\\" at the Riverside Museum in 1940. During that year, the Botello family traveled to Cuba, where they stayed for eight months. Upon their return to Santo Domingo, his paintings were noted by the Peruvian ambassador there who invited Botello to show them in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in 1944. After his arriving to Haiti, Botello met Christiane Auguste, who became his wife and artistic manager. After his marriage, Botello changed his artistic plans to move to Mexico to meet with the greatest Mexican artist Diego Rivera and stayed in Haiti. Botello became increasingly recognized and critically acclaimed. His Haitian landscapes and figure studies are considered to be some of his best works. In Haiti, Botello developed his artistic career of woodworking. For ten years, the Botello family lived in Haiti until 1953 when they moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where they would reside permanently. By this time, he already had gained international recognition in the world of plastic arts. A painting by Botello entitled 'Mother and Child' featured on an episode of Discovery Channel's Auction Kings during the show's second series achieving a price of $17,000. Botello in Puerto Rico After the Botello family left Haiti and arrived in Puerto Rico in 1953, they opened their first art gallery at the Caribe Hilton Hotel. Later, they established a second art gallery in Old San Juan. Botello stated that the light and bright colors of the tropics opened a new world for him and stimulated his creativity. From the 1960s until his death in 1986 his work became more personal, as it was enriched by his new favorite theme: his three children. The deep love that he felt for his children and his family is reflected in his later paintings and sculptures. In 1959, Botello traveled to Ravenna, Italy to learn about the mosaic technique and produced some mosaics but quickly abandoned the technique, convinced that he had mastered it. In the 1960s, Botello became interested in printmaking after an art dealer reproduced some of his paintings using this technique. Botello refused to sign these reproductions because he was not consulted and had not worked personally on the final production of the prints. For that reason, Botello traveled to Paris, France and learned printmaking techniques. He became a master in printmaking and graphic design. Some of his best printmaking works are his linocuts, lithographs and serigraphs. By the beginning of the 1980s, Botello started a double artistic career in painting and sculpture. In 1985, Ángel Botello, who was a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer and knowing that his life was in danger, then accelerated his artistic production pace and never surrendered to his illness. In the last year of his life, at age 73, Botello produced the incredible amount of 22 bronze sculptures in large format. The 33 years that Botello lived in Puerto Rico are considered the most prolific period in his artistic career, in terms of the quality of his paintings and sculptures and the quantity of artwork produced and art media used. This artistic period of Botello in Puerto Rico has a strong figurative and surrealist influence and is the period that brought most recognition to the artist. His works of this period are known in Puerto Rico as the \\"Botellian Style\\", recognized by his caricature figures, especially girls. Ángel Botello died in San Juan, Puerto Rico on November 11, 1986 leaving behind an impressive legacy of oil paintings, lithographs, linocuts, serigraphs and bronze sculptures. His former house located at Old San Juan, Puerto Rico now is an art gallery where his paintings, sculptures and artwork of other outstanding Puerto Rican and international artists are displayed.

Professional wrestling career =Pro Wrestling Federation (1995–1997)= While growing up, Robinson idolized NWA superstar Ric Flair. He also studied NWA referee Tommy Young in order to hone his mannerisms as a referee. His professional wrestling career began when he joined the Pro Wrestling Federation (PWF) as a photographer in 1995. After being used as a special guest referee in 1995, he later became a full-time referee for the PWF. =World Championship Wrestling (1997–2001)= Robinson working for WCW in 1998 Robinson repeatedly petitioned the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) professional wrestling promotion for a job. On September 15, 1997, he was given a tryout match, refereeing a dark match between Chris Adams and Kendall Windham before WCW Monday Nitro at Independence Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina. A few weeks following the match, Robinson was contacted by WCW and signed to a contract. His first appearance was during the WCW TV tapings at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. In 1999, Robinson became the heel referee of the Four Horsemen, aligning himself with Flair. Robinson frequently favored the Horsemen in the matches he officiated, enraging Randy Savage. Savage, who had been suspended by Flair (then the WCW President), proposed a match between his girlfriend, Gorgeous George, and Robinson, with Savage to be reinstated if George defeated Robinson. The match, which marked Robinson's wrestling debut, took place at Slamboree 1999 on May 9, 1999. Robinson, dubbed \\"Little Naitch\\" (a reference to Flair's nickname, the \\"Nature Boy\\"), came to the ring in a robe similar to those worn by Flair, and mimicked Flair's mannerisms, signature strut and \\"wooo\\" catchphrase. Robinson emulated Flair throughout the match, using Flair's customary illegal tactics, but was defeated by George, who pinned him following a diving elbow drop. Robinson wrestled his second match one week later, teaming with Flair to face Randy Savage and Madusa on an episode of WCW Monday Nitro. In the course of the match, Savage delivered a botched diving elbow drop to Robinson, cracking several of his vertebrae and collapsing his lung. After undergoing treatment, Robinson returned to WCW television several weeks later, and was appointed to President Flair's stable. Flair and Piper kayfabe ran WCW until they were unseated by Sting, with Robinson returning to his refereeing duties. Robinson would again turn heel in the Fall of 1999, this time siding with Sid Vicious and Rick Steiner. Robinson would get involved in matches he was refereeing for Vicious and Steiner. This would go on for a month before Robinson would go back to being an unbiased Referee. In 2000, Robinson appeared in the WCW-produced film Ready to Rumble. On March 26, 2001 on Nitro, Robinson refereed the last WCW match ever, where Sting defeated Ric Flair via submission. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (2001–present)= When WCW's properties were purchased by the World Wrestling Federation from AOL Time Warner in March 2001, Robinson was hired by the WWF. He debuted in the WWF as a member of The Alliance, bickering with WWF loyalist referee Jack Doan and accompanying senior WCW official Nick Patrick to ringside for his match at WWF Invasion on July 22, 2001. He refereed his first WWF match on July 2, 2001. Despite being a member of the Alliance, Robinson, unlike fellow Alliance member Nick Patrick, was mostly a fair and impartial referee. An example of this would be the August 20, 2001 episode of Raw when he awarded Tajiri a victory over Booker T by disqualification when Booker T started choking Tajiri with his shirt. The night before at Summerslam, Robinson refereed Booker T's match against the Rock and called the match right down the middle as the Rock won the WCW Championship. In 2002, the WWF was renamed \\"World Wrestling Entertainment\\", and the roster was divided between two \\"brands\\", Raw and SmackDown!. Robinson was initially assigned to Raw, but was later traded to SmackDown!, where he refereed many women's matches. On the July 1, 2004, episode of SmackDown!, Robinson was forced to wrestle Luther Reigns by General Manager Kurt Angle. The match, however, was quickly stopped by Charlie Haas. Robinson in the ring in 2009 At No Mercy 2006, Robinson, who had refereed a match between Mr. Kennedy and The Undertaker, was on the receiving end of a Tombstone Piledriver from the Undertaker after he had called for him to be disqualified after hitting Mr. Kennedy with his WWE United States Championship belt. Robinson also officiated the World Heavyweight Championship matches at WrestleMania 22, WrestleMania 23, as well as Ric Flair's final WWE match and the last part of the World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXIV. Two years later he refereed the main event of WrestleMania XXVI, the retirement match of Shawn Michaels. On the June 20, 2008, episode of SmackDown, Robinson was placed in a match by General Manager Vickie Guerrero after ejecting Chavo Guerrero from ringside during Bam Neely's match with Matt Hardy. He lost to The Great Khali in a squash match. After the match he was carried out by medical officials. He returned in a match between Edge and The Big Show, where he stopped Big Show from giving a con-chair-to to Edge. In November 2008 referees were made no longer exclusive to certain brands. Robinson has worked the final matches of Eddie Guerrero, Edge, & Shawn Michaels, as well as Ric Flair's WWE retirement match at WrestleMania XXIV. He also refereed Triple H's successful victory against Sting at Wrestlemania 31. This was Sting's first match in WWE, and Sting personally chose Robinson as the referee. Robinson also refereed the match between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker at SummerSlam where the match ended in controversy after Undertaker tapped out to Lesnar. Even though Robinson didn't see Undertaker tapping, the timekeeper saw it and rang the bell. Undertaker then hit Lesnar with a low blow and made Lesnar pass out to Hell's Gate. In a post-match backstage interview, Robinson admitted that, after watching the replays, Undertaker did tap out, but he also confirmed that it didn't matter if the timekeeper or the crowd saw it, and that as long as Robinson didn't call for the bell, the match would continue, due to him being the referee and the official. At Payback on May 1, 2016, he refereed the match between Charlotte (with her father Ric Flair) and Natalya (with Bret Hart) for the WWE Women's Championship. During the match, Robinson called for the bell when Charlotte had Natalya in the sharpshooter despite Natalya not submitting. This was similar to the Montreal Screwjob of Survivor Series 1997, when Bret Hart lost the WWF Championship. Robinson was one of the referees assigned to the inaugural WWE Cruiserweight Classic. Since 2002, Robinson has been a part of the WWE production and ring crew, helping assemble and disassemble the ring and set before and after shows. In April 2020, Robinson became SmackDown\`s senior official referee, after SmackDown's senior referee Mike Chioda was released from his WWE contract as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. =Injuries= He once had his elbow knocked out of its socket while refereeing a match in the PWF in Gastonia, North Carolina. Fire Breaker Chip accidentally kicked Charles' elbow during a pin attempt. He was out of action for 4 months. On April 18, 2014, while traveling with the WWE in Saudi Arabia, Robinson suffered a freak accident while helping assemble the wrestling ring, resulting in him nearly losing his thumb. The injury required six stitches. On January 29, 2017 during the Royal Rumble PPV, Robinson was refereeing the WWE Championship Match between John Cena and AJ Styles when he tore the plantar fascia on his left foot seven minutes into the match. He completed the match, but was subsequently out of action for two months, during which he underwent successful surgery. He returned on March 25, 2017 during a WWE SmackDown Live house show in Johnson City. He made his television return on the March 28, 2017 episode of 205 Live. On the July 11, 2017 episode of SmackDown, Robinson's left index finger was mildly fractured by Baron Corbin while he refereed Corbin's match against Shinsuke Nakamura. Video games Robinson's likeness appears as the referee in THQ's WWE 12, WWE 13, and 2K Sports WWE 2K14, WWE 2K15 and WWE 2K16. Personal life On October 11, 2000, Robinson married a woman named Amy, who was diagnosed with melanoma of the lung in January 2001 and died on April 7, 2002. He has a daughter named Jessica from a previous relationship. He is a Christian.

They can be found from tropical lowland forests to montane rainforests. A few species grow as terrestrials or even as lithophytes in open, humid habitats. The genera Bolborchis Lindl., Hologyne Pfitzer and Ptychogyne Pfitzer are generally included here. The genus is abbreviated Coel. in trade journals.  Name  The name Coelogyne was first published as Caelogyne in 1921 by John Lindley.Lindley, J. 1821. Collectanea Botanica, ad pl. 33 and pl. 37 and is derived from the Ancient Greek words κοῖλος (koîlos, hollow) and γῠνή (gunḗ, woman), referring to the concave stigma. A few species are commonly known as \\"necklace orchids\\", because of their long, pendant, multi-flowered inflorescence.  Description  This genus lacks the saccate base of the labellum, a typical characteristic which is present in the other genera in the subtribe Coelogyninae. The free lip has high lateral lobes along the basal part of the labellum (hypochile) and smooth, toothed or warty keels. The pseudobulbs of one internode vary in size. They may be closely or widely spaced through sympodial growth along the rhizome. Inflorescences often show a small to very large number of showy, medium-sized to large flowers. They may arise either from the apex of the newly completed pseudobulb at the end of the growing season (as in Coelogyne fimbriata), or may precede the new growth in early spring (as in Coelogyne cristata). The typical colour range of this genus is white, through tawny brown to green, and occasionally peachy tones. All species have four pollinia. They have often a sweet scent, attracting different kinds of pollinators, such as bees, wasps and beetles.  Distribution  The cooler growing species such as Coelogyne fimbriata, Coelogyne ovalis, Colegyne fuliginosa, Coelogyne cristata, Coelogyne flaccida, Coelogyne nitida originate in the Himalayan region of India and southeast Asia.  Taxonomy  The traditional taxonomy of the genus Coelogyne is still disputed. Coelogyne has been subdivided in 23 sections or subgenera by De Vogel (1994) and Clayton. Molecular data show that Coelogyne is paraphyletic and should be reorganised. It should include the genera Neogyna and Pholidota, and several sections should be removed, including Cyathogyne, Tomentosae, Rigidiformes, Veitchiae and Verrucosae. This new genus Coelogyne should then contain about 160 species.Gravendeel, B. (2000). Reorganising the orchid genus Coelogyne: A phylogenetic classification based on morphology and molecules. Nationaal Herbarium Nederland. The type species is Coelogyne cristata.

Cultivation  The wide distribution of this genus has resulted in a wide variety of temperature requirements from species to species, some requiring cool to cold conditions to grow and bloom reliably, while others need decidedly warmer temperatures to achieve the same. The orchids in this genus require a decided rest period during winter in which they receive no feed, very little water (enough to prevent pseudobulbs shrivelling), cool to cold temperatures and high light. These conditions seem to aid flowering in spring for some growers, though others report that more constant conditions can also produce regular flowering.  Notes   References  * Teuscher, H. 1976.

The river drains Lake Matagami and travels north-west before emptying into Rupert Bay at the south end of James Bay. Its drainage basin is and has a mean discharge of 1190 m³/s (1556 yd³/s). Its source is the head of the Mégiscane River, which is from the mouth.Atlas of Canada Significant lakes along its course are Soscumica Lake () and Dusaux Lake (). The Nottaway, together with the Broadback and Rupert Rivers, was initially considered to be dammed and developed as part of the James Bay Project. But in 1972 hydro-electric development began on the more northerly La Grande and Eastmain Rivers, and the NBR Project was shelved. With the decision to divert the Rupert River to the La Grande, it is not likely that the Nottaway will be developed in the foreseeable future. Geography Nottaway means the lower course of Lake Matagami and a length of , of a watercourse which originates in the Mégiscane Lake. The whole is a long river of units flowing through many lakes. On the way to the northwest, the Nottaway, from Lake Matagami, creates the lakes of Soscumica and Dusaux, collects the waters of several rivers - notably the Kitchigama River and ends its race in Rupert Bay at the southern end of James Bay, at the western area of the Broadback River and Rupert River. Its drainage basin is and has an average discharge of . The course of the river crosses many marsh areas, especially in its lower part. The mouth of Matagami Lake is located: * North of downtown Matagami; * South of the confluence of the Nottaway River and Rupert Bay; * Northwest of the center of the village of Lebel-sur-Quévillon, Quebec. From the mouth of Matagami Lake, the Nottaway River flows on divided into the following segments: Upper part of Nottaway River (segment of ) * to the North, crossing the South part of Soscumica Lake and collecting the waters of the discharge of \\"Lac de la Tourbière\\" (coming from North-East); * to the North, then westward, across Soscumica Lake (altitude: ) to its full length; in this segment, the river collect the water of Natchiowatchouan River (coming from the Southwest); * to the northwest, collecting the discharge (coming from South-West) of lakes Kawawiyekamach et Mistatikamekw, up to \\"Rapides des Taureaux\\" (river bend); * to the North, bypassing Kauskatistin Island and crossing the Longs Rapides, up to \\"Iroquois Falls\\" (located at the entry of Dusaux Lake); Lower part of Nottaway River (segment of ) * to the northwest, crossing the Dusaux Lake (convert200m) on it full length, collecting the Davoust River (coming from North-East), bypassing the Nestipuku Island and Michikushish Island, up to Vandry Island; * to the North-West, at first bypassing Vandry Island, up to Interdite Island; * collecting the water of Richerville River (coming from South-East) and Iroquois River (Nottaway River) (coming from South-East), to a narrowing of the river; * to the North-West, up to Kitchigama River (coming from South East); * to the North-West bypassing two large islands (including D'Herbomez Island), until the widening of the river where are rapids and archipelago; * to the North-West bypassing the Kakupanchish Island, Lavoie Island and Lemoine Island, up to the mouth of the river.Segments of the river measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Ministry of Natural Resources Natural Resources Canada. The confluence of the Nottaway River is located at: * to the Northwest of downtown Matagami; * South of the village of Waskaganish (Cree village municipality); * to the south-east of Charlton Island in James Bay.

Toponymy In the seventeenth century, the Iroquois invaded the Algonquin territory near James Bay along this river. So when European cartographers started to map the river in the late seventeenth century, they called it \\"Rivière des Iroquois\\" (Iroquois River), as shown on maps of Jean-Baptiste- Louis Franquelin in 1699, Guillaume Delisle in 1703, and Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in 1744. Yet various forms of \\"Nottaway\\" started to appear in the early 18th century. \\"Noddaways\\" in 1715, \\"Nodaway\\" in 1743, \\"Nodaoay\\" and \\"Nodway\\" in 1744. Geologists James Richardson and Albert Peter Low used \\"Notaway River\\" in their reports (of 1880 and 1885 respectively). The current spelling \\"Nottaway\\" was established in the early twentieth century. It is believed to have come from the Algonquin word nadowe, meaning \\"snake\\" and which the Algonquin tribes used to identify or describe their enemies, including the Iroquois. The Cree called this river Natuweu Nipi, and the Iroquois name was Nottaweou.

He was famous as the manager of many of the most popular and successful performers of folk and folk-rock music, including Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Peter, Paul and Mary, the Band, Odetta, Gordon Lightfoot and Ian & Sylvia. Early life Albert Grossman was born in Chicago on May 21, 1926, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants who worked as tailors. He attended Lane Technical High School and graduated from Roosevelt University, Chicago, with a degree in economics. Career After finishing college he worked for the Chicago Housing Authority, leaving in the late 1950s to go into the club business. Seeing folk star Bob Gibson perform at the Off Beat Room in 1956 prompted Grossman's idea of a 'listening room' to showcase Gibson and other talent, as the American folk-music revival movement grew. The result was the Gate of Horn in the basement of the Rice Hotel, where Jim (later Roger) McGuinn began his career as a 12-string guitarist. Grossman moved into managing some of the acts who appeared at his club — including an eighteen-year-old Joan Baez, who got her first major break with him — and in 1959 he joined forces with George Wein, who had founded the Newport Jazz Festival, to start up the Newport Folk Festival. At the first Newport Folk Festival, Grossman told The New York Times critic Robert Shelton: \\"The American public is like Sleeping Beauty, waiting to be kissed awake by the prince of folk music.\\" Because Grossman was committed to commercial success for his clients, and was frequently surrounded by socialist enthusiasts of the American folk-music revival, his manner could generate hostility. This hostility is illustrated by this description of Grossman's presence in the Greenwich Village folk scene by Dylan biographer and critic Michael Gray: \\"He was a pudgy man with derisive eyes, with a regular table at Gerde's Folk City from which he surveyed the scene in silence, and many people loathed him. In a milieu of New Left reformers and folkie idealists campaigning for a better world, Albert Grossman was a breadhead, seen to move serenely and with deadly purpose like a barracuda circling shoals of fish.\\" In 1961, Grossman put together Mary Travers, Noel Stookey, and Peter Yarrow as the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary. They quickly achieved success when their eponymous first album entered the Billboard Top Ten in 1962. The group had been avidly pursued by Atlantic Records, who were on the verge of signing them when the deal inexplicably fell through. The group signed with Warner Bros. Records instead and Atlantic's executives later discovered that it was because music publisher Artie Mogull had introduced Grossman to Warner executive Herman Starr, from whom Grossman was able to extract an unprecedented deal that gave the trio complete creative control over the recording and packaging of their music. Over the course of his career, Grossman's client list included Todd Rundgren, Odetta, Peter, Paul and Mary, John Lee Hooker, Ian and Sylvia, Phil Ochs (early in his career), Gordon Lightfoot, Richie Havens, The Pozo Seco Singers, The Band, the Electric Flag, Jesse Winchester, and Janis Joplin. On August 20, 1962, Bob Dylan signed a contract which made Grossman his manager. Grossman also extended hospitality to Dylan at his home in Woodstock in upstate New York. Dylan liked the area so much he purchased a house there in 1965. The cover of Dylan's album Bringing It All Back Home was photographed at Grossman's home in Woodstock. The woman in the cover photo with Dylan, in the red trouser suit, was Grossman's wife, Sally. Having returned to Woodstock at the end of his 1966 World Tour, Dylan was on his way home from Grossman's house in West Saugerties when he suffered the motorcycle accident that precipitated his eight-year withdrawal from touring. When managing both Bob Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary, Grossman brought the trio Dylan's song \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" which they promptly recorded (on a single take) and successfully released. In his autobiography, Chronicles: Volume One, Dylan describes first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: \\"He looked like Sydney Greenstreet from the film The Maltese Falcon, had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, and he sat at his corner table. Usually when he talked, his voice was loud like the booming of war drums. He didn't talk so much as growl.\\" When Bob Dylan was about to perform at the Isle of Wight Festival in August 1969, English critic Michael Gray asked Grossman about the rumor that The Beatles might appear on-stage with Dylan. Grossman replied, sotto voce: \\"Of course the Beatles would like to join Bob Dylan on stage. I should like to fly to the moon.\\" The contracts between Dylan and Grossman were officially dissolved on July 17, 1970, prompted by Dylan's earlier realization that Grossman had taken 50% of his song publishing rights in a hastily-signed contract. When Grossman signed Janis Joplin and her four bandmates from Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1967, he told them he would not tolerate any intravenous drug use, and all five agreed to abide by the rule. When he discovered, in the spring of 1969, that Joplin was injecting drugs anyway, he did not confront her. Instead, in June 1969 he took out a life insurance policy guaranteeing him $200,000 in the event she died in an accident. His yearly premium was $3,500. On October 4, 1970, two-and-a-half months after Grossman was dealt a blow by the dissolution of his contracts with Dylan, his most famous remaining client, Janis Joplin, died suddenly from a heroin overdose. Grossman refused to speak about her death to journalists or colleagues in the music business, leaving his employee Myra Friedman to handle the phone calls that flooded their office. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, Grossman's \\"feelings about the loss of his most valuable client are not known.\\" What is known is that in 1974, by which time his only living clients were the members of The Band, he kept busy with Joplin's legacy. The San Francisco Associated Indemnity Corporation challenged him on his collection of $200,000 from his life insurance policy, which led to a bizarre civil trial in the spring of that year, covered by the New York Post, in which the insurer tried to prove that the singer's death was a suicide, not an accidental overdose as had been determined by Dr. Thomas Noguchi. Grossman testified that he had never known the extent of Joplin's substance abuse when she was alive, and that he secured the accidental death policy \\"with air crashes in mind.\\" He won the case and collected $112,000. In 1974 he also assisted Howard Alk with the creation of the feature-length documentary Janis, locating and using black and white film footage in which the singer says she is satisfied with Grossman as her manager. In 1969, Grossman established the Bearsville Recording Studio near Woodstock, and in 1970 he founded Bearsville Records, which evolved from his brief partnership with the Ampex company to establish a record label of the same name. Although that venture was short-lived - Todd Rundgren's debut solo album Runt was one of its few successful releases - this soon led to the establishment of Grossman's own Bearsville Records label, which was originally distributed through Ampex, and then by Warner Bros. Records. In addition to Rundgren's solo recordings and those of his band Utopia, the label also recorded acts including Jesse Winchester, Foghat, Gil Evans, Paul Butterfield, Sparks, Felix Cavaliere, Randy Vanwarmer, Lazarus, Jesse Frederick, Roger Powell, NRBQ and The dB's. When Michael Friedman joined the Grossman office he brought Todd Rundgren with him and signed Rundgren to a management contract with Grossman. This was soon after leaving his original group Nazz and during the early 1970s he worked extensively on record production projects, either for the Bearsville label or for Grossman's other clients. It was Grossman who recommended Rundgren to Robbie Robertson of The Band as the engineer on an album by Jesse Winchester, which in turn led to Rundgren working on The Band's third LP Stage Fright. Rundgren also worked briefly on the early Pearl sessions with Janis Joplin, but these came to nothing and the project was subsequently taken over by Paul A. Rothchild. Joplin's Rundgren-produced recording of the song One Night Stand from March 28, 1970 stayed in a vault for more than a decade then became part of her posthumous Farewell Song album. The Bearsville label continued into the early 1980s, folding in 1984, two years before Grossman's death. Bearsville Studios became Todd Rundgren's recording base through the late 1970s and 1980s and was used by a slew of top- line American and international acts. =Management style= Grossman had a reputation for aggressiveness in both his method of acquiring clients and the handling their careers. That aggression was based in large measure on Grossman's faith in his own aesthetic judgments. Grossman charged his clients 25 percent commission (industry standards were 15 percent). He is quoted as saying, \\"Every time you talk to me you're ten percent smarter than before. So I just add ten percent on to what all the dummies charge for nothing.\\" In negotiations, one of Grossman's favorite techniques was silence. Musician manager Charlie Rothschild said of Grossman, \\"He would simply stare at you and say nothing. He wouldn't volunteer any information, and that would drive people crazy. They would keep talking to fill the void, and say anything. He had a remarkable gift for tipping the balance of power in his favor.\\" Grossman sometimes appeared treacherously devoted to his clients' satisfaction. While wooing Joan Baez into representation, Grossman is quoted as saying, \\"Look, what do you like? Just tell me what do you like? I can get it for you. I can get anything you want. Who do you want? Just tell me. I'll get you anybody you want.\\" =In film= In the documentary film chronicling Dylan's 1965 tour of the United Kingdom, Dont Look Back, Grossman can be seen constantly protecting his client, sometimes aggressively confronting people he thinks are disrespectful to Dylan. In one memorable scene, he works with musical entrepreneur Tito Burns to extract a good price for Dylan's appearance on BBC One television. The director of Dont Look Back, D. A. Pennebaker, said of Grossman's management tactics, \\"I think Albert was one of the few people that saw Dylan's worth very early on, and played it absolutely without equivocation or any kind of compromise.\\" There are two interesting comments on Grossman in Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home.

You could smell him coming.\\" The other is John Cohen's: \\"I don't think Albert manipulated Bob, because Bob was weirder than Albert.\\" In the 2007 Bob Dylan biopic I'm Not There, Grossman was represented as the fictitious character Norman, played by Mark Camacho. In the film, Norman makes many of the remarks spoken by Grossman in Dont Look Back, at one point saying to an English hotel manager, \\"And you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes and most stupid persons I've ever spoken to in my life\\". He was also briefly portrayed as the manager of the fictional Bob Dylan (Hayden Christensen as Billy Quinn) in the 2006 film Factory Girl. In the 2013 Film Inside Llewyn Davis by the Coen brothers, F. Murray Abraham portrays a fictional character named Bud Grossman, who owns The Gate of Horn folk club in Chicago, the same name as Albert Grossman's Chicago club. In the film, fictional folk singer Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) auditions for Bud Grossman, who replies: \\"I don't see a lot of money here.\\" This comment refers to the experience of Dave Van Ronk, who recounted a similar audition for Grossman, who then asked: \\"Do you know who works here? Big Bill Broonzy works here. Josh White works here... Now tell me why I should hire you?\\" After this comment, Grossman offers Davis a part in a band he is about to put together, consisting of two guys and a girl, which one journalist notes is \\"a reference to Peter, Paul, and Mary, the trio that Albert Grossman put together in 1961—ultimately choosing Noel Paul Stookey as the third member of the group, rather than Van Ronk, whom he also considered.\\" Davis turns down the offer. Personal life Grossman died of a heart attack on January 25, 1986, while flying on the Concorde, aged 59. He was en route to London and was planning to make a trip to Cannes, France to attend a music convention. He is buried behind his own Bearsville Theater near Woodstock, New York.

The river originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northern Georgia. The river flows for U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 27, 2011 into the artificial Hiwassee Reservoir in North Carolina. The Nottely River is dammed in Georgia, creating Lake Nottely. Arkaqua Creek is a tributary. Variant names According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as: *Notley River Early history The region was occupied by Native Americans, associated with modern-day Muskogean tribes, until the early 18th century. The earliest European maps only vaguely show the area to be occupied by a mountain branch of the Apalachee people. However, it is quite likely that groups ancestral to the Creek and/or Yuchi Indians occupied the Nottely River Basin at some time in the past. After the Cherokees occupied the region, most of their villages had names from the Muskogee (Creek) language. However, the region seems to have remained thinly populated due to its proximity to Creek Indian territory. The origin of the word, Nottely, is not known for certain, but appears to be derived from the Hitchiti-Creek word Note-le, which means, \\"People on the Other Side.\\" In 1715 the Cherokees invited leaders of all the major Creek provinces to a diplomatic conference in the nearby town of Tugaloo, at the head of the Savannah River. All of the Creek leaders were murdered in their sleep. This act of treachery precipitated a 40-year-long war between the Creeks and the Cherokees. Initially, all the branches of the Creeks were involved, but only the Kowita branch fought the war continuously. By the 1750s, the Kowita Creeks alone had gained so much military prowess that they were consistently defeating the Cherokees in battle. One Creek war leader bragged that he had sent women and boys into battle, but still captured another Cherokee town. By 1755 the Kowita Creeks had destroyed all of the Cherokee towns and villages in the Nottely and Hiwassee Valleys. The 1755 John Mitchell Map labels the entire region \\"Deserted Cherokee settlement.\\" In 1763 the Cherokees lost all of their territory in North Carolina, east of the 80th longitude line, which runs through Murphy, NC. This was punishment for the Cherokees switching sides in the French and Indian War. The Creeks agreed to give back their recently regained lands in North Carolina and Georgia, in return for most of the land in Alabama, which had been taken from the French by the British. Some small Cherokee settlements such as Choestoe (Rabbit) and Chota (Frog in Creek) returned to the Nottely River Basin. In 1838, the Cherokees were removed from Georgia and were forcibly deported to the Indian Territory (Oklahoma.) A historical marker near the Nottely River describes a massive battle in 1755 on Blood Mountain between the Cherokees and the Creeks, in which the Cherokees won all of northern Georgia. After the Cherokee Trail of Tears, the Nottely Basin slowly filled with settlers, many of whom were from Scotland or Ulster. The region was isolated from the remainder of the State of Georgia until the 1920s, when the first paved highways were constructed. Improved highway access during the early 21st century resulted in a population boom. Many of the new residents migrated from Florida in the aftermath of a series of severe hurricanes on the Gulf Coast. The Nottely River Basin is still farmed intensively. It is known for both sorghum syrup and several varieties of vegetables.

For example, a child below the age of criminal responsibility cannot be held legally responsible for his or her actions, and so cannot be convicted of committing a criminal offence. The age has continually been under debate with adjustments being made in line with rulings, the results of psychological research and to some extent public pressure.

The Nun is formed when the Niger River splits in two, forming the Nun and Forcados rivers. Upon emerging from its parent river, Niger, the Nun River flows for almost south to the Gulf of Guinea at Akassa. Its course runs mainly through thinly settled areas and swamps. In the 19th century, the Nun was a hub for trade between the Igbo Kingdom, which was based at Aboh, and Europe. The river's trading history began with the trade of slaves but was later replaced by palm oil export. At the turn of the century, however, the river mouth silted heavily, blocking the passage. Subsequently, traders began using the more accessible waters of the Forcados River. The Nun River is immortalised in the poetry of Gabriel Okara.

Along the margins of the river is gallery forest which floods periodically. The dry season here lasts from about November until April, with the hot dry Harmattan wind blowing from the north. At this time of the year the river's flow is minimal. Both the Oti and the Koumongou have floodplains, some wide respectively. These flood extensively during the wet season, but during the dry season they become dry, dusty plains, with the occasional pond or lake in a depression.

The length of the edit sequence provides a measure of the distance between the two strings.

The year and a day rule was an ancient rule of the common law which created a conclusive presumption that a death was not murder (or any other form of homicide) if it occurred more than a year and a day since the act (or omission) that was alleged to have been its cause. The precise scope of the rule was unclear. As Lord Dormand said on second reading in the House of Lords, \\"it certainly applies to murder, manslaughter, infanticide and aiding and abetting suicide. It may also apply to motoring offences in which death is an element: causing death by dangerous driving; causing death by reckless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs; and aggravated vehicle taking causing death.\\" The Act has only three sections. Section 1 simply says: :The rule known as the \\"year and a day rule\\" (that is, the rule that, for the purposes of offences involving death and of suicide, an act or omission is conclusively presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day elapsed before he died) is abolished for all purposes. The remaining two sections provide that a prosecution where a death occurs more than three years after an injury, or where the accused was previously convicted of an offence committed in circumstances connected with the death (for example, a previous conviction for grievous bodily harm), can be instituted only with the consent of the Attorney General. The Act started as a private member's bill introduced by Doug Hoyle MP, who came 16th in the ballot in the 1995/6 Parliamentary session. The Act received Royal Assent on 17 June 1996, and the abolition of the year and a day rule came into effect for acts (or omissions) leading to death on that day.

Situated in the western part of Arad County, 50 km from the county capital, at the western border of Romania, Nădlac is the main entrance gate from Western Europe. Nădlac was first mentioned in documents in 1313 when it was known as Noglog. The town's name in Hungarian language means \\"big place\\". The Romanian and Slovak names derive from that. Population According to the 2011 census, Nădlac had 7,185 inhabitants. The ethnic breakdown was as follows: * Romanians: 47.26% * Slovaks: 43.85% * Romani: 5.1% * Hungarians: 2.37% * others: 1.75% History Archaeological excavations have brought to the surface traces of existence of the Dacian-Romans. Throughout times Nădlac, a castle with wooden and soil fortification, was invaded by the Tartars, was held by János Hunyadi, and was donated to the commanding officers Gyorgy Istvan and Dmitar Jakšić who laid the foundation of a new fortification. It was also ravaged several times by the Turks, and was razed to the ground by the rebels led by György Dózsa. It was, however, rebuilt every time. In 1685 the town was conquered by the Austrian royal army and was integrated in the border disposition of the Mureș valley. One of the most important moments in the history of Nădlac took place in the early 19th century, when the colonization process of the Slovaks started.

She was originally named Keangsoo (), and was a wooden dispatch vessel built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was constructed in 1862 by Whites at Cowes, she formed part of the Lay-Osborn Flotilla during the Taiping Rebellion. Design Keangsoo was the largest of the vessels which made up the Lay-Osborn Flotilla. She was long overall, had a beam of and an average draft of . She displaced . The propulsion system consisted of a oscillating cylinder steam engine, built by Day & Co. of Southampton, equipped with four boilers; however during trials she was demonstrated at producing up to . Her engines produced an average cruising speed of , while on two boilers she could operate at an average speed of . The main armament on the vessel were two mounted smoothbore muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns. Her secondary armament consisted of four 18-pounder long guns. Construction and career =Lay-Osborn Flotilla= Keangsoo was a wooden dispatch vessel, laid down at Whites' shipyard at Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1862 and launched on March 5, 1863. Whites had become well known for winning contracts with the Ottoman Navy during the 1850s. She was the flagship of the Lay-Osborn Flotilla, the name given to a grouping of vessels which had been arranged to be sent to China by Horatio Nelson Lay, then the Inspector General of Customs for Imperial China, to help suppress the ongoing Taiping Rebellion. Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty gave permission for Lay to proceed with this task, and provided the funds to procure the ships. While some, such as HMS Africa (subsequently renamed China) were purchased from the Royal Navy, Keangsoo was one of three dispatch vessels alongside Tientsin and Kwangtung which were procured as new builds. Permission was given by the British Government to enlist British sailors for the Chinese flotilla, and Captain Sherard Osborn was co-opted to command the fleet, with the ship under the direct command of Charles Stuart Forbes. Keangsoo underwent trials in May 1863 while underway to China. There was a problem in the command structure for the fleet, since the Chinese Government expected to receive the vessels directly under their own command, and had already assigned new commanding officers and names for the ships. However, Lay and Osborn agreed that Osborn would only accept orders from Lay, and he in turn would only pass orders on from the Chinese Government if he agreed with them on an individual basis. The ships reached Shanghai in September, where it was renamed Chen Wu () by the Chinese government. The Chinese refused to provide stores or funds since Osborn would not accept a new Chinese commander. When the authorities attempted to bribe the enlisted men from the fleet to join them, Osborn sent it to Chefoo (now Yantai). Following the intervention of a British minister, the fleet was ordered to depart for India with Osborn taking Keangsoo, Kwangtung, Amoy and the yacht Thule to Bombay (now Mumbai). The Keangsoo was then laid up alongside the other remaining vessels of the flotilla, since their sales were embargoed until the end of the American Civil War. She was then acquired by her Captain Forbes once again, following the end of the conflict in 1865. =Boshin War= While at Nagasaki, Keangsoo was purchased by Matsukata Masayoshi, a leading Satsuma samurai, on November 3, 1867, for the amount of 160,000 ryō (approx $250,000 at then current exchange rates), whence she was renamed Kasuga Maru. With a speed of , and six cannons, she was faster than anything in the Tokugawa shogunate Navy, and Matsukata intended to convert her into a warship. However, already alarmed by the high cost, as the price was four times the budget Matsukata had been authorized, he was overruled by the Shimazu clan elders. She was assigned to be used as a cargo ship. In disgust, Matsukata gave up command of the ship he had bought, only to see it converted into a warship just a few months later under the command of his assistant, Akatsuka Genroku. Kasuga Maru entered Hyōgo harbour in January 1868, where she was blockaded by three ships of the Tokugawa Navy: , and . Tōgō Heihachirō, future Admiral of the Fleet, joined the ship on January 3 as a third-class officer and a gunner. The night of January 3, Kasuga Maru escaped from Hyōgo harbour with two other ships. She was spotted by Kaiyō Maru, which chased her into Awa Strait. The two ships exchanged fire at a distance of 1,200-2,500 meters, without any actual hits. The exchange was named the Naval Battle of Awa and was the first naval battle in Japan between two modern fleets. Kasuga Maru returned to Kagoshima after that exchange. In March 1869, Kasuga Maru participated in the expedition against the last remnants of the pro-Tokugawa forces in Hokkaido, where they had formed the Republic of Ezo with the support of a few French military advisors such as Jules Brunet. While at Miyako Bay, the expedition suffered a surprise attack by the Bakufu ship . Kaiten attacked the state-of-the art ironclad ship , but she was repulsed by Gatling guns on board the Kōtetsu and cannon response by Kasuga Maru. The encounter has been named the Naval Battle of Miyako Bay. After these events Kasuga Maru participated in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, until the surrender of the last forces of the Republic of Ezo. Kaiyo Maru of the Tokugawa Shogunate Navy (background), during the Naval Battle of Awa. =Imperial Japanese Navy= In April 1870, Kasuga Maru was transferred from the Satsuma Domain to the Meiji government and assigned to the newly formed Imperial Japanese Navy, and was renamed Kasuga at that time. In 1872, under the command of Itō Toshiyoshi, she carried Japanese envoys to Korea as part of Japan's ongoing attempts to obtain diplomatic recognition from Joseon dynasty Korea. The failure of this mission was one of the underlying factors in the subsequent Ganghwa Island incident of 1875, during which Kasuga was assigned to blockade the port of Busan. Under the command of Inoue Yoshika, Kasuga was also one of the ships which participated in the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. Kasuga was demobilized in 1894 and then assigned to the mine-laying group at the Takeshiki Guard District on Tsushima Island. She was sold for scrap in 1902. Notes References * *Haraguchi, Izumi.

It rises in the Atakora Mountains, and is about long. It flows past the towns of Carnotville and Ouémé to a large delta on the Gulf of Guinea near the seaport city of Cotonou. The largest tributaries are the Okpara River and the Alpouro River. Ouémé River is the largest River of Benin Republic. It is located between 6° 30° and 10° north latitude and 0° 52 'and 3° 05' east longitude(Oba S. Alain 2018). It crosses several agro-ecological zones and feeds downstream, the lagoon system ‘'Lake Nokoué-lagoon of Porto-Novo'’ through a Delta zone. The lower Delta of Ouémé, is located between latitude 6° 33'N and 8° 15 'and the meridians 1° 50' and 2° 00 ' (Zinsou et al., 2016). The lower Delta of Ouémé begins after municipality of Adjohoun in the department of Ouémé and ends at the south facade where the river flows into the lagoon complex ‘'Nokoué-Porto-Novo'’ (Lalèyè et al., 2004). The subequatorial climate type, characterized by two rainy seasons and two dry seasons. On the other hand, its hydrological regime depends on the Sudanian climate (north-Benin) with a low water period usually lasts seven months (November to June) and a flood period (July to October) (Lalèyè, 1995). The plant formations along the area are characterized by swamps inhabited by floating plants dominated by water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes), water lily (Nymphaea lotus), water lettuce (Pistoia stratiotes) and lemna (Lemna pairciostata). There are also undeveloped marshy forests, dominated by the Raphia palm (Raphia hookeri) and the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The part of the valley covered by the water is very productive in fish (Zinsou et al., 2016).

It is based on the game of five-card cribbage, also known as the \\"old game\\", and is one of many solitaire card games based on those played by at least two players, best known of which is poker solitaire.  Rules  First, twelve cards are dealt into two hands as if there are two players. The player looks at the first hand and discards two cards to contribute to an area known as the \\"crib\\". The player then looks at the second hand and contributes two more cards from that hand to the crib. A thirteenth card, the \\"starter\\", is then dealt. The starter combines with the crib and the two hands to each form a five-card cribbage hand, much the same way as the community cards in Texas hold 'em poker. Points are scored according to how the hand/crib is combined with the starter. Hands are scored like in actual cribbage and the combinations below may occur more than once in just one hand: * Fifteens - Given that face cards are valued at ten and aces at one, a combination of two or more cards that add up to fifteen are scored two points each \\"fifteen\\". * Pairs - Each pair in a hand is scored two points each pair. A \\"pair royal\\", or three of a kind, scores six points since three cards of the same rank can form three pairs, while a \\"double pair royal\\", or four of a kind, scores twelve points since four cards of the same rank can form six pairs. * Runs - Three or more consecutive cards (regardless of suit) is scored three to five points depending on the number of cards on that run. * Flush - If the four cards on the hand is of the same suit, it is scored four points, plus an additional point if the starter is of the very same suit as those in the hand. A flush on the crib (four cards of the same suit) only scores however if the starter is of the same suit as the four cards in the crib. If so, it is scored five points; otherwise, only the other combinations formed in the crib are tallied. * His nobs - A jack in \\"his nobs\\", i.e. one that has the same suit as the starter, scores a point. * His heels - A jack in \\"his heels\\", i.e. one that is the starter gives two points to the entire tally for the deal. Points are added from the two hands and from the crib and given a running total. This makes a set or deal. The cards used are then discarded and a new set of 13 cards are dealt. Since each deal uses a fourth of the entire deck, a game of cribbage solitaire is composed of four such deals. The points from the four deals are added up into a final total for the entire game. The winning final score can range from 101 to 121 (the points needed to win a game of regular cribbage) according to the player's preference.  Variants  The rules stated above are those written by Peter Arnold in his book Card Games for One.Card Games for One by Peter Arnold. () The version of Cribbage Solitaire described in Hoyle's Rules of Games is played differently.\\"Cribbage Solitaire\\" (p.209) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. In this version, instead of 13 cards only nine cards are dealt: the six cards in the hand, the first two cards of the crib, and the starter. The player contributes to the crib another two cards from his hand. Points are then scored similar to what is described above. The starter is then placed at the bottom of the deck, so that a total of six hands with cribs and starters are played, followed by one hand without a crib or a starter. An average expected score is about 85, and some sources consider anything above 80 to be a win, while others suggest a score of at least 120 is a win.\\"Cribbage Solitaire\\" (p.29-30) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002.

Józef Piłsudski founded the group in August 1914; it adopted the name POW in November 1914. It aimed to gather intelligence and to sabotage the enemies of the Polish people. Piłsudski used the POW to act independently from his cautious Austro-Hungarian supporters, and it became an important, if somewhat lesser known, counterpart to the Polish Legions. Its targets included the Russian Empire in the early phase of the war, and the German Empire later. Its membership rose from a few hundred in 1914 to over 30,000 in 1918. History =Intelligence and training= The Polish Military Organization (PMO) can be traced to formations of August 1914 or even earlier, but it was officially founded in November 1914, as a merger of two previously-existing youth para-military organisations: the Drużyny Strzeleckie and the Związek Strzelecki. Active in the Russian-held Kingdom of Poland, the PMO served as the intelligence and sabotage arm of Piłsudski's Polish Legions. In fact, many members of the illegal and secret PMO were at the same time soldiers of the Austrian-backed Polish Legions. The PMO was commanded militarily by Piłsudski himself, while the political command was a secret \\"A\\" Convent headed by Jędrzej Moraczewski. Initially active only in Central Poland, with time the PMO units were formed in all parts of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including modern day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. It was mainly preoccupied with intelligence and sabotage, as well as military training of its members and acquisition of arms from various armies fighting on Polish soil. The PMO members were seen as the core of the future Polish Army after Poland regained her independence. After most of Poland was occupied by the Central Powers in 1915, the PMO became semi-legal and unofficially supported by the German army, which saw it as a useful source of information on Russia and a useful reservoir of skilled officers. However, in July 1917, after the Oath Crisis in the Polish Legions and the arrest of Piłsudski, the PMO returned to the underground and started covert operations against German and Austrian garrisons and supply lines. In place of Piłsudski, who was sent to a German prison in the fortress in Magdeburg, the commander of the PMO became his friend, Edward Rydz-Śmigły, also future Marshal of Poland. =Sabotage and open fight= With the collapse of the Central Powers during the final stages of the Great War, the PMO command decided to take an active part in the war and the organisation went out in the open. In October and November 1918 the revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hungary made the Ober Ost army collapse. The German units were struck by mass desertions of soldiers who simply left their posts and headed for their homes. The main tasks of the PMO during this period was to disarm the withdrawing soldiers and escort them to Germany. The campaign was successful and gave the new-born Polish state a large quantity of arms and military equipment. By mid-November, most of garrisons in Galicia surrendered to PMO members and the region became controlled by Poland. The PMO members continued the disarming actions in the former Congress Kingdom as well. Finally, the PMO was the core of Polish defences of the city of Lwów in the Battle of Lwów against the attacking forces of the West Ukrainian People's Republic (roughly 400 members in the initial phase of the struggle). In December 1918, the members of the PMO were all conscripted into the newly-reborn Polish Army. =Later struggles= Contrary to the rest of units, the PMO in the Ukraine (most notably the areas controlled by both the Western Ukrainian government and the areas controlled by the Kiev-based Directorate and Hetmanate) remained active after the Polish withdrawal from Kiev in July 1920. In February 1918, a similar organisation was formed in the German-held Greater Poland. It was modelled after the original PMO and maintained contacts with her predecessor. It assumed the name of Polish Military Organisation of the Prussian Partition and its main aim was to liberate the region and attach it to Poland. The members of the PMO became the core of the Greater Polish Army during the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918-1919. After the uprising succeeded, the PMO members were also drafted into the Polish Army, together with other military units fighting in the Uprising. In February 1919 the Polish Military Organization of Upper Silesia was also formed. It had similar tasks to its Greater Polish counterpart and became the core of the Silesian Uprisings of 1919-1921. Afterwards the members of the PMO members were either demobilised or integrated into the Polish Army or the Polish Intelligence Services. =In Lithuania= In Lithuania, the PMO was organizing a secret plot to overthrow the legal government of Lithuania and replace it with one more friendly towards Poland. The coup was planned for August 1919, but it was uncovered by the Lithuanian State Security Department, and mass arrests followed, thus eliminating the possibility of a coup d'état. From the documents stolen in POW headquoters safe in Vilnius and given to Prime Minister of Lithuania Augustinas Voldemaras it is clear, that this plot was directed by Józef Piłsudski himself. A PMO-led uprising did occur in the Sejny region, at the time controlled by Lithuanian forces, and led to Polish forces gaining control of that disputed territory. =Influence in the Soviet Union= Although the PMO was disbanded in 1921, Soviet authorities claimed that it continued to exist; during the Great Purge of 1936-38,Wojciech Materski, Katyn: A Crime Without Punishment (Yale University Press, 2007: ), p. 417. and as early as 1933,Terry Martin, The Affirmative Action Empire: Nations and Nationalism in the Soviet Union, 1923-1939 (Cornell University Press, 2001: ), p. 328. many people of Polish nationality were charged with membership in it, which was illegal, see Polish Operation of the NKVD for the circumstances, and NKVD Order No. 00485 in particular.

It is used both as a tool and a weapon. Tamils reserve the weapon as a symbol of karupannar. In popular culture, it is sometimes associated with gangsters. In movies, it is used as a weapon of choice. In Kerala, its primary use is for agriculture, mainly in coconut cutting, clearing pathways, cutting wood and other uses. Introduction An aruval usually measures 3–6 feet in length (hand sickle measures 1.5 feet). The blade of this weapon originates at the grip and extends to the main part of the lade. It can be described as a sickle with an extension. It can also be thought of as a sword with a reverse curve. The shorter versions were handy for breaking apart coconuts, and the longer versions were more like battle weapons. The shorter version is usually seen in small villages. Blades are mostly straight with a curve towards the end, allowing it to function as a grabbing tool. The straight portion of the blade is also used for cutting, like a standard knife. Variants and usage While farmers typically employ the standard billhook machete kathir aruvāl koyttharivaal for harvesting crops, a longer variation called the veecharuvāl is used for clearing through wooded areas. In Kerala, Malayalam language references the semi-circular knife for paddy, called \\"koduval\\" and the regular sized billhook machete is known as \\"vaakathi\\" (coconut cutting); while the veecharuval is known simply as aruval. The veecharuval was also used as a weapon and is still used as such for self-defence in rural areas or gang warfare in cities. When not in use, the weaponised aruval was worn on the back, with the blade pointing downwards and the handle just behind the user's head. Some aruvals, such as those used in worship of the Khaval Dheivam, are as long as 3.5 feet. { Veecharuval Kathir aruval } References Almost all action movies in tamil nadu See also *Khaval Dheivam * Madurai Veeran * Ayyanar *Karuppu Samy * Machete * Billhook *Urumi *Chakram *International Silambam Committee Category:Blade weapons Category:Weapons of India Category:Indian melee weapons ","title":"Aruval"},{"id":"1899880","text":"The Rivière aux Outardes or Outardes River is a river in Quebec, Canada. The river originates in the Otish Mountains, and flows in a southerly direction for its entire course. It passes through Lake Plétipi and Burnt Islands Lake (Îles Brûlées), and widens about midway to form the large Outardes 4 Reservoir. It drains into Outardes Bay of the Saint Lawrence River, about southwest of Baie-Comeau. At its mouth, the Outardes River widens and flows over a sandbar, making it extremely shallow. There are several islands in Outardes Bay of which the most notable are White Island (île Blanche), a rock of white granite high, and Mine Island (île de la Mine), a bare red rock reaching high. The river was first called Cane or Caen River by Jean Alfonse in 1544. The name riviere aux Outardes came in use following its appearance on maps by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in 1744 and 1764. English maps from the end of the 18th century and early 19th century would show \\"Bustard River\\", as a translation of the archaic French word bistarde or oustarde.

Course The Oyapock runs through the Guianan moist forests ecoregion. It rises in the Tumuk Humak () mountain range and flows into the Atlantic Ocean, where its estuary forms a large bay bordering on Cape Orange. The mouth of the Oyapock is the northern end of Brazil's coastline, as it is where the border between Brazil and French Guiana meets the ocean, but nearby Cape Orange, which separates the Bay of Oyapock from the Atlantic Ocean, is the northernmost point of the Brazilian coast. In Brazil, both the cape and the mouth of the Oyapock are often mistaken for the whole country's northernmost point (rather than just of its coastline), and in the past this information could even be found in geography schoolbooks. Yet the true northernmost point in Brazil is actually far inland, on Monte Caburaí, in the state of Roraima, hundreds of kilometers from the Oyapock and almost a full degree more to the north. History Vicente Yáñez Pinzón was said to be the first European person to see the Oiapoque River in the first years of the 16th century. It has been rendered Japoc, Yapoc, Iapoco, Wiapoco, and even called the Vicente Pinzón River. Early European colonists referred to the river as the Wiapoco, and it was the site of early settlements by Briton Robert Harcourt in 1608 and Dutchman Jan van Ryen in 1627. The name Oiapoque has been officially used from 1900, when a territorial dispute between Brazil and France was resolved through Swiss diplomatic arbitration. Settlements In addition to the small towns of Oiapoque (Brazil) and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock (French Guiana), there are some small villages scattered along the bank of the Oyapock, such as Camopi and Clevelândia do Norte. Bridge The Oyapock River Bridge has been built across the river to connect the Brazilian town of Oiapoque and the French town of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock. It is the first international land border connection of French Guiana, but although completed since 2011, as of February 2017 it remains closed to traffic, due to delays in making the final payments to the construction company, building and staffing the Brazilian customs facilities, and some minor disagreements between the Brazilian and French governments.The inauguration ceremony of the bridge finally took place on 18 March 2017. Starting from 08:00 on 20 March 2017, the bridge has been open to members of the public. In popular culture The widespread Brazilian Portuguese expression \\"do Oiapoque ao Chuí\\" (\\"from the Oyapock to the Chuí [rivers]\\") is used to refer to the whole nation, by mentioning the waterways that mark respectively the northern and southern extremities of the Brazilian coastline (as noted above, they are often mistaken for the entire country's northern and southern extreme points).

Life and career Offord studied physics at university, and landed a job as a trainee engineer at Advision Studios in London to fill in spare time. Not long into his time at the studio, he started work as an engineer. Offord would spend much of his career working at Advision Studios. ELP wrote a tribute to Offord with the song \\"Are You Ready, Eddy?\\", featured on their 1971 album Tarkus. In 1970, Offord began his partnership with Yes. He suggested that the band record Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) in the countryside to try and ease tensions that had grown within the group, but the compromise was to record at Morgan Studios with trees, plants, and model cows. In the late 1970s, Offord relocated to the United States where he worked in Woodstock, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. In 1994, after working on Grassroots by 311, Offord announced his retirement from the music business.

He was part of the British small press comics scene in the 1980s. Career After contributing spot illustrations to comic fanzines such as Bemusing and The Panelologist in the mid 70's, Elliott decided to try his hand at publishing his own fanzine and, with the help of Ian Wieczorek and Paul Chester released Blitzine, followed by Delapsus Resurgam. In 1977 Elliott, with co-editors John Matthews (a fellow comic artist) and Ian Wieczorek, published the comic fanzine, Elipse. Elipse ran for three issues and printed early strips by Kev F Sutherland, Mike Matthews, and Dave Hine as well as Elliott himself. Elipse was a unique fanzine at the time, featuring solely comic strips. In the early 1980s Elliott became re-acquainted with an old comic collecting friend, Paul Gravett, who was working on Pssst! magazine. Unable to get his work published in Pssst!, Elliott decided to return to self- publishing and, with Ian Wieczorek again, released the Fast Fiction comic, which took its name from the Fast Fiction comics distribution service. One of the artists Phil chose to publish in Fast Fiction was Eddie Campbell. Elliott collaborated with Campbell between 1984 and 1986 on various comic strips that ran in the music paper Sounds and drew the first issue of Campbell's Lucifer. Elliott was also responsible for colouring many of the covers of Campbell's comics for Harrier Comics. Elliott also formed a strong creative partnership with Glenn Dakin, which resulted in comics such as Greenhouse Warriors, Mr Night and The Man from Cancer. Elliott was a regular contributor to the influential UK comic magazine Escape, and in 1985 Escape published his Doc Chaos comic. Doc Chaos was written by Dave Thorpe and Lawrence Gray. In 1985 Elliott began drawing The Suttons for his local newspaper, The Maidstone Star. This comic strip ran for three years. After handing over the editorship of Fast Fiction to Ed Pinsent, Elliott began editing !GAG! for Harrier Comics. Harrier Comics also published Elliott and Paul Duncan's four-issue Second City comic as well as two collections of Elliott's A Tale from Gimbley stories, Some Tales From Gimbley and More Tales From Gimbley. Elliott has worked in some capacity for most of the major comic publishers in the US and UK. His comic Blite was published by Fantagraphics. He was an artist on The Real Ghostbusters comic for Marvel UK and was the colourist on the first seven issues of Paul Grist's superhero comic book, Jack Staff. Other work has appeared in Punch, Knockabout, Fox Comics and Power Rangers. Elliott has recently coloured Paul Grist's series Demon Nic which was published in the Judge Dredd Megazine. He has also coloured various Doctor Who comics for IDW Publishing. =Recent work= Elliott's most recent work is a quirky under-18 thriller entitled Contraband written by Thomas John Behe. Released in February 2008, Contraband was a unique illustrated book revealing how privacy-invading camera phone use fuels the multibillion-dollar spy-cam industry. Other recent comic work includes TUPELO , Absent Friends and Rockpool Files for Slave Labor Graphics and Illegal Alien for Dark Horse Comics. A 184-page collection of Elliott's Tales From Gimbley, titled In His Cups - collected Tales From Gimbley was published in August 2014. Influences Elliott's early influences were mainly US comic book artists, including Bernie Wrightson, Barry Smith and Jeff Jones. Elliott was later influenced by the European ligne claire, or Clear Line, artists such as Hergé and Joost Swarte. Eddie Campbell, along with Glenn Dakin and Ed Pinsent have also had a major influence on Elliott's work and outlook.

At 459 km in length, it is the longest river on the Malay Peninsula. The river begins at the confluence of Jelai and Tembeling rivers on the Titiwangsa Mountains and drains into the South China Sea.  River course  From the upper slopes of Titiwangsa Mountains at Cameron Highlands, Jelai river flows in a southeasterly direction, passing through Padang Tengku and Kuala Lipis before merging with Tembeling river. Tembeling River which begins at Pahang and Terengganu state border at Ulu Tembeling, flows in a southwesterly direction passing through Kuala Tahan. Pahang River flows in a southerly direction passing through Jerantut Feri, Kuala Krau, Kerdau and Temerloh. At Mengkarak, the river turns to the northeast, passing through Chenor and then turning east at Lubuk Paku and Lepar into the floodplain of Paloh Hinai, Pekan and Kuala Pahang before draining into the South China Sea. From the source to the mouth, Pahang River basin comprises almost all the districts in Pahang, including Cameron Highlands, Lipis, Jerantut, Temerloh, Bera, Maran and Pekan. Lipis River, a tributary of Jelai River, begins at Pahang and Perak state border in Ulu Sungai, Raub district and ends at the confluence of Jelai River and Lipis River at Kuala Lipis. Semantan River, a tributary of Pahang River begins in Bentong district and ends at the confluence of Pahang River and Semantan River at Kuala Semantan. Triang River and Bera River, tributaries of Pahang River begin at Jelebu and Jempol district of Negeri Sembilan state while Lepar River, another tributary of Pahang River, passing through Kuantan district in the east before ending at the confluence of Pahang River and Lepar River at Paloh Hinai. The only district in Pahang that does not have a tributary of the Pahang River or have Pahang River flowing through it is Rompin.  History  The banks of Pahang River were settled as early as 1400 by warriors and seafarers from around Maritime Southeast Asia including places such as Aceh, Riau, Palembang and Sulawesi. The earliest historical records of Pahang River, the riverine inhabitants or the people of Pahang were found in the Malay Annals and Hikayat Munshi Abdullah. = Early transportation role = The Pahang and Muar Rivers were nearly connected at a place called Jempol, in Negeri Sembilan as the Serting River flows into the Bera River, a tributary of the Pahang River. Jempol River flows into Muar River. Trading boats from the Muar could continue their journey until they reached Kuala Pahang in Pekan, or Kuala Lipis to continue into Terengganu, Kelantan or Perak.  Natural history  During the Pleistocene epoch or Mesolithic period about 10,000 years ago, there was a 5 degrees Celsius drop in the global temperature. At mountaintops, snow accumulated as ice caps and glaciers (including Mount Kinabalu), thus disrupting the global hydrological cycle. Due to lack of water discharge into the sea, the sea level was 120 meters lower than it is today. The South China Sea dried up, exposing the Sunda Shelf and previous deep trenches became huge ancient rivers called the North Sunda River. Mainland Asia, the Malay Peninsular, Sumatra and Java became connected to Borneo via the landbridge of exposed Sunda Shelf. The North Sunda River provided vital connection to Mekong River in Vietnam and Chao Phraya River in Thailand to the north, Baram and Rajang rivers in Sarawak to the east and Pahang River and Rompin River to the west of the massive land mass. Freshwater catfishes from those rivers migrated and mated to exchange their genetic materials about 10,000 years ago. Thus, after the Holocene, when the temperature increased, a substantial amount of the ice that had accumulated melted, increasing sea levels, inundating the landbridges and Sunda River, thus isolating the catfish populations. However, their genetic motives are still in the DNA as an evidence of the previous connections of Pahang River to other isolated rivers in Indochina and Borneo.  Towns and Bridges  Jerantut is 15 km from the confluence of Jelai river and Tembeling River. Temerloh is situated on the confluence between Semantan River and Pahang River. The town of Pekan, which is Pahang's royal town, is situated on the southern bank of the river, near the river mouth. There are 7 bridges were built across the river.

In the ancient Indian texts, dharma-yuddha refers to a war that is fought while following several rules that make the war fair. For instance, in a righteous war, equals fight equals. Chariot warriors are not supposed to attack cavalry and infantry, those on elephants are not supposed to attack infantry, and so on. The rules also forbid the usage of celestial weapons (divine weapons bestowed by the gods) on ordinary soldiers (as opposed to soldiers of noble birth). The build-up of weapons and armies is done with the full knowledge of the opposing side and no surprise attacks are made. The rules of engagement also set out how warriors were to deal with noncombatants. No one should attack an enemy who has temporarily lost or dropped their weapon. The lives of women, prisoners of war, and farmers were also sacred. Pillaging the land was forbidden. Dharma- yuddha also signifies that the war is not fought for gain or selfish reasons. A dharma-yuddha is waged to uphold the principles of righteousness.  In the Mahabharata  In the Mahabharata epic, which describes the Kurukshetra war, the two sides agree on the following rules: * Fighting must begin no earlier than sunrise and, should end by exact sunset. (Broken on the 14th day, after Jayadratha was slain). * Multiple warriors must not attack a single warrior. (Broken several times, most notably in the 13th day, when Abhimanyu was slain). * Two warriors may duel, or engage in prolonged personal combat, only if they carry the same weapons and they are on the same mount (no mount, a horse, an elephant, or a chariot). (Broken several times). * No warrior may kill or injure a warrior who has surrendered. (Violated when Satyaki slew an unarmed Burishravas). * One who surrenders becomes a prisoner of war and will then be subject to the protections of a prisoner of war. * No warrior may kill or injure an unarmed warrior. (Broken when Arjuna slew Karna when the latter was unarmed trying to take out his chariot wheel from mud ). * No warrior may kill or injure an unconscious warrior. (Broken when Abhimanyu was slain). * No warrior may kill or injure a person or animal not taking part in the war. (Broken several times when warriors slew horses and charioteers of their enemies). * No warrior may kill or injure a warrior whose back is turned away. (Shakuni and Arjuna broke that rule). * No warrior may strike an animal not considered a direct threat. (Broken when Bhima killed an elephant named Ashwathama). * The rules specific to each weapon must be followed. For example, it is prohibited to strike below the waist in mace warfare (Broken in the final combat of Bhima and Duryodhana on night of final day of war). * Warriors must not engage in any 'unfair' warfare whatsoever. * The lives of women, prisoners of war, and farmers are sacred. * Land should not be pillaged.

It is in the Central Luzon region and traverses the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, and Nueva Ecija. Topography Its headwaters are at the Sierra Madre and runs a south and southwesterly course for about until it drains into Manila Bay. The river's basin covers an area of , including the allied basin of Guagua River. The basin is drained through the Pampanga River and via the Labangan Channel into the Manila Bay. Great Pampanga River (view from San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija bridge) Its main tributaries are Peñaranda and the Coronel-Santor rivers on the eastern side of the basin and the Rio Chico River from the northwest side. The Angat River joins the Pampanga River at Calumpit, Bulacan via the Bagbag River. Mount Arayat (elevation: ) stands in the middle of the basin. Southeast of Mount Arayat and the Pampanga River is the Candaba Swamp, covering an area of some absorbing most of the flood flows from the western slopes of a portion of the Sierra Madre and the overflowing of the Pampanga River via the Cabiao Floodway. This area is submerged during the rainy season but is relatively dry during summer. Flooding The basin experiences, on an average, at least one flooding in a year. The dry season generally occurs from December to May and wet the rest of the year. The wettest months are from July to September. The Pampanga River Basin could handle between of 24-hour rainfall. Extensive flooding occurred at the Pampanga River Basin in July 1962, May 1966, May 1976, October 1993, August 2003, August 2004, late September–October 2009, and August 2012. The flooding in September 2011 associated with Pedring (Typhoon Nesat) nearly swallowed all of Pampanga and southern parts of Bulacan. Very catastrophic and exceptionally severe flooding in the river basin that engulfed the Central Luzon provinces of Pangasinan, Pampanga, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and Tarlac occurred in July and August 1972. The 1972 flooding was so extensive that it flooded out 14 provinces in throughout Northern and Central Luzon, plus Metro Manila and Southern Tagalog. The Pampanga River Basin and the Agno River Basin converged over Tarlac, submerging that province. Economic importance At the higher sections of the basin, dams — especially the Pantabangan Dam in Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija — provide irrigation for farms in the province of Nueva Ecija. At the lower sections of the basin, where the Pampanga delta lies, the Pampanga River system divides into small branches, crisscrossed with fishponds to form a network of sluggish, tidal flats and canals, which eventually find their way to Manila Bay. With the anticipated completion of the Pampanga Delta Project (DPWH), it is expected that flood flows at the lower section of the Pampanga River will recede at a much faster rate.

There are also restaurants, bars, and cafés, mostly located outside in the covered Festival Square. These include Nandos, Las Iguanas, Cosy Club & GBK. The centre also incorporates a Vue cinema, Basingstoke Sports Centre, Basingstoke Discovery Centre and Flip Out Trampoline Park. It is located within Basingstoke town centre, close to Basingstoke railway station, and incorporates the town bus station and a multi-storey car park. Festival Place was also home to The Breeze, located in the centre management block. The Breeze FM was Basingstoke & North Hampshire's local radio station. On the 1st September 2020, The Breeze became Greatest Hits Radio (Berkshire & North Hampshire), it is unsure whether the studios are still being used for the new station. Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire & North Hampshire Festival Place is 102,000 m² (102 thousand square metres) in size. History The area of Basingstoke which Festival Place now stands on was cleared in the 1960s where a large concrete shopping centre was built. The first phase, which became The Walks and New Market Square was completed at the end of the decade and The Walks was covered in the 1987. The second phase became The Malls and has since been altered further to include a new roofed area and new modernised areas (2011/2012). The third phase was abandoned and became The Anvil concert hall. Festival Place was completed in 2002. The development replaced New Market Square and a 1960s multi-storey car park and included covering Porchester Square and extending the centre to the east into a new two-level section, Festival Square and the tower which is illuminated at night. The bus station was redeveloped and an amphitheatre was built beyond Festival Square and a fountain installed in neighbouring Eastrop Park. Between 2018 and 2019, Festival Place underwent a major refurbishment project, with a new identity, logo and signage throughout the centre, the car park was massively overhauled with new signage, coloured parking zones, wider spaces, bay light monitoring system and increased disabled/parent parking spaces. Payment machines were only located on the ground floor of the mall, but they have now installed payment machines on every floor in the lift lobbies of the car park. St johns Square which was part of the old town centre was refurbished with new shopfronts, fascias and the square given a new modern look with outdoor seating so it is in keeping with the new look of the centre and the opposite Malls Shopping Centre.

Portuguese forces led by Afonso Henriques defeated forces led by his mother Teresa of Portugal and her lover Fernão Peres de Trava. Following São Mamede, the future king styled himself \\"Prince of Portugal\\". He would be called \\"King of Portugal\\" in 1139 and was recognised as such by neighbouring kingdoms in 1143. Background In late 11th century, Henry of Portugal, a knight and brother of the Duke of Burgundy, went to support the Christians of Hispania. He fought the Moors along with Alfonso VI of León. In honour of his fights in Hispania, the King gave him the County of Portugal. This gift came with a reinstated title; because of attempts by the previous holder some years earlier to assert independence, it had been suppressed. Henry became count of Portugal and Theresa, one of Alfonso's daughters, his wife. In 1095, the county was a dependency of the Kingdom of Galicia, itself a dependency of the Kingdom of León. In 1097 Portugal became a direct dependency of León. However, from the early years of his rule, as he became influenced by the desire of the lords of the county for independence, Henry desired the independence of the county. Henry died in 1112, and his wife Regina Tarasia (Queen Theresa, as she addressed herself) became the countess of Portugal. She also wished for independence from her sister, Urraca, who became Queen of León after her father's, Alfonso VI of Leon, death. Like her husband, Theresa was also ambitious. In an attempt to maintain the autonomy of her county, she allied herself to her sister's enemies or with her sister, whichever was most propitious at the time. In 1116, the Portuguese took two Galician cities, Tui and Ourense. In reply, the sister of Countess Theresa, Queen Urraca, attacked Theresa's dominions. Bishop Diego Gelmírez, a friend of a Galician noble that was in the service of Theresa, led a revolt in the camp of Queen Urraca, and she was obliged to make peace with her sister Theresa. Urraca died in 1126. Urraca's son, Alfonso VII, became king of León and Castile and demanded that Theresa become his vassal, which she refused to do. In response, Alfonso attacked Portugal in the spring of 1127. This increased the power of her son, because she had lost the trust of the Leonese king, and her son became the count of Portugal. Theresa became a puppet of the Galician Ferdinand Perez de Trava. Theresa and Prince Afonso became enemies, as both wanted to take control of the county, but only the supporters of Prince Afonso were really interested in full independence. The battle Afonso Henriques was not alone in the battle. In fact, he was pressured by the lords of the main Portuguese cities, by the local church, and by its people to achieve the country's independence. Nobles participating in the battle with Afonso Henriques: * Afonso Nunes de Barbosa (1131) * D. Paio Mendes da Maia (Archbishop of Braga) * Egas Moniz de Cresconhe * Egas Moniz de Ribadouro (1108–1146) * Ermígio Moniz de Ribadouro (1128–1135) * Fernão Captivo (Alferes-Mor) * Garcia Soares * Godinho Fafes de Lanhoso * Gonçalo Mendes da Maia (O Lidador) * Gonçalo Mendes de Sousa (1154–1167) * Nuno Soares Velho (1117–1162) * Paio Ramires Ramirão * Sancho Nunes de Barbosa (1114–1169) * Soeiro Mendes de Sousa (1121–1137) The counts that dominated the counties of Portugal and Coimbra kept the idea of independence, and their merger strengthened their positions. Alfonso VI of León, knowing the wishes of the Portuguese, united all Galicia under a single rule of one lord, which he chose from one of his close relatives. Teresa, mother of Afonso Henriques, came to Guimarães to govern the Portuguese county. The Portuguese did not accept this, and the battle started. Afonso won the battle and Portugal started its journey towards independence. Post battle In 1129, Henriques declared himself Prince of Portugal and in 1139 as King of Portugal. León finally recognized Portugal's independence in 1143 in the Treaty of Zamora. In 1179, the Holy See declared him King, de jure. Further reading * Anderson, James Maxwell (2000).

It consists of a longitudinal motion of the electrons perpendicular to the magnetic field with the dispersion relation : \\\\omega^2 = \\\\omega_{pe}^2 + \\\\omega_{ce}^2 + 3 k^2 v_{\\\\mathrm{e,th}}^2 , where (in cgs units) :\\\\omega_{pe} = (4\\\\pi n_ee^2/m_e)^{1/2} is the electron plasma frequency, and :\\\\omega_{ce} = eB/{m_e c} is the electron cyclotron frequency. This oscillation is closely related to the plasma oscillation found in unmagnetized plasmas or parallel to the magnetic field, where the ωpe term arises from the electrostatic Coulomb restoring force and the 3k²ve,th² term arises from the restoring force of electron pressure. In the upper hybrid oscillation there is an additional restoring force due to the Lorentz force. Consider a plane wave where all perturbed quantities vary as exp(i(kx-ωt)). If the displacement in the direction of propagation is δx, then :vx = -iωδ :fy = nevxBz/c = -iω(neBz/c)δ :vy = -fy/iωnm = (eBz/mc)δ :fx = -nevyBz/c = -(nm)(eBz/mc)²δ :ax = -ωce²δ Thus the perpendicular magnetic field effectively provides a harmonic restoring force with a frequency ωce, explaining the third term in the dispersion relation. The particle orbits (or fluid trajectories) are ellipses in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, elongated in the direction of propagation. The frequency of long wavelength oscillations is a \\"hybrid\\", or mix, of the electron plasma and electron cyclotron frequencies, :ωh² = ωpe² + ωce², and is known as the upper hybrid frequency. There are also a lower hybrid frequency and lower hybrid oscillations. For propagation at angles oblique to the magnetic field, two modes exist simultaneously. If the plasma frequency is higher than the cyclotron frequency, then the upper hybrid oscillation transforms continuously into the plasma oscillation. The frequency of the other mode varies between the cyclotron frequency and zero. Otherwise, the frequency of the mode related to the upper hybrid oscillation remains above the cyclotron frequency, and the mode related to the plasma oscillation remains below the plasma frequency. In particular, the frequencies are given by : \\\\omega^2 = (1/2)\\\\omega_h^2\\\\,\\\\left( 1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{ 1 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\omega_h^2/2 \\\\omega_c\\\\omega_p} \\\\right)^2 } \\\\right) See also * Plasma oscillation * Lower hybrid oscillation * List of plasma (physics) articles Category:Waves in plasmas ","title":"Upper hybrid oscillation"},{"id":"1899999","title":"Espen Knutsen"},{"id":"1900000","text":"Agustín Pichot (born 22 August 1974, in Buenos Aires) is a retired Argentine rugby union player, formerly captain of the Argentine team and the English club Bristol. In addition to Bristol, he played for French sides Stade Français and Racing Métro after leaving Argentine team CASI from San Isidro in 1997. In 2011, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame. He was Vice-Chairman of World Rugby between 2016 and 2020.Agustín Pichot elected to World Rugby Executive Committee, World Rugby, 28 October 2015 Playing career Pichot made his debut for Los Pumas in April 1996 during the Pumas' tour to Australia, scoring a try in the first Test in Brisbane. Pichot was capped another three times that year for the Pumas; playing in Tests against Romania, Italy and France during October. The following year he was capped another three times for Argentina, playing two Tests against France and one against Uruguay in June, scoring a try in the match against Uruguay. In October/November of the next year, he earned another four Test caps, playing in matches against Italy, France and the Wallabies, scoring a try in the second of two matches against the Wallabies. He moved from CASI to Richmond, and later switched to Bristol. Pichot would be capped six times during the 1998 international season, including playing France three times, as well as playing matches against Italy, Romania and Wales, scoring tries in the games against Wales and Romania. In the lead up to the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales Pichot played two Tests against the hosts in June, and Tests against Scotland and Ireland that August, scoring a try in the Test against Ireland. He played five matches during the World Cup and helped the Pumas reach the quarter- finals. Argentina played France in their quarter-final, which France won 26–47, Pichot being one of Argentina's try scorers in the match. After the World Cup Pichot captained Argentina for the first time in a Test against Ireland in June 2000, which Argentina won 34 points to 23. He was also capped another four times that year, playing two games against World Champions Australia and then matches against South Africa and England in November. He earned eight Test caps during 2001, and captained Argentina on three more occasions, in matches against Uruguay, the United States and Canada in May. He played six Tests the following year, captaining the Pumas during two of them (June Tests against England and South Africa). Pichot then moved to Paris club Stade Français in 2003. He played two Tests during August 2003, including captaining the Pumas against Uruguay. He was named captain for the opening match of the 2003 Rugby World Cup against hosts Australia. The Wallabies won the match 24–8. He also scored tries in the pool matches against Uruguay and Canada. He then captained the team in the last pool game against Ireland, which they lost 16–15. He was named to Argentina's 2007 Rugby World Cup squad, which he captained successfully to a 3rd place showing in the World Cup, after a second win in the 2007 Rugby World Cup against France in the 3rd/4th place playoff. Pichot was the first foreign captain of a French team that won the French championship in 2007. He spent the 2007–2008 season with Racing Métro, then in Rugby Pro D2, before retiring. Pichot briefly came out of retirement for one last stint with Stade Français in 2009.http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/depeches/sports/20090312.REU1752/top_14_le_dernier_challenge_parisien_dagustin_pichot.html However, an injury suffered in April 2009 that ended his 2008–09 season led Pichot to call time on his playing career. Pichot returned to Argentina for one final match on 27 June at CASI, an informal exhibition divided into three periods that saw nearly 60 players take the pitch, including many of his former CASI teammates and past and present Pumas. He was the only player to remain on the field through the match. Also present were Alex Wyllie, who coached the Pumas to their first World Cup quarterfinal in 1999; Marcelo Loffreda, the Pumas' coach for their 2007 World Cup run; and Pichot's successor as Pumas captain, Felipe Contepomi, who was unable to play as he was recovering from a torn ACL. Every player on the pitch wore #9, the standard number for starting scrum-halves. He narrated the Argentine version of the documentary Earth. On 24 October 2011, at the IRB Awards ceremony in Auckland, Pichot was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame alongside 18 other key figures in the history of the Rugby World Cup. Rugby administration Pichot's boardroom career began in 2009 following an overhaul of the Argentine Rugby Union, known as UAR, which changed its long-standing amateur status and moved towards rugby as a professional game in Argentina.

He was a rugby union footballer who played fly-half or centre; his last club was Club Newman, in the first division of the URBA championship. He was also a key player for Argentina, having played 15 years for the national team. His twin brother Manuel was also a Puma. In June 2015 he was appointed coach of Argentina XV. Contepomi was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in November 2017. Club career Born 20 August 1977 in Buenos Aires, Contepomi started playing rugby for his secondary school Colegio Cardenal Newman, and then for Club Newman in Buenos Aires. In 2003 he joined Leinster from Bristol on a four-year contract following Bristol's relegation in the 2002–03 Zurich Premiership. He played a major role in Leinster's run in the 2005–06 Heineken Cup, helping Leinster to a 41–35 win over Cup holders Toulouse, scoring 21 points in the process and winning the man of the match award. That year he was top scorer in both the 2005–06 Celtic League and the Heineken Cup. In late January 2006, Contepomi's former girlfriend, Paula, gave birth to their daughter, Catalina. Only hours later, Contepomi played for Leinster the Celtic League match against the Border Reivers, a game in which he went on to score 22 points.Magners League. Leinster crush Border Reivers , 22 January 2006. In November of that year, Agustín Pichot said that Contepomi was a better player than All Black fly- half, Dan Carter, the winner of the 2005 IRB International Player of the Year award.Fox Sports, Contepomi \\"better than Carter\\" , 8 November 2006. On 31 May 2007, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in Dublin conferred him with the medical degrees of MB BCh BAO (NUI) LRCP&SI.; He subsequently worked in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin. Contepomi won the 2007 Rugby Writers of Ireland Player of the Year award. While playing at Leinster, his nominal 'local club' of origin was County Carlow Co Carlow Football Club, a provincial side which later got into financial difficulties and is now a minor Junior concern.Irish Examiner , 16 February 2011. On 12 March 2009, it was announced that Contepomi would be leaving Leinster at the end of the season, and that he had signed a 4-year deal to join French side RC Toulon from the 2009–10 Top 14 season. Contepomi played a role in the Leinster win over Munster in the Heineken Cup semi-final on 2 May 2009. After scoring a drop goal after 15 minutes in, he was helped off the pitch after suffering a knee injury half an hour in. An MRI scan confirmed he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to be out of action for 6 months post-op. Almost exactly on schedule, he made his Toulon debut on 21 November against Brive, coming off the bench and scoring a penalty in Toulon's 19–10 win. Contepomi left RC Toulon to take the fly-half position at Stade Français in time for the 2011–12 season. International career Contepomi was one of the stars of world rugby and was also set to lead the Argentina national team into a new era after being named captain in 2008. The former U19, U21 and Sevens international made his Pumas debut against Chile in 1998 and has been an integral part of Argentinean rugby ever since. The multi-talented Contepomi made his international break-through at fly-half and while he has played much of his rugby in that position he recently has found his place at inside centre with Juan Martin Hernandez preferred at No.10. He was named in José Luis Imhoff and Alex Wyllie's squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup squad, where the Pumas made the quarter-finals for the first time. Marcelo Loffreda took charge of the national side in 2000 and Contepomi retained his place, eventually nailing down a starting berth 2001.

He was also part of the 2003 Rugby World Cup squad, featuring in three of the Pumas' pool games as they were forced to play four games in a fortnight. In 2004, Contepomi weighed in with 14 points as Argentina condemned France to their first defeat at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille. He also faced the British & Irish Lions in 2005 and at the end of 2006 he was part of the Pumas side that scored their first ever victory over England at Twickenham. The Pumas stunned the rugby world with an inspired performance at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. Contepomi was a key player throughout the campaign – featuring in all seven matches as the Pumas claimed third place in the sport's global showpiece. He was the second highest points scorer in the tournament – notably kicking four penalties in the shock opening victory over hosts France and 11 points in both the pool victory over Ireland and the quarter-final against Scotland. Contepomi was nominated by the IRB as one of five candidates for the 2007 International Player of the Year award, which was won by Bryan Habana. Following the retirement of veteran scrum-half Agustín Pichot, Contepomi was handed the captaincy of the Pumas in 2008 by new coach Santiago Phelan ahead of the opening clash of the year against Scotland. A knee injury suffered in Leinster's Heineken Cup semi-final victory over Munster in 2009 ruled him out of action for over a year but he returned to Pumas colours in 2010 and won a 31-point haul in their 41–13 victory over Six Nations champions France. He was part of the Argentine squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand playing as captain. Contepomi played his last international game with Argentina on Saturday 5 October 2013 in Rosario, Santa Fe, against Australia during The Rugby Championship. At the time of his retirement, Contepomi achieved the most test matches played for Argentina (87) and the most points scored in international games (651). He worked with his father in their medical practice in Buenos Aires and as assistant coach in the Super XV for new Argentine franchise Jaguares (Super Rugby).

In 2018, he was appointed as new Backs Coach to Leinster, succeeding Girvan Dempsey, who moved to Bath.

It was formed from Finnish volunteers and fought on the Eastern Front as part of the SS Division Wiking. The unit was disbanded in mid-1943 as the two-year commitment of the volunteers had expired and the Finnish Government was unwilling to allow more men to volunteer. About 1,400 men served in the battalion throughout its existence. Operational history The Finnish Government recruited men for service with the Waffen-SS for a two-year term in early 1941, although negotiations over the details lasted until the end of April. This delayed their arrival until May and the roughly 400 men who had military experience in the Winter War were sent to the SS Division Wiking in mid-June where they were dispersed throughout the formation. The inexperienced volunteers were held back for training and were formed into the SS-Volunteer Battalion Northeast (motorized) () on 1 June. By the end of the month, the battalion had about 1,000 men. It was renamed the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS on 13 September and additional volunteers arrived over the next several months to bring its strength up to around 1,180 men. The unit was sent to the front at the beginning of January 1942 where it was attached to the SS-Regiment Nordland of the SS Division Wiking, serving as its third battalion.Ueberschär (1996), pp. 1072–73; Tessin (1980), pp. 89, 186 The battalion participated in the Battle of the Caucasus in mid-1942 and the subsequent Third Battle of Kharkov in early 1943, after the German defeat during the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 forced the Germans to evacuate the Caucasus. The mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna was chairman of the Committee for the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS. 1408 men served in the battalion during its existence.Jokipii 2002, pp. 184–189 The unit lost 255 men killed in action, 686 wounded and 14 missing during its service. Allegations of war crimes Research by Finnish historian Andre Swanström identified at least six Finnish Waffen-SS volunteers who had in Swanström's opinion implicated themselves in crimes, including shooting Jews in Ukraine in 1941. In one letter, an SS private wrote to an officer and military chaplain, , objecting to being on the shooting detail because \\"for the execution of Jews, less skilled personnel would have sufficed\\". In 2018, in response to a request from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Finnish authorities announced a committee of inquiry into the activities of the battalion.

Among others, historians and showed that, in the light of the archival material that emerged in the 2010s, Jokipii's estimates of nationalist radicals, fascists and National Socialists among its ranks was underestimated. According to Silvennoinen and Tikka, about 46 per cent of volunteers, or more than double the number compared to Jokipii's calculations, would have shown themselves to be adherents of fascist ideology.Olli Koikkalainen: Uusi tutkimus muuttaa kuvaa puhtoisista SS-vapaaehtoisista. Aamulehti 3. kesäkuuta 2018, s. A21. Alma Media. According to Swanström, 36 percent of the volunteers declared being supporters of the clerical fascist Patriotic People's Movement (IKL), while 10 per cent declared being supporters of the various minor Finnish Nazi parties and 7 per cent supporters of traditional right-wing parties. According to Swanström, the ideology of the Finnish SS men was connected to extreme Finnish nationalism and a particular Finnish form of Lutheran revivalism (herännäisyys). According to Jokipii, the Finnish SS men did not participate in the brutal executions of Jews by the Germans, but some of them testified as eyewitnesses to murders. However, a Finnish government investigation determined in 2019 that some of the Finns alongside the Germans shot Jews and civilians.\\"  Footnotes   References   Category:Military history of Finland during World War II Category:Foreign volunteer units of the Waffen-SS Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1943 Category:Finland–Germany relations ","title":"Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS"},{"id":"1900027","text":"Corporate manslaughter is a criminal offence in English law, being an act of homicide committed by a company or organisation. In general, in English criminal law, a juristic person is in the same position as a natural person, and may be convicted for committing many offences. The Court of Appeal confirmed in one of the cases following the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster that a company can, in principle, commit manslaughter, although all defendants in that case were acquitted.R. v. P & O Ferries (Dover) Ltd (1991) 93 Cr App Rep 72 (citation explained). Theory and historical development The common law test to impose criminal responsibility on a company only arises where a person's gross negligence has led to another person's death and (under the \\"identification doctrine\\") that person is a \\"controlling mind\\", whose actions and intentions can be imputed to the company (that is, a person in control of the company's affairs to a sufficient degree that the company can fairly be said to think and act through him). This is tested by reference to the detailed work patterns of the manager, and the job title or description given to that person is irrelevant, but there is often no single person who acts as a \\"controlling mind\\", particularly in large companies, and many issues of health and safety are delegated to junior managers who are not \\"controlling minds\\".Tesco v. Nattrass [1972] AC 153, HLAttorney-General's Reference (No.2 of 1999) [2000] QB 796, CA On 6 March 1987, 193 people died when the Herald of Free Enterprise capsized. Although individual employees failed in their duties, the Sheen Report severely criticised the attitude to safety prevalent in P&O;, stating:Department of Transport (1987), The Merchant Shipping Act 1894, mv Herald of Free Enterprise, Report of Court No 8074 (Sheen Report), London: HMSO There was significant institutional resistance to the appropriateness of using the criminal law in general, and homicide charges in particular in this type of situation. Judicial review of the coroner's inquest persuaded the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring manslaughter charges against P&O; European Ferries and seven employees, but the trial judge ruled that there was no evidence that one sufficiently senior member of the company's management could be said to have been negligent. A subsequent appeal confirmed that corporate manslaughter is a charge known to English criminal law, and with the revival of gross negligence as a mens rea for manslaughter, it was thought that prosecutions might succeed. However, a prosecution of Great Western Trains following the Southall rail crash collapsed because \\"the Crown was not in a position to satisfy the doctrine of identification\\" (Turner J). Only the company itself and the train driver, Mr Larry Harrison, were prosecuted. Since the train driver is not someone of a managerial or directorial level, the case against him was dismissed in the opening arguments. Because the only other defendant was GWT, a corporation, this meant that it was impossible to identify a controlling mind for the purposes of holding an individual personally liable for manslaughter. In English law, proving corporate manslaughter and securing a conviction of an individual where the corporation involved is a small concern are easier where it is easier to identify a \\"controlling mind\\" (in R v OLL Ltd, 1994, about the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy, managing director Peter Kite was convicted), but efforts to convict people in larger corporate entities tends to fail as the management structure is more diffuse making this identification more difficult. Instead, the prosecution stands more chance of pursuing a case successfully if it prosecutes simply on the grounds of a safety breach under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Following R v. Prentice,(1993) 3 WLR 937 a breach of duty amounts to 'gross negligence' when there is: The Law Commission's 1996 report on involuntary manslaughter found that the gross negligence formula overcomes the problems of having to find one particular officer who has the mens rea for the offence and allows emphasis to be placed on the company's attitude to safety.Involuntary Manslaughter , Law Commission Report 237, 1996. This question would only arise where the company has chosen to enter a field of activity that carries a risk to others, such as transport, manufacture or medical care. The steps the company has taken to discharge the \\"duty of safety\\" and the systems devised for running its business, will be directly relevant. Although only expressed as a provisional view, it is significant that the Law Commission echoes here the recognition of corporate safety systems voiced in the Seaboard case. Thus, a real tension is exposed between the paradigm of criminal culpability based on individual responsibility and the increasing recognition of the potential for harm inherent in large scale corporate activity. The government issued a consultation paper in 2000, proposing reforms to the law to implement the recommendations of the Law Commission. A draft Corporate Manslaughter Bill was published in March 2005, and the Queen's Speech on 17 May 2005 included a reference to an Act of Parliament to be passed in 2005/6 to widen the scope for prosecutions for corporate manslaughter. New legislation from 2008 A Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill was introduced to the House of Commons by Home Secretary John Reid on 20 July 2006 to create new offences of corporate manslaughter, in England and Wales, and corporate homicide, in Scotland. Originally, the Bill proposed that the offence would require a company's or organisation's activities to be so managed or organised by its senior managers as to cause a person's death, and to amount to a \\"gross breach\\" of a duty of care owed to the deceased. The requirement for the failure of management or organisation to have been \\"by its senior managers\\" was dropped in Standing Committee. The Bill also sought to abolish the common law offence of manslaughter by gross negligence so far as it applies to corporations. A juristic person cannot be imprisoned, but the penalty would be an unlimited fine as for the existing common law offence. The Bill received royal assent on 26 July 2007, becoming the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007.Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill, Parliament website. The Act came into force on 6 April 2008. On 15 November 2007, the Sentencing Guidelines Council issued a consultative document recommending a starting point of a fine of 5% of turnover for a first offence with a not guilty plea, rising to 10% of turnover.

It was established in 1896 and operated until 2009. The grounds of the prison are now included in part of the Barkley Marathons. History Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary opened in 1896 in the aftermath of the Coal Creek War, an 1891 lockout of coal miners that took place in Coal Creek and Briceville, Tennessee, after miners protested the use of unpaid convict leasing in the mines. This labor conflict was eventually resolved in favor of the coal miners, with a bill passing the Tennessee state legislature to abolish the convict labor system, to be replaced by the Brushy is not as well as Todd South, Bars closing on Brushy Mountain after 113 years, Chattanooga Times Free Press, April 5, 2009Frank Lee and Robert Rogers, Tennessee Prison System , Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed November 1, 2009 The mountainous, secure site was located with the help of consulting geologists, and Brushy Mountain convicts built a railroad spur, worked the coal mines on site, operated coke ovens, or farmed. At the end of all the state's convict lease arrangements on January 1, 1896, some 210 of those prisoners became the first inmates of Brushy Mountain. The original prison was a wooden structure also built by prisoner labor. It was replaced in the 1920s with a castle-like building constructed from stone mined by prisoners from a quarry on the property.Todd South, Bars closing on Brushy Mountain after 113 years, Chattanooga Times Free Press, April 5, 2009Brushy Mountain Correctional Complex Prison Tours, Tennessee Department of Correction website, accessed November 8, 2008 As of 2008 Brushy Mountain was the oldest operating prison in Tennessee. The prison is nearly encircled by rugged wooded terrain in a remote section of the Cumberland Plateau, adjacent to Frozen Head State Park and Natural Area. Escape attempts were infrequent and almost always unsuccessful. Perhaps the best-known escape attempt occurred on June 10, 1977, when James Earl Ray, who committed the assassination Martin Luther King Jr., escaped with six other inmates by climbing over a fence. Ray was captured less than 58 hours later in rugged mountain terrain 8 miles from the prison.https://web.archive.org/web/20080524142603/http://knoxville.fbi.gov/hist.htm The prison was closed in 1972 after a strike by prison guards protesting unsafe working conditions. It reopened in 1976. Brushy Mountain was the only unionized prison in the state. The union worked closely with state legislators to improve the working conditions for correctional staff across the state. Under governor Lamar Alexander attempts were made to squeeze the union out of existence but his efforts were fruitless. In the following years, Brushy Mountain would face additional attempted union busts - but these, too, would prove unsuccessful. Many efforts to close the prison were attempted long before the 2009 closure. In 1998 Brushy Mountain Prison was administratively joined with Morgan County Correctional Complex. With the joining of the two institutions, both prisons became unionized. In the 1980s Brushy Mountain ended its long-standing function as a maximum security prison and assumed a mission as a classification facility. In its final operations, it had a capacity of 584 and was used as the state's reception/classification and diagnostic center for East Tennessee. It housed all custody levels of inmates, although it retained a maximum security designation due to the ninety six bed maximum security annex contained within the prison walls. These ninety six beds were used to house the state's most troublesome inmates.

It is a small town of 935 people (as of the 2016 census), many of whom were previously employed by Bord na Móna to work the local peat bogs. The town is located near the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The Silver River flows through the town. The town was more commonly referred to as Frankford prior to Irish independence. Kilcormac History The name Kilcormac comes from the Irish Cill Chormaic meaning Cormac's Church. This name is based on the local patron saint; Cormac Ua Liatháin, a native of Cork, who paid a visit to St Colmcille at the famous monastery he had founded in Durrow in 553 A.D. Cormac was so inspired by the great saint that he joined Colmcille and spent many years at Durrow, eventually taking over as abbot after Colmcille had gone to Iona in Scotland. He eventually founded a church near the Silver River which became known as Cill Chormaic. Over time the original church fell into ruin. Tradition holds that Cormac died in nearby Eglish following an attack by a pair of wolves. A window in Eglish Church depicts the event. Historically, Kilcormac was part of the O'Molloy territory of Firceall which was part of the Kingdom of Meath, however Ballyboy was traditionally the main trading centre of the area at the time being situated on an important route which passed through the area. Following the Plantations of Offaly the area formed part of the Barony of Ballyboy. About five hundred years later reference is made to foreign monks, possibly Augustinian, at the Hermitage. A manuscript, written in Kilcormac in 1300, is now in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy. (The same museum also houses the crozier of Durrow, which was probably Cormac's symbol of authority when he succeeded Colmcille as abbot of Durrow). During the Middle Ages Kilcormac was the site of a Carmelite monastery. Following the Henrican Reformation all monasteries were dissolved. The current Convent of Mercy is located on the site of the old monastery. The current Catholic Church is located on the site of Cormac's old church. The Church is a fine imposing building and dates from 1867 after a number of alterations to the original church built during the time of the penal laws. It is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. =The Kilcormac Pieta= Within the church is statue of the Pieta. According to tradition it was donated to the parish by a rich lady in the 16th century. It was placed in the parish church, which at that time was in Ballyboy, about 1 mile from Kilcormac. There it remained until 1650 when Oliver Cromwell’s army was reported approaching from the direction of Cadamstown. The pieta was eventually buried in a bog for 60 years for safety. During this time both Ballyboy and Kilcormac Churches were ruined by Cromwell's forces. While the church at Kilcormac was not rebuilt, Ballyboy Church was rebuilt eventually, but as part of the Established Anglican Church of Ireland. Tradition holds that only one man remained alive who knew where the Pieta was buried, and, according to tradition, he was carried on his deathbed to point it out. The carving was carefully recovered and when it was examined it was found to be in perfect condition. It was then placed in the Church Of The Nativity that had recently been built in Kilcormac. =18th Century onwards= Kilcormac grew in importance in the 18th and 19th Century as Ballyboy went into decline. Following the establishment of County Offaly and the growth of Tullamore, Kilcormac now found itself on the main route on from Birr to Tullamore and became an important market centre in the area. Following the relaxation of the Penal laws the Catholic Church also opted to build its church in Kilcormac and not Ballyboy which cemented its place as a market centre of the area given the Catholic majority population of the area. Services and amenities The amenities serving the local population include a primary school, a secondary school (Coláiste Naomh Cormac), a number of local grocery shops, butchers, clothes shop, doctors practice, chemist and an agricultural/hardware store. There are also a number of pubs along the main street. Kilcormac has somewhat declined from its peak which was in the mid 20th Century. Many people traditionally found work in Bord na Móna and the bogs in what is now a declining industry. Bord na Móna remains an important part of the local economy with many employed in nearby Derrinlough at the peat briquette manufacturing plant. Agriculture and farming are also important to the local economy. The main route out of Kilcormac is the R437 regional road. Lough Boora parklands is a local outdoor amenity for walkers and outdoor pursuits, as are the nearby Slieve Bloom Mountains. Sport Kilcormac- Killoughey play Seir Kieran in the 1996 Offaly Senior Hurling Championship Gaelic Games are the most popular sports played in the area and are played at all levels. Hurling is the most popular code of sport played. Kilcormac/Killoughey GAA is the local GAA club.

Typical P&I; cover includes: a carrier's third-party risks for damage caused to cargo during carriage;Marine Cargo Insurance - John Dunt - 2009 - Informa - war risks;Marine War Risks - Michael D Miller - 1994 - Lloyds - and risks of environmental damage such as oil spills and pollution. In the UK, both traditional underwriters and P&I; clubs are subject to the Marine Insurance Act 1906. A P&I; club is a mutual insurance association that provides risk pooling, information and representation for its members. Unlike a marine insurance company, which reports to its shareholders, a P&I; club reports only to its members. Originally, P&I; club members were typically shipowners, ship operators or demise charterers, but more recently freight forwarders and warehouse operators have been able to join. Whereas the assured pays a premium to an underwriter for cover which lasts for a particular time (say, a year, or a voyage), a P&I; club member instead pays a \\"call\\". This is a sum of money that is put into the club's pool, a kind of \\"kitty\\". If, at the end of the year, there are still funds in the pool, each member will pay a reduced call the following year; but if the club has made a major payout (say, after an oil spillage) club members will immediately have to pay a further call to replenish the pool. There is an International Group of P&I; Clubs based at Peek House, London.The Jackson Parton Miscellany - 2nd ed - 2012 page 77 - www.marinequery.com These clubs cooperate to provide funds in the event of huge claims using a complex system to determine liability.  Historical background  The ancient Greeks created the practice of General Average in Rhodos island, and ancient Romans could be said to have had a rudimentary form of marine insurance. However, a novel type of insurance that one would recognise as modern emerged in the London \\"coffee shops\\" in the 19th century. Shipowners and charterers would seek underwriters to insure their ships, and cargo owners (whether shippers, importers or consignees) would insure their cargoes. Carriers soon realised that often they might themselves be at fault should cargo be lost or damaged at sea, and they sought to take out third- party indemnity insurance in respect of cargo liability. Underwriters showed an unwillingness to take on such open-ended risks, so shipowners responded by forming their own mutual P&I; clubs, acting as a shipowner's co-operative. An advantage was that a club worked for the shipowners, thereby eliminating the underwriters' profit margins and making P&I; Insurance significantly cheaper.Law of Marine Insurance - Susan Hodges -Cavendish Publishing - 2001 - - pp 323-326 In the second half of the 19th century, the number of claims greatly increased due to the number of passengers emigrating to North America and Australia. Shipowners became aware of their insurers' compensation limits, especially when it came to damages caused by ship collisions. While the UK Merchant Shipping Act 1854 had determined that, when evaluating insurance claims, the value of ships should be no less than £15 per ton, many ships had an actual lower market value and existing insurance policies did not cover this gap in liability. The compensation for collision damages also excluded a quarter of such damages. Existing hull insurance policies included damages to the insured ship and liability for the damages it had caused, while the maximum amount shipowners could recover after collisions was the ship's insured value, injured crew members might seek compensation from their employers. Later, the Fatal Accidents Act 1846 made it easier for passengers or their survivors to file claims. Perhaps the first protection association, the Shipowners' Mutual Protection Society, was formed in 1855. It was intended to compensate for loss of life, injuries and collisions that were excluded from marine insurance policies beyond the monetary limit of these policies. Similar associations were later formed within the United Kingdom, in Scandinavia, Japan and the United States. In 1874, the risk of liability for cargo carried by the insured ship was added to the insurance cover provided by a P&I; club. Cargo value had risen and cargo underwriters, encouraged by UK courts, filed more claims to recover their losses from shipowners. These claims were not covered by the current marine insurance class. After 1874, many clubs added a marine indemnity class to respond to these new claims. This class was later merged with the marine insurance class reserved for the original protection risks and the distinction between the two classes virtually disappeared. After the Torrey Canyon grounding in 1967, covering the liabilities, costs and expenses of oil spills became an increasingly important aspect of P&I; insurance.  SCOPIC  Following on from the innovations of the LOF 1980, the 1989 International Salvage Convention permitted salvage rewards to be made to salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 & 14 of the Convention made provision for \\"Special Compensation\\", but the UK House of Lords case of the Nagasaki Spirit [ Nagasaki Spirit [1997] LLR 323] revealed that the convention had been poorly drafted, thereby limiting the amount that environmental salvors could be paid to mere \\"out-of-pocket expenses\\", with no allowance for any profit margin. As an antidote to this, the marine insurance industry and P&I; clubs jointly developed the \\"SCOPIC clause\\", which is a codicil that may be appended to an LOF and invoked should the statutory payment provisions prove inadequate. The first SCOPIC clause was in 2000, and there have been several iterations since.  P & I clubs today = Relationship with marine insurance = Marine insurers offer insurance on measurable risks: hull and machinery insurance for shipowners, and cargo insurance for cargo owners. P&I; clubs provide insurance for broader, indeterminate risks that marine insurers usually do not cover, such as third party risks. These risks include: a carrier’s liability to a cargo-owner for damage to cargo, a shipowner’s liability after a collision, environmental pollution and P&I; war risk insurance, or legal liability due to acts of war affecting the ship. Marine insurers are usually for-profit companies that charge customers a premium to fully cover ships and cargo in the time period when the policy applies. In contrast, a P&I; club is run as a non-profit co-operative and the insurance is financed by “calls”. Club members contribute to the club’s common risk pool according to the Pooling Agreement's rules. If the risk pool cannot cover current claims, the club members will be asked to pay a further call. If the pool has a surplus, the club will ask for a lower call the following year or make a refund to members. Only shipowners with acceptable reputations are allowed to join a P&I; club and any P&I; club member who incurs reckless or avoidable losses to the club may be asked to leave. Thus, marine cargo is generally covered twice by insurance standards. The shipper or cargo-owner will be covered by a marine insurer likely with 'all risks' cover. The carrier or shipowner will be covered by the P&I; club but will typically limit their liability to goods owners to a small fraction of the retail value of goods. If the cargo is lost or damaged, the cargo-owner needs to first make a claim against the shipowner. However, the shipowner may avoid liability if it did not cause the loss or if the Hague-Visby Rules grant exemption from liability. In that case, the cargo-owner will claim against its own insurance company. If the cargo-owner fails to claim first against the shipowner, but claims instead against its own insurance company, the insurer, having reimbursed its client, will through subrogation pursue the claim in its own right against the shipowner. = Exceptions = The following are the major exceptions to P&I; coverage: * Other insurance: A P&I; insurance claim may be rejected if club managers think the risk should have been covered by other types of insurance that the shipowner should have obtained, such as war risks insurance or hull insurance, which pays collision liabilities and, in some cases, liabilities for damages to fixed and floating objects (\\"FFO\\"). * Mutuality: A claim may be rejected in part or full if the shipowner took insufficient steps to limit its liability in order to protect the club. The club requires shipowners to ensure that the text within bills of lading and passenger tickets minimises the shipowner's liability faults (within the scope of section 2 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977). The club expects shipowners comply with all flag state requirements concerning marine safety and environmental protection. * Moral hazard: Liabilities due to the fraudulent non-delivery of cargo, especially deliveries of cargo that do not require an original bill of lading, are usually not covered by P&I; insurance. This view is reflected in the decision of the English courts in Sze Hai Tong Bank v. Rambler Cycle Co. [1959] UKPC 14;[1959] AC 576; [1959] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 114 (PC) * Willful misconduct: Losses intended by the insured, or to which it \\"turned a blind eye\\" knowing they were likely to happen. * Public policy: Criminal liabilities used not to be covered as a matter of course. Criminal liability was imposed only for intentional misconduct, and the requirement of fortuity generally included the coverage of criminal liabilities. Today, statutes in many countries impose \\"criminal\\" liability for negligent conduct that damages the environment, under circumstances that do not rise to the level of \\"willful misconduct\\" under the law of marine insurance.  Modern developments  = European Union Directive 2009/20/EC = The European Union Directive 2009/20/EC was implemented in all 27 Member States by January 1, 2012. The Directive requires compulsory P&I; to cover for EU and foreign ships in EU waters and ports. Foreign vessels that do not comply to the Directive may be expelled or refused entry into any EU port, although ships may be allowed time to comply before expulsion. As EU competence does not generally extend to penology, (see Re Tachographs (CJEU) 1979),Re Tachographs 1979 ECR 419 the Directive requires the Member States themselves to set penalties for any breach. = The Rotterdam Rules = The Rotterdam Rules are a set of rules designed to replace the Hamburg Rules and the outdated Hague-Visby Rules (both of which are international conventions to impose duties upon a carrier of goods by sea). Should the Rotterdam Rules come into effect, they would cover not merely the sea voyage, but all parts of any contract of multimodal carriage with a sea leg. Thereafter, land carriers, warehouses, and freight forwarders would also need P&I; cover. This would inevitably lead to an increase in the scope and importance of P&I; cover, and might diminish the prevalence of standard cargo insurance. = Non-mutual P&I; cover= Conventional P&I; cover has been taken up primarily by shipowners and demise charterers, but a new development is P&I; cover for time- and voyage- charterers. Since these charterers may have no long-term relationship with any vessel, and may well have periods when they are not chartering at all, the mutual model based on common-pool sharing of liability is not necessarily ideal. Some non-mutual \\"charterers P&I; clubs\\" have arisen whereby a private company may act as broker to provide 3rd-party cover via underwriters, on payment of a conventional premium, rather than a P&I; call. In addition to brokerage services, such a company may offer conventional \\"our man on the spot\\" P&I; services.

A tidal marsh (also known as a type of \\"tidal wetland\\") is a marsh found along rivers, coasts and estuaries which floods and drains by the tidal movement of the adjacent estuary, sea or ocean. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Tidal marshes Tidal marshes experience many overlapping persistent cycles, including diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, day-night temperature fluctuations, spring-neap tides, seasonal vegetation growth and decay, upland runoff, decadal climate variations, and centennial to millennial trends in sea level and climate. Tidal marshes are formed in areas that are sheltered from waves (such as beside edges of bays), in upper slops of intertidal, and where water is fresh or saline.They are also impacted by transient disturbances such as hurricanes, floods, storms, and upland fires Types Tidal marshes are differentiated into freshwater, brackish and salt according to the salinity of their water. Coastal marshes lie along coasts and estuarine marshes lie inland within the tidal zone. Location determines the controlling processes, age, disturbance regime, and future persistence of tidal marshes. Tidal freshwater marshes are further divided into deltaic and fringing types.Pasternack, G. B. 2009. Hydrogeomorphology and sedimentation in tidal freshwater wetlands. In (A. Barendregt, A. Baldwin, P. Meire, D. Whigham, Eds) Tidal Freshwater Wetlands, Margraf Publishers GmbH, Weikersheim, Germany, p. 31-40 Extensive research has been conducted on deltaic tidal freshwater marshes in Chesapeake Bay, which were formed as a result of historic deforestation and intensive agriculture. Tidal marshes can be further categorized by salinity level, elevation, and sea level.\\"Responding to Changes in Sea Level\\", by Marine Board, Marine Board, National Research Council (U.S.) p. 65 Tidal marshes are commonly zoned into lower marshes (also called intertidal marshes) and upper or high marshes, based on their elevation above sea level. A middle marsh zone also exists for tidal freshwater marshes. Tidal marshes may be further classified into back- barrier marshes, estuarine brackish marshes and tidal freshwater marshes, depending on the influence of sea level. =Coastal= Coastal tidal marshes are found within coastal watersheds and encompass a variety of types including fresh and salt marshes, bottomland hardwood swamps, mangrove swamps, and palustrine wetlands. Island and barrier island Tidal Marshes also form between a main shoreline and barrier islands. These elongated shifting landforms evolve parallel and in close proximity to the shoreline of a tidal marsh.Davis, Richard A. \\"Barrier Island System - a Geologic Overview.\\" Geology of Holocene Barrier Island Systems. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1994. N. pag. Print. Many become fully submerged at high tide, and become directly attached to the mainland when at low tide. Barrier island formation includes mechanisms such as offshore bar theory, spit accretion theory, and climate change.  Ecosystem Services  Seaside sparrow (Ammospiza maritima). Tidal marsh ecosystems provide numerous services, including supplying habitats to support a diverse range of biodiversity. Their areas are spawning grounds and home to \\"feeder fish\\" that lie low on the food chain, and serve as crucial rest-stops for migratory birds. Additionally, they provide suitable habitat to various tidal salt marsh specialist bird species, such as the seaside sparrow (Ammospiza maritima) and the willet (Tringa semipalmata) found in tidal marshes in Connecticut, U.S.Benoit, Lori K., and Robert A. Askins. \\"Relationship between habitat area and the distribution of tidal marsh birds.\\" The Wilson Journal of Ornithology 114.3 (2002): 314-323. Other ecosystem services include their role as significant carbon sinks and shoreline stabilizers. Tidal marshes provide flood protection to upland areas by storing ground water, and lessen the impact of storm surges on nearby shorelines. Tidal marshes located along coastlines also act as intricate filtration systems for watersheds.Carter, V. 1997. Technical Aspects of Wetlands: Wetland Hydrology, Water Quality, and Associated Functions. United States Geological Survey Water Supply Paper 2425 These areas absorb and trap pollutants from water run-off that travels from higher elevations to open water.  Anthropogenic Threats  Historically, the global loss of tidal marshes can be attributed to the implementation of tidal restrictions and other draining activities. Tidal restrictions methods include diking, tide gates, and impoundments, which were implemented on coastal lands internationally in favour of creating agricultural land, as exemplified with large-scale diking that has occurred in Atlantic Canada and the U.S. (e.g. in The Bay of Fundy). Historical changes (due to anthropogenic activity) to tidal marshes have a lasting impact on them today. Tidal marshes have experienced the Gold Rush which filled some marshes with sediment due to erosion. Logging has also damaged tidal marshes due to their decomposition and filling of marshes. Tidal marshes sensitivity to anthropogenic activity have created long lasting affects. Currently, rising sea levels is one of the leading threats to tidal marshes caused by global warming and climate change. Pollution due to urbanization also continues to endanger tidal marsh ecosystems.  Restoration  Restoration of tidal marshes through the removal of tidal restrictions to re-establish degraded ecosystem services have been underway internationally for decades. Deliberate and natural restoration practices have occurred in the U.S., United Kingdom, Europe, and Canada. Research shows that tidal marsh restoration can be evaluated through various factors, such as vegetation, biogeochemical responses (e.g. salinity, sediment deposition, pH, and carbon sequestration), hydrologic responses, and wildlife community responses.

At the beginning of the 20th century, pioneers such as Henri Coanda, Aurel Vlaicu, Traian Vuia and George Valentin Bibescu made important contributions to early aviation history, building revolutionary aeroplanes and contributing to the international scene. In the present, the Romanian Civil Aeronautic Authority oversees all aviation activities.  History  =Pioneers= George Valentin Bibescu was a Romanian aristocrat who became an early aviation pioneer and international figure. He flew a balloon named \\"Romania\\" brought from France 1905. Later he tried to teach himself how to fly a Voisin airplane, also brought from France, but without success. After Louis Blériot's demonstrative flights in Bucharest on October 18, 1909, Bibescu went to Paris and enrolled in Blériot's flying school where, in 1910, he obtained International Pilot License number 20. After returning from France, Bibescu organized the Cotroceni Piloting School in Bucharest where Mircea Zorileanu and Nicolae Capşa were licensed. On May 5, 1912, he founded the Romanian National Aeronautic League. Bibescu would later be instrumental in founding the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the international regulatory body for aeronautics. Between 1927 and 1930 he was its vice-president, and becoming president in 1930 and remaining so until 1941. Traian Vuia 2 Traian Vuia was a Romanian inventor and aviation pioneer. He constructed his first powered, fixed wing aircraft with wheeled undercarriage and in 1906 he flew short hops in it at Montesson near Paris, France. On March 18 he flew about 12 metres at a height of 1 foot, and on 19 August he flew for 24 metres.Traian I. Vuia at earlyaviators.com Although unsuccessful at true flight, Vuia's aircraft has been credited as \\"the first man-carrying monoplane of basically modern configuration\\" and influenced the more successful Brazilian pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont.Gibbs-Smith, Charles Harvard (3 April 1959).\\"Hops and Flights\\" Flight. p. 469 Vuia went on to experiment with another monoplane and two helicopters but none was successful. Aurel Vlaicu was born in Transylvania, then part of Austria-Hungary. Having constructed a glider with his brother, he moved to the Kingdom of Romania in 1909. His first aircraft, the Vlaicu I, was constructed at the Army Arsenal at Bucharest and first flown on 17 June 1910, a day still celebrated in Romania as National Aviation Day. Vlaicu later constructed two more aircraft, fatally crashing the second in 1913 before the third had flown. Henri Coandă exhibited the Coanda-1910 at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris around October 1910, and built his first flying aircraft in 1911. Later he worked in the UK to design aircraft for World War I, a number of Bristol- Coandă and Coandă monoplanes being purchased by the Romanian Army and Government. Coandă continued to research in a variety of fields. He is most famous for discovering the Coanda effect in aerodynamics and fluidics. =Early military aviation= The Romanian Army took an interest in aviation from the earliest days, facilitating the construction of the Vlaicu I in 1910. The next year the Army formed the Aviation Group, which over the next few years constructed Farman biplanes under license and also acquired two Blériot monoplanes, several Bristol-Coandă monoplanes and Two Morane Type F monoplanes. On 20 April 1913 it became the Corp al aernautlior permanenti – the Permanent Corps of Aeronauts. Three months later they engaged in reconnaissance sorties over the Bulgarian border at the start of the Second Balkan War.Green and Swanborough (1971). The Romanian Air Corps was established on 15 September 1915, at a time during the First World War when Romania was still neutral. That same year, even before Romania joined the Western Powers in 1916, it was supplied with 44 aircraft by France. During the ensuing defeat of Romanian forces, the Air Corps was chronically short of serviceable aircraft and supplies and was reorganised several times. After the World War, the Air Corps again saw action in the 1919 campaign to secure Transylvania from Hungary. By then the Air Corps was in a sorry state, but following the collapse of the Hungarian communist regime the Air Corps gained 87 captured aircraft. From then on the air arm grew steadily, changing its name in 1920 to the Aeronautica Militara Romana (Romanian Military Aviation) and in the 1930s to the Fortele Aeriene Regale ale Romaniei (Royal Air Forces of Romania, or FARR). Further aircraft were acquired from France and licensed production was set up at various centres. By the early 1930s Romanian aviation had advanced enough to produce its own designs and types such as the SET 10 fighter-trainer, IAR 15 and IAR 16 began to appear. However these were not yet judged adequate and for a period front line fighter squadrons were equipped with Polish PZL fighters, examples of which were both purchased and manufactured. In the late 1930s the FARR also significantly developed its bombing capabilities and the IAR 37 light reconnaissance bomber went into production. As World War II loomed in 1939, Romania found itself in a precarious position and made many treaties with its neighbours. One result of this was a change of supplier; a number of German aircraft were procured and IAR licensed production of the Junkers Jumo 211Da aero engine. In response Britain began supplying frontline aircraft, although only a few Hawker Hurricanes arrived in the few days left before hostilities would begin. =World War II= Following the outbreak of war and the German invasion of Poland, over 100 surviving aircraft of the Polish Air Force joined the FARR. However the increasing aggressiveness of the Axis powers Germany and Russia forced Romania to join them. Through 1940 and '41 the German presence and influence grew strongly. In June 1941, with the FARR operational strength at 504 aircraft, Romania joined Germany in the attack on the Soviet Union and the FARR was committed heavily in support. In March 1942 deliveries of the IAR 80 fighter began, and both this type and its derivative the IAR 81 joined front line operations. Following a long and bloody campaign, by the summer of 1943 emphasis was beginning to switch to the air defence of Romania and especially the oil wells and refineries which supplied Germany, the FARR giving a good account of itself during the American Operation Tidal Wave bombing raids. By now the FARR was operating a great mix of aircraft types, including more than 80 types of trainer. On 20 August 1944 the Soviets invaded Romania. Following a brief period of confusion, Romania changed sides and, once more allied with the Soviet Union, turned against its German occupiers. Although by now possessing less than 200 operational aircraft, the FARR joined in the attack on German forces. Despite chaotic conditions, exacerbated by the Soviet demand for Romanian mechanics to maintain their aircraft, IAR continued a low level of manufacture and the FARR began to rebuild its strength. But then in 1945 operations over Slovakia and against German and Hungarian forces reduced its strength once again, having just 10 operational combat squadrons remaining by the end of the war. =Postwar= In 1947 Romania became a republic and its air arm changed its name to the Fortele Aeriene ale Republicii Populare Romania, the Air Forces of the Romanian People's Republic or FR-RPR. From 1948 greater cooperation with Soviet forces began with the introduction of the Yakovlev Yak-11 trainer, and the ageing combat fleet progressively supplemented and replaced by more modern Soviet types. The first jet fighter arrived in the 1950s, in the form of the Yakovlev Yak-23. A process of expansion and modernization continued, and accelerated after Romania joined the Warsaw Pact in 1955. The supersonic age arrived during this period, with the introduction of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19. The expansion stopped after the withdrawal of the last Soviet forces in 1964, and the FR-RPR ended its participation in Warsaw Pact exercises. 1965 saw the introduction not only of the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighter but also the Czech Aero L-29 Delfin jet trainer. 1966 saw yet another name change accompanying Romania's establishment of a Socialist Republic, to the Fortele Aeriene ale Republicii Socialiste Romania – the Air Forces of the Romanian Socialist Republic or FR- RSR. The new FR-RSR went on to maintain and modernize its fleet, including the introduction of a variety of Mil helicopters, some of them Polish-built. In the 1970s Romania began once more to develop its own military aircraft including a joint Yugoslav-Romanian attack aircraft built in Romania as the IAR-93 Vultur, and the IAR-99 Şoim trainer – the first jet of wholly Romanian design. Helicopters such as the IAR 316 and IAR 330 were built under license from Aérospatiale, and the ROMBAC 1-11 passenger aircraft under license from BAC. =Astronautics= Dumitru Prunariu is the only Romanian astronaut who participated in a space mission (Soyuz 40 – May 14, 1981).

There are 16 commercial airports in service today, most of them opened for international traffic. Four of the airports (OTP, BBU, TSR, CND) have runways of in length and are capable of handling jumbo jets. Six of the airports (BCM, CRA, IAS, SBZ, SCV, SUJ) have runways of in length, while the rest of them have runways of in length. In 2011, the air traffic reached 10.7 million passengers, 5.1% more than the previous year when there were 10.2 million people flying by plane.European airport passengers up 7% in 2011 to over 1.6 billion at anna.aeroRomania: Air traffic to grow by 5 percent in 2011, up to 10.7 million passengers at aviationnews.us  Manufacturing  The industrial facilities for aircraft building and maintenance are located in Bacǎu (Aerostar), Braşov (Industria Aeronautică Română), Craiova (Avioane Craiova) and Bucharest (Romaero, Turbomecanica).  Future development  Following the ascending curve of the economy growth, the air transportation in Romania experiences a favorable trend. Carpatair is the Romanian airline with the most spectacular growth; the national carrier TAROM is recovering from a difficult period at the beginning of the 2000s, 2004 being the first profitable year in the last 10 years, but with a price: the cancellation of the long-haul flights to New York, Chicago, Montreal and Beijing. In 2006 the company started a fleet update program with the acquisition of 4 new Airbus A318 airplanes, 2 new ATR 72 turboprops in 2009 and two new Boeing 737-800 NG in 2017. The first Romanian low-cost airline, Blue Air, is going through a development phase, while other low-cost airlines are ready to start their operations. There are many investment projects also in airport infrastructure: the upgrading of the existing airports (major rehabilitation programs for OTP, TSR, CLJ, CND, the airports with the most significant traffic growth) and the construction of three new airports in Braşov, Galaţi – Brăila (a 600,000 inhabitants urban area without airport access) and Deva – Alba Iulia (Southern Transylvania). Currently (dec. 2006) the most advanced project is the construction of the new Braşov Airport , the construction site opening was planned for March 2007 but construction was halted. Construction restarted in April 2013. The project consists of a 1 mil. passengers/year terminal and a runway of 2,800 m long.

It is a private high school with a middle school subdivision, serving students in grades 6 through 12. The school occupies a sprawling campus near the geographic center of Irondequoit, just 1 mile from Lake Ontario, and 10 minutes away from downtown Rochester.  Origin and history  The school's dramatic facade, as photographed in the 1960s Bishop Kearney High School was co-founded by Blessed Edmund Rice and the Congregation of Christian Brothers of Ireland, with the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The school was named after Bishop James E. Kearney of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester. It opened in 1962, accepting only freshmen at the time. Those freshmen remained the school's upperclassmen throughout their tenure, so they became the first graduates in 1966. It was opened at the same time as a nearly identical sister school, Cardinal Mooney High School, which closed in 1989. Bishop Kearney's first principal was the late Joseph M. Clark, FSCH, of the Congregation of Christian Brothers of Ireland. Front view  Recent events  On February 13, 2007, the school announced that local billionaire B. Thomas Golisano would be donating a substantial amount to the school for improvements in technology. The money will allow the school to provide every student with a laptop computer, as well as fund a wireless network, digital projection systems, video conferencing systems, and interactive whiteboards, with the stated goal of making the school \\"the most technologically advanced high school\\" in the country. The school will also be making curriculum enhancements with its College Prep Plus, to \\"better prepare students for the working world,\\" including work-scholarship opportunities with local colleges and businesses. The donation has prompted the school to announce a pending name change, to \\"Bishop Kearney High School / A Golisano Education Partner.\\" On February 19, 2014 Tom Golisano offered to rescue the school's building from a bankruptcy filing by the founding Christian Brothers. Golisano offered $3.4 million to buy the 200,000-square-foot building and the 42 acres of surrounding property, with the stated intention of maintaining the school's existing educational mission. From 2015-2016, the school renovated the former dormatory space of the Irish Christian Brothers, on the third floor of the north half of the building. This was converted into residence space for an elite girls hockey program — with 21 dorms accommodating 42 players. The players room at and attend classes at Bishop Kearney, and participate in the hockey program — run through LEGACY Global Hockey — titled \\"Selects Academy at Bishop Kearney\\". The program launched in August 2016 with a 16-and-under team (U-16) team — followed by a U-19 team in 2017 — each with about 20 girls. The program recruits players from across the United States and Canada, and play their season from September to March, and competes against teams nationally (not through Section V Athletics).

Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 148. History He first appeared in The Patchwork Girl of Oz. Ojo is a Munchkin who lived with his uncle, Unc Nunkie in the Blue Forest, a remote location in the north of the Munchkin Country. During a trip with his uncle to visit his uncle's friend Dr. Pipt, Ojo learns from Pipt's wife, Dame Margolotte, that he is known to others as \\"Ojo the Unlucky.\\" Ojo discovers rationalizations for this, including the fact that he was born on Friday the 13th, is left-handed, and has a wart under his arm, and he begins to believe that bad luck follows him wherever he goes. However, the Tin Woodman officially deems him Ojo the Lucky after hearing these reasons because he believes Ojo's bad luck is due to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Ojo later starred in his own book, Ojo in Oz by Ruth Plumly Thompson. In this book, Thompson picked up a dropped thread of Baum's about Ojo being possibly related to royalty and made him the Prince of Seebania, whose family was enchanted by an evil sorcerer named Mooj, causing his father, King Ree Alla Bad, to run around Oz as a bandit called Realbad. Although Ojo is a Munchkin, he seems to be taller than the Munchkins Dorothy met during her first trip to Oz, though this is never stated. It is usually surmised from a passage in which Dr. Pipt refers to Ojo getting \\"taller,\\" though only the comparative form of the word is used.

They are used to remove organic compounds, either to improve clarity or adjust flavor or aroma. The removed compounds may be sulfides, proteins, polyphenols, benzenoids, or copper ions. Unless they form a stable sediment in the final container, the spent finings are usually discarded from the beverage along with the target compounds that they capture. Substances used as finings include egg whites, blood, milk, isinglass, and Irish moss. These are still used by some producers, but more modern substances have also been introduced and are more widely used, including bentonite, gelatin, casein, carrageenan, alginate, diatomaceous earth, pectinase, pectolyase, PVPP, kieselsol (colloidal silica), copper sulfate, dried albumen (egg whites), hydrated yeast, and activated carbon. Actions Their actions may be broadly categorized as either electrostatic, adsorbent, ionic, or enzymatic. The electrostatic types comprise the vast majority; including all but activated carbon, fining yeast, PVPP, copper sulfate, pectinase and pectolase. Their purpose is to selectively remove proteins, tannins (polyphenolics) and coloring particles (melanoidins). They must be used as a batch technique, as opposed to flow-through processing methods such as filters. Their particles each have an electric charge which is attracted to the oppositely charged particles of the colloidal dispersion that they are breaking. The result is that the two substances become bound as a stable complex; their net charge becoming neutral. Thus the agglomeration of a semi-solid follows, which may be separated from the beverage either as a floating or settled mass. The only adsorbent types of finings in use are activated carbon and specialized fining yeasts. Although activated carbon may be implemented as a flow-through filter, it is also commonly utilized as a batch ingredient, which later must be separated and discarded from the beverage. It can completely/partially remove benzenoid compounds and all classes of polyphenols non-specifically, decolorizing and deodorizing juices and wines. Traditionally, yeast fining has involved the addition of hydrated yeasts used as adsorption agents. Consisting of approximately 30% protein, yeast cell walls have a chemical affinity with wine compounds, such as those that may be polyphenolic or metallic. Indeed, yeast fining is a practical means of removing excess copper ions (greater than 0.5 mg/L) when copper sulfate is used to bind selected volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs).Wine/Enology Notes #85, by Bruce Zoecklein, 22 Jan 2004, Virginia Cooperative Extension Service The ionic finings are copper sulfate and PVPP. When dissolved in aqueous beverages, copper sulfate's copper ions can chemically bind undesirable sulfides. The resulting complexes must be removed by other finings. The action of PVPP appears to be through the formation of hydrogen bonds between its carbonyl groups and the phenolic hydrogens of the polyphenols. It attracts the low molecular weight polyphenols rather than the condensed tannins and leucanthocyanins that are removed by gelatin.Fining & Clarifying Agents, by Terry Rayner The enzymatic finings are pectin and pectinase. They aid in destroying the large polysaccharide molecule named pectin, which otherwise causes haze in fruit wines and juices. They are among the few finings that are added before juices are fermented. Nutritional and vegetarian concerns Unfortunately, beneficial antioxidant flavonoids are removed by some finings. Quercetin is removed from red wines via the finings gelatin, casein, and PVPP to reduce astringent flavors. If other fining methods are used, the quercetin remains in the wine. Similarly the catechin flavonoids are removed by PVPP and other finings that target polyphenolic compounds. In the absence of \\"animal products used here\\" labels, vegetarians and vegans may be unaware that the processing of a commercially produced beverage may have utilized animal based finings: either gelatin, casein, albumen, or isinglass. Luckily, more and more winemakers are labelling their wine as vegetarian or vegan friendly, as are supermarkets with their own brand wines. There are also good resources such as http://www.barnivore.com/ that let you check if your beverage if vegan. Additionally, there are specialist vegan wine merchants popping up (such as www.veganwinebox.co.uk in the UK), so it is getting easier to know if your wine contains animal derived finings.

Jančić (born Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia) is a Bosnian Serb pianist. He was educated at Primary and Secondary Music School. He gave his first recital at the age of twelve. He was also educated at the Zagreb Academy of Music (Croatia) and graduated with First Class Honours in Music Performances. He subsequently completed his Postgraduate Studies (MA) at the end of 1983. Jancic’s music and teaching have a living pulse directly linked with former pupils of Franz Liszt through his piano teacher Pavica Gvozdić, whose predecessor Svetislav Stančić studied with Liszt’s pupils Y. Barth and Conrad Ansorge in Berlin. Jancic also took part in master classes conducted by Evgeny Timakin, Rudolf Kerrer, Arbo Valdma, Leonid Brunberg and Pierre Barbisett, prominent figures within 20th century’s Russian and French school of thought 1979-1982. Jancic became Professor of Piano Studies at the Academy of Music in Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and was one of the last staff to continue teaching despite of the war. At great personal risk he continued to give performances during the siege of Sarajevo until he left the city in the spring 1993. \\"It was experience of a lifetime to teach and perform in such life threatening conditions,\\" he said. Jancic’s competitions successes include winning First Prize in the 13th Competitions for Young Musicians of Yugoslavia 1979, than the First Prize in The Greatest Musical Talent Competition. His many awards include Outstanding European Musician and the Croatian Institute of Music Awards for the Best Interpretation of Beethoven (Sonata op. 110 in A flat major). He was also finalist at the International Pianists Competition in Udine – Italy. Jancic was frequently invited to participate in major music festivals within his native homeland including Ohrid and Dubrovnik International Music Festivals. His engagements included numerous performances as a soloist with the leading orchestras there. He was the first among his peers to perform complete cycles of works by Frédéric Chopin (4 Ballades, 24 Etudes op. 10 and op. 25, the Waltzes, 21 Nocturnes, 4 Rondos) and Isaac Albéniz's (Suite española). The audiences of the former Yugoslavia were also treated to the first performance ever of the complete cycle by Enrique Granados – Goyescas. His other engagements also included solo recitals and tours in Germany, Italy, France, Ireland, United Kingdom and Denmark. He has entranced audiences internationally with his sensitive and versatile playing and received rapturous critical acclaim. Critics have cited his rich, warm tones, his magnificent dynamism and his exquisite sensitivity to the nuances of the music he performs. His affinity with the music of Ravel, Debussy and Franck has merited commendations from the acclaimed Marcelle de la Cour, Director of the Conservatoire Superiere de Musique in Paris. It is only by his performances that one can unequivocally appreciate the true talent he has to offer the music world. He is currently teaching at Faculty of Arts in the city of Niš, Serbia, and he is also head of piano department.

He is a five-string banjo player in the bluegrass music scene since the 1960s, founder of the Country Cooking and Hot Rize bands, Grammy nominee and educator, with several instruction books and videos on banjo and bluegrass, and a network of bluegrass jamming teachers called The Wernick Method. He served from 1986 to 2001 as the first president of the International Bluegrass Music Association. Wernick is also an outspoken atheist and humanist, and at one time led a secular humanist \\"congregation\\" in Boulder, Colorado. Biography Pete Wernick was born in New York City and began playing the banjo at the age of fourteen. He pursued studies at Columbia University, hosting New York City's only bluegrass radio program in the 1960s on WKCR-FM and earning a Ph.D. in sociology, thus the moniker \\"Dr. Banjo\\". In 1970 while working at Cornell University, he formed Country Cooking in Ithaca, New York together with Tony Trischka, Russ Barenberg, John Miller, and Nondi Leonard. They recorded four albums for Rounder Records, adding the talents of Kenny Kosek, Harry Gilmore (later known as Lou Martin), and Andy Statman, among others. In 1976, Wernick and his wife Nondi Leonard (now known as Joan Wernick), settled in Niwot, Colorado and with Tim O'Brien began to develop \\"Niwot Music\\", consisting only of banjo, mandolin and bass. The music was showcased on his 1977 solo album \\"Dr. Banjo Steps Out\\". In January 1978, with O'Brien, Charles Sawtelle, and Mike Scap, he started the bluegrass band Hot Rize. Nick Forster replaced Scap in May, 1978, completing the band's classic lineup that recorded and performed nationally and internationally full-time for 12 years, through April, 1990. Hot Rize recorded many Wernick-penned originals, including the standard \\"Just Like You\\", and instrumentals \\"Gone Fishing\\" and \\"Powwow the Indian Boy\\". After disbanding as a full-time unit, the group continued with several performances a year until 1998, the year before Sawtelle's death. Currently leading the bluegrass/jazz combo Flexigrass, and a sometime member of the Colorado bluegrass band Long Road Home, he also performs with his wife Joan (\\"Dr. and Nurse Banjo\\") and with Hot Rize for limited tours and music festivals. In 1986 the Board of the newly formed IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) elected Wernick its first president, a position he held until 2001. Wernick was one of the members of the short-lived bluegrass supergroup Men with Banjos who Know How to Use Them, a group that included Steve Martin and Earl Scruggs among its other members. In 2010, the Wernicks became the first Americans to tour in Russia as a bluegrass act, performing at the first annual Russian bluegrass festival in Vologda and Semenkovo, and in St. Petersburg. The duet has also performed in recent years in Ireland, England, Denmark, Israel, the Czech Republic, Germany, Switzerland, and Holland. Wernick is a prominent teacher of bluegrass, having hosted over 200 music camps since 1980 and still conducting several each year. After starting as banjo camps, since 1999 the camps have focused mostly on bluegrass jamming for all bluegrass instruments. Wernick has produced 10 instructional videos for Homespun and his books \\"Bluegrass Banjo\\" and \\"Bluegrass Songbook\\" have together sold over a third of a million copies. He also co-authored in 1987 with Tony Trischka, the encyclopedic \\"Masters of the Five String Banjo\\". Since 1999 his website, DrBanjo.com has presented many instruction articles and an Ask Dr. Banjo section. In 2010 Wernick created The Wernick Method, a national network of bluegrass teachers he certifies to teach bluegrass jamming. As of 2020, Wernick Method teachers have conducted 900 classes in 46 states and 11 countries, registering over 10,000 students. Wernick is also a survivor of the United Airlines Flight 232 air disaster. He composed a song inspired by that incident, called \\"A Day In '89 (You Never Know)\\", however has not released a recording of it yet.

A team of 15 smokejumpers parachuted into the area on the afternoon of August 5, 1949, to fight the fire, rendezvousing with a former smokejumper who was employed as a fire guard at the nearby campground. As the team approached the fire to begin fighting it, unexpected high winds caused the fire to suddenly expand, cutting off the men's route and forcing them back uphill. During the next few minutes, a \\"blow-up\\" of the fire covered in ten minutes, claiming the lives of 13 firefighters, including 12 of the smokejumpers. Only three of the smokejumpers survived. The fire would continue for five more days before being controlled. The United States Forest Service drew lessons from the tragedy of the Mann Gulch fire by designing new training techniques and safety measures that developed how the agency approached wildfire suppression. The agency also increased emphasis on fire research and the science of fire behavior. University of Chicago English professor and author Norman Maclean (1902–1990) researched the fire and its behavior for his book, Young Men and Fire (1992) which was published after his death. Maclean, who worked northwestern Montana in logging camps and for the forest service in his youth, recounted the events of the fire and ensuing tragedy and undertook a detailed investigation of the fire's causes. Young Men and Fire won the National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction in 1992. The 1952 film Red Skies of Montana, starring actor Richard Widmark and directed by Joseph M. Newman, was loosely based on the events of the Mann Gulch fire. The location of the Mann Gulch fire was included as a historical district on the United States National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 1999.  Sequence of events  The fire started when lightning struck the south side of Mann Gulch at the Gates of the Mountains, a canyon over five miles long that cuts through a series of 1,200 foot cliffs. The place was noted and named by Lewis and Clark on their journey west in 1805. The fire was spotted by forest ranger James O. Harrison around noon on August 5, 1949. Harrison, a college student at Montana State University, was working the summer as recreation and fire prevention guard for the Meriwether Canyon Campground. He had been a smokejumper the previous year but had given it up because of the danger. As a ranger, he still had a responsibility to watch for and help fight fires, but it was not his primary role. On this day, he fought the fire on his own for four hours before he met the crew of smokejumpers who had been dispatched from Hale Field, Missoula, Montana, in a Douglas DC-3. It was hot, with a temperature of 97 °F, and the fire danger rating was high, rated 74 out of a possible 100. Wind conditions were turbulent. The plane flight was especially rough. One smokejumper got sick on the way and did not jump, returning with the airplane to Hale Field. Getting off the plane, he resigned from the smokejumpers. The remaining 15 smokejumpers parachuted into an open area at the top of the gulch. Below them, they could see the fire burning on the south ridge further down toward the Missouri River. Gear and individual jumpers were scattered widely due to the conditions. Their radio was destroyed after its parachute failed to open. After the smokejumpers had landed, a shout was heard coming from the front of the fire. The foreman, Wagner \\"Wag\\" Dodge, went out ahead to find the person shouting and to scout the fire. He left instructions for the team to finish gathering their equipment and eat, and then to cross the gully to the south slope and advance to the front of the fire. The voice turned out to be Jim Harrison who had been fighting the fire by himself for the past four hours. The two headed back up the gulch with Dodge noting that one could not get closer to within 100 feet of the fire due to the heat. The crew met Dodge and Harrison about half way to the fire. Dodge instructed the team to move off the front of the fire, and instead move down the gulch and cross over to the thinly-forested and grass-covered north slope of the gulch; \\"sidehilling\\" (keeping the same contour or elevation) and moving \\"down gulch\\" towards the Missouri River. They could then fight the fire from the flank and steer it to a low-fuel area. Dodge returned with Harrison to the supply area at the top of the gulch. The two stopped there to eat. From the high vantage point, Dodge noticed the smoke along the fire front boiling up indicating an intensification of the heat of the fire. He and Harrison headed down the gulch to catch up with the crew. =The \\"blow up\\"= Mann Gulch today, north slope on the left side of photo By the time Dodge reached his men, the fire at the bottom of the gulch had already jumped from the south ridge to the bottom of the north slope. The intense heat, combined with wind coming off the river, pushed the flames up-gulch into the dry grass of the north slope causing what fire fighters call a \\"blow up\\". Various side ridges running down the north slope obscured the crew's view, so they could not see the conditions further down the gulch, and they initially continued down toward the fire. When Dodge finally got a glimpse of what was happening below, he turned the men around and started them angling back up the gulch. Within a couple hundred yards, he ordered the men to drop packs and heavy tools (Pulaskis, shovels and crosscut saws): > Dodge's order was to throw away just their packs and heavy tools, but to his > surprise some of them had already thrown away all of their heavy equipment. > On the other hand, some of them wouldn't abandon their heavy tools, even > after Dodge's order. Diettert, one of the most intelligent of the crew, > continued carrying both his tools until Rumsey caught up with him, took his > shovel and leaned it against a pine tree. Just a little further on, Rumsey > and Sallee pass the recreation guard, Jim Harrison, who, having been on the > fire all afternoon, was now exhausted. He was sitting with his heavy pack on > and was making no effort to take it off By this point, the fire was moving extremely fast up the 76% north slope (37.23 degree slope) of Mann gulch and Dodge realized they would not be able to make the ridge line in front of the fire. With the fire less than a hundred yards behind, he took a match out and set fire to the grass just before them. In doing so, he was attempting to create an escape fire to lie in so that the main fire would burn around him and his crew. In the back draft of the main fire, the grass fire set burned straight up toward the ridge above. Turning to the three men by him – Robert Sallee, Walter Rumsey and Eldon Diettert – Dodge said \\"Up this way\\", but the men misunderstood him. The three ran straight up for the ridge crest, moving up along the far edge of Dodge's fire. Sallee later said he wasn't sure what Dodge was doing, and thought perhaps he intended the fire to act as a buffer between the men and the main fire. It was not until he got to the ridge crest and looked back down that he realized what Dodge had intended. As the rest of the crew came up, Dodge tried to direct them through the fire he had set and into the center burnt out area. Dodge later stated that someone, possibly squad leader William Hellman, said \\"To hell with that, I'm getting out of here\\". The rest of the team raced past Dodge up the slope toward the hogback of Mann Gulch ridge, hoping they had enough time to get through the rock ridge line to safer ground on the other side. None of the men trying to outrun the fire entered the area Dodge had burned. = Immediate outcome = Four of the men reached the ridge crest, but only two, Bob Sallee and Walter Rumsey, managed to escape through a crevice or deep fissure in the rock ridge to reach the other side. In the dense smoke of the fire, the two had no way of knowing if the crevice they found actually \\"went through\\" to the other side or would be a blind trap. Diettert had been just to the right, slightly upgulch of Sallee and Rumsey, but he did not drop back to the crevice and continued on up the right side of the hogback. He did not find another escape route and was overtaken by the fire. Sallee and Rumsey came through the hogback to the ridge crest above what became known as Rescue Gulch. Dropping down off the ridge, they managed to find a rock slide with little to no vegetation. They waited there for the fire to overtake them, moving from the bottom of the slide to the top as the fire moved past. Hellman was caught by the fire on the top of the ridge and was badly burned. Though he and Joseph Sylvia initially survived the fire, they suffered heavy injuries and both died in the hospital the next day. Wag Dodge entered the charred center of the escape fire he had built and survived the intensely burning main fire. In Young Men and Fire, Maclean stated that when the fire passed over Dodge's position, \\"he was lifted off the ground two or three times.\\" Later researchers repeated the claim. However, this statement was an exaggeration. Dodge actually wrote, in his statement to the board of review, \\"There were three extreme gusts of hot air that almost lifted me from the ground as the fire passed over\\" In another description of Dodge's ordeal, John Maclean said, \\"as the main fire passed, it [the fire] picked him up and shook him like a dog with a bone.\\" Although Young Men and Fire attributed the story to Earl Cooley, the spotter and kicker aboard the airplane, it actually originated with C.E. \\"Mike\\" Hardy, who was the head of the litter bearers collecting the bodies the day after the disaster. Hardy assisted Norman Maclean in his research and accompanied him on a trip to the site. It was originally thought that the unburned patches underneath the bodies indicated they had suffocated for lack of air before the fire caught them. This is another fallacy. In modern fire science, the unburned patches are called protected areas. The firefighters' bodies protected these areas by shielding from the intense thermal radiation, by keeping out hot gases, and absorbing heat. All of these factors kept the grass and forest litter unburned where they were lying. It is now known that death by smoke and toxic gas inhalation, while common in structure fires because of the confined atmosphere, is virtually nonexistent among wildland fire fatalities. = Timing = The events described above all transpired in a relatively short period of time. Everyone had jumped by around 4:10 p.m. The scattered cargo had been gathered at about 5:00 p.m. At about 5:45 p.m., the crew had seen the fire coming up towards them on the north slope and had turned to run. By 5:56, the fire had swept over them. The time at which the fire engulfed the men was judged by the melted hands on Harrison's pocketwatch, forever frozen at 5:56 p.m. by the intense heat. Studies estimated that the fire covered 3,000 acres in 10 minutes during this blow-up stage, an hour and 45 minutes after they had arrived. Thirteen firefighters died, with eleven killed in the fire itself and two who sustained fatal burns. Only three of the sixteen survived.  Findings  = Casualties = Memorial cross marking the spot where smokejumper Joseph B. Sylvia was fatally burned while fleeing the advancing wildfire—13 memorial markers are located on the steep hillside. Those that were killed by the fire: *Robert J.

Rumsey died in an airplane crash in 1980, age 52. *Robert W. Sallee, youngest man on the crew, age 17 at time of the fire, from Willow Creek, Montana. Last survivor of the smoke jumpers. Died May 29, 2014. Much controversy surrounded Foreman Dodge and the fire he lit to escape. In answering the questions of the Forest Service Review Board as to why he took the actions he did, Dodge stated he had never heard of such a fire being set; it had just seemed \\"logical\\" to him. In fact, it was not a method that the forest service had considered, nor would it work in the intense heat of the normal tall growth forest fires that they typically fought. Similar types of escape fires had been used by the plains Indians to escape the fast-moving, brief duration grass fires of the plains, and the method had been written about by James Fenimore Cooper (1827) in The Prairie, but in this case Foreman Dodge appears to have invented it on the spot, as the only means available to him to save his crew. None of the men realized what it was and only Dodge was saved by it. Earl Cooley was the spotter/kicker the morning of the August 5, 1949 Mann Gulch fire jump. Cooley was the first Smokejumper to jump on an operational fire jump. The first jump was a two-man jump, and was performed on July 12, 1940. Mr. Cooley was the airborne supervisor who directed the crew of smokejumpers who dropped in to fight the Mann Gulch fire. In the 1950s Mr. Cooley served as the smokejumper base superintendent and was the first president of the National Smokejumper Association. Mr. Cooley died November 9, 2009, at age 98. The C-47/DC-3, registration number NC24320, was the only smokejumper plane available at Hale Field, near the current location of Sentinel High School, on August 5, 1949, when the call came in seeking 25 smokejumpers to fight a blaze in a hard-to-reach area of the Helena National Forest. The C-47/DC-3 could only hold 16 jumpers and their equipment. Even though more help was needed, fire bosses decided not to wait for a second plane, and instead sent No. NC24320 out on its own. NC24320 flew with Johnson Flying Service from Hale Field in Missoula, Montana and was used to drop Smokejumpers as well as for other operations for which Johnson Flying Service held contracts. The C-47/DC-3 that carried the smokejumpers that day was later placed on exhibit in Missoula at the Museum of Mountain Flying. The aircraft was restored as a memorial to the Smokejumpers and the Fire Guard that lost their lives at Mann Gulch on August 5, 1949. It was made airworthy and flown to France in 2019 as part of the D-Day 75th anniversary commemorations with a flight to Normandy. On August 5th, 2019 The Miss Montana flew back over Mann Gulch on the 70th Anniversary of the fire and dropped wreaths for the 13 brave men lost. = Aftermath = Commemorative sign at Mann Gulch Four hundred fifty men fought for five more days to get the fire under control, which had spread to 4,500 acres (1,800 ha). Wagner Dodge survived unharmed and died five years later of Hodgkin's disease. Thirteen crosses were erected to mark the locations where the thirteen firefighters who died fighting the Mann Gulch fire fell. However, one of the smokejumpers who died in the Mann Gulch fire was David Navon, who was Jewish. In 2001 the cross marking the location where Navon died was replaced with a marker bearing a Star of David. Several months following the fire, fire scientist Harry Gisborne, from the U.S. Forest Service Research Center at Priest River, came to examine the damage. Despite a history of heart problems, he nevertheless conducted an on-ground survey of the fire site. He suffered a heart attack and died while finishing the day's research. Gisborne had forwarded theories as to the cause of the blowup prior to his arrival on site. Once there, he discovered several conditions, which caused him to change his concepts of fire activity, particularly those pertaining to fire \\"blow-ups\\". He noted this to his companion just before his death on November 9, 1949. There was some controversy about the fire, with a few parents of the men trying to sue the government. One charge was that the \\"escape fire\\" had actually burned the men. Lessons learned from the Mann Gulch fire had a significant effect on firefighter training. Two training protocols—\\"Ten Standard Firefighting Orders\\" and \\"Eighteen Situations That Shout Watch Out\\"—were incorporated into Forest Service firefighter training program, and safety training made mandatory to achieve certification to work on a fire line. However, the training methodology proved inadequate and the tragedy would be repeated twice, in the 1990 Dude fire in Arizona, which killed six firefighters, and in the 1994 South Canyon Fire in Colorado, in which 14 firefighters died. A primary factor in the latter appeared to be surprise of the sudden transition from surface fire to crown fire, leading to the development and adoption of LCES, an acronym for a four-point safety procedure to increase observance of the previous training protocols. LCES consists of posting lookouts, providing all firefighters radio communication with lookouts, identifying escape routes, and designating valid safety zones, and ensuring that all members of the process, from \\"hotshot\\" crews to seasonal Type 2 crew volunteers to \\"crew bosses\\", understand and follow its tenets. = Contributing factors = Several factors that combined to create the disaster are described in Norman Maclean's book Young Men and Fire. * Slope – Fire spreads faster up a slope, and the north slope of Mann Gulch was about a 75% incline. Slope also makes it very difficult to run. * Fuel – Fire spreads fast in dry grass. The north slope of Mann Gulch was mostly knee high cheatgrass, an especially volatile fuel, and the entire area had been left ungrazed because it had been recently designated a wildlife area and closed to local cattle. * Leadership – Dodge did not know most of the crew, as he had been doing base maintenance work during the normal training and \\"get acquainted\\" time of the season. This may have contributed to the crew not trusting his \\"escape fire.\\" Furthermore, Dodge left his crew for several minutes, during which the second-in-command let them spread out instead of staying together. * Communication – The crew's single radio broke because its parachute failed to open. It could have possibly prevented the disaster or helped get aid more quickly to the two burned men who died later. There were other dangerous fires going on at the same time and Forest Service leaders did not know what was happening on Mann Gulch. * Weather – The season was very dry and that day was extremely hot. Winds in the Gulch were also strong \\"up gulch'\\" the same direction in which the men tried to run.  Young Men and Fire  Mann Gulch, looking southeast from Missouri River. The fire came down off the near end of the ridge on the right into the gulch and \\"blew up\\", overtaking the fleeing smokejumper crew on the west side. The Mann Gulch Fire was the subject of Norman Maclean's book Young Men and Fire,Norman Maclean, Young Men and Fire (excerpt), 1992. Retrieved February 28, 2007. which was published after his death. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction in 1992. Norman Maclean's son John wrote a book in 2003 titled Fire and Ashes: On the Front Lines Battling Wildfires, and it also includes a section on the Mann Gulch fire. In 2004, John N. Maclean also published an article called \\"Fire and Ashes: The Last Survivor of the Mann Gulch Fire,\\" in Montana: The Magazine of Western History. The article was adapted from the Mann Gulch section of his book, in which he interviewed Bob Sallee, the last remaining survivor of the fire. Folk songs James Keelaghan wrote a song about this fire entitled \\"Cold Missouri Waters\\" after being inspired by Young Men and Fire. The song was covered by Richard Shindell, Dar Williams, and Lucy Kaplansky on their album Cry Cry Cry. It was also covered by Hank Cramer in his album, Days Gone By. It was again recorded by Paul McKenna Band on their 2012 album ”Elements” and by Wolf Loescher on his 2020 album \\"Sheep's Clothing\\". A cover version also appears on the 2014 album ”The Call”, by Greg Russell and Ciaran Algar. In 2016, Irish singer Pauline Scanlon covered the song on her album Gossamer. It is sung from the perspective of foreman Dodge, lying on his deathbed dying of Hodgkin's disease five years after the fire. It imagines Dodge saying of his decision to set the escape fire: \\"I don't know why, I just thought it. I struck a match to waist-high grass, running out of time. Tried to tell them, 'Step into this fire I set. We can't make it, this is the only chance you'll get.' But they cursed me, ran for the rocks above instead. I lay face down and prayed above the cold Missouri waters.\\" Ross Brown, a musician/songwriter from Townsend, MT (about 35 miles south of Helena) wrote another song entitled \\"The Mann Gulch.\\" A scratch version of this song is available on YouTube. The song also has been recorded on Black Irish Band's album \\"Into the Fire\\" released in 2007. The album is all songs about firefighters. The album also features Michael Martin Murphey. Underneath Montana Skies is another song about the Mann Gulch fire written by Patrick Michael Karnahan also on this album. The song was revived as a tribute to the 19 firefighters who died in the massive Yarnell Hill Fire near Yarnell, Arizona in 2013.

However, a permanent member's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted. This veto power does not apply to \\"procedural\\" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors. The veto power is controversial. Supporters regard it as a promoter of international stability, a check against military interventions, and a critical safeguard against US domination. Critics say that the veto is the most undemocratic element of the UN, as well as the main cause of inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity, as it effectively prevents UN action against the permanent members and their allies.  UN Charter  The veto power originates in Article 27 of the United Nations Charter, which states: # Each member of the Security Council shall have a vote. # Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members. # Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VI, and under paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting.UN Charter, Article 27, as amended in 1965. Before that date, Articles 27(2) and (3) had specified the affirmative votes of seven members. The change was part of the process whereby the size of the Council was increased from 11 to 15 members. A negative vote from any of the permanent members will block the adoption of a draft resolution. However, a permanent member that abstains or is absent from the vote will not block a resolution from being passed. Although the \\"power of veto\\" is not mentioned by name in the UN Charter, Article 27 requires concurring votes from the permanent members. For this reason, the \\"power of veto\\" is also referred to as the principle of \\"great power unanimity\\" and the veto itself is sometimes referred to as the \\"great power veto\\".  Origins  The idea of countries having a veto over the actions of international organisations was not new in 1945. In the League of Nations, every member of the League Council had a veto on any non-procedural issue.League of Nations Covenant, Article 5(1). At the foundation of the League, there were 4 permanent and 4 non-permanent members. The League Council had expanded by 1936 to have 4 permanent and 11 non- permanent members, which meant that there were 15 countries with veto power. The existence of such a large number of vetoes made it very difficult for the League to agree on many issues. The veto was the result of extensive discussion during the negotiations for the formation of the United Nations at Dumbarton Oaks (August–October 1944) and Yalta (February 1945). The evidence is that the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and China all favored the principle of unanimity, not only out of desire for the major powers to act together, but also to protect their own sovereign rights and national interests.See e.g. Winston S. Churchill, The Second World War, vol. 6: Triumph and Tragedy, Cassell, London, 1954, pp. 181–2 and 308-13; Harry S. Truman, Year of Decisions: 1945 (London, 1955), pp. 194–5, 201, and 206-7; Charles de Gaulle, War Memoirs: Salvation 1944–1946 – Documents, tr. Murchie and Erskine (London, 1960), pp. 94–5. Harry S. Truman, who became President of the United States in April 1945, wrote: \\"All our experts, civil and military, favored it, and without such a veto no arrangement would have passed the Senate.\\"Truman, Year of Decisions: 1945, p. 207. See also US Department of State: \\"The United States and the Founding of the United Nations\\". October 2005. Retrieved 1 March 2012. At San Francisco, the Big Five made it clear that there would be no United Nations if they weren't given the veto. Francis O. Wilcox, an adviser to the US delegation, described the dramatic negotiations: \\"At San Francisco, the issue was made crystal clear by the leaders of the Big Five: it was either the Charter with the veto or no Charter at all. Senator Connally [from the US delegation] dramatically tore up a copy of the Charter during one of his speeches and reminded the small states that they would be guilty of that same if they opposed the unanimity principle. \\"You may, if you wish,\\" he said, \\"go home from this Conference and say that you have defeated the veto. But what will be your answer when you are asked: 'Where is the Charter'?\\"II. The Yalta Voting Formula, Author(s): Francis O. Wilcox, Source: The American Political Science Review, Vol. 39, No. 5 (Oct. 1945), pp. 943–956 Retrieved 5 May 2015 17:13 UTC  Usage  = History = The usage of the veto has gone through several distinct phases, reflecting the shifting political balance on the Security Council. From 1946 to 1969, a majority of the Security Council was aligned with the United States, which cast no vetoes because it won every vote. To block resolutions from the Western majority, the Soviet Union cast of all the vetoes. France and the United Kingdom occasionally used the veto to protect their colonial interests, and the Republic of China only used the veto once. The Western majority eroded through the 1960s as decolonization expanded the membership of the United Nations. The newly independent countries of the Third World frequently voted against the Western powers, which led the United States to resort to the veto. After the first United States veto in 1970, the Soviet ambassador declared, \\"Using your automatic majority you imposed your will on others and forced it down their throats. But times have now changed.\\" From 1970 to 1991, The United States cast of the vetoes, sometimes joined by French and British vetoes. The Soviet Union cast fewer vetoes than any of the Western powers, and the People's Republic of China used the veto only once. After the end of the Cold War, there was a brief period of harmony on the Security Council. The period from 31 May 1990 to 11 May 1993 was the longest period in the history of the UN without the use of the veto. The number of resolutions passed each year also increased. Usage of the veto picked up in the early 21st century, most notably due to the Syrian Civil War. Since 1992, Russia has been the most frequent user of the veto, followed by the United States and China. France and the United Kingdom have not used the veto since 1989. As of July 2020, Russia/USSR has used its veto 116 times, United States 81 times, UK 29 times, France 16 times and China 16 times. = Subjects = = Secretary-General selection = The Secretary-General of the United Nations is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council. Therefore, the veto power can be used to block the selection of a Secretary-General. Since 1981, the Security Council has selected the Secretary-General through series of straw polls. A vote by a permanent member to \\"discourage\\" a candidate is considered equivalent to a veto. The formal recommendation of a Secretary-General is approved unanimously by acclamation. Although the identity of the vetoing permanent member is usually known, the veto does not go on the record as a formal veto of a Security Council Resolution. Every permanent member has vetoed at least one candidate for Secretary-General. The United States circumvented a Soviet veto in 1950 by asking the General Assembly to extend Trygve Lie's term without a recommendation from the Security Council. However, every Secretary-General since 1953 has been recommended by a unanimous vote of the permanent members of the Security Council.  Analysis by country  = China (ROC/PRC) = Between 1946 and 1971, the Chinese seat on the Security Council was held by the Republic of China, whose Nationalist government lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and evacuated to Taiwan. During that time, its representative used the veto only once to block Mongolia's application for membership in 1955, because the ROC considered the entirety of Mongolia to be part of China. This postponed the admission of Mongolia until 1961, when the Soviet Union announced that it would block all further admissions of new members unless Mongolia were admitted. Faced with this pressure, the Republic of China relented under protest. In 1971, the Republic of China was expelled from the United Nations, and the Chinese seat was transferred to the People's Republic of China. China first used the veto on 25 August 1972 to block Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations. From 1971 to 2011, China used its veto sparingly, preferring to abstain rather than veto resolutions not directly related to Chinese interests. China turned abstention into an \\"art form,\\" abstaining on 30% of Security Council Resolutions between 1971 and 1976. Since the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, China has joined Russia in many double-vetoes. China has not cast a lone veto since 1999. = Soviet Union/Russia = In the early days of the United Nations, the Soviet Union was responsible for almost all of the vetoes. Because of their frequent vetoes, Soviet ambassador Andrei Gromyko earned the nickname Mr. Nyet and Vyacheslav Molotov was known as Mr. Veto. Molotov regularly vetoed the admission of new members to counter the US refusal to admit members of the Eastern Bloc. The impasse was finally resolved on 14 December 1955 when 16 countries from the Western and Eastern Blocs were simultaneously admitted to the UN. The Soviet government adopted an \\"empty chair\\" policy at the Security Council in January 1950 to protest the fact that the Republic of China still held the Chinese seat at the United Nations.Malanczuk, P. Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law, Ed. 7, page 375, Routledge, 1997 The Soviet Union was not present in the Security Council to veto UN Security Council Resolutions 83 (27 June 1950) and 84 (7 July 1950), authorising assistance to South Korea in the Korean War. The Soviet Union returned to the Security Council in August 1950 and resumed its usage of the veto. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation used its veto power sparingly. However, Russian vetoes became more common in the early 21st century to block resolutions on conflicts with Russian military involvement, including Georgia, Syria and Ukraine. = France = France uses its veto power sparingly. The last time it unilaterally vetoed a draft was in 1976 to block a resolution on the question of the independence of the Comoros, which was done to keep the island of Mayotte as a French overseas community. It also vetoed, along with UK, a resolution calling on the immediate cessation of military action by the Israeli army against Egypt in 1956 during the Suez Crisis. France has not used the veto since 1989, when it joined the United States and United Kingdom to veto a resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama. In 2003, the threat of a French veto of resolution on the impending invasion of Iraq caused friction between France and the United States. = United Kingdom = The United Kingdom has used its Security Council veto power on 32 occasions. The first occurrence was in October 1956 when the United Kingdom and France vetoed a letter from the USA to the President of the Security Council concerning Palestine. The most recent was in December 1989 when the United Kingdom, France and the United States vetoed a draft resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama. The United Kingdom used its veto power, along with France, to veto a draft resolution aimed at resolving the Suez Canal crisis (in which France and UK were militarily involved) in 1956. The UK and France eventually withdrew from Egypt after the US instigated an 'emergency special session' of the General Assembly, under the terms of the \\"Uniting for Peace\\" resolution, which led to the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I), by the adoption of Assembly resolution 1001. The UK also used its veto seven times in relation to Rhodesia from 1963 to 1973, five of these occasions were unilateral; the only occasions on which the UK has used its veto power unilaterally. The UK has not used the veto since 1989, when it joined the United States and France to veto a resolution condemning the United States invasion of Panama. = United States = Ambassador Charles W. Yost cast the first US veto in 1970 over Rhodesia, and the US cast a lone veto in 1972 to block a resolution that condemned Israel for war against Syria and Lebanon. Since then, the United States has been the most frequent user of the veto power, mainly on resolutions criticising and condemning Israel; since 2002, the United States has applied the Negroponte doctrine to veto most resolutions relating to the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict. This has been a constant cause of friction between the General Assembly and the Security Council. On 23 December 2016, the Obama administration abstained on a resolution calling for an end to Israeli settlements, the first time that the United States has. However, the United States has resumed the use of the veto in the Trump administration.  Controversy  = Criticism = The veto power has been criticized for its undemocratic nature. A single country can prevent a majority of the Security Council from taking any action. For example, the United States routinely casts lone vetoes of resolutions criticizing Israel. The permanent members also veto resolutions that criticize their own actions. In 2014, Russia vetoed a resolution condemning its annexation of Crimea. Amnesty International claimed that the five permanent members had used their veto to \\"promote their political self interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of protecting civilians.\\" Some critics see the fact that veto power exclusive to the permanent five as being anachronistic, unjust, or counterproductive. Peter Nadin writes that \\"The veto is an anachronism ... In the twenty-first century, the veto has come to be almost universally seen as a disproportionate power and an impediment to credible international action to crises.\\"Peter Nadin, UN Security Council Reform (Routledge, 2016), pp. 133–34. The \\"enormous influence of the veto power\\" has been cited as a cause of the UN's ineffectiveness in preventing and responding to genocide, violence, and human rights violations.Sevak Joseph Manjikian, \\"Genocide and the Failure to Respond\\" in Civil Courage: A Response to Contemporary Conflict and Prejudice (ed. Naomi Kramer: Peter Lang, 2007), pp. 49–50. Various countries outside the P5, such as the Non-Aligned Movement and African Union have proposed limitations on the veto power.Edwin Egede & Peter Sutch, The Politics of International Law and International Justice (Edinburgh University Press, 2013), p. 142. Reform of the veto power is often included in proposals for reforming the Security Council. It has been argued that with the adoption of the \\"Uniting for Peace\\" resolution by the General Assembly, and given the interpretations of the Assembly's powers that became customary international law as a result, that the Security Council \\"power of veto\\" problem could be surmounted.Hunt, C. \\"The 'veto' charade\\", ZNet, 7 November 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2008 By adopting A/RES/377 A, on 3 November 1950, over two-thirds of UN Member states declared that, according to the UN Charter, the permanent members of the UNSC cannot and should not prevent the UNGA from taking any and all action necessary to restore international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC has failed to exercise its \\"primary responsibility\\" for maintaining peace. Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded \\"final responsibility\\"—rather than \\"secondary responsibility\\"—for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter. Various official and semi-official UN reports make explicit reference to the Uniting for Peace resolution as providing a mechanism for the UNGA to overrule any UNSC vetoes;International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty. \\"The Responsibility to Protect\\" , ICISS.ca, December 2001.

Thomas G. Weiss and Giovanna Kuele called it \\"a variation on the Hippocratic Oath: UN decisions should do no harm.\\" Russian President Vladimir Putin praised the \\"profound wisdom\\" of the founders of the United Nations, referring to the veto power as the underpinning of international stability.

Isikoff (born May 12, 1952) is an American investigative journalist who is currently the Chief Investigative Correspondent at Yahoo! News. He is the co-author with David Corn of the book titled Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, published on March 13, 2018. From July 2010 to April 2014, Isikoff was the national investigative correspondent for NBC News. He resigned from NBC, citing the network's move in a direction that left him with \\"fewer opportunities\\" for his work. He had previously worked for Newsweek, which he joined as an investigative correspondent in June 1994, and wrote extensively on the U.S. government's War on Terror, the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, campaign finance and congressional ethics abuses, presidential politics and other national issues. Isikoff had been prepared to break the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, but several hours before going to print, the article was killed by top Newsweek executives. As a result, the story broke first on Matt Drudge's Drudge Report the following morning. Isikoff's book on the subject, Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story, was named Best Non-Fiction Book of 1999 by the Book of the Month Club.  Early life  Isikoff was born to a Jewish family, the son of Gertrude \\"Trudy\\" (née Albert) and Morris Isikoff. He was raised in Syosset, New York. He has one sister. Isikoff graduated from Syosset High School on Long Island in 1970. He received his A.B. from Washington University in 1974, with a junior-year-abroad at the University of Durham, England, and obtained a masters from the Medill School of Journalism from Northwestern University in 1976.  Career  Isikoff is the co-author, with The Nation reporter David Corn, of Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War, a 2006 book about the selling of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to the U.S. public and the ensuing Plame affair. The book was a New York Times best-seller. His online column with fellow journalist Mark Hosenball, \\"Terror Watch,\\" won the 2005 award from the Society of Professional Journalists for best investigative reporting online. Isikoff was a part of the Newsweek team that won the Overseas Press Club's most prestigious award, the 2001 Ed Cunningham Memorial Award for best magazine reporting from abroad for Newsweeks coverage of the War on Terror. In the May 9, 2005, issue of Newsweek, Isikoff co-wrote an article that stated that interrogators at Guantanamo Bay \\"in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a Quran down a toilet.\\" Detainees had earlier made similar complaints, but this was the first time a government source had appeared to confirm the story. The article caused widespread rioting and massive anti-American protests throughout some parts of the Islamic world, resulting at least 17 deaths in Afghanistan. The magazine later retracted the story after noting that the anonymous official who was their source subsequently could not remember important details. A subsequent June 4, 2005, report by the Pentagon, however, confirmed multiple instances of desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo, including one incident in which a guard's urine came through an air vent and splashed on a detainee and his Quran. Isikoff was a creator of the short film \\"64 Hours In October: How One Weekend Blew Up The Rules Of American Politics\\" regarding events around October 7–9, 2016 relating to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. A September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article written by Isikoff was cited by Federal authorities in a FISA warrant application in order to justify the surveillance of Carter Page, who was alleged to have a connection to Russian authorities during the 2016 presidential campaign.Stableford, Dylan.

Isikoff once claimed that Linda Tripp offered to take the infamous blue dress (claimed to have been marked with Bill Clinton's semen as a result of a sexual encounter with Monica Lewinsky) from Lewinsky's closet and hand it over to him. Isikoff allegedly refused, saying he didn't want to take possession of stolen property and did not have access to President Bill Clinton's DNA to test the evidence on the dress anyway. Isikoff has been a contributing blogger at HuffPost, and has appeared on the Democracy Now! show.  Personal life  In January 2007, Isikoff married former Washington, D.C. political gossip columnist Mary Ann Akers, who wrote \\"The Sleuth\\" for The Washington Post.

Riley, 488 U.S. 445 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court decision which held that police officials do not need a warrant to observe an individual's property from public airspace.. Background The Pasco County Sheriff's Office received a tip that Michael Riley was growing marijuana on his of rural property.Florida v. Riley, Oyez A deputy sheriff subsequently investigated the tip and went to Riley's mobile home. Unable to see inside a greenhouse, which was behind the defendant's mobile home, the deputy circled over the property using a helicopter. The absence of two roof panels allowed the deputy to see, with his naked eye, what appeared to be marijuana growing. A warrant was obtained and marijuana was found inside the greenhouse. =Procedural history= Riley successfully argued before the trial court that the aerial search violated his reasonable expectation of privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. The Florida Second District Court of Appeal disagreed, siding instead with the state, but the Florida Supreme Court agreed with Riley and overturned the Court of Appeal. Supreme Court =Issue(s) before the Court= *\\"Whether surveillance of the interior of a partially covered greenhouse in a residential backyard from the vantage point of a helicopter located above the greenhouse constitutes a 'search' for which a warrant is required under the Fourth Amendment and Article I, 12 of the Florida Constitution.\\" -- Justice White, quoting the Florida Supreme Court decision =Decision and rationale= The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Florida Supreme Court with a four-vote plurality, arguing that the accused did not have a reasonable expectation that the greenhouse was protected from aerial view, and thus that the helicopter surveillance did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. However, the Court stopped short of allowing all aerial inspections of private property, noting that it was \\"of obvious importance\\" that a private citizen could have legally flown in the same airspace: > Any member of the public could legally have been flying over Riley's > property in a helicopter at the altitude of 400 feet and could have observed > Riley's greenhouse. The police officer did no more.Riley, 488 U.S. at 451. Also vital to the Court's ruling was the fact that the helicopter did not interfere with the normal use of the property: > As far as this record reveals, no intimate details connected with the use of > the home or curtilage were observed, and there was no undue noise, no wind, > no dust, or threat of injury. In these circumstances, there was no violation > of the Fourth Amendment.Riley, 488 U.S. at 452. =Justice O'Connor's concurrence= Justice O'Connor felt that the plurality focused too much upon FAA regulations, \\"whose purpose is to promote air safety, not to protect [Fourth Amendment rights].\\" She deviated from the plurality opinion in arguing that the frequency of public flight in the airspace was a necessary concern, and that the mere legality of such flights was insufficient to determine whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy: > [I]t is not conclusive to observe, as the plurality does, that \\"[a]ny member > of the public could legally have been flying over Riley's property in a > helicopter at the altitude of 400 feet and could have observed Riley's > greenhouse.\\" Nor is it conclusive that police helicopters may often fly at > 400 feet. If the public rarely, if ever, travels overhead at such altitudes, > the observation cannot be said to be from a vantage point generally used by > the public and Riley cannot be said to have \\"knowingly expose[d]\\" his > greenhouse to public view.Riley, 488 U.S. at 454-55 (O'Connor, J., > concurring in the judgment). Nevertheless, O'Connor concurred with the plurality opinion because she thought the defendant still needed to show that public use of the relevant airspace was uncommon. The Justice closed by saying flights less than in altitude \\"may be sufficiently rare that police surveillance from such altitudes would violate reasonable expectations of privacy.\\"Riley, 488 U.S. at 455 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment). =Justice Brennan's dissent= Justice Brennan, joined by Marshall and Stevens, strongly believed that the plurality had misstated the issue, agreeing with O'Connor that the frequency of public air travel was a necessary consideration, and that the key issue in the case was whether ordinary citizens were normally in the air above the defendant's home: > The police officer positioned 400 feet above Riley's backyard was not, > however, standing on a public road. The vantage point he enjoyed was not one > any citizen could readily share. His ability to see over Riley’s fence > depended on his use of a very expensive and sophisticated piece of machinery > to which few ordinary citizens have access.Riley, 488 U.S. at 460 (Brennan, > J., dissenting). However, Brennan disagreed with O'Connor in that he believed the defendant did not necessarily need to show that public flight was rare, but rather that the state needed to show that it was common: > Because the State has greater access to information concerning customary > flight patterns and because the coercive power of the State ought not be > brought to bear in cases in which it is unclear whether the prosecution is a > product of an unconstitutional, warrantless search, the burden of proof > properly rests with the State and not with the individual defendant. The > State quite clearly has not carried this burden.Riley, 488 U.S. at 465-66 > (Brennan, J., dissenting) (internal citations omitted). =Justice Blackmun's dissent= Justice Blackmun recognized that five of the nine justices (O'Connor and the four dissenters) had agreed that \\"the reasonableness of Riley's expectation [of privacy] depends, in large measure, on the frequency of non-police helicopter flights at an altitude of 450 feet.\\" Like Brennan, Blackmun noticed that the main disagreement among these five justices was whether the government or the defendant had the burden of proof in establishing whether public flights above Riley's home were common or rare. Blackmun thought it was likely that such flights were quite rare, supporting Riley's case, so the government had to show they occurred with some regularity. He wrote that \\"burdens of proof relevant to Fourth Amendment issues may be based on a judicial estimate of the probabilities involved.\\"Riley, 488 U.S. at 468 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).

Description thumb White-flowered form With insect Red clover is a herbaceous, short-lived perennial plant, variable in size, growing to tall. It has a deep taproot which makes it tolerant to drought and gives it a good soil structuring effect. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate (with three leaflets), each leaflet long and broad, green with a characteristic pale crescent in the outer half of the leaf; the petiole is long, with two basal stipules that are abruptly narrowed to a bristle-like point. The flowers are dark pink with a paler base, long, produced in a dense inflorescence, and are mostly visited by bumblebees. Distribution The red clover is native to Europe, Western Asia, and northwest Africa, but it has been naturalized in other continents, like North and South America. Specifically, the red clover was brought to Argentina and Chile over 100 years ago, although it is not clear how exactly it was introduced. The red clover has become increasingly important as a source of economic stability in Chile, which has made the need for pollinators even more important. One important pollinator, which was also brought from Europe, is Bombus ruderatus, or the large garden bumblebee. This bumblebee has been one of the important pollinators of red clover in South America and other countries such as New Zealand. Uses Trifolium pratense, general aspect It is widely grown as a fodder crop, valued for its nitrogen fixation, which increases soil fertility. For these reasons, it is used as a green manure crop. Several cultivar groups have been selected for agricultural use, mostly derived from T. pratense var. sativum. It has become naturalised in many temperate areas, including the Americas and Australasia as an escape from cultivation. Due to its beauty, it is used as an ornamental plant. Red clover's flowers and leaves are edible, and can be added as garnishes to any dish. They can be ground into a flour. The flowers often are used to make jelly and tisanes, and are used in essiac recipes. Their essential oil may be extracted and its unique scent used in aromatherapy. =Medical uses of the plant= Trifolium pratense is used in traditional medicine of India as deobstruent, antispasmodic, expectorant, sedative, anti-inflammatory and antidermatosis agent. In alternative medicine, red clover is promoted as a treatment for a variety of human maladies, including symptoms of menopause, coughs, disorders of the lymphatic system and a variety of cancers. Several systemic reviews and meta-analyses concluded that red clover extract reduces the frequency of menopause hot flashes. Most added that further research is needed to confirm the results. There is no evidence in the human trial literature that red clover has been tested for effects on cough, lymphatic system or cancer prevention/treatment. Dietary amounts of red clover are safe, but dietary supplement extracts may cause rash-like reactions, muscle ache, headache, nausea, vaginal bleeding in women, and slow blood clotting.Red clover, WebMD. Red clover contains coumestrol, a phytoestrogen. Due to its activity on oestrogen receptors, red clover is contraindicated in people with a history of breast cancer, endometriosis, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, uterine fibroids or other oestrogen-sensitive conditions, although some authors have suggested the high isoflavone content counteracts this, and even provides benefits in these conditions. It is said to be a blood cleanser. Due to its coumarin derivatives, T. pratense should be used with caution in individuals with coagulation disorders or currently undergoing anticoagulation therapy. It is metabolised by CYP3A4 and therefore caution should be used when taking it with other drugs using this metabolic pathway. Diseases Red clover is subject to bacterial as well as fungal diseases, including the red clover rust, Uromyces trifolii-repentis var. fallens. Other problems include parasitic nematodes (roundworms) and viruses. Symbolism Trifolium pratense is the national flower of Denmark and the state flower of Vermont.

It is based on the idea that humans are biological beings that think, feel, act, sense, imagine, and interact—and that psychological treatment should address each of these modalities. Multimodal assessment and treatment follows seven reciprocally influential dimensions of personality (or modalities) known by their acronym BASIC I.D.: behavior, affect, sensation, imagery, cognition, interpersonal relationships, and drugs/biology. Multimodal therapy is based on the idea that the therapist must address these multiple modalities of an individual to identify and treat a mental disorder. According to MMT, each individual is affected in different ways and in different amounts by each dimension of personality, and should be treated accordingly for treatment to be successful. It sees individuals as products of interplay among genetic endowment, physical environment, and social learning history. To state that learning plays a central role in the development and resolution of our emotional problems is to communicate little. For events to connect, they must occur simultaneously or in close succession. An association may exist when responses one stimulus provokes, are predictable and reliable, similar to those another provokes. In this regard, classical conditioning and operant conditioning are two central concepts in MMT. BASIC I.D. BASIC I.D. refers to the seven dimensions of personality according to Lazarus. Creating a successful treatment for a specific individual requires that the therapist consider each dimension, and the individual's deficits in each. *B represents behavior, which can be manifested through the use of inappropriate acts, habits, gestures, or the lack of appropriate behaviors. *A stands for affect, which can be seen as the level of negative feelings or emotions one experiences. *S is sensation, or the negative bodily sensations or physiological symptoms such as pain, tension, sweat, nausea, quick heartbeat, etc. *I stands for imagery, which is the existence of negative cognitive images or mental pictures. *C represents cognition or the degree of negative thoughts, attitudes, or beliefs. *The second I stands for interpersonal relationships, and refers to one's ability to form successful relationships with others. It is based on social skills and support systems. *D is for drugs and biological functions, and examines the individual's physical health, drug use, and other lifestyle choices.Dwyer, K. K. (2000). The Multidimensional Model: Teaching Students to Self-Manage High Communication Apprehension by Self-Selecting Treatments, Communication Education, 49, 72–81. Multimodal therapy addresses the fact that different people depend on or are more influenced by some personality dimensions more than others. Some people are prone to deal with their problems on their own, cognitively, while others are more likely to draw support from others, and others yet are likely to use physical activities to deal with problems, such as exercise or drugs. All reactions are a combination of how the seven dimensions work together in an individual. Once the source of the problem is found, treatment can be used to focus on that specific dimension more than the others. Function MMT starts after the patient has been assessed based on his/her emotional responses, sensory displays and the manner in which he/she interacts with people around via behavior, affect, sensations, images, cognition, drugs and interpersonal activities. Based on this assessment, the therapist will introduce the patient to the first session. During this time, the therapist and the patient will create a list of problems and the suitable treatments that may suit him/her the most. Since the treatment is based upon individual cases, each remedial strategy is considered as an effective method for the patients. Post the completion of the initial assessment, a more detailed diagnosis is done using questionnaires. The therapist shall diagnose both the actual profile as well as the structural profile of the patient. Such a diagnosis will define the target which both the therapist and the patient would want to achieve once the treatment is complete. Here, the therapist will evaluate different other ways to treat the patient. Often, relaxation tapes are used to calm down the patient. Besides psychotherapy, the therapist will try to include dietary measures and stress management programs to treat patient's associated psychiatric symptoms. The prime focus of the therapist would be to ease the pains of the patient and fulfill his/her needs by studying his/her behavior and mannerisms. Upon the patient's prior consent, the therapist will tape all the sessions and furnish a copy of those tapes to the patient. These tapes act as a supporting resource when the therapist is evaluating the patient's behavior. MMT is a flexible mode of psychotherapy because each treatment plan is devised keeping all the possibilities in mind. In the case of a single patient, the duration of the session could last not more than few hours, depending upon the therapist's analysis of the concerned patient's behavior. However, if the patient shows a condition that needs multiple treatments, then the session could stretch farther so as to enable the therapist to analyse the patient further.Multimodal Therapy, Retrieved 16 February 2016. CBT Multimodal therapy originated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a fusion of cognitive therapy and behavior therapy. Behavior therapy focused on the consideration of external behaviors, while cognitive therapy focused on mental aspects and internal processes; combining the two made it possible to utilize both internal and external factors of treatment simultaneously.Milkman, H., & Wanberg, K.

Arnold Lazarus added the idea that, since personality is multi-dimensional, treatment must also consider multiple dimensions of personality to be effective. His idea of MMT involves examining symptoms on each dimension of personality in order to find the right combination of therapeutic techniques to address them all. Lazarus retained the basic premises of CBT, but believed that more of the individual's specific needs and personality dimensions must be considered.Lazarus, A. (1981).

The fish can come from many places, but most comes from Southeast Asia. The live food fish trade is a global system that links fishing communities with markets, primarily in Hong Kong and mainland China. Many of the fish are captured on coral reefs in Southeast Asia or the Pacific Island nations.  Consumer demand  Live fish market in Tongyeong, Korea Within the live food trade there are certain types of fish demanded more often by consumers, particularly smaller and medium-sized fish. According to the book While Stocks Last: The Live Reef Food Fish Trade consumer demand has caused the fish captured on coral reefs to be the most valued fish in the trade. Consumers are important because they are directly purchasing these fish species at restaurants and stores. In addition to these types of fishes, many juvenile fish are used for the live food trade. There are also cultural and regional preferences among consumers, for example, Chinese consumers often prefer their fish to be reddish in color believing the color to be auspicious.Sadovy, Y.T, Ecological Issues and the Trades in Live Reef fishes chapter 18, 2002 These preferences inevitably affect the biodiversity of marine life making certain fish species rarer to find. The life fish food trade is a lucrative business. According to University of Washington Professor Patrick Christie, live fish caught for food export earns approximately $6000 a ton.Christie, Patrick John. University of Washington Professor in School of Marine Affairs. Lecture 5/9/2005. To help support themselves and their families, fishermen in Oceania and Southeast Asia sometimes use illegal fishing methods. Although many feel the fish are worth the cost, a typical dinner can cost up to one hundred dollars per kilogram. The wholesale value on these fish is anywhere from eleven US dollars to sixty-three US dollars per kilogram, meaning there’s a large markup and resale value. (Hong Kong alone is estimated to be about four hundred million US dollars a year.) Because this trade frequently uses illegal methods of collecting (using cyanide), there is no way to know for sure how much money is being made each year on live fish trade, although estimates conclude probably over one billion US dollars each year. As is often the case, consumers are willing to pay large amounts of money on rare and fresh fish. One 500-pound, polka-dot grouper, estimated to be more than a century old, was hacked into fillets by seven kitchen workers in about half an hour, the Economist reports. It was expected to bring about $15,000.Moll, David. \\"A Good Time for a Fishing Expedition.\\" Journal Star Peoria [Illinois] 29 May 1996: C1.  Market and trade routes  The center for the Live Food Fish Trade is located in Hong Kong -- the markets consumers contribute $400 million to the estimated $1 billion of the trades global value.SeaWeb. Life Reef Fish Trade In the Pacific Islands. SeaWeb.org. 24 May 2005 Total imports flowing into Hong Kong included 10153 metric tons, of which 30 percent was re-exported to mainland China.Montaldi, Allasandro. Marine Finfish Markets in Hong Kong. July-Sept 2004. 24 May 2005 Other major markets include Singapore, mainland China, and Taiwan.Graham, Thomas. A Collaborative Strategy to Address the Live Reef Fish Food Trade. The Nature Conservancy. May 24 2005. The primary suppliers of wild caught fish are Indonesia (accounting for nearly 50 percent of Hong Kong's imports), Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, and Vietnam. However, Taiwan and Malaysia are leading the charge towards farmed live fish specializing in an industry that \\"harvested annually has probably been in the billions [Metric Tons]\\". Farming live fish is gaining popularity as tastes for live fish are burgeoning across South Asia and countries look to become more and more self sustainable, this is appareant in nations with sizable Chinese populations such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Hong Kong and China are the dominant markets for the live fish, in addition to other cities in the region that have large Chinese populations, including Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\\"Coral reef populations severely depleted by trade.\\" BusinessWorld (Manila). 11 Nov 1999: 1. In Southeast Asia, Singapore alone consumes 500 tons of live coral fish a year. Exports from Southeast Asia rose to over 5,000 tons in 1995 from 400 tons in 1989. However, in 1996, exports declined by 22%. Indonesia, which accounts for over 60% of the harvest, saw exports falling by over 450 tons. That same year, other Southeast Asian countries have experienced similar drops in stocks of live coral fish for food. In 1996, the Philippines' exports were halved, while Malaysian exports declined by over 30%. These decreases in catch have been due to the excessive amount of fish caught for exports and the degradation of the coral reefs from such procedures.  Corruption in the trade  The \\"wellboat\\", or live fish carrier, Hedda, turning into Kinlochbervie Harbour, Scotland The live fish trade is a complex issue that involves many different perspectives, all of which must be considered in trying to approach a solution. While, at first, one may point the finger at the fishermen themselves as the criminals, there are many other factors. One is the economic disparity of many of the communities that take part in cyanide, dynamite, or other illegal fishing practices. 40% of the Filipino population and 27% of the Indonesian population is considered to be in poverty.The World Factbook Many whose livelihood once depended on fishing or agriculture are realizing it is more lucrative to participate in illegal fishing activities. Community members who are not a part of the trade are affected by the activities of these illegal fishers. The cyanide fishers profit by taking away from everyone else’s trade and food.Lowe, Celia “Who is to blame? Logics of responsibility in the live reef food fish trade in Sulawesi, Indonesia” SPC Live Reef Fish Information Bulletin #10 June 2002 ‘If people were using poison and my take dropped to only a little, I would accept it,’ Puah said. ‘But I feel heartsick…I catch nothing at all. I have not caught a big fish in a month so there’s no point in going fishing this afternoon.’” The local people are often helpless to protect themselves, as government and law enforcement officials have “open pockets” and are also involved in the trade by turning a blind eye to the illegal actions and receiving a take of the profits. “Culpability in cyanide use cannot be understood apart from the larger structures of corruption that permeates resource extraction throughout Indonesia. The Indonesian State bureaucracy extends from Jakarta down to the village level, and radiates out into villages through kinship connections. It is the factor most tightly correlated with illegal trade in natural resources throughout Indonesia.”  Cause and effect  Coral reefs found in the South Pacific are regarded as the \\"rainforest of the sea\\" harboring countless fish species large and small. However, recently the live fish trade has threatened the sanctity of these endangered areas. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network has issued a recent report that estimates that 25% of the world's reefs are severely damaged and another third are in grave danger.Moore, Franklin and Best, Barbara. \\"Coral Reef Crisis: Causes and Consequences.\\" May 24 2005 The live fish trade is part of this alarming ecological trend caused by the popular use of cyanide which is injected into the coral reefs to stun inhabiting fish so they can be easily caught by nets. It is estimated that since the 1960s, more than one million kilograms of cyanide has been squirted into Philippine reefs alone, and since then the practice has spread throughout the South Pacific. The live fish trade is only growing, in 1994 the Philippines exported 200,000 kg of live fish; by 2004 the Philippines were annually exporting 800,000 kg annually.Aguiba, Melody M. \\"12 August 2004 Depletion of live fish trade for export feared.\\" May 24 2005 Although Asian markets are the primary buyers of live reef fish for food, the recently created U.S. Coral Reef Task Force has concluded that the U.S. is the primary purchaser of live reef fish for aquariums as well as eclectic jewelry. Even though the use of cyanide in the live fish trade is severely detrimental, one must realize that this issue is multidimensional. Small-scale native fishermen of the small South Pacific coastal communities are the backbone of the live fish trade, and are forced to resort to the illegal use of sodium cyanide due to demand and high prices offered by the industry.  Fishing techniques  While live food fish trade can be very profitable for those involved, there are many dangerous aspects to it. Through the use of illegal practices such as cyanide fishing, coral reefs and fish communities are put in grave danger. The process of cyanide fishing involves dissolving crushed cyanide tablets and squirting this solution from a bottle toward the targeted fish on top of coral heads. Specifically, the cyanide kills coral polyps, symbiotic algae, and other coral reefs organisms that are necessary for maintaining the health of the coral reef. These damages eventually deteriorate the coral reef and lead it into collapse of the entire coral reef ecosystem. The effect on the targeted fish is disorientation and semi-paralysis. After being squirted with cyanide, the fish are easy brought to the surface and kept alive in small, on-board containers. Fishermen often understand that this practice is harmful and will offer locals a portion of the fish in order to continue fishing. When ingested, small levels of cyanide accumulate in the system causing weakness of fingers and toes, failure of the thyroid gland and blurred vision. Divers without experience may come in direct contact with cyanide, causing death. Estimates show that since the 1960s, over a million kilograms of cyanide have been squirted into the coral reefs of the Philippines alone.Bryant, D., L. Burke, J. McManus, and M. Spalding. 1998. Reefs at risk: A map-based indicator of threats to the world's coral reefs. World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C. The harm upon the reefs is coming full circle and having a social impact through the limited fish stocks. As fish are depleted from these fishing techniques, the fishermen are having a more difficult time feeding themselves.\\"Cyanide: an Easy but Deadly Way to Catch Fish.\\" 29 Jan. 2003. Additionally, the use of explosives may be used as a fishing technique in the live food fish trade. While the majority of these fish do not survive the blast of such explosions, the remaining fish that are only stunned are collected for the live food fish trade. The use of cyanide makes a stronger argument in that the more coral reef fish captured alive, the more lucrative the catch is for the fisherman. Live fish, according to the [WWF], fetch five times more than a dead fish. This is why banning the live- fish trade would similarly harm the reefs. Fisherman would resort to the \\"dead fish trade\\", be forced to deal in a larger quantity of fish, and the process of dangerous fishing techniques continues. To illustrate the effects of repeated explosions in the proximity of a coral reef system, roughly one half of the coral reefs in Komodo National Park in Indonesia have been destroyed. The use of cyanide and explosives in fishing proves to be an effective technique in catching fish, but its powers are indiscriminating and as a result the coral reefs are being held hostage to such practices. The future of the reefs are in question just as are the futures of those who subsist from them because \\"from a long term perspective, the question of ethics of using the ocean...contains a commitment for future generations\\".Grover, Velma I., Ed. Climate Change Five Years After Kyoto. Enfield: Science Publishers Inc., 2004, p. 129.  Impacts on humans  In communities like those in the Philippines and Indonesia, people are participating in the live food fish trade because it is a source of income, or at least a source of temporary income. For some communities this is one of the few income-generating opportunities. Along with the environmental, ecological, and economic consequences of this industry, there are serious health risks as well. Because of inadequate training and lack of quality equipment, divers, especially young men are in large risk of paralysis.Donaldson, T.J.; Graham, T.R.; McGilvray, G.J.; Phillips, M.J.; Rimmer, M.A.; Sadovy, Y.J.; Smith, A; and Yeeting, B. “While Stocks Last: The Live Reef Food Fish Trade.” Asian Development Bank. 2003.  Sustainable practices  Because of the great profitability of this industry, there is a great incentive to identify sustainable practices. The Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) works to offer the hobbyist with a product that is certified as environmentally sound and sustainable. Additionally, the International Marinelife Alliance (IMA), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and MAC are working with the Hong Kong Chamber of Seafood Merchants to develop standards for the live fish trade. The Hong Kong Seafood Merchants represent ninety percent of the buyers of live reef food fish in Hong Kong and have an extensive impact on collection practices.  Aquaculture  A fish hatchery at Loch an Eilein, Scotland, which exports young salmon via a live fish carrying ship that comes into the bay. The fish are taken to sea cages where they are grown on. In an effort to address the damage inflicted on coral reef eco- systems and fish stocks, aquaculture is being utilized to reduce pressure on coral reefs. However, initial efforts to farm grouper have met with significant challenges. There are difficulties with fragile grouper seed that can make it more expensive than wild caught larvae, which can affect natural replenishment rates. Additionally, there are problems with finding suitable food, disease and cannibalism.Johannes, R.E. and N.J. Ogburn, “Collecting grouper seed for aquaculture in the Philippines.” Available from Efforts are also being made in regards to the aquarium fish trade. Juvenile fish are being captured and raised specifically for the industry. However, there are debates as to whether this practice will affect replenishment rates. “The age of the juveniles is pivotal to the debate, harvesting of postlarvae from the water column is considered to have a much lower (negligible) impact on rates of replenishment than the removal of the larger juveniles from benthic habitats because the postlarvae have yet to undergo severe mortality”.Bell, Johann, Peter Doherty and Cathy Hair, “The capture and culture of postlarval coral reef fish: Potential for new artisanal fisheries.” Available from If studies determine that the capture of juveniles is sustainable, it may help in mitigating the damage from cyanide fishing. Aquaculture production, specifically grouper rearing is rapidly expanding in Asia. From 1998 to 2001 the Indo-Pacific countries involved in aquaculture; China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand witnessed a 119 percent increase in output.FAO fishery Information Data and Statistics Unit 2003 The explosion in this practice can most likely be attributed to the large profit margins that can be derived in very little time. It is estimated that the majority of farms after annual returns can be paid back in less than one year. In comparison to other species of fish such as the Milkfish, the Grouper, because of high demand is able to garner high rates of return, in order to earn 1,000 dollars a grouper farm would only have to raise 400 kilograms in contrast to 5,000 kilograms of Milkfish.

The company was established as Elektra on 18 January 1921 and renamed TESLA on 7 March 1946. TESLA had a state-sponsored monopoly on electronics production in Czechoslovakia, and produced nearly all electronic products in the country until 1989. Many subsidiaries were created from the original brand, including those at Liptovský Hrádok, Hradec Králové, Pardubice, Žďár nad Sázavou, Bratislava, and Nižná. Later, some of them were transformed into independent state-owned companies. Tesla a.s. Prague-Hloubětín became a direct successor. Company Tesla a.s. headquarters in Prague Tesla 308U Talisman radio (1953) Tesla tape recorders (B93, B115, B116, B730, B56 and B100) in Radebeul museum This was officially reported by Radioamator in October 1946: Tesla the National Enterprise was set up on 10 August at the Mikrofon Factory in Strašnice with the participation of Yugoslavian Minister Zlataric Branko, Minister of Industry of North Macedonia Vasilijev Georgie, Minister of Industry of B. Laušman, representatives of government, institutions and universities. The enterprise was named after a genial Slavic technician and it documents the effort for convergence and cooperation among all Slavic nations. The main task of nationalized industry is to quickly overcome all post-war troubles and woes, and to create a socially healthy and productive work environment. Then the Minister declared Tesla as established. The company had a wide range of production: TVs, radio receivers, transistors, integrated circuits, screens, speakers, gramophones, cassette recorders, CD players, videocassette recorders etc. However, quantity usually did not meet the needs of industrial customers and many products gradually became obsolete simply because they were not updated; e.g. one particular type of diode was manufactured for over 30 years without modifications. Other products, e.g. some kinds of silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) or power transistors were competitive with the world market and so TESLA was the supplier for all Eastern Europe countries. Some high quality products were even exported to western countries, for example, the turntables NC 470 or NC 500 under the tradename Lenco. In 1953, the production of the first Czechoslovak television Tesla 4001A began in Strašnice. The first Czechoslovak color TV Tesla 4401A began manufacturing in 1974. The most well- known international Tesla product was the Tesla 308U Talisman bakelite radio designed by Igor Didov of Tesla Bratislava and made by several Tesla company branches between 1953 and 1958 and reel-to-reel tape recorder Sonet duo (1959-1965). It was also known for its military passive radar KRTP-86 Tamara (TESLA Pardubice, 1986), which was claimed to be the only one in the world able to detect military \\"invisible aircraft\\". TESLA had to contend with both foreign and new domestic competition after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, and had difficulty competing effectively, which resulted in dramatic downsizing and privatization of the majority of its stores and production facilities. TESLA's logo is a rare sight in the present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia, as only a few of its subsidiaries have survived. One of its former subsidiaries, the Slovak JJ Electronic in Čadca is known for its production of vacuum tubes and SEV Litovel is known for its production of high-end turntables known as Pro-Ject. The direct successor is a joint-stock company Tesla a.s. Prague-Hloubětín. It owns a trademark in more than 80 countries in the world and other companies lease the right to use the Tesla trademark from this company. Tesla a.s. is a Czech manufacturer of radio and security electrical equipment for military and commercial use. Since 2011, the license for the Tesla brand is also owned by the Inter-Sat Ltd company based in Brno, under which the company manufactures set-top boxes, antennas, robotic vacuum cleaners, soundbars, motion detectors and multifunctional pressure cookers. In 2015, the first primary cells comes to market under the trade name Tesla Batteries.  Dispute with Tesla, Inc.  After series of actions taken by Tesla a.s. against American company Tesla, Inc. (formerly Tesla Motors, Inc.) the contract between Tesla a.s. and Tesla Motors, Inc. was signed on 6 October 2010 stating a coexistence of TESLA trademarks and regulating relationships between them. Preamble to the Tesla trademarks coexistence agreement: (A) Tesla Motors owns a number of trademark applications and registrations consisting of or containing the word TESLA.¨ (B) Tesla Holding owns a number of trademark applications and registrations consisting of or containing the word TESLA. (C) Tesla Holding and Tesla Motors wish to enter into a coexistence agreement relating to the TESLA trademark.

Roughly, the critical band is the band of audio frequencies within which a second tone will interfere with the perception of the first tone by auditory masking. Psychophysiologically, beating and auditory roughness sensations can be linked to the inability of the auditory frequency- analysis mechanism to resolve inputs whose frequency difference is smaller than the critical bandwidth and to the resulting irregular \\"tickling\\" of the mechanical system (basilar membrane) that resonates in response to such inputs. Critical bands are also closely related to auditory masking phenomena – reduced audibility of a sound signal when in the presence of a second signal of higher intensity within the same critical band. Masking phenomena have wide implications, ranging from a complex relationship between loudness (perceptual frame of reference) and intensity (physical frame of reference) to sound compression algorithms.  Auditory filters  Filters are used in many aspects of audiology and psychoacoustics including the peripheral auditory system. A filter is a device that boosts certain frequencies and attenuates others. In particular, a band-pass filter allows a range of frequencies within the bandwidth to pass through while stopping those outside the cut-off frequencies. A Band-pass filter showing the centre frequency(Fc), the lower(F1) and upper(F2) cut off frequencies and the bandwidth. The upper and lower cut-off frequencies are defined as the point where the amplitude falls to 3dB below the peak amplitude. The bandwidth is the distance between the upper and lower cut-off frequencies, and is the range of frequencies passed by the filter. The shape and organization of the basilar membrane means that different frequencies resonate particularly strongly at different points along the membrane. This leads to a tonotopic organisation of the sensitivity to frequency ranges along the membrane, which can be modeled as being an array of overlapping band-pass filters known as \\"auditory filters\\". The auditory filters are associated with points along the basilar membrane and determine the frequency selectivity of the cochlea, and therefore the listener's discrimination between different sounds. They are non-linear, level-dependent and the bandwidth decreases from the base to apex of the cochlea as the tuning on the basilar membrane changes from high to low frequency. The bandwidth of the auditory filter is called the critical bandwidth, as first suggested by Fletcher (1940). If a signal and masker are presented simultaneously then only the masker frequencies falling within the critical bandwidth contribute to masking of the signal. The larger the critical bandwidth the lower the signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) and the more the signal is masked. Figure 2: ERB related to centre frequency. The diagram shows the ERB versus centre frequency according to the formula of Glasberg and Moore. Another concept associated with the auditory filter is the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB). The ERB shows the relationship between the auditory filter, frequency, and the critical bandwidth. An ERB passes the same amount of energy as the auditory filter it corresponds to and shows how it changes with input frequency. At low sound levels, the ERB is approximated by the following equation according to Glasberg and Moore: :ERB(f) = 24.7 * (4.37 f / 1000 + 1), where the ERB is in Hz and f is the centre frequency in Hz. It is thought that each ERB is the equivalent of around 0.9mm on the basilar membrane. The ERB can be converted into a scale that relates to frequency and shows the position of the auditory filter along the basilar membrane. For example, an ERB number of 3.36 corresponds to a frequency at the apical end of the basilar membrane whereas an ERB number of 38.9 corresponds to the base and a value of 19.5 falls half- way between the two. One filter type used to model the auditory filters is the gammatone filter. It provides a simple linear filter, which is therefore easy to implement, but cannot by itself account for nonlinear aspects of the auditory system; it is nevertheless used in a variety of models of the auditory system. Variations and improvements of the gammatone model of auditory filtering include the gammachirp filter, the all-pole and one-zero gammatone filters, the two-sided gammatone filter, and filter cascade models, and various level-dependent and dynamically nonlinear versions of these.  Psychoacoustic tuning curves  The shapes of auditory filters are found by analysis of psychoacoustic tuning, which are graphs that show a subject's threshold for detection of a tone as a function of masker parameters. Psychoacoustic tuning curves can be measured using the notched-noise method. This form of measurement can take a considerable amount of time and can take around 30 minutes to find each masked threshold. In the notched-noise method the subject is presented with a notched noise as the masker and a sinusoid (pure tone) as the signal. Notched noise is used as a masker to prevent the subject hearing beats that occur if a sinusoidal masker is used. The notched noise is noise with a notch around the frequency of the signal the subject is trying to detect, and contains noise within a certain bandwidth. The bandwidth of the noise changes and the masked thresholds for the sinusoid are measured. The masked thresholds are calculated through simultaneous masking when the signal is played to the subject at the same time as the masker and not after. To get a true representation of the auditory filters in one subject, many psychoacoustic tuning curves need to be calculated with the signal at different frequencies. For each psychoacoustic tuning curve being measured, at least five but preferably between thirteen and fifteen thresholds must be calculated, with different notch widths. Also a large number of thresholds need to be calculated because the auditory filters are asymmetrical, so thresholds should also be measured with the notch asymmetric to the frequency of the signal. Because of the many measurements needed, the amount of time needed to find the shape of a person's auditory filters is very long. To reduce the amount of time needed, the ascending method can be used when finding the masked thresholds. If the ascending method is used to calculate the threshold the time needed to calculate the shape of the filter is reduced dramatically, as it takes around two minutes to calculate the threshold. This is because the threshold is recorded when the subject first hears the tone, instead of when they respond to a certain stimulus level a certain percentage of the time.  Anatomy and physiology of the basilar membrane  The human ear is made up of three areas: the outer, middle and inner ear. Within the inner ear sits the cochlea. The cochlea is a snail-shaped formation that enables sound transmission via a sensorineural route, rather than through a conductive pathway. The cochlea is a complex structure, consisting of three layers of fluid. The scala vestibuli and scala media are separated by Reissner's Membrane whereas the scala media and scala tympani are divided by the basilar membrane. The diagram below illustrates the complex layout of the compartments and their divisions: Cross-section through the cochlea, showing the different compartments (as described above) The basilar membrane widens as it progresses from base to apex. Therefore, the base (the thinnest part) has a greater stiffness than the apex. This means that the amplitude of a sound wave travelling through the basilar membrane varies as it travels through the cochlea. When a vibration is carried through the cochlea, the fluid within the three compartments causes the basilar membrane to respond in a wave-like manner. This wave is referred to as a 'travelling wave'; this term means that the basilar membrane does not simply vibrate as one unit from the base towards the apex. When a sound is presented to the human ear, the time taken for the wave to travel through the cochlea is only 5 milliseconds. When low-frequency travelling waves pass through the cochlea, the wave increases in amplitude gradually, then decays almost immediately. The placement of vibration on the cochlea depends upon the frequency of the presented stimuli. For example, lower frequencies mostly stimulate the apex, in comparison to higher frequencies, which stimulate the base of the cochlea. This attribute of the physiology of the basilar membrane can be illustrated in the form of a place–frequency map: Simplified schematic of the basilar membrane, showing the change in characteristic frequency from base to apex The basilar membrane supports the organ of Corti, which sits within the scala media. The organ of Corti comprises both outer and inner hair cells. There are approximately between 15,000 and 16,000 of these hair cells in one ear. Outer hair cells have stereocilia projecting towards the tectorial membrane, which sits above the organ of Corti. Stereocilia respond to movement of the tectorial membrane when a sound causes vibration through the cochlea. When this occurs, the stereocilia separate and a channel is formed that allows chemical processes to take place. Eventually the signal reaches the eighth nerve, followed by processing in the brain.  Relationship to masking  Auditory filters are closely associated with masking in the way they are measured and also the way they work in the auditory system. As described previously the critical bandwidth of the filter increases in size with increasing frequency, along with this the filter becomes more asymmetrical with increasing level. framecentreAsymmetry of the auditory filter. The diagram shows the increasing asymmetry of the auditory filter with increasing input level. The highlighted filters show the shape for 90 dB input level (pink) and a 20 dB input level (green). Diagram adapted from Moore and Glasberg, which showed rounded (roex) filter shapes. These two properties of the auditory filter are thought to contribute to the upward spread of masking, that is low frequencies mask high frequencies better than the reverse. As increasing the level makes the low frequency slope shallower, by increasing its amplitude, low frequencies mask high frequencies more than at a lower input level. The auditory filter can reduce the effects of a masker when listening to a signal in background noise using off-frequency listening. This is possible when the centre frequency of the masker is different from that of the signal. In most situations the listener chooses to listen 'through' the auditory filter that is centred on the signal however if there is a masker present this may not be appropriate. The auditory filter centred on the signal may also contain a large amount of masker causing the SNR of the filter to be low and decreasing the listeners ability to detect the signal. However, if the listener listened through a slightly different filter that still contained a substantial amount of signal but less masker, the SNR is increased, allowing the listener to detect the signal. Off-frequency listening. Diagram A shows the auditory filter centred on the signal and how some of the masker falls within that filter, resulting in a low SNR. Diagram B shows a filter further along the basilar membrane, which is not centered on the signal but contains a substantial amount of that signal and less masker. This shift reduces the effect of the masker by increasing the SNR. Diagram adapted from Gelfand (2004). The first diagram above shows the auditory filter centred on the signal and how some of the masker falls within that filter. This results in a low SNR. The second diagram shows the next filter along the basilar membrane, which is not centred on the signal but contains a substantial amount of that signal and less masker. This reduces the effect of the masker by increasing the SNR. The above applies to the power-spectrum model of masking. In general this model relies on the auditory system containing the array of auditory filters and choosing the filter with the signal at its centre or with the best SNR. Only masker that falls into the auditory filter contributes to masking and the person's threshold for hearing the signal is determined by that masker.  Normal and impaired auditory filters  In a 'normal' ear the auditory filter has a shape similar to the one shown below. This graph reflects the frequency selectivity and the tuning of the basilar membrane. The auditory filter of a \\"normal\\" cochlea The tuning of the basilar membrane is due to its mechanical structure. At the base of the basilar membrane it is narrow and stiff and is most responsive to high frequencies. However, at the apex the membrane is wide and flexible and is most responsive to low frequencies. Therefore, different sections of the basilar membrane vibrate depending on the frequency of the sound and give a maximum response at that particular frequency. In an impaired ear, however the auditory filter has a different shape compared to that of a 'normal' ear. The auditory filter of an impaired cochlea The auditory filter of an impaired ear is flatter and broader compared to a normal ear. This is because the frequency selectivity and the tuning of the basilar membrane is reduced as the outer hair cells are damaged. When only the outer hair cells are damaged the filter is broader on the low frequency side. When both the outer and inner hair cells are damaged the filter is broader on both sides. This is less common. The broadening of the auditory filter is mainly on the low frequency side of the filter. This increases susceptibility to low frequency masking i.e. upward spread of masking as described above.

Map of the area (1777–83) Old Kilcullen 7 a.m The outbreak of the rebellion on the night of 23/24 May 1798 led to failed assaults on Ballymore-Eustace, Naas, and Prosperous. As news of the rising spread throughout Kildare, Kilcullen rebels began to mobilise in the ancient hill-top churchyard in the townland now known as Old Kilcullen. About 200 had gathered by daybreak, including a number of survivors of the attack on Ballymore-Eustace, when they were spotted by local military under the command of Lieutenant General Ralph Dundas, Commander of the Army of the Midlands, whose headquarters, Castle Martin, was located only three miles away. Dundas quickly mustered a combined force of about 120 infantry, cavalry and dragoons and marched to disperse the rebel gathering. The 80 or so cavalry and dragoons raced ahead of the infantry and upon arrival at the base of the hill, charged the rebel gathering. The rebels however, quickly entrenched themselves on three sides by using a ditch and the walls of the ruined church and graveyard to protect their flanks. The cavalry were driven back by the long pikes of the rebels, losing over thirty of their number and many of their horses in the fighting. Two of their captains lay dead on the field, one of whom, a Captain Erskine, reportedly met his death after the battle. As he lay disabled with a broken leg from a horse fall he was discovered by an old woman scavenging the battlefield who stabbed him to death with a rusty knife. The rebels threatened to take advantage of the disarray of the cavalry with their own attack but the eventual arrival of infantry shielded the survivors withdrawal to Kilcullen Bridge where they were reinforced by about 100 local yeomen. Kilcullen Turnpike 9 a.m As news of the Government defeat spread through Kilcullen and the surrounding area, the rebel army swelled with recruits until it numbered almost 1,000 men. The rebel leadership then decided to quickly follow up their victory by cutting off the remaining garrison from the Dublin Road thereby cutting communications between Dublin and the south. The rebels forded the river Liffey downstream from Kilcullen Bridge and occupied the high ground on both sides of the road at Turnpike Hill. Dundas, by now no longer underestimating his opponents, devised a ruse to draw the rebels down from the high ground by sending a small party of cavalry ahead, their orders were to avoid combat and lure the rebels into prepared lines of fire. The rebels took the bait and chased after the advance party only to be hit by several musket volleys from the waiting soldiers. When the rebels reached the Liffey in disarray, the cavalry were unleashed and scattered them, killing about 150 for no reported losses on the Government side. Government Withdrawal Despite achieving a crushing victory, Dundas was shaken by his earlier defeat, the attacks on isolated garrisons and news of the spreading rebellion. As Commander of the Army of the Midlands, he decided to consolidate his position by issuing a general order for all Crown forces under his command to withdraw to Naas, in effect abandoning much of the county to the rebels. In his haste to evacuate the town, a number of soldiers and some of their wounded from the earlier fighting were left behind and killed by the rebels. Knockaulin 26 May The rebels defeated by General Dundas at Turnpike Hill, amassed themselves on Knockaulin hill (the ancient site of Dún Ailinne) near Old Kilcullen. On Saturday 26 May they began to negotiate a surrender. When Dundas replied favourably to the rebels overture for peace, they delivered terms. They would surrender themselves and their arms and return to their homes, provided the free-quarters would end and plundered property was restored. While Dundas may have been favourable to negotiate terms and end hostilities, the government was indignant and sent General Gerard Lake, Commander-in-Chief of the army, to Castlemartin. By the time Lake arrived on Sunday, Dundas had agreed that the surrender would take place the next day, Whit Monday. Patrick O'Kelly, aged 17, was chosen to accept the surrender on behalf of the rebels and was appointed a Colonel so he could properly treat with General Dundas. The meeting was cordial but Lake refused any terms, other than the complete surrender of the rebels in the avenue of Castlemartin. O'Kelly said the rebels would only surrender on the hill. Despite Lake's objections, Dundas climbed Knockaulin. The presence of Dundas greatly mollified the rebels disappointment at the refusal of terms, and the men began to deposit their arms and return home. The subsequent pile of arms was the size of the Royal Exchange, according to O'Kelly in his General History of the Rebellion of 1798, and these were later removed to Castlemartin. This avoided a planned assault by Lake as he had three regiments of infantry and four pieces of artillery lying within one mile of Castlemartin, ready to engage the rebels if necessary.

Burgomaster (alternatively spelled burgermeister, literally master of the town, master of the borough, master of the fortress, or master of the citizens) is the English form of various terms in or derived from Germanic languages for the chief magistrate or executive of a city or town. The name in English was derived from the Dutch burgemeester. In some cases, Burgomaster was the title of the head of state and head of government of a sovereign (or partially or de facto sovereign) city-state, sometimes combined with other titles, such as Hamburg's First Mayor and President of the Senate). Contemporary titles are commonly translated into English as mayor. Historical use Caption of a Bürgermeisteramt from 1505 (burgomaster Erhart Huck of Bozen, South Tyrol * In history (sometimes until the beginning of the 19th century) in many free imperial cities (such as Bremen, Hamburg, Lübeck etc.) the function of burgomaster was usually held simultaneously by three persons, serving as an executive college. One of the three being burgomaster in chief for a year (called in some cases in ; in presiding burgomaster), the second being the prior burgomaster in chief, the third being the upcoming one. Präsidierender Bürgermeister is now an obsolete formulation sometimes found in historic texts. * In an important city, especially in a city state (Stadtstaat), where one of the Bürgermeister has a rank equivalent to that of a minister-president (governor), there can be several posts called Bürgermeister in the city's executive college, justifying the use of a compound title for the actual highest magistrate (also rendered as lord mayor), such as: **Regierender Bürgermeister (literally 'governing burgomaster', commonly translated as governing mayor) in West Berlin and reunited Berlin, while in Berlin the term Bürgermeister without attribute – English Mayor – refers to his deputies,cf. Article 56 sec. 2 of the and while the heads of the 12 boroughs of Berlin are called Bezirksbürgermeister, English borough mayor.cf. Article 74 sec. 2 of the ** Erster Bürgermeister (literally First Burgomaster) in Hamburg ** Bürgermeister und Präsident des Senats ('Burgomaster and President of the Senate') in Bremen *Amtsbürgermeister (German; roughly translated: 'District Burgomaster') can be used for the chief magistrate of a Swiss constitutive canton, as in Aargau 1815–1831 (next styled Landamman) Contemporary use =By jurisdiction= Arnold von Brauweiler, a German burgomaster, known in German as Bürgermeister * Bürgermeister (literally: 'master of the citizens'), in German: in Germany, Austria, South Tyrol, and formerly in Switzerland. In Switzerland, the title was abolished mid-19th century; various current titles for roughly equivalent offices include Gemeindepräsident, Stadtpräsident, Gemeindeamtmann, and Stadtamtmann. ** Oberbürgermeister ('Supreme Burgomaster') is the most common version for a mayor in a big city in Germany (it is not in use in Austria). The Ober- (lit. upper) prefix is used in many ranking systems for the next level up including military designations. The mayors of cities, which simultaneously comprise one of Germany's 112 urban districts usually bear this title. Urban districts are comparable to independent cities in the English- speaking world. However, also the mayors of some cities, which do not comprise an urban district, but often used to comprise one until the territorial reforms in the 1970s, bear the title Oberbürgermeister. * Borgmester (Danish) * Borgarstjóri (Icelandic & Faroese) * Borgermester (Norwegian (Bokmål)) * Börgermester (Low German) * Burgomaestre (Spanish) * Purkmistr (Czech) * Burgumaisu (Basque) * Borgomastro or Sindaco-Borgomastro (Italian): in few communes of Lombardy * Burgemeester in Dutch: in Belgium a party-political post, though formally nominated by the regional government and answerable to it, the federal state and even the province.

In the Netherlands, mayors chair both the council of mayor and aldermen and the municipal council. They are members of the council of mayor and aldermen (, B&W;) and have their own portfolios, always including safety and public order. They also have a representative role for the municipal government, both to its civilians and to other authorities on the local, regional and national level. A large majority of mayors are members of a political party. This can be the majority party in the municipal council, but there are many exceptions on this. However, the mayors are expected to exercise their office in a non-partisan way. The mayor is appointed by the national government (the Crown) for a renewable six-year term. In the past, mayors for important cities were often chosen after negotiations (behind the screens) between the national parties. This appointment procedure has been criticised because it was seen by some as undemocratic. Especially the party D66 had a direct election of the mayor as one of the main objectives in its platform. In the early 2000s, proposals for change were discussed in the national parliament. However, opponents of the status quo were divided between two alternatives: direct election of the mayor by the people or appointment by the municipal council. A constitutional change to direct election gained a majority in both chambers but failed to pass the final vote in the Senate in March 2005. In the meantime, although the law remained the same, the practice changed. Nowadays, when a vacancy occurs, a special committee of the municipal council interviews (behind closed doors) candidates, which are pre-selected by the provincial governor (the King's Commissioner). After advice by the committee, the council express its preferences to the Minister of the Interior, who almost always follows this recommendation.

Biography Legendarily, Feng appeared one day at Guoqing Temple (located by the East China Sea, in the Tiantai mountain range), a monk with an unshaven head, riding a tiger. From then on, he took up residence in the temple behind the library, where he would hull rice and chant sutras. The few accounts of him record that he became close friends to Hanshan, and was the one who found the orphaned Shide, named him, and brought him to the temple. From these and other anecdotes, it appears that Feng was the oldest of the three. The circumstances of his death are as murky as his life: the stories in which Feng is any more than a name or foil for Hanshan cease after he healed a local prefect. It has been conjectured that Hanshan's Poem 50 refers to his death: ::Show me the person who doesn't die; ::death remains impartial. ::I recall a towering man ::who is now a pile of dust- ::the World Below knows no dawn ::plants enjoy another spring ::but those who visit this sorrowful place ::the pine wind slays with grief. Poetry Very few of Feng's poems survive, but the ones which do are very revealing; the third of the four confirms Feng's relationships with the other members of the Tientai Trio: ::Whenever Cold Mountain stops to visit, ::or Pick-Up pays his usual call, ::we talk about the mind the moon ::or wide open space- ::reality has no limits ::so anything real includes it all. The first of the poems appears to confirm the stories of how he was an itinerant monk prior to stopping at Kuoching Temple (and even then he would depart at least once for a pilgrimage to Mount Wutai): ::I have been to Tientai ::maybe a million times ::like a cloud or river ::drifting back and forth. ::Roaming free of trouble ::trusting the Buddha's spacious path ::while the world's forked mind ::only brings men pain. The fourth poem is especially important, since it unmistakably references the challenge the Fifth Patriarch of Zen set his would-be successors ~713 C. E. making it impossible for Feng (and by extension Hanshan and Shide) to predate the 720's, thereby eliminating many other dating possibilities: ::Actually there isn't a thing ::much less any dust to wipe away. ::Who can master this ::doesn't need to sit there stiff. (The exchange referenced was between two potential successors Shenxiu and Huineng. Shenxiu to demonstrate his mastery of Zen wrote the following poem: The body is the Bodhi Tree \\\\ the mind like a clear mirror. \\\\ Always wipe it clean, \\\\ don't let it gather dust. Huineng retorted with Bodhi isn't a tree, \\\\ what's clear isn't a mirror. \\\\ Actually, there isn't a thing- \\\\ where do you get this dust?) It is difficult to judge Feng's poetic oeuvre with only four works to judge by, and only one really poetic. But it appears that his poetry's formal structures were fairly conventional, and in ideas, from a strictly Buddhist perspective; Hanshan, in contrast, often played with rhymes and tones and structure, and very often dropped in Taoist references, to the point where his actual religious orientation is in some doubt. See for example Feng's second poem, which expresses strictly Buddhist ideas: ::Sinking like a rock in the Sea, ::drifting through the Three Worlds- ::poor ethereal creature ::forever immersed in scenes ::until a flash of lightning shows ::that life and death are dust in space. (The 'Three Worlds' refer to either those of the past, present, and future; or alternatively, those of form, formlessness, and becoming.)

It was explored and named by Captain George Vancouver for his aide, Peter Puget, in 1792. The ninth Puget Sound Update, from the Puget Sound Action Team reports that:Puget Sound Action Team. 2007 Puget Sound Update: Ninth Report of the Puget Sound Ambient Monitoring Program. Olympia, Washington. 260 pp. :\\"the Puget Sound has biological resources which include all of the living organisms which inhabit the marine waters and shorelines. These biological resources are plankton, invertebrates, fish, birds, mammals, and aquatic vegetation, including species that are either residential or migratory.\\" The abundance of creatures and foliage allowed for the native peoples of the area to thrive and prosper by harvesting it. Many of the problems of the Puget Sound originated from explorers and trappers hunting and killing the indigenous species off of which the natives thrived and prospered. In the past 30 years there has been a large recession in the populations of the species which inhabit the Puget Sound. The decrease has been seen in the populations of: forage fish, salmonids, bottom fish, marine birds, harbor porpoise and orcas. This decline is attributed to environmental issues in Puget Sound. Because of this population decline, there have been changes to the fishery practices, and an increase in petitioning to add species to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). There has also been an increase in recovery and management plans for many different area species. The cause of these environmental issues are, toxic contamination, eutrophication (low oxygen due to excess nutrients), and near shore habitat changes. The Puget Sound has been affected by urbanization and the toxic pollutants it produces. As a government document regarding this issue says, \\"A major contributor of these toxic pollutants entering the Sound is the stormwater that runs off our highways, roads, driveways, roofs, parking lots, disturbed soils, and other developed surfaces.\\" They also talk about the loss of habitat. In the last 125 years, the Puget Sound has lost or damaged 70 percent of their habitats including the salt marshes, eelgrass beds and the estuaries.  Puget Sound industry  Puget Sound, Washington is a body of water lying east of Admiralty Inlet, through which ocean waters reach inland some from the Pacific Coast to complex and intricate system of channels, inlets, estuaries, embayments and islands. Industries in this area include aerospace, military, biotechnology, fishing, electronics, computers, forest products, marine industries, telecommunications, transportation and other commerce industries. Due to improper storage methods for dangerous chemicals, such as arsenic, areas of soil and aquatic land in Puget Sound are being managed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Standards for the storage and discharge of industry chemicals have improved, and Puget Sound remains vital to the industries that depend upon it, such as shipping ports.http://www.lhwmp.org/home/BHW/reg_review.aspx Ports in Washington are diverse. Governed as municipalities, the ports operate shipping terminals, marinas, docks, and associated infrastructure, such as roads, railroads and parks. The fastest-growing part of Washington ports is industrial development.  Urbanization and population  The Puget Sound region has been rapidly growing. According to the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC), a board that plans for growth in the four central counties of the area (Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish and King counties), the combined population of these counties was nearly 3.4 million residents in 2003. Times have changed since the 1970s, when a billboard in Seattle read \\"the last person to leave Seattle please turn out the lights\\".Montgomery (2003), p. 8 Between 1970 and 2000, the Puget Sound region's population increased by 1.3 million people. The 12-county Puget Sound region, including Seattle and Tacoma, has quadrupled to four million people since the 1950s, and the state predicts one million more residents by 2025. The PSRC predicts that between 2000 and 2020 the region will increase by 1.7 million people. Another change the region faces involves the demographics of its population. The segment of its population ages 65 and older is projected to increase by 150 percent, making up 17 percent of the total population by 2040. The expansion of Microsoft and Boeing has spurred an economic growth in the area. This has major environmental implications, including pollution runoff and the altering of important shorelines. \\"One-third of Puget Sound shoreline has already been altered\\".Klinger, Terry, Assistant Professor, University of Washington, Lecture for Society and Oceans. 2005. Under the Growth Management Act (GMA), local governments plan, coordinate and manage for growth in Washington, while protecting natural resources and public interests. The GMA requires local governments to develop long-term comprehensive plans for land uses in their jurisdictions. Plans must be coordinated with surrounding counties and be approved by a regional board. Finally, as part of the GMA, local governments must address sensitive fish and wildlife areas through Critical Area Ordinances (CAOs). Hood Canal hypoxia Hood Canal is a fjord off the Puget Sound. Hypoxia is a low-oxygen condition occurring in Hood Canal. One overriding factor of this is the underwater topography of the canal. While the shallowest part of the canal is its entrance, where the ledge, or sill, of the canal measures only 150 feet (46 m) deep, the deepest parts of the canal are more than 600 feet (180 m) deep. The Hood Canal Dissolved Oxygen Program (HCDOP) and the United States Geological Service (USGS) are studying Hood Canal circulation, trying to model the tidal circulations and salinity distribution patterns between the canal and Admiralty Inlet. Other factors that, when combined with the constrictive shape, could also influence hypoxia in Hood Canal are: #Pacific Ocean marine water may be entering with a lower oxygen content than historically received. #Marine water may be entering at a density lighter than needed to flush out Hood Canal quickly or effectively. #Riverine freshwater input has changed—increased or decreased—altering the stratification (water) of Hood Canal marine life. #Organic material input may have increased. #Light input may have increased (algae growth increases with light, as well as organic nutrient input). #Wind currents may have altered water column circulation (Atmospheric circulation). The picture surrounding hypoxia in Hood Canal is complex; research models point to more than one contributing factor: Nutrient level. Nutrient level is a large issue due to the human impact. The supply of nutrients, primarily nitrates, to the euphotic zone is thought to impact levels of dissolved oxygen. Nutrients feed algae, which under the right conditions, \\"bloom\\" and then die and decompose; the entire process requires a large amount of oxygen. This decreases the oxygen in the water column, lowering the dissolved oxygen level. There are both natural and man-made sources of nutrients. The primary natural source is in ocean water that flushes Hood Canal. Man-made sources include leaking septic systems, storm water runoff, agriculture and various other sources causing nutrient pollution. The presence of nutrients leads to algae growth, which consumes oxygen when the algae die and decompose, contributing to the low oxygen conditions in these waters. Another factor mentioned by the HCDOP is the influence of the ocean water. The ocean water that enters Hood Canal is like most estuaries: fresh, warm water flows out at the surface and is replaced by cold, salty water at depth. The cold, salty ocean water that enters Hood Canal comes into Puget Sound from the open ocean and has not recently been in contact with the atmosphere. As a result, this water is initially somewhat depleted in oxygen. Oxygen levels will fluctuate throughout the year; this is due to seasonal changes in nutrient availability, solar radiation, and water column stratification (layers of water of different density, temperature, and salinity). Low oxygen conditions are at their worst in the late summer, after several months of limited flushing and maximum plankton production near the surface. In some years, oxygen becomes sufficiently depleted that animals cannot survive. These kills may occur either locally or over a wide area. Combined Sewage Overflow Combined sewage overflow (CSO) has been occurring in the Puget Sound. CSO occur during rain events when runoff with the combination of raw sewage overflows the pipes and it carries pollutants, harmful pathogens, and excess nutrients directly into Puget Sound.ECY: Washington State Department of Ecology [Internet]. c1994-2014.

[cited 2015 March 6]. Available from: ftp://ftp.cob.org/council/packets/1996/09_sep/16/packets/16sep1996_AB12686.pdf Due to high amounts of excess nutrients and water disturbance, there are fewer number of benthic invertebrate species found near CSO outfalls. One of the nutrients found in excess amounts is Nitrogen, which can cause low oxygen level. Excess nitrogen can causes algae blooms which leads to low oxygen level which is dangerous for marine organism that need oxygen. Furthermore, at the outfall the output disturbs the soils, which makes the water more turbid. Turbid water can increase the number of pathogens in the water.USGS: U.S. Geological Survey’s [Internet]. c2015. [cited 2015 March 20].

Available from: http://your.kingcounty.gov/dnrp/library/wastewater/cso/docs/WQA/80165-LAYOUT.pdf Furthermore, build-up in pollutants has been found to affect fish growth. To reach standards stated in the Clean Water Act, Washington State must have a long-term CSO Control Plan so that 1 or fewer overflow events occur on average in a year.King County [Internet]. c2015 [cited 2015 Feb 19]. Available from: http://kingcounty.gov/environment/wastewater/CSO.aspx =King County: CSO Long-term Control Plan and Integrated Plan Alternative= King County, Washington, US, has two plans to help improve CSO impacts on the environment: CSO Long-term Control Plan and the Integrated Plan Alternative. The Integrated Plan presents management of both runoff and sewage overflow, while the Long- term Control Plan focuses on decreasing sewage overflow. At various locations, King County monitors and assesses the water quality at CSO outfall locations. Between 1979 and 2012 King County working with the City of Seattle has been able to decrease CSO by about 1.5 billion gallons. The Integrated Plan Alternative is implemented by Seattle Public Utilities and expected to be completed by 2025.Seattle Public Utilities [Internet]. c2015 [cited 2015 Feb 19]. Available from: http://www.seattle.gov/UTIL/MyServices/DrainageSewer/Projects/SewageOverflowPrevention/index.htm The purpose of the plan is to reduce pollutants entering the water. It has suggested three methods: (1) increasing the number of streets that are swept; (2) build a water quality facility in South Park to remove pollutants; and (3) maintaining existing rain gardens and/or natural drainage systems. The CSO Long-term Control Plan is to be completed by 2030. There are four main strategies in the plan to decrease CSO impact on the environment: (1) underground storage tanks/tunnel; (2) Wet Weather treatment stations; (3) Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI); and (4) repairing/replacing existing outfalls/pipes. Underground storage tanks/tunnels are being built in North Beach, Magnolia, West Seattle, and Rainer Valley. Wet Weather treatment stations are being built in Elliot West and Henderson/MLK. GSI are being built at Barton, Highland Park, and South Green Park. At Salmon Bay (Ballard) and Leschi (Lake Washington) old outfalls and pipes are being replaced or repaired. The underground storage tank in Magnolia will be able to hold 1.5 million gallon during CSO events, which will eventually flow to the CSO treatment center in Smith Cove. The architecture of the facility was structured to collect and filter runoff by creating a rain garden. It helps clean water and provides habitat for wildlife such as birds, bees, and butterflies. =King County: Sediment Management Plan= King County has decreased the CSO discharge into the Puget Sound, however soils are still polluted due to past CSO discharges. The Sediment Management Plan was first created in the 1990s to deal with soil pollution at CSO outfalls. The cleanup methods include capping, dredging, and source control/natural recovery. CSO outfalls of concern include the sites at Duwamish/Diagonal, King Street, Hanford Street, Lander Street, Brandon Street, Denny Way, Norfolk Street, and Pier 53-55. At Denny Way CSO outfall, the polluted soil was removed through dredging and then improved the habitat by refilling the sea floor with clean soils to mimic surround area. Aquatic vegetation According to the 2007 Puget Sound Update: > Aquatic vegetation is a key component of the near shore environment that > supports the ecosystem through primary production and by providing habitat > to numerous species of fish, invertebrates, birds, and mammals. Puget Sound > is home to a diverse assemblage of aquatic plants and algae, each with > unique habitat requirements. Major threats to submerged aquatic vegetation > include physical disturbance, loss of water clarity, and excessive > nutrients. Known to be important ecosystem components that are sensitive to > anthropogenic stressors, eelgrass and kelp species are commonly recognized > indicators of aquatic vegetation health. There are twenty six species of kelp which grow along Washington’s shorelines, which makes it one of the highest sites of kelp diversity in the world.Gabrielson, P., T. Widdowson, S. Lindstrom, M. Hawkes, and R Scagel. 200. Keys to the benthic marine algae and seagrass of British Columbia, Southeast Alaska, Washington and Oregon. Phycological Contribution #5, University of British Columbia, Department of Botany 189 p. Changes in the oceans kelp have direct effect on other species. This is particularly due to the unique three-dimensional habitats that the plants provide for invertebrates, fish, birds, and mammals. Widespread loss of kelp throughout Puget Sound would have repercussions for the marine ecosystem as a whole. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an underwater grass that thrives in marine and estuarine water bottoms and spreads through rhizomes, or roots. It has been estimated by the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that Puget Sound is occupied by approximately of eelgrass. Research has shown that eelgrass beds in Puget Sound can be found in two different habitats: flats, which can be described as either large, shallow bays or small \\"pocket\\" beaches, and fringe beds along steep shorelines. Beds of eelgrass provide a vital link in the nearshore foodweb, creating underwater forests for biota such as salmon, herring, sand lance, and numerous invertebrates. Eelgrass beds provide nutrients and shelter for various biota in Puget Sound. As eelgrass and other seagrasses decay, it combines with other dead matter. This rich detritus is a staple for invertebrates, which are fed upon by salmonids, birds and other predators. Eelgrass functions as a protective cover from the predators for juvenile salmon and as a nursery for herring that deposit eggs among bed. Herring, in turn, are an important food source for juvenile and adult salmon. During low tide, eelgrass beds shelters other small animals from extreme temperatures, and in tideflats the beds act as a sponge for moisture. Eelgrass monitoring is conducted throughout Puget Sound using random sampling under the Submerged Vegetation Monitoring Program, Washington Department of Natural Resources, Nearshore Program. Results for 2003–2004 were posted in 2005. Many eelgrass populations were holding steady, but sharp declines were noted in five shallow bays in the San Juan Islands and 14 smaller sites in the greater Puget Sound. Eelgrass throughout the entire Hood Canal showed a steady decline. In eleven embayments there was almost of eelgrass lost between 1995 and 2004. A number of reasons contribute to the decline in eelgrass population, including, but not limited to: #Lack of appropriate substrate to grow upon #Lack of or poor-quality light, impacting photosynthesis #Changes in climate impacting currents, water temperature and water quality #Nutrient input, spurring algae growth, reducing light and oxygen availability #Sediment input, reducing light availability and quality #Physical alteration of the shoreline, potentially increasing wave energy or altering substrate in the nearshore area, sometimes both The Puget Sound Conservation and Recovery Plan (2005–2007) outlines a number of goals for improving management and health of the state's eelgrass beds. These include increasing protection over eelgrass beds on state-managed aquatic lands, and developing a statewide \\"seagrass management conservation plan\\" to be used by local, state and federal agencies. Impacted species =Groundfish= 60% of the ground fish populations are currently considered, by the areas scientific community, to be in acceptable or good conditions. The populations which are in decline are: middle-trophic level predators such as rockfish, spiny dogfish, Pacific cod, and hake. =Copper and quillback rockfish= There was a spawning decline for copper and quillback rockfish of close to 75% between 1970 and 1999; more recent data shows a continued decline. Many rockfish species which are popular to harvest in the area are showing large population decreases, while less popular species are showing signs of increased population. =Pacific herring= The Puget Sound has 19 Pacific herring stocks; the populations from all have decreased since 2002. The largest decreases are found in the north Puget Sound area; where stocks dropped form roughly 12,000 tons of spawning biomass to 4,000 tons in 2004. The Cherry Point stock had particularly large decreases. =Harbor porpoise= The harbor porpoise was once very abundant in the Puget Sound. However, its population declined to the point that it was rarely seen in the 1970s and 1980s. Its population has increased somewhat and it can now be seen in localized areas. =Orcas= Orcas in the south Puget Sound were added to the federal endangered species list in 2005. In 2007 their population numbered 86 (down from their peak population number of 98 in 1975). =Sea lions= The populations of sea lions in Washington State have increased. Steller sea lions specifically are showing an increase in population; 10% every year. =Harbor seal= The populations of harbor seals have been on the rise since the early 1970s. In 2007 there were approximately 14,000 harbor seals in the inland waters of Puget Sound alone. =Pinto abalone= Populations of the pinto abalone have sharply decreased due to the inability of the species to naturally reproduce. Between 1992 and 2005, in 10 long term monitoring stations, their populations declined from 351 animals per site, to 103 per site. =Olympia oyster= The population of Olympia oyster (Ostrea Lurida), been declining due to sewage contamination and the effects of sulfur liquor emissions (from pulp mills). Both of these things were shown to have serious effects on the reproductive part as well as the health part of Ostrea lurida. Some other problems include mining, logging, and boat traffic. Pollution like gasoline and motor oil from the boats is harmful to the species of oyster as well. The Journal of Shellfish Research states, \\"Although oysters may be able to tolerate brief exposure to motor oil and gasoline by closing their shell, up to 14% population mortality increases after 10 days [of exposure]\\". As the article states, another large problem for Olympia oysters is the human-caused sedimentation caused by topsoil runoff in areas of logging or mining. The sedimentation leads to murky waters and oysters that are buried under layers of runoff as well as non-secure places to inhabit. =Marine birds= There are over 100 species of marine bird which rely on the Puget Sound as habitat. A survey completed by the Western Washington University (WWU) reports that the total number of marine birds in the Puget Sound is decreasing. The cause of this decrease in population is not clear, although researchers suspect likely causes such as pollution, non-native species, and collisions with man made structures, abandoned or lost fishing gear, some fishing practices, unavailable food sources, and loss of habitat. =Scoters= There has been a decline of surf scoters, white-winged scoters, and black scoters. This decrease of scoters is the largest decrease in biomass of marine birds over the past 25 years in Puget Sound. =Loons and grebes= The loons and grebes which over-winter in Puget Sound have shown a population decrease of 75% in the past 10 years. (It is not known if this decline is due to a population decrease or a change in their winter location). =Salmon= Under provisions of the ESA, two salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest have been listed as endangered, but none within the Puget Sound.Cameron, Mindy. August 18, 2002. The Seattle Times. p. D1 One of the factors that contribute to declining salmon runs in Puget Sound, and the Pacific Northwest in general, is the lack of logjams in rivers. Logjams are essential to the survival of healthy salmon populations. Logjam and river current interaction carve deep pools into riverbeds, providing salmon and their young, also known as fry, with hiding places from predators. Logjams also force some of the water from the main river to spill out over the adjacent Floodplain, forming Tributaries along the river, which supply ideal habitat for maturing salmon. The natural processes of spawning and reaching maturity become much more difficult for salmon without the services logjams provide. Also, as the organisms that salmon feed on begin to dwindle due to factors including overfishing and invasive species, salmon are further threatened as their food sources become precarious, as is the case with herring populations around Puget Sound (Puget Sound Action Team). For more information see Salmon conservation. The increased urbanization around streams connected to the Puget Sound has led to the annual increase in premature (adult salmon who have not yet spawned) spawner mortality rates. The exposure to metals and petroleum hydrocarbons which originate from motor powered vehicles in the urban area, have led to the recurring fish kills. Salmon that transition from saltwater to freshwater are vulnerable to the toxic substances found in the urban streams.Scholz, Nathaniel L, Mark S Myers, Sarah G McCarthy, Jana S Labenia, Jenifer K McIntyre, Gina M Ylitalo, Linda D Rhodes, Cathy A Laetz, Carla M Stehr, Barbara L French, Bill McMillan, Dean Wilson, Laura Reed, Katherine D Lynch, Steve Damm, Jay W Davis, and Tracy K Collier. 2011. Recurrent Die-offs of Adult Coho Salmon Returning to Spawn in Puget Sound Lowland Urban Streams. PLoS ONE. 6, no. 12: e28013. Degradation of nearshore habitat \\"Nearshore\\" is most commonly defined as the backshore, intertidal and shallow subtidal areas of shoreline. In Washington, for example, the Shoreline Management Act defines the upland edge of this area to be behind the shoreline. Many groups also consider the nearshore to go fairly deep beyond the intertidal zone. More than 10,000 streams and rivers drain into Puget Sound. Approximately of shoreline surround the estuary, which is a mosaic of beaches, bluffs, deltas, mudflats and wetlands. A number of factors have been listed as potentially contributing to continued degradation of the nearshore environment. These include changing the nearshore by adding artificial structures, such as Tide gates and bulkheads increased pollution from various sources, such as failing septic systems; and various impacts from agricultural and industrial activities. One-third of more than of Puget Sound shoreline has been modified by some form of human development, including Armoring, Dredging, filling and construction of overwater structures. Protected species The Seattle Post reported that there are 17 species currently under protection from the Federal Endangered Species Act in the Puget Sound area. There are: Endangered: * Sei whale * Finback whale * Gray wolf * Marsh sandwort (plant) Threatened: * Marbled murrelet * Canada lynx * Steller sea lion * Chum salmon (Hood Canal) * Chinook salmon * Orcas (southern resident) * Grizzly bear * Bull trout * Spotted owl * Golden paintbrush (plant) * Water howellia (plant) * Kincaid's lupine (plant) Unprotected species that are \\"critically imperiled\\": *Sea otter: Weasel relative that was nearly hunted to extinction for its pelts. One of the few non-primates known to use tools. *Pallid bat: Large, pale bat with doglike face. Feeds at night on large insects. Emits a skunk-like odor when disturbed. *Oregon spotted frog: Green-, brown- or magenta-colored, with black blotches on its head and back. Now absent from 90 percent of former range. *American peregrine falcon: Removed from federal endangered list in 1999, but still endangered in Northwest. Cliffs were preferred nesting sites, but today many nest on high-rises. *Yellow-billed cuckoo: Adults are a foot long, with an exceptionally long tail marked with three large black spots. Only breeds in riparian forests and wetlands. *Green sturgeon: Olive-green fish grows to in length, 350 pounds and 70 years in age. First appeared more than 200 million years ago. *Walleye pollock: Member of the cod family. Annual catch in Alaskan waters is nearly 2 million metric tons. Important prey for marine mammals. *Sea cucumber: Relative of starfish and sea lilies; popular in Asian cuisine. Fourteen species found in Northwest waters. *Marsh shrew: Insect-eating aquatic shrew with fringe of hairs on toes to aid swimming. Can run on top of the water for several seconds. Invasive species Aquatic nuisance species are non-native plants or animals that threaten the diversity or abundance of native species; the Ecological stability of infested waters; or the commercial, agricultural or recreational activities that depend on such waters. In recent years, the Puget Sound has seen an increase of invasive species, specifically from Japan, as early as 1971. Invasive species have come to the Puget Sound via several factors, including aquaculture, importation of live seafood, shipping (attached to ship hulls and through ballast water), research and academic institutions, deliberate introductions, pet stores and public aquaria, and natural dispersal. The Japanese wire weed Sargassum muticum and the marine grass Spartina are currently two of the most damaging species. In response to such trends, ocean species have migrated to places they shouldn't. The Puget Sound has the most introduced invasive species. Nationwide, about 400 of the 958 (42 percent) species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA are considered to be at risk, primarily due to competition with and predation by non-native species. The WDFW is now attempting to combat its exotic species problem with the Washington State Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan. Under this plan, Washington State Patrol Commercial Vehicle Inspectors search incoming vessels for harmful invasive species, such as the zebra mussel, and decontaminate the vessels before they can spread the organism. The city of Olympia, Washington has worked with the United States Environmental Protection Agency to use the shells of invasive water snail which has started to decrease the numbers of the endemic Olympia Oyster. The invasive arched slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata) shell is taken and, packed into the sidewalk. With doing so, the shells of the said invasive species of water snail will slow down the runoff and will reduce the flow of stormwater which will in turn reduce flooding and potential environmental damage. Walker says that \\"The scoop-shaped shell of the snail could help slow storm water. Currently the city uses rock and gravel beneath sidewalks to stabilize the concrete. City officials want to try using snail shells instead.\\" The millions of snail shells could act as micro- reservoirs slowing the flow of stormwater and reducing the chances of city streams, brooks, and waterways. Emmett Dobey, the program manager at Olympia’s Department of Public Works says, \\"The process also seemed to reduce the amount of pollutants that typically come along for the ride\\". Oil spills Since 1989, there have been 225 oil spills in Puget Sound. Nearly every day Puget Sound imports 550,000 barrels of unrefined oil, thus making Puget Sound one of the country's primary centers for refining petroleum. One such spill on October 14, 2004 in Dalco Passage leaked nearly 1,000 gallons over Vashon and Maury Islands. Solutions The Washington state government has adapted the federal government's Marine Protected Area (MPA) system into designated Aquatic Reserves, defined as \\"aquatic lands of special educational or scientific interest or lands of special environmental importance that are threatened by degradation\\". Aquatic Reserves are meant to serve as aquatic versions of national parks or sanctuaries. Through the Aquatic Reserve Program, the DNR hopes to control these areas in an effort to restore, preserve or enhance habitats and species that directly tie into the aquatic ecosystem. The first Aquatic Reserve created under the program was at Maury Island in November 2004. Further candidate sites under review include Cherry Point, Fidalgo Bay and Cypress Island. =Legislation= Puget Sound Partnership reports that the Washington State Legislature included several priority items in the 2010 Supplemental Budget which are intended to support restorative efforts of the environment. This includes funding totaling $50 million for Washington State Department of Ecology stormwater project funding. \\"Stormwater is a primary source of toxic chemicals and other hazardous materials washing into Puget Sound and other water bodies\\" .Puget Sound Partnership There is also $42 million allocated to projects targeting toxic site cleanup in the Puget Sound. The specifics of this legislature are as follows: * $1.645 million for a wastewater treatment plant and reclamation project at Potlatch on Hood Canal. This money, through the Department of Ecology, will allow the project to be completed and will help restore the health of Hood Canal. * $2.8 million for Carpenter Creek estuary restoration in Kitsap County through the Department of Fish and Wildlife to remove a culvert blocking fish passage and restore tidal function creating approximately 28 acres of estuary habitat. * $1 million for the Puget Sound Near Shore Ecosystem Restoration Project (PSNERP) through the Department of Fish and Wildlife to complete scientific work and near shore restoration projects. Preliminary engineering and property assessments will be conducted for a portfolio of priority near shore restoration opportunities that would be eligible for federal funding through the US Army Corps of Engineers. * $381,000 for the Nooksack Forks large woody debris placement for habitat enhancement through the Department of Fish and Wildlife. This project will construct six large woody structures along 1.5 miles of the Middle Fork Nooksack River and augment 20 stable large wood structures on five channel islands in the North Fork Nooksack River. * $185,000 for the South Fork Nooksack River restoration through the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The project will remove a barrier to provide fish passage to 1.4 miles of river, placement of stable log jams, and 41 acres of riparian planting along 2,900 linear feet of stream and several adjoining wetlands. * $3 million for Commencement Bay cleanup in Pierce County through the Department of Natural Resources. This project will remove 2,300 contaminated pilings to allow completion of in-water remediation of toxic contamination at the Asarco Superfund site. * In addition, the Puget Sound Partnership played a key role in securing $15 million to help acquire the Maury Island gravel pit. This complicated transaction is still pending but the state resources will help lead to its successful culmination. The money comes from state accounts funded by polluters, not general tax revenue. Pollution advisories Pollution advisories are posted for some of the beach areas on the Puget Sound. These advisories warn the public of health concerns due to contact with sand and water of the posted areas. Showering after contact with material from these areas is advised. It is also advised to avoid eating fish and shell fish from these areas.

Originally built for musical reasons, it was later used to announce the time and is now a tourist attraction. The Bell Tower of Beijing (), stands closely behind the drum tower. Together, the Bell Tower and Drum Tower have panoramic views over central Beijing and before the modern era, they both dominated Beijing's ancient skyline. Function Bells and drums were musical instruments in ancient China. Later they were used by government and communities to announce the time. The Bell and Drum towers were central to official timekeeping in China in the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. The Bell and Drum Towers continued to function as the official timepiece of Beijing until 1924, when the Beijing Coup led to the expulsion of Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, from the Forbidden City, and the adoption of western-styled clockwork for official time-keeping. History The Drum Tower was built in 1272 during the reign of Kublai Khan, at which time it stood at the very heart of the Yuan capital Dadu. At that time it was known as the Tower of Orderly Administration (Qizhenglou). In 1420, under the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty, the building was reconstructed to the east of the original site and in 1800 under the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty, large-scale renovations were carried out. Following the Beijing Coup in 1924, Feng Yuxiang removed the official status of the towers, replacing them with western time-keeping methods, and renamed the building \\"Mingchilou\\", or the \\"tower of clarifying shame\\". Objects related to the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of Beijing and later the May 30 Massacre of 1925 were put on display, turning the towers into a museum. The upper story of the building currently serves as the People's Cultural Hall of the East City District. In the 1980s, after much repair, the Bell and Drum Towers were opened to tourists. Architecture The Drum Tower is a -tall two-story building made of wood. In the upper story of the building housed 24 drums, of which only one survives. New drums have been made to replace them. Nearby stands the Bell Tower, a -tall edifice with gray walls and a green glazed roof.

The Survey of Activities of Young People (SAYP) undertaken in 1999 indicated that collecting fuel or fetching water are by far the most common work-related activity done by children in South Africa. South African stakeholders have indicated, in the consultative process that led to the Child Labour Programme of Action, that the fetching of water over long distances should be regarded as a priority, given its prevalence and associated hazards. According to the Child Labour Programme of Action, this work should not be seen as child labour, a term which implies that someone benefits unduly from the work that children do. Poor households have little control over the distance to water from the homestead, and often have no alternative but to ask their children to help in carrying water. Therefore, stakeholders in the country indicated that fetching water should rather be seen as a priority form of child work that should be addressed by the government's programme to deliver water to all households by 2008. By delivering water to such households, the extremely long periods spent by some children in collecting water could be reduced, thereby making more time available for schooling and other activities. It should also reduce the hazards they are exposed to. Accordingly, the Programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour (TECL), a programme to kickstart action on the Child Labour Programme of Action, commissioned Dynacon Engineering and the Human Sciences Research Council to do research and design pilot projects with a focus on water delivery in distant areas. The purpose of the overall project is to investigate the phenomenon, to design and run pilot projects, and to develop and implement policy to assist in water delivery in such areas. This project was run in the following stages: Stage 1: Research and design The research and design stage of this pilot includes three processes: *Environmental scan of stakeholders, policies and literature, on the relevant pilot project focus: (a) report on stakeholder consultations and analysis; (b) literature survey, including analysis of relevant quantitative surveys and qualitative research; (c) recommended sites for possible implementation of the project, where a baseline study is then conducted; and (d) initial suggestions on how the project could be implemented. This report should be available soon at this [link]. *Baseline study: within each of the selected candidate site, to inform the final choice of sites and to assist with the design of the pilot. *Project design for pilots in each selected sites. Stage 2: Implementation of the pilot project It is planned that the pilot project will run in two of the sites where the baseline study is being conducted, from about August 2005. Stage 3: Development and implementation of policy Policy will be developed during the pilot design and implementation stages. During the third stage a process through which the main implementing agencies, such as relevant government departments, will consider and possibly adopt key recommendations, operationalise measures, including budgeting for them. During this stage the pilot projects will be closed, or handed to government departments, agencies or NGOs. Participating institutions The following institutions are involved in the project: *Department of Labour, acting as the lead department of the Child Labour Programme of Action; *Department of Provincial and Local Government *Department of Water Affairs and Tourism.

Named by W R Morris after the city of dreaming spires, the university town in which he grew up, the manufacture of Morris's Oxford cars would turn Oxford into an industrial city. From 1913 to mid-1935 Oxford cars grew in size and quantity. In 1923 they with the Cowley cars were 28.1 per cent of British private car production. In 1925 Morris sold near double the number and they represented 41 per cent of British production. Meanwhile, Oxfords grew larger from the first 1018 cc, Nine horsepower, two-seater car to the last 2½-litre Twenty horsepower car. The model name was recycled in 1948 and lasted almost another 23 years through to 1971 but in this time the market sector and engine-size remained nearly constant between 1476 cc and 1622 cc. Oxford bullnose 1913–19 William Morris's first car was called Oxford in recognition of its home city. It was announced in The Autocar magazine in October 1912 and production began in March 1913.The Bullnose and Flatnose Morris, Lytton P Jarman and Robin I Barraclough, David & Charles, Newton Abbot 1976 Virtually all components were bought-in and assembled by Morris. It was a small car with a 1018 cc four-cylinder side-valve engine with fixed cylinder head from White & Poppe. The car got its popular name, Bullnose, from its distinctive round- topped radiator at first called the bullet nose. Most bodies were of the two- seat open-tourer type, there was also a van version, but the chassis did not allow four-seat bodies to be fitted, it was not strong enough and too short. =Bullnose de luxe= It was first displayed at the Olympia Motor Show which opened 7 November 1913. The standard model remained in production unchanged. The new de luxe had a longer wheelbase, , and track was now . The range of bodies was now expanded from the simple two-seater. Its front axle and steering had been re-designed to reduce \\"bump-steer\\"and its radiator capacity increased. =Cowley= The American engined Continental Cowley, with most other significant components US sourced, shown to the press in April 1915, was a 50 percent larger engined (1495 cc against 1018 cc), longer, wider and better equipped version of this Morris Oxford with the same \\"Bullnose\\" radiator. The Cowley's stronger and larger construction could carry a four- passenger body. Oxford bullnose 1919–26 The 1919 Oxford (advertised as early as September 1918) was assembled from locally made components and now took on the rather more substantial aspect of 1915's Cowley. Longer and stronger than the old Oxford, enough to carry five passengers, the new Oxford retained the pre-war Bullnose radiator style in its larger version. From August 1919, the Cowley became the downmarket \\"no frills\\" variant with only a 2-seater body and lighter smaller tyres.\\"Light\\" Cars. The Times, Saturday, Feb 21, 1920; pg. 5; Issue 42340 The new car's 11.9 fiscal horsepower 1548 cc engine was made under licence in Coventry for Morris by a British branch of Hotchkiss the French ordnance company. =14/28= In 1923 the engine was enlarged to 13.9 fiscal horsepower, 1802 cc. This became known as the 14/28 engine. In 1925 it got a longer wheelbase chassis to move it further from the Cowley, and four-wheel brakes. This model of the Oxford would be the basis of the first MG, the 14/28 Super Sports. 1926 mid-year switch to flatnose Oxford Six F-type bullnose A short-lived 17 hp six-cylinder variant, The F-Type Oxford Six, was displayed for the first time as a four seated cabriolet at the November 1922 Olympia Motor Show.The Motor Show. The Times, Tuesday, Nov 07, 1922; pg. 5; Issue 43182 The first open four-seater tourer was sold to Lord Redesdale. Only 50 were made and, after the initial run, they were assembled to special order. It remained available until 1926. The 2320 cc engine proved unreliable, two intense vibration periods weakened and broke crankshafts and few were sold. Oxford flatnose 1926–30 The distinctive bullnose radiator was dropped in 1926 in an updated version of the car. The engines remained the same but a new range of bodies was offered including all- steel saloons. There were substantial changes to the chassis frame which was now firmly fixed to the bulkhead or scuttle. The radiator cooling surface was increased sixty per cent Oxford 15.9 The 2½-litre Oxford 15.9 Empire model was displayed as \\"a Colonial Chassis\\" at the Olympia Motor Show of October 1926. The standard coachwork is a four or five seater body with four doors.Cars Of To-Day. The Times, Tuesday, Jun 28, 1927; pg. 11; Issue 44619. The car can be driven safely through 20 inches, 510 mm, of water. The ground clearance is 10¼ inches, 260 mm. A full 11 inches, 278 mm, is allowed at the forward running board bracket cross stay. This clearance is now greater than on many American cars. This \\"falsifies hostile propaganda to the contrary\\".

The Times, Monday, Sep 03, 1928; pg. 9; Issue 44988 Oxford 16/40 A revised version of the slow-selling 4-cylinder 15.9 it was announced in September 1928. It was probably given this new name before the announcement of the 15.9 horsepower Oxford Six. There were minor improvements of appearance but this was no more than a 15.9 with a new name. This 16/40 was replaced by Oxford Six 15.9 hp. Oxford Six 1929–1934 A 1938 cc six- cylinder version, the LA series Oxford Six, was made between 1929 and 1933. It was much more successful than the 1920 version. The all-steel body was made over the road at Cowley by W R Morris's joint venture with American Edward G Budd, Pressed Steel Company. It had striking similarities to a recent Dodge body. By 1930 supply problems were such that it was replaced by a similar but coachbuilt (wood framed) body. In August 1930 a shorter chassis more expensive version was announced and named Morris Major Six,The Times, Saturday, Aug 30, 1930; pg. 12; Issue 45605 For other Morris Sixes: =Upgrade= Oxford Six 6-light saloon Q-series registered December 1932 direction indicator on bracket above spare In September 1932, the gearbox gained a fourth speed and the engine grew to 2062 cc with the Q-series unit.The Times, Thursday, Sep 01, 1932; pg. 7; Issue 46227 Direction indicators, a set of three coloured lights on each side of the car visible from front and rear were fitted.

The Times, Monday, Aug 28, 1933; pg. 6; Issue 46534 The chassis frame was quite new and now also contained a cruciform shape. =Tax relief= This Oxford Six was renamed Oxford Sixteen in September 1934 and placed within the new 16 to 25 horsepower range of Morris Big Sixes expanded in view of the 25 per cent reduction in Horse Power tax expected in 1935.The Times, Tuesday, Sep 04, 1934; pg. 14; Issue 46850 Oxford Sixteen and Oxford Twenty 1934–35 The Six name was changed to Sixteen, from the car's 16 hp tax horsepower category, in September 1934 when its 2062 cc engine was joined by the 2561 cc Twenty sold for the same price, the size of engine being the only difference. There was an intermediate eighteen horsepower Isis. Two styles of coachwork were available, the saloon and a Special coupé both fitted with a Pytchley sliding head (sunroof) and the sliding head was wired for radio. Oxford Twenty six-light saloon 1935 Barely nine months later these cars were superseded by members of the Morris Big Six series II range: Sixteen or Eighteen and Twenty-one or Twenty Five announced 2 July 1935. The Oxford name disappeared from new Morris cars until 1948. Oxford Taxi Nuffield Oxford Series I Nuffield's Oxford Taxi was produced from 1947 to 1953 Oxford Series MO 1948–54 After the Second World War the one much larger 13.5 fiscal horsepower Oxford Series MO replaced the range of Ten horsepower series M, Morris's Twelve and Morris's Fourteen. It was announced along with the new 918 cc Morris Minor and the 2.2-litre Morris Six MS on 26 October 1948. Designed by Alec Issigonis, the Oxford, along with the Minor, introduced unibody construction techniques. The MO was sold as a 4-door saloon and 2-door Traveller estate with an exposed wooden frame at the rear. Both were four-seaters. A six-cylinder version was sold as the Morris Six MS. It was replaced by the Oxford Series II announced Tuesday 18 May 1954.Morris Oxford. The Times, Wednesday, May 19, 1954; pg. 4; Issue 52935 Morris Oxford Series MO Traveller Oxford Series II 1954–56 The extensively redesigned Oxford announced in May 1954 was given a new shape directly foreshadowing the BMC ADO17 and, following the formation of BMC, notably getting the Austin-designed B-Series OHV straight-4. Styling was entirely new though the rounded body maintained a family resemblance to the Morris Minor. Sales remained strong when the Series III arrived in 1956. A 2.6-litre six-cylinder 7-inches longer Morris Isis version was announced 12 July 1955 with a saloon or Traveller estate body. Hindustan Motors of India produced the four-cylinder version of this car (except the air-vent situated upon the bonnet) naming it Hindustan Landmaster.

The Times, Friday, Aug 23, 1957; pg. 11; Issue 53927 A Traveller estate car version of the Series V Farina body was announced 28 September 1960. The new body now provided a double bed size sleeping compartment about 6 ft long and 4 ft wide. The back of the car had a tail- board hinged at the bottom and an upper panel hinged at the top. The Morris version had a single bench front seat and cost £10 more than the equivalent Austin Countryman.'Double Bed' New Estate Cars. The Times, Wednesday, Sep 28, 1960; pg. 4; Issue 54888 Oxford Series V 1959–61 For 1959, the Oxford, announced on Lady Day 25 March 1959,New Morris Oxford. The Times, Wednesday, Mar 25, 1959; pg. 8; Issue 54418 was merged into the mid-sized Pininfarina- designed BMC Farina range along with a half-dozen other previously announced models, including the 1958 Wolseley 15/60 and 1959 Riley 4/68, Austin A55 Cambridge Mark II, and MG Magnette Mark III. The Series IV Traveller was still sold for the first year after which a Series V Traveller was made. In all, 87,432 Series V Oxfords were built. Oxford Series VI 1961–71 All five Farina cars were updated in October 1961The British Motor Corporation. The Times, Wednesday, Oct 18, 1961; pg. 7; Issue 55215 with a new 1.6-litre (1622 cc/98 in3) version of the B-Series engine, longer wheelbase and a new revised look. The tail fins had been trimmed and there were still detail changes between the marques. The Morris retained the Series V dash, while the Austin had an all-new fake woodgrain design. The Morris Oxford Traveller (estate) Series V was replaced by a Series VI, although little changed apart from the front grille. A diesel-engined Oxford Series VI, introduced shortly after the 1961 update, was popular as a taxi. Variants of the same diesel engine enjoyed a long life in marine applications. The Oxford VI remained in production until 1971 with 208,823 produced. The Oxford range was to have been replaced by the 1967 Morris 1800, but in the event both were built until Oxford VI production ended in 1971 because, in terms both of pricing and of interior space, the 1800 fell into the market segment of a larger car. The Morris 1800 continued in production until 1975, when it was succeeded by the Princess. At the smaller end of the market the Oxford VI was replaced by the Morris Marina, which also succeeded the smaller Morris Minor.

Early years Johnston was born in Topeka, Kansas, on September 14, 1892, the son of a missionary, William Johnston. The elder Johnston brought his family to Flagstaff, Arizona, on September 16, 1896, to serve Navajos residing on the western part of the Navajo Reservation. Philip's father was able to intervene and defuse a potentially violent clash known as the Padre Canyon Incident, which revealed underlying tensions between Navajos and Anglos involving livestock rustling. For resolving that incident in a peaceful manner, local Navajo leaders allowed Reverend Johnston to build a mission 12 miles north of Leupp, Arizona. After that incident, Philip's father worked to expand the boundaries of the western part of the Navajo reservation in order to resolve livestock rustling disputes on which developing tensions were generally centered. On the reservation, young Philip learned to speak Navajo while playing with Navajo children. In 1901, Philip traveled to Washington, D.C., with his father and local Navajo leaders when they spoke to the newly appointed President Theodore Roosevelt to persuade him to add more land to the Navajo Reservation via an Executive Order. Philip was the Navajo/English translator between the local Navajo leaders and President Roosevelt. Around 1909–10, Johnston attended the Northern Arizona Normal School, now Northern Arizona University, where he earned an academic degree. In March 1918 he enlisted in the U.S. Army's 319th Engineers, where he received a reserve commission. Between March and September 1918 he trained in Camp Fremont at Menlo Park, California, before being shipped to France as part of the AEF to participate in World War I. It is here that he may have heard about Comanches being used as code talkers by U.S. Army units. Johnston attended the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, where he earned his graduate civil engineering degree in 1925. Afterwards he took a job with the city of Los Angeles water department. The Navajo code talkers project Though he worked in Los Angeles he maintained his social connections with the Navajo people with whom he grew up. He was working as a civilian in Los Angeles when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor. After the attack he had read of the U.S. Army using Comanches in their Louisiana field maneuvers to transmit military communications and began to think that the Navajo language could also be applied in this manner. He presented this idea to the United States Marine Corps (USMC), and he was directed to present his proposal. Johnston recruited four Navajos who were working in the Los Angeles shipyards, and arranged to demonstrate the utility of using the Navajo language to transmit military communications. The officer in charge of this demonstration was Communications Officer, Amphibious Force, Fleet Marine Force (FMF) Major James E. Jones, USMC at Camp Elliot, San Diego and Commanding Officer; Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet General Clayton Barney Vogel heard of the event and attended the demonstration. Initially Philip thought the Navajo language could be used unmodified to transmit military communications, using conversational Navajo. Just before the actual demonstration started, the Navajos received their samples of common military expressions they were to convey to each other. They informed the gathered personnel that in order to send the military messages they would have to use word and letter substitution methods to convey the messages. After some deliberation to agree upon which Navajo words would represent English equivalents the Navajos were divided into two groups and put into separate rooms, where field phones had been installed, at opposite ends of the same building. At that point they transmitted the common military expressions they were assigned to be coded into Navajo and decoded into English, by verbally encrypting, transmitting and decoding the messages nearly verbatim from English, to Navajo and back into English. Philip indicated that this Camp Elliot exercise revealed limitations to using conversational Navajo for military communications and that he was inspired to use the letter and word substitution methods to encrypt Navajo. On the other hand, USMC documents indicate that it was after this demonstration, when they were independently investigating the logistics of using the Navajo language as a code, that it was Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel who stated that a coding system for Navajo had to be created. General Vogel was so impressed with the Camp Elliot demonstration that he asked the Commandant of the Marine Corps to recruit 200 Navajos. But Vogel was given authorization to recruit only 30 Navajos, under a pilot program status to investigate the feasibility of this proposed program with actual Navajos. On the morning of May 4, 1942, 29 Navajo recruits boarded the bus at Ft. Defiance, Arizona, were transported to the induction center at Ft. Wingate, New Mexico, and, after lunch, were transported overnight to Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego (MCRD, SD) for administrative in-processing, then to start their seven weeks of standard recruit training.McClain (2001), p. 39. Upon completion of recruit training the first all-Navajo Platoon 382 graduated from MCRD, SD on June 27, 1942, where they were immediately ordered to report to Camp Elliot for about eight weeks of basic communications training and to develop a code based on the Navajo language.McClain (2001), pp. 45–46, 58. As for developing the code, the Navajos were guided by a cryptographic officer under the command of now Lieutenant Colonel Jones in the basics of employing letter and word substitution encryption methods in the formulation of the code.McClain (2001), pp. 50–51. Shortly after the beginning of this project three additional Navajo Marines were added to the program, and together the 32 Navajos worked to develop the code. Their stay in Camp Elliot ended in the latter half of August 1942.McClain (2001), pp. 54, 58. Based upon the successful training of the pilot talker program on August 25, 1942, the authorization to fulfill the recruitment of 200 Navajos commenced and Marine units \\"were asked to submit recommendations relative to the number of Navajos they could usefully employ\\".8 April 1943 Memorandum. After training, one group of 50 were assigned to the 1st Marine Division, a second group of 16 were assigned to the 6th Marines and the 2nd Signal Company of the 2nd Marine Division.McClain (2001), pp. 60–61. Three individuals were retained stateside to recruit and train Navajos to become code talkers. The first group of Navajo code talkers arrived at Guadalcanal on September 18, 1942, near Lunga Point.McClain (2001), p. 66. The second group arrived with the 6th Marines on January 4, 1943, and relieved the 1st Marine Division code talkersMcClain (2001), p. 88. and then participated in the latter stages of the Battle of Guadalcanal.Rottman (2002), p. 131. After the USMC officially instituted the \\"talker\\" program, Johnston asked the USMC for a special dispensation to serve in the Navajo Code Talking Program as a Staff Sergeant. His request was granted on September 22, 1942, and he served as a school administrator for the \\"confidential\\" program. By October 26, 1942, Staff Sergeant Philip Johnston USMCR and Corporal John A. Benally USMC, one of the three stateside code talkers, were sent out to recruit more Navajos to join the program. From late October through November 1942, they recruited Navajos throughout the western portion of the reservation, until they were recalled back to Camp Elliot. On December 7, 1942, the Navajo Communication School at Camp Elliot began formal lessons under Johnston's supervision.22 February 1943 letter. Navajo recruits trickled in and went through standard Marine Corps boot camp, whereupon after graduation they were sent to Camp Elliot. The next all-Navajo platoon to go through boot camp was Platoon 297 in March 1943 at MCRD, SD.McClain (2001), p. 78. Johnston may have proposed the idea of using the Navajo language to encrypt USMC tactical communications, but he was not yet on active duty with the USMC to be present during its creation by the first 29 + 3 Navajos who created the vocabulary with guidance by a USMC cryptographic officer.

It was adopted 3 November 1950, after fourteen days of Assembly discussions, by a vote of 52 to 5, with 2 abstentions.The Byelorussian SSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and the Ukrainian SSR voted against. Argentina and India abstained. See The resolution--also known as the \\"Acheson Plan\\"--was designed to provide the UN with an alternative avenue for action when at least one P5 member is using its veto to obstruct the Security Council from carrying out its functions mandated by the UN Charter. To facilitate prompt action by the General Assembly in the case of a deadlocked Security Council, the resolution created the mechanism of the \\"emergency special session\\" (ESS).UN General Assembly Emergency Special Sessions. UN.org. Emergency special sessions have been convened under this procedure on ten occasions, with the most recent convened in 1997. However, unlike preceding ESSs, the tenth ESS has been 'adjourned' and 'resumed' on numerous occasions, over the past several years, and remains adjourned. Indeed, more than ten separate 'meetings' have been held by the Assembly, whilst sitting in tenth ESS, since 2000.See A/ES-10/PV.1 onwards.

It was adopted by 52 votes to 5,Czechoslovakia, Poland, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic with 2 abstentions.India and Argentina In the closing days of Assembly discussions leading up to the adoption of 377 A, US delegate to the UN, John Foster Dulles, made specific reference to the Korean War as a chief motivator in the passage of the resolution: > Then came the armed attack on the Republic of Korea and it seemed that the > pattern of 1931A reference to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. > had in fact begun to repeat itself and that the third world war might be in > the making. And that might have been--and I think it would have been--had it > not been for a series of accidental circumstances which made it possible to > improvise collective resistance to that aggression. The principal accidental circumstance referred to by Dulles was that the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time of the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, and had been since January 1950, owing to its discontent over the UN's refusal to recognize the People's Republic of China's representatives as the legitimate representatives of China,Malanczuk, P: Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law, Ed. 7, page 375, Routledge, 1997 returning only on 1 August 1950 to assume the rotating role of Council President, for that month. This circumstance had meant that the Security Council was able to adopt its resolutions 83, of 27 June 1950, and 84, of 7 July 1950, thereby establishing a UN-mandated force for South Korea \\"to repel the armed attack\\" from the North. Had the Soviet Union been seated at the Council during the months of June and July, the relevant draft resolutions would almost certainly have been vetoed, and the United States was well aware of this, as evidenced by the above statement.  Assembly discussions on the \\"Joint Seven-Power draft resolution\\"  Some of the key statements made during Assembly discussions on 377 A, whilst sitting in plenary, include: = United States (John Foster Dulles) = > \\"If, in response to our resolution, the Member States do actually establish > a system which ensures that aggression will be promptly exposed, if they > maintain a collective strength, and if they have both the will and the way > to use that strength promptly in case of need, then a third world war may be > permanently averted... It would be vastly reassuring to all who love peace > if here we could adopt unanimously a programme which only aggressors need > fear.\\" ... \\"We must organize dependably the collective will to resist.

Indeed, it is impossible to > conceive that the authors of the Charter at San Francisco would have lent > themselves to a proposition so far out of tune with the hopes and wishes of > the peoples of the world.\\" ... \\"This resolution should help to make > aggression less likely by giving notice to any intending aggressor that he > risks uniting the world against him...

It has been invoked by both the Security Council (7 times) and the General Assembly (5 times). Ten of those cases took the form of Emergency Special Sessions. = Security Council invoked =  Middle East (1956) - France and UK veto - 1st Emergency Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 119. Although \\"Uniting for Peace\\" was enacted because of Soviet vetoes, its first use was, unexpectedly, against two NATO members. The Assembly's first emergency special session was instigated by a procedural vote of the Security Council on its Resolution 119 of 31 October 1956,UN Security Council resolutions of 1956. UN.org as a result of the Suez Crisis, which commenced 29 October 1956. France and the United Kingdom were the only two Council members to vote against the adoption of Council resolution 119, and were likewise, along with Israel, the principal antagonists in the conflict with Egypt; a conflict that the United States wanted to end. The session's meetings were held between 1 November and 10 November 1956. On 7 November 1956, the Assembly adopted resolution 1001, thereby establishing the United Nations Emergency Force I (UNEF I) to \\"secure and supervise the cessation of hostilities\\". The Assembly, by its own resolutions, not only established UNEF I, but also called for \\"an immediate cease-fire\\", and recommended \\"that all Member States refrain from introducing military goods in the area\\", thereby authorizing military sanctions.  Hungary (1956) - USSR veto - 2nd Emergency Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 120. Second UNGA Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in Hungary” adopted five resolutions, including Resolution 1004 (ES-II) mandating a commission of inquiry into foreign intervention in Hungary.  Middle East (1958) - USSR veto - 3rd Emergency Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 129. Third UNGA Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in the Middle East” adopted Resolution 1237 (ES-III) calling for early withdrawal of foreign troops from Jordan and Lebanon.  Congo (1960) - USSR veto - 4th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 157. Third Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in the Middle East” adopted Resolution 1237 (ES-III) calling for early withdrawal of foreign troops from Jordan and Lebanon.  Bangladesh (1971) - USSR veto - Resolved without Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 303. The Twenty-Sixth Regular Session was seated no Emergency Special Session was needed so the issue was handled under the agenda item “UN Assistance to East Pakistan Refugees”.  Afghanistan (1980) - USSR veto - 6th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 462. Sixth Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in Afghanistan” adopted Resolution ES-6/2 calling for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.  Middle East (1982) - US veto - 9th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by Security Council Resolution 500. Ninth Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in the Middle East” adopted Resolution ES-9/1 declaring Israel a non peace-loving state and calling on members to apply a number of measures on Israel. = General Assembly invoked =  Korea (1951) - USSR veto  Following three vetoes by the USSR on the situation in Korea, six Security Council members requested the General Assembly to consider the situation (A/1618). The Security Council subsequently removed the item from its agenda, enabling the General Assembly to freely discuss the matter under Article 11 of the UN Charter. In resolution 498(V), the Assembly used the language of the Uniting for Peace resolution: \\"noting that the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security with regard to Chinese communist intervention in Korea . . .\\"  Middle East (1967) - USSR failed to obtain 9 votes - 5th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by General Assembly at the request of USSR (A/6717) and vote (98-3-3). Fifth Emergency Special Session on “The Situation in the Middle East” adopted six resolutions, including Resolutions 2253 and 2254 (ES-V) calling on Israel to rescind unilateral measures in Jerusalem.  Palestine (1980) - US veto - 7th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by General Assembly request Senegal (A/ES-7/1). Seventh Emergency Special Session on “The Question of Palestine” adopted eight resolutions (ES-7/2 through ES-7/9) calling for the unconditional and total withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied since 1967.  Namibia (1981) - France, UK and US veto - 8th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by General Assembly at the request of Zimbabwe (A/ES-8/1). The UNGA's eighth emergency special session was convened by Zimbabwe in order to discuss the \\"Question of Namibia\\". Its meetings were conducted between 3 September and 14 September 1981. At the conclusion of the final meeting of the session, the Assembly adopted resolution A/RES/ES-8/2: > \\"Declaring that the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa together > with the repeated acts of aggression committed by South Africa against > neighbouring States constitute a breach of international peace and security, > Noting with regret and concern that the Security Council failed to exercise > its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and > security when draft resolutions proposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions > against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations > were vetoed by the three Western permanent members of the Council on 30 > April 1981, ... 6\\\\.

Also strongly urges States to cease > forthwith, individually and collectively, all dealings with South Africa in > order totally to isolate it politically, economically, militarily and > culturally;\\" This was the first occasion on which the Assembly authorized economic, diplomatic and cultural sanctions against a state; it had already authorized military sanctions by its resolution 1001 of 7 November 1956, during its first emergency special session. Resolution A/RES/ES-8/2 also reaffirmed the power of the General Assembly to authorize the use of military force by UN Member States.  Palestine (1997) - US veto - 10th Emergency Special Session  Invoked by General Assembly request Qatar (A/ES/10/1). Tenth Emergency Special Session on “The Question of Palestine”, still in session, adopted inter alia, Resolution ES-10/14 requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice.  Uniting for Peace and the Security Council 'veto power'  It has been argued that with the adoption of the 'Uniting for Peace' resolution by the General Assembly, and given the interpretations of the Assembly's powers that became customary international law as a result, that the Security Council 'power of veto' problem could be surmounted.Hunt, C. \\"The 'veto' charade\\", ZNet, 7 November 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2008 By adopting A/RES/377 A, on 3 November 1950, over two-thirds of UN Member states declared that, according to the UN Charter, the permanent members of the UNSC cannot and should not prevent the UNGA from taking any and all action necessary to restore international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC has failed to exercise its 'primary responsibility' for maintaining peace. Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded 'final responsibility'--rather than 'secondary responsibility'--for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter. Various official and semi-official UN reports make explicit reference to the Uniting for Peace resolution as providing a mechanism for the UNGA to overrule any UNSC vetoes.International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty. \\"The Responsibility to Protect \\", ICISS.ca, December 2001.

It was to be a stepping stone for Empire of Japan's final control of the Chinese mainland. The operation started in spring of 1942, after the first phase of operations had been concluded in south China, and continued through spring of 1943. The operation is noted for Japan's sustained bombing of cities in central west China. Basic plan The basic plan was to make a multi-front breakthrough to Sichuan from northern Shanxi, central Hubei and southern Hunan. Heavy aerial support and bombing of Chongqing was to support the advance of the Japanese Army and their Collaborationist Chinese Army puppets. Japanese Navy patrol boats from the Yangtze river were to provide further bombardment. Chiang Kai-shek discussed the invasion in his book Soviet Russia in China, stating: > The Imperial General Headquarters sent the order for drawing down 16 > divisions and logistics support units from Japan reserves, Manchukuo and > Southern Areas (including New Guinea and Solomon islands also) to reinforce > the Japanese expeditionary forces in central China area, to prepare the > principal force of ten divisions in south Shanshi and other support group > conformed by six Divisions of Ichang in Hubei amongst other Divisions > located in Changde, in Hunan, for striking Sichuan and the occupation of > Chongqing in September 1942. By coincidence, September 1942 was also the time when the German Wehrmacht was closing in on Stalingrad. The invasion phase was to involve Japanese units first occupying Wanxian, from where the Japanese could advance to Chongqing- proper in echelon. To cut off the escape routes of Chinese refugees, the occupation of North Guizhou was planned, which could be used to stage an attack on Chengdu through Yibin. The north Japanese army division would have had the option to either advance towards south Shaanxi to capture Xi'an, or towards Hanzhong to take Chengdu directly. Alternatively, Japan could have utilized airborne forces to cut off Chinese escape routes and take the Chongqing metropolitan area directly. Interests in Sichuan region Both Chiang Kai-shek and General Wego W.K. Chiang suspected that the intense bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese Navy and the Japanese Air Force was to support the diversionary Japanese operations against metropolitan Chongqing, as part of the invasion of Sichuan. It was also possible that the Japanese army hoped that a terror campaign against Chongqing would force the Chinese authorities to break from the Allies and make a separate peace with Japan. Sichuan invasion =Japanese plan= According to General Chiang Wei-kuo, should the invasion be successful, the Japanese might have intended to put Wang Jingwei's puppet regime in charge of Chongqing. The Japanese might also have persuaded Chiang Kai-shek to join Japan's Greater East Asian Co- Prosperity Sphere and to even assist in a future Japanese offensive against the Soviet Union in Siberia and Central Asia. Another possibility was the installation of a Japanese civilian or military Governor-General to administer the area as an Imperial Japanese Army fief in mainland Asia, which could later be expanded to include Tibet and Xinjiang as well. =Factors affecting invasion= Due to opposition against Japan from other Allied countries, the Sichuan invasion was not enthusiastically carried out. In particular, the United States' counter-offensive against Japan heavily undermined the possibility of an invasion. Chiang Kai-shek stated: > But in June 1942, Japanese forces suffered the humiliating defeat in the > Battle of Midway, and in August the U.S. forces initiated the > counteroffensive against the Solomon Islands, with a landing at Tenaru > River, Guadalcanal (Operation Watchtower). The Japanese suffered frequent > losses at the end of September 1942, and decided to delay the implement of > invasion plan for Sichuan. Later in November, the Japanese forces having > been totally defeated in Guadalcanal, (Battle of Guadalcanal, Battle of > Tassafaronga and Battle of Rennel), the situation was turned around, with > Japan losing all possibility to transfer with impunity its forces in the > area (the Japanese were obliged to use all disposable vessels in their > retreat, \\"Operation KE\\" during the night of February 1–2, 1943, the last > part of the so-called \\"Tokyo Express\\"). At the end of 1942, the planning for > the Sichuan Invasion was suspended. =Last operative attempt to invade= However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters was still in favor of an invasion. Hence the Japanese China Expeditionary Army produced a new plan for the capture of Sichuan, which was based on the previous 1942 plan. The May 1943 \\"Battle of West Hubei\\" was part of this new attempt to advance to Sichuan. Nevertheless, by then the Nationalist Chinese armies had the support of the \\"Flying Tigers\\" (A.V.G.) of the United States, which was commanded by General Claire Chennault. In subsequent battles, the Japanese army suffered defeats at the hands of the Nationalist Chinese armies. In light of these defeats, the Japanese forces had to abandon a new offensive. During this period the Chinese Army sent seven Army envoys to Yunnan and India to clear the China–Burma route. In fear of Chinese reinforcements through the cleared route and having sustained much losses in the Battle of Changde, the Japanese army switched their attention to Yunnan to prevent future Chinese counter-offensives from that area.

Etzion Village) is an Israeli settlement orgabnized as a religious kibbutz located in the Judean Hills between Jerusalem and Hebron in the southern West Bank, established in 1927, depopulated in 1948 and re- established in 1967. It is located 4.7 km east of the Green Line and falls under the jurisdiction of Gush Etzion Regional Council. In , Kfar Etzion had a population of . The majority of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli and the American governments dispute this. History =Migdal Eder= In January 1927, the Zikhron David society, a group of 160 Orthodox Jews from the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem, established a small farming community, \\"Migdal Eder,\\" on land south of Jerusalem.Jerusalem and its environs: quarters, neighborhoods, villages, 1800–1948, Ruth Kark, Michal Oren-Nordheim The name was taken from a verse in the Bible, Genesis 35:21, which referenced a tower by the same name. During the 1929 Palestine riots, Migdal Eder was attacked and destroyed. Residents of the neighboring Palestinian village of Beit Ummar sheltered the farmers, but they could not return to their land.Settlements in Focus: Gush Etzion =Old Kfar Etzion= In the early 1930s, the land was purchased by Haredi businessman Shmuel Zvi Holtzman from Rehovot, who renamed the settlement \\"Kfar Etzion,\\" a play on his own name: Yiddish “holts” and German \\"Holz\\" means “wood”, which translates to “etz” in Hebrew). The Jews were forced to leave again in the wake of the 1936–39 Arab revolt. Much of what Holtzman and his comrades had built was demolished by the Arabs. In 1943–47, the kibbutz movement sent out groups of settlers to establish four kibbutzim, creating what became known as the Etzion bloc. Kfar Etzion, Ein Tzurim, Massu'ot Yitzhak and Revadim were destroyed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and the entire area came under Jordanian rule. The kibbutzim held off the attacks for ten days until Kfar Etzion fell. In the Kfar Etzion massacre on 14 May, 157 Jewish inhabitants of the village were murdered, as all but four of the inhabitants were executed by Arab Legion and irregular forces. The other three kibbutzim surrendered. The inhabitants there were taken as prisoners of war and released nine months later.Moshe Dayan, 'The Story of My Life'. . Page 130.

Another figure involved in Kfar Etzion's resettlement is Elyashiv Knohl, a rabbi of the community whose father fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and was captured during the war by the Jordanians. According to Knohl, Kfar Etzion's original settlers were socialists, and members of the kibbutz continue to channel their incomes to a joint account. Today Kfar Etzion houses a museum and archive documenting the history of Gush Etzion. In the 2013 Middle East cold snap a meter of snow fell on the Kfar Etzion area.  Economy  Residents of Kfar Etzion earn their livelihood growing cherries, flowers, olives, almonds, and grapes. Some raise chickens, and others work in Jerusalem. As of 2012 there is a large clothing store on the settlement. In 2012 the price of a 120-square-meter home on the settlement was while the price of a 200-square-meter home was .

He represented Missouri as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives for several terms: 1919–1921, 1925–1933 and 1935–1943. Biography Nelson was born on a farm near Bunceton, Missouri on August 4, 1875. He attended the local schools, the Hooper Institute in Clarksburg, Missouri, William Jewell College, and the Missouri College of Agriculture. He taught school for five years and then became involved with his brothers in operating and editing a county newspaper in Bunceton. A Democrat, he served in the Missouri House of Representatives from 1901 to 1903 and 1905 to 1907. Nelson moved to Columbia, Missouri to accept appointment as Assistant Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, a position he held from 1908 to 1918. Nelson also operated his own farm and authored articles for several agricultural publications. In 1918, Nelson was the successful Democratic nominee for a seat in the U.S. House, and he served in the 66th United States Congress, March 4, 1919, to March 3, 1921. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1920, after which he was on the editorial staff of the Iowa Homestead, a major farming magazine. In 1924, he ran successfully for the U.S. House. He was reelected three times, and served in the 69th, 70th, 71st, and 72nd Congresses (March 4, 1925 to March 3, 1933). He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1932, and again returned to farming and writing in Columbia. In 1934, he was again elected to the U.S. House. He was reelected three times, and served in the 74th, 75th, 76th and 77th Congresses (January 3, 1935 to January 3, 1943). He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1942. After leaving Congress in 1943 Nelson served as Assistant to J. Marvin Jones, the federal War Food Administrator during World War II. Later in 1943, Nelson returned to Columbia, where he lived in retirement. Nelson died in Columbia on December 31, 1946, and was buried at Columbia Cemetery. References External links * *William L.

The area burned included large parts of the Bitterroot, Cabinet, Clearwater, Coeur d'Alene, Flathead, Kaniksu, Kootenai, Lewis and Clark, Lolo, and St. Joe national forests. The fire burned over two days on the weekend of August 20–21, after strong winds caused numerous smaller fires to combine into a firestorm of unprecedented size. It killed 87 people,Egan, Timothy. - \\"Ideas & Trends: Why Foresters Prefer to Fight Fire With Fire\\". - The New York Times. - August 20, 2000. mostly firefighters,(78 firefighters, 8 civilians)(86 firefighters) destroyed numerous manmade structures, including several entire towns, and burned more than three million acres of forest with an estimated billion dollars' worth of timber lost. It is believed to be the largest, although not the deadliest, forest fire in U.S. history. The extensive burned area was approximately the size of the state of Connecticut. In the aftermath of the fire, the U.S. Forest Service received considerable recognition for its firefighting efforts, including a doubling of its budget from Congress. The outcome was to highlight firefighters as public heroes while raising public awareness of national nature conservation. The fire is often considered a significant impetus in the development of early wildfire prevention and suppression strategies. Origin A great number of problems contributed to the destruction caused by the Great Fire of 1910. The wildfire season started early that year because the winter of 1909–1910 and the spring and summer of 1910 were extremely dry,Idaho Spring/Summer Precipitation; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the summer sufficiently hot to have been described as \\"like no others.\\" The drought resulted in forests that were teeming with dry fuel, which had previously grown up on abundant autumn and winter moisture.Idaho Autumn/Winter Precipitation; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hundreds of fires were ignited by hot cinders flung from locomotives, sparks, lightning, and backfiring crews. By mid-August, there were 1,000 to 3,000 fires burning in Idaho, Montana, and Washington. The Big Blowup August 20 (Saturday) brought hurricane-force winds to the interior northwest, whipping the hundreds of small fires into one or two much larger blazing infernos. Such a conflagration was impossible to fight; there were too few men and supplies. The United States Forest Service (then called the National Forest Service) was only five years old at the time and unprepared for the possibilities of the dry summer or a fire of this magnitude, though all summer it had been urgently recruiting as many men as possible to fight the hundreds of fires already burning, many with little forestry or firefighting experience. Earlier in August President William Howard Taft had authorized the addition of military troops to the effort, and 4,000 troops, including seven companies from the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Regiment (known as the Buffalo Soldiers), were brought in to help fight the fires burning in the northern Rockies. in The arrival of the Buffalo Soldiers troops almost doubled the black population of Idaho. Smoke from the fire was said to have been seen as far east as Watertown, New York, and as far south as Denver, Colorado. It was reported that at night, out into the Pacific Ocean, ships could not navigate by the stars because the sky was cloudy with smoke. The extreme scorching heat of the sudden blowup has been attributed to the expansive Western white pine forests that covered much of northern Idaho at the time, due to their flammable sap. Firefighters At least 78 firefighters were killed while trying to control the fire, not including those firefighters who died after the fire of smoke damage to their lungs. The entire 28-man \\"Lost Crew\\" was overcome by flames and perished on Setzer Creek outside of Avery, Idaho. Perhaps the most famous story of survival is that of Ranger Ed Pulaski, a U.S. Forest Service ranger who led a large crew of about 44 men to safety in an abandoned prospect mine outside of Wallace, Idaho, just as they were about to be overtaken by the fire. It is said that Pulaski fought off the flames at the mouth of the shaft until he passed out like the others. Around midnight, a man announced that he, at least, was getting out of there. Knowing that they would have no chance of survival if they ran, Pulaski drew his pistol, threatening to shoot the first person who tried to leave. In the end, all but five of the forty or so men survived.The Source https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Source-Stephen-Pyne- Lecture.pdfThe Big Burn: Idaho and Montana, August 1910 part two Pulaski has since been widely celebrated as a hero for his efforts; the mine tunnel in which he and his crew sheltered from the fire, now known as the Pulaski Tunnel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Aftermath Wallace after the Big Blowup Memorial to fallen firefighters of 1910; at Woodlawn Cemetery in St. Maries, Idaho () The fire was finally extinguished when another cold front swept in, bringing steady rain and some early snowfall. Several towns were completely destroyed by the *Idaho: **Falcon **Grand Forks *Montana: **De Borgia **Haugan **Henderson **Taft **Tuscor In Idaho, one third of the town of Wallace was burned to the ground, with an estimated $1 million in damage (). Passenger trains evacuated thousands of Wallace residents to Spokane and Missoula. Another train with 1,000 people from Avery took refuge in a tunnel after racing across a burning trestle. Other towns with severe damage included Burke, Kellogg, Murray, and Osburn, all in Idaho. The towns of Avery, Saltese (MT), as well as a major part of Wallace, were saved by backfires. The smoke from the fire went as far to the east as New York City, and as far south as Dallas. Legacy The Great Fire of 1910 cemented and shaped the U.S. Forest Service, which at the time was a newly established department on the verge of cancellation, facing opposition from mining and forestry interests. Before the epic conflagration, there were many debates about the best way to handle forest fires—whether to let them burn because they were a part of nature and were expensive to fight, or to fight them in order to protect the forests. One of the people who fought the fire, Ferdinand Silcox, went on to become the fifth chief of the fire service. Influenced by the devastation of the Big Blowup, Silcox promoted the \\"10 a.m.\\" policy, with the goal of suppressing all fires by 10 a.m. of the day following their report. It was decided that the Forest Service was to prevent and battle every wildfire.The Big Burn: Idaho and Montana, August 1910 part three https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a1961/4219853 More recently, this absolutist attitude to wildfires has been criticized for altering the natural disturbance mechanisms that drive forest ecosystem structure, which paradoxically increases the destructive potential of forest fires.

They serve many functions, such as forming the livelihood for subsistence fishermen and even function as jewelry and construction materials. Coral reefs are developed by the carbonate-based skeletons of a variety of animals and algae. Slowly and overtime, the reefs build up to the surface in oceans. Coral reefs are found in shallow, warm salt water. The sunlight filters through clear water and allows microscopic organisms to live and reproduce. The Indian Ocean holds 60% of the world's coastal reefs, 25% are in the Pacific and 15% are in the western Atlantic. There are coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, Madagascar, the Philippines, Hawaiian Islands and off Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have been preserved and identified in rocks over 400 million years old. Coral reefs are actually composed of tiny, fragile animals known as coral polyps. Coral reefs are significantly important because of the biodiversity. Although the number of fish are decreasing, the remaining coral reefs contain more unique sea creatures. The variety of species living on a coral reef is greater than anywhere else in the world. An estimation of 70-90% of fish caught are dependent on coral reefs in Southeast Asia and reefs support over 25% of all known marine species. However, those sensitive coral reefs are facing detrimental effects on them due to variety of factors: overfishing, sedimentation and pollution, bleaching, and even tourist-related damage. Ohandley, Cassie. \\"Anthropogenic Effects on Coral Reefs\\" June 11, 2003 Depletion For 50 percent of Southeast Asia's coral reefs, they are at high or very high levels of threat. Only 12 percent of the reefs are at low risk. 64 percent of the regions reefs are threatened by overfishing and 56 percent are threatened by destructive fishing techniques. Indonesia and the Philippines together possess about 77 percent of the region's coral reefs and nearly all of those reefs are threatened. Over 90 percent of the coral reefs in Cambodia, Singapore, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, China, and the Spratly Islands are threatened and over 85 percent of reefs of Malaysia and Indonesia are threatened. Heavy reliance on marine resources resulted in overexploitation and degradation of many coral reefs, especially those near major population centers. Major threats include overfishing, destructive fishing practices, sedimentation and pollution from land based sources. Human activities threaten an estimated 88 percent of Southeast Asia's coral reefs, jeopardizing the biological and economic value to society.\\"Key Findings and Introduction from World Resources Institute .\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 31 May 2011. . Coral reefs just off the coasts of Indonesia and the Philippines possess the world's most diverse coral species and organisms. These coral reefs are susceptible to severe damage by environmental impacts and mankind. The majority of the destruction of coral reefs in Southeast Asia is due to illegal fishing practices and explosives. These explosives kill fish and shatter the coral skeletons resulting in depletion. Scientists agree that pollution, overfishing, cyanide fishing, and bleaching have negatively impacted about 85% of Indonesia's reefs. In recent years, the direct and indirect effects of overfishing and pollution from agriculture and land development have been the major drivers of massive and accelerating decreases in abundance of coral reef species, causing widespread changes in reef ecosystems. Philippines is covered with 35,000 km² coral reefs. But 70% of them are degraded. The conditions of coral reefs are deteriorating on a dramatic rate. Global climate change has caused serious troubles on coral reefs. Changes in ocean chemistry due to increasing carbon dioxide level cause weakening of coral skeletons and reduce the accretion of reefs, especially at higher latitudes. Hurricanes, rising sea levels and Greenhouse are also great threats. However, the most pressing impact of climate change is coral bleaching and disease that have already increased over the past 30 years. Other than climate change, trawling, dynamite fishing, and diving tourism also have large influence on the health of coral reefs. Blast fishing, also called dynamite fishing, is a major contributor to the destruction of coral reefs. Even though blast fishing was banned in 1985, it still remains a huge threat to the Indonesia coral reefs. By filling up an empty bottle with fertiliser and kerosene a fisherman can create an improvised but powerful explosive and throw it into the ocean gaining immediate access to hundreds of dead fish.Lu, Andrea. \\"Turmoil in the Sea: Blast Fishing Destroys Coral Reefs.\\" The Daily Californian. March 30, 2005. <> This method of fishing leaves coral reefs virtually unsalvagable, yet has become increasingly popular as the demand for fish increases but the supply steadily decreases. The explosives used to catch dead fish destroys coral reefs from the inside leaving them no room for regrowth. This effect in turn hurts Filipino fisherman because it leaves no place for fish to reproduce and thus decreases the fish population. Blast fishing became popular among Filipino fisherman in the mid-1980s, but did not gain global attention until the 1990s.Martin, Glen. 2002. \\"The depths of destruction. Dynamite fishing ravages Philippines' precious coral reefs.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. Available at: http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/The-depths-of-destruction-Dynamite- fishing-2816512.php Laws created to prevent blast fishing are poorly enforced by officials of this area, and fisherman are highly motivated to continue this practice for survival and profit. \\"These are not poor Third World guys trying to put food on the table, go to the villages and find the people who head the dynamite fishing cooperatives are the people with new Jeeps and new satellite dishes in their houses. This is about greed,\\". Indonesia and the Philippines contain about 77% of the regions coral reef systems, and with 98% of the Philippine coral reefs seriously threatened by human activities, it is obvious that there needs to be serious changes to the marine practices of the communities.Martin, Glen. 2002. \\"The depths of destruction.

Available at: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?file=chronicle/archive/2002/05/30/mn232485.dtl Cyanide fishing originated in the Philippines in the 1960s due to the growing market for aquarium fish in North America and Europe.\\"Cyanide Fishing: A poison tide on the reef.\\" World Resources Institute, 1982-2005. This method of fishing is done by squirting cyanide, a poison, directly into crevices of the coral reefs. The cyanide quickly stuns the fish, making the fishermen's job much easier when catching their targeted prey. This poison is extremely harmful to the surrounding corals and all of the reef's inhabitants. Since the 1960s when this practice began, over one million kilograms of cyanide poison has been released and used to catch fish amongst the Philippine coral reefs. However, less than one half of the live fish caught by this method survive to be sold to restaurants and aquariums.International Coral Reef Information Network: \\"Cyanide Fishing and Coral Reefs\\" The Coral Reef Alliance, 2002. < Coralreef.org> Another major problem facing the Southeast Asian Coral Reefs is sedimentation. Sedimentation is caused by development on land and agricultural runoff. Southeast Asian countries are experiencing rapid development, leading to deforestation, and construction projects near the reefs that lead to sediment eroding and covering the corals.Burke, Lauretta. Reefs At Risk., 2011. This reduces sunlight, and smothers the coral colonies; clogging their mouths, which killing them. The nutrient rich sediment also facilitates algae growth, which can overgrow the corals. Sedimentation will continue to be a major problem as Southeast Asian economies continue to grow. The Philippine waters are considered as having nearly 70% of its coral reefs destroyed with only 5% in good condition. Although this dynamite and cyanide fishing may be targeted at one specific location, it destroys the surrounding habitat as well, spreading over one kilometer upon each impact. It takes over one hundred years for these reefs to grow into substantial sizes, at a rate of one inch every five years. These poor fishing practices not only threaten the food habitats for many species, but also the biodiversity that makes these Philippine and Indonesian coasts so beautiful. Inland human activities is what mainly pressures these reefs' pristine states; from indirect activities such as the increasing demand within the fishing industry as well as directly, through coastal run-off and pollution. The coral reefs of Indonesia and the Philippines are vital to food security, employment, tourism, and medicinal research. The value of the regions sustainable coral reef fisheries alone is US$2.4 billion a year.World Resources Institute 2002, Key Findings These countries rely on the marine resources as a means to diversify their economy. Due to unsafe fishing practices, the coral reefs in these countries are experiencing a decline. There are no pristine coral reefs left in the world. Coral reefs in these countries are headed toward becoming ecologically extinct.Pandolfi_et_al.2003.coral_reefs.science.pdf Without the abundance of Marine resources, the Philippines and Indonesia will experience a major hit to their economy. On September 24, 2007, Reef Check (the world’s largest reef conservation organization) stated that only 5% of Philippines' 27,000 square- kilometers of coral reef are in “excellent condition\\" : Tubbataha Reef, Marine Park in Palawan, Apo Island in Negros Oriental, Apo Reef in Puerto Galera, Mindoro, and Verde Island Passage off Batangas. Philippine coral reefs is 2nd largest in Asia.Abs-Cbn Interactive, ‘RP coral reefs, second largest in Asia, in bad shape’ Indonesia Indonesia has 2,915,000 square kilometers of marine area. The reef area is 51,020 square kilometers. Of that amount, 82% of it is at risk. Indonesia holds 17% of the world's total coral reef areas. Blast fishing, which has been illegal since 1985 still goes on today, along with cyanide fishing (1995). Another factor that is hurting the coral reefs in Indonesia is the amount of coral that they export. They are the world's largest exporter of corals, exporting about 500 tons of coral per year. COREMAP is helping Indonesia with their combat against destruction of corals by working in 9 of the 32 provinces. They want to: #Heighten law enforcement to protect coral reefs; #Establish coral reef monitoring and information systems, in order to conduct research on the status of coral reefs and more effectively disseminate that information to stakeholder groups; #Develop community-based management systems and increase public participation in coral reef resource management; #Increase institutional capacity and strengthen inter-institutional coordination in planning and implementing policy that affects coral reef management, and; #Enhance public knowledge of the importance of coral reef and motivate people to actively participate in the management and sustainable use of coral reefs. Philippines The Philippines, with more than 7,000 islands and warm ocean waters, surround about 26,000 square kilometers of coral reef. These coral reefs have recently brought the attention of beneficial economic uses to the Philippines government. Benefits of Coral Reefs in Philippines #Coral reefs break the waves from the chance of eroding the coastline of the islands; #Protection of Communities: “the reefs act as buffer zones” meaning they decrease the power of typhoons and hurricanes as they approach the Philippine Islands; #Economic Benefits: Fishing off the coral reefs, profits from tourism, for example, Diving tours and snorkeling areas on the shallow reefs. These economic benefits create many new jobs and profitable opportunities to the country. State For the past 55 years, the proportion of degraded reefs in Indonesia increased from 10 to 50%. From 1989 to 2000 reefs with over 50% live coral cover declined from 36 to 29%. Western Indonesia, which is more developed and holds the majority of the nation's population, faces the greatest threats to its coral reefs. Surveys concluded that reef condition improves from west to east. The percentage of reefs in good or excellent condition (live coral cover of 50% or more) is 23% in western Indonesia versus 45% in eastern Indonesia. 65% of surveys taken from the Maluku islands had evidence of bomb damage. In addition, reefs affected by land-based pollution (i.e. sediment discharge into reefs by deforestation, industry, sewage, and fertilizer) show 30–50% less diversity at depths of three meters and 40–60% less diversity at 10 meters in comparison to pristine reefs. The 1997–1998 el Nino event triggered widespread bleaching in Indonesia, with western and west-central Indonesia most affected. Bleaching was recorded in East Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Lombok. In the Seribu Islands northwest of Jakarta, 90–95% of coral reef from the reef flat down to 25 meters died. Two years later, the Seribu Islands significantly recovered, with live coral cover of 20–30% (2000). Coral reefs in Indonesia are located near Java (Batavia), Nusa Dua, Jakarta and Saribu. 30% of the Philippine's coral reefs are dead while 39% are dying. The news isn't all bad: Establishment of the Sumilon Island marine reserve has resulted in a marked comeback of fish in adjacent areas. Along with the establishment of the Sumilon Island marine reserve, there is hope for the Philippines via boosts in ecotourism. In recent years, local Filipino governments have discovered that fishing is not the only economic benefit the reefs can provide. They are confident that with a spread of ecotourism, even local fishermen will reap the financial benefits of this economic sector. A surge in coral reef conservation education is helping the tourism sector provide information to tourists on how to preserve the coral reefs while they enjoy the beauty and serenity of the reefs.The Utrecht Faculty of Education/The Philippine Hogeschool van Utrecht. Manila Luzon The Philippines ecotourism sector is unfortunately stifled at this time due to a limited budget and there are approximately 7,000 islands to patrol for destructive fishing techniques.Martin, Glen. 2002. \\"The depths of destruction. Dynamite fishing ravages Philippines'precious coral reefs.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. Available at: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?file=chronicle/archive/2002/05/30/mn232485.dtlhttps://www.motherjones.com/news/special_reports/coral_reef/philippines.html Destructive fishing techniques are thought to be the largest contributor to reef degradation in the Philippines. The first ever mass-bleaching event in the Philippines was reported in 1998–99. It began at Batangas, off Luzon, in June 1998 and then proceeded nearly clockwise around the Philippines, correlating with anomalous sea-surface temperatures. Most reefs of northern Luzon, west Palawan, the Visayas, and parts of Mindanao were affected. Subsequent mortalities were highly variable, with decreases in live coral cover ranging from 0.7 to 46 percent and up to 80 percent in Bolinao. Recent surveys in 1997 found a low percentage of reefs to be in excellent condition. They found only 4 percent of Philippine reefs in excellent condition (i.e., over 75 percent hard or soft coral cover), 28 percent in good condition (50-75 percent coral cover), 42 percent in fair condition (25-50 percent coral cover), and 27 percent in poor condition (less than 25 percent coral cover). The Visayas have experienced the most significant decline in coral cover, exhibiting an average of only 11 percent hard coral cover. A study in the early 1990s revealed that coral reefs are damaged by a variety of human activities such as household sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural chemicals from land that are washed to the sea. This was a new finding for the time period in which it was widely believed that the main damage to coral reefs was causes by oil spills or from pollution dumped by ships. This survey was concentrated on SE Asia mainly because it was believed that coral reefs in this region were at great threat of extinction if continued to be unmanaged. In the last thirty years climate change has had the most harmful effect on corals. (Hughes) Currently one of the major issues the Indonesian government is dealing with is climate change. (CIA Worldfactbook) When the ocean warms such as in El Nino, coral bleaching occurs, which kills the coral. (Hughes) The reefs are incredibly important to the economy and people of Southeast Asia. The reefs bring in $1.6 billion a year through fishing, employment, and the tourist industry. (Reefs at Risk in Southeast Asia Key Findings 2002) Today, the coral reefs located in the Philippines and Indonesia are in great danger. Fishermen are constantly practising dangerous methods such as blast fishing and dynamite fishing. These practices prove to be detrimental to the coral reefs as well as the marine life in the surrounding areas. Because of the dangerous methods, fish that are usually near the coral reefs are no longer there any more. Two of these fish are Groupers and snappers. According to David Nockels it was only seven years ago that 30% of the reefs were dead in this region and many more were dying. Bleaching Bleaching is one significant threat to the corals. Bleaching is a process that expels the photosynthetic algae from the corals' \\"stomachs\\" or polyps. This algae is called zooxanthellae. It is vital to the reef's life because it provides the coral with nutrients; it is also responsible for the color. The process is called bleaching because when the algae is ejected from the coral reef the animal loses its pigment. Zooxanthellae densities are continually changing; bleaching is really an extreme of what naturally happens.Reefkeeping The detrimental exaggeration of the natural occurrence can be explained by the increasing temperature of the oceans which is accused to be a result of the \\"Greenhouse Effect,\\" or global warming (Blackman and Hughes). Biological oceanographer Paul Falkowski and marine biologist Andrew Baker from the Wildlife Conservation Society study bleaching and why it occurs. Their explanations can be put in their simplest terms as such: the algae's membrane melts from the rise in temperature and, as a result, spits out an \\"oxygen species\\" directly into the reef. The animal, in turn, views this process as a threat and ejects the algae as a defense mechanism. Once the zooxanthellae are expelled the coral have nothing to feed off and die. Bleaching has been shown to cause up to 90% mortality rate of the affected corals. However, there is a catch. The reefs that are victims of bleaching have been found to be affected in patches, suggesting that there are several factors that affect the bleaching threshold. Not only that, but both bleached and non-bleached corals are often found right next to each other. These cases are numerous, and the variation and impact of factors (such as species or light) are still being heavily questioned, researched, and are vaguely understood. Ocean acidification One of the largest potential threats of ocean acidification to marine invertebrates is the corrosive properties of undersaturated waters with respect to calcium carbonate skeletons/shells, and a theoretical inability to calcify under these conditions. Ocean acidification is a lowered pH of ocean waters caused by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which results in more CO2 dissolving into the ocean. This poses a threat to corals and calcifying macroalgae, two main calcifying groups that occur in reefs, as well as other shelled organisms and the organisms that depend on them. Corals and calcifying macroalgae such as coralline red algae and calcifying green algae are extremely sensitive to ocean acidification because they build their hard structures out of calcium carbonate. The sinking pH of ocean waters makes it difficult for these shelled creatures to produce enough calcium carbonate to build and maintain their skeletal structures. Echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, and mollusks, including squid and clams, as well as many other species are also at risk because of thinning shells and weakened skeletal structures. By targeting calcifying organisms, ocean acidification threatens the health of reef ecosystems as a whole. Ocean acidification from increasing level of atmospheric CO2 represents a major global threat to coral reefs, and in many regions acidification is exacerbated by local smaller-scale disturbances such as overfishing. Studies have shown that severe acidification and warming alone can lower reef resilience even under high grazing intensity and low nutrients. Furthermore, the threshold at which herbivore overfishing (reduced grazing) leads to a coral-algal phase shift was lowered by acidification and warming. Also, increasing temperature and ocean acidification are predicted to have a synergistic effect; ocean warming will further magnify ocean acidification changes. Social impacts of depletion Most Southeastern Asian coastal communities are socially and economically dependent upon coral reef ecosystems.Cesar, H., Burke, L. and L. Pet-Soede. 2003. The Economics of Worldwide Coral Reef Degradation. International Coral Reef Action Network http://www.icran.org/ 350 million people live within 50k of the coast and the majority of that population depend in one way or another upon the coral reefs.Burke, Lauretta, Liz Selig, and Mark Spalding. 2002. Reefs at Risk in Southeast Asia. (UNEP-WCMC, Cambridge, UK) Because so many people are dependent on such a precious ecosystem, environmental impacts are not all they are facing. Along with the degradation and depletion of the physical coral and its inhabitants, the Southeastern Asian residents are facing major social and economic implications. Socially, the coral depletion could have a devastating effect on the population and the culture that is dependent upon the reefs of Southeast Asia. The marine waters of the Philippines is five times more in area than the land it covers.Tongson, Edgardo. Haribon Foundation; for the Conservation of Natural Resources. Available at: http://www.aenet.org/treks/haribon.htm#research. Out of the 86 million people that reside in the Philippines, about 40% live on less than a dollar a day.PBS. \\"Philippines Lesson: Coral Reefs\\" Available at: https://www.pbs.org/kcet/globaltribe/classroom/globaltribe_classroom_phil_coral.pdf#search='philippines%20and%20coral%20reefs' Most people fish for personal consumption and survival. Fish consumption is estimated at around 30 kg per capita in the Philippines. Because fish are becoming scarcer as their reef habitat is gradually destroyed by cyanide and blast fishing, siltation, and bleaching, fishermen must continue to use the cheapest and most reliable methods to bring in their daily catch. The coral reefs of Indonesia and the Philippines are vital to food security, employment, tourism, and medicinal research. The value of the regions sustainable coral reef fisheries alone is US$2.4 billion a year. These countries rely on the marine resources as a means to diversify their economy. Due to unsafe fishing practices, the coral reefs in these countries are experiencing a decline. There are no pristine coral reefs in the world. Coral reefs in these countries are headed toward becoming ecologically extinct. Without the abundance of Marine resources, the Philippines and Indonesia will experience a major hit to their economy. The coral reef has been an integral part of Southeast Asian communities for thousands of years. According to Tiffany Adams of Hong Kong, \\"With the higher demands on the coral reef to produce for the increasing population and the introduction of the world market in the last fifty years, overexploitation has become the most prevalent threat.\\" The explosion of the live reef food fish and aquarium trades as markets has been detrimental to the coral reef. Economic incentives have led to the over fishing of the coral reef and the creation of new technologies to create higher yields of harvest. The use of cyanide and blast fishing has begun to destroy one of the largest coral reef environments in the world. Furthermore, the increased populations have affected the coral reef indirectly. Besides using the reef for economic gain, the increase of people has created pollution. The high levels of development and change in the methods of using the land have led to massive deforestation, which in turn has created a substantial amount of sediments and nutrient loads being placed in coastal environments. Furthermore, attempts to industrialize at the lowest cost possible have led to increased pollution without regulation. To protect and restore the coral reefs many things must be considered. The fishermen and reef harvesters must be given a new method of generating income, one that is sustainable and economically enticing that does not negatively affect the environment. Also, there is a need to manage and regulate the development of the Southeast area and the pollution from this area, while considering the environmental impacts and the economic impacts farther down the road. The task of saving the coral reef in Southeast Asia must occur within the communities which depend upon them. The problem, of a community's abuse and overuse of a natural resource, as created through desperation, poverty and a lack of oversight, cannot be handled by a foreign, external organization or a well-intended NGO. Such as the result of the incredibly successful restoration of Apo Island's reef, the local people must decide as a community to manage the reefs so that they may continue to sustain themselves through this essential resource.Wilkinson, C.R., L.M.

Munro (eds.) The Management of Coral Reefs Resource Systems. ICLARM Conf. Proc. 44. Dive tourism Dive tourism can have negative and positive influences on coral reef ecosystems. It is very important to have tourist education programs to reduce stress on coral reefs caused by tourists who are unaware how easily damaged corals can be. One such negative effect of tourism that can easily be avoided is people walking on coral, and breaking it. Walking near corals also can lead to sediment being stirred up and covering corals, which leads to coral death and makes it very difficult for corals to re-colonize the area. Dive tourism can be beneficial to coral reefs by creating funding for protection programs, including Marine Protected Areas. By simply charging dive fees at certain dive sites, money can be generated for the conservation of coral reefs. Marine protected areas Amongst the many proposed solutions to the problems plaguing coral reefs in Southeast Asia is the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs). Currently marine protected areas make up around 8% of the area of Southeast Asian coral reefs. The World Commission on Protected Areas,http://www.iucn.org/themes/wcpa/region/seasia/seasia.html amongst other groups, has been active in establishing MPAs in Southeast Asia. However, the success rate of MPAs in Southeast Asia is low, with an estimated 14% of MPAs rated effectively managed.2002\\\\. Reefs at Risk in Southeast Asia. Key Findings and Introduction from World Resources Institute. WCPA Regions- South East Asia, p8. <> This rate reflects the difficulty of implementing MPAs. Moreover, it shows that much work is still needed to make MPAs successful in Southeast Asia. IUCN has defined an MPA as “any area of intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment”.Graeme Kelleher and Ardrian Philips ed. 1999. Guidelines for Marine Protected Areas. Best Practice Protected Area Guidelines Series No. 3 World Commission on Protected Areas, p11. In other words, an MPA is a marine area in which the water column and all the life that exists in it are protected through laws. These laws restrict certain practices within the MPA, which can differ per MPA. Marine protected areas, in sum, provide a marine sanctuary which can foster an increase in marine biodiversity.De Guzman, Asuncion B. 2004. Do Marine Protected Areas Work?: A Case Study From The Philippines. EEPSEA Research Report 2004-RR6, A Fishery in Transition: Impact of a Community Marine Reserve on a Coastal Fishery in Northern Mindanao, Philippines. <> (See also:). This increased biodiversity is thought to be able to carry over to the non-protected surrounding areas in which fishing can take place. This is important for a number of reasons. In the Southeast Asian context, especially amongst the islands of the Philippines and Indonesia, the sea and people are very much interconnected. As mentioned, the sea provides both a source of income and source of food for the people. In the Philippines, for example, 67% of protein food consumption comes from fish and fish products. Additionally, roughly one million people in the Philippines are employed in the fishing industry.White, Alan T. and Annabelle Cruz-Trinidad. 1998. Values of Philippine coastal resources: why protection and management are critical. Coastal Resource Management Project 1998 PN-ACJ-113, p45. Increased fish stocks resulting from marine protected areas only add to the solutions needed to revitalize Southeast Asian economies, life systems, and coral reefs. In addition, the LMMA (Locally-Managed Marine Area) Network is another organization that takes part in the Southeast Asia marine conservation. Similar to the MPA, the LMMA also provides protection areas in the sea. However, according to the definition above, an LMMA is an example of an MPA because an MPA includes a large space within and close by the area. The LMMA involves members from around the world, and the communities within the managed areas. The goal of LMMA is to allow members and local communities to learn the uses of protected resources. Due to the massive destruction of coral reefs in Southeast Asia, the LMMA has established two areas in Eastern Indonesia: Padaido Islands, Biak, West Papua, and Southern Ambon Island and the Moluccas Islands; and various areas in the Philippines. With the help of the LMMAs, the local communities would learn to preserve their marine goods, and be able to maintain for longer years. Gradually, the communities will accommodate bigger and healthier fish. There are an estimated 400 MPAs in the Philippines. Of the 400 only 16% have yielded an increase in biodiversity. The high failure rate is due to poor management and a lack of regulation.PORFIRIO M. ALIÑO Despite the numerous failures there have been successes. One of the best known areas is Apo island where a small community has effectively managed an MPA since the mid-1980s. The Apo MPA includes a ban on detrimental fishing practices and a no-take zone covering 10% of their reef. Apo's reef has thrived giving hope to Philippine reefs.Resource at Risk: Philippine Coral Reefs Contributions for management The state of the coral reefs in the Philippines and Indonesia are depleting with every blink of an eye. It is to no one's surprise that the Philippines have lost more than 80% since the 1920s. In Indonesia it is a little better due to the some drastic actions made by the government. On December 6, 2002 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a US$33 million loan in order to save what is the rest of these important organisms. Overfishing, illegal fishing methods, and overpopulation have all contributed to the decline of the coral reefs both in the Philippines and Indonesia. Along with the loan the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Project (Phase II), the second part of a three phase plan has given us all hope in restoring coral reefs in this part of the region. The Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries will oversee the whole entire project with a due date of June 30, 2009. If it all goes according to plan the fishing industry will be the benefited the most. However, government action is not always necessary to manage reefs. When the community dependent on the resources provided by coral works together to save and restore the fish population, the results can be very good. The community managed reefs of Apo Island, located in the southern Philippines, known worldwide for its success. The waters around Apo Island are home to about 650 species of fish and 400 species of corals. The waters of Apo Island were not always this full of life. Fishing is the major occupation on the island, and even those who do not fish, rely on the catch for their protein. So when a fisherman's catch began shortening, after years of unregulated fishing, it was very easy for them to resort to destructive methods of fishing, such as blast fishing and cyanide fishing, to get by. These methods almost led to the end of the already dwindling fish stocks. The community began, through education and widespread involvement, the process of making these practices socially unacceptable.Video: Resource at Risk: Philippine Coral Reefs People began patrolling the waters in a small area with the intention of allowing fish to flourish and repopulate and then spill over into areas that had been fished out. This informal establishment of a sanctuary was first met with a lot of resistance, eventually though, after seeing the obvious improvements, the island community and local council were able to formalize the sanctuary in 1985, three years after it started. This formalization extended the sanctuary to water surrounding the island up to 500 meters from the shore and declaring a portion a no-take fish sanctuary. To manage the coral reefs effectively to preserve what is left of the beautiful natural resource, individual people must unite. If the marine ornamentals trade is to successfully turn around and begin to sustain more live fish, certain people must perform their jobs to the fullest. Firstly, there if lobbyists are responsible about the issue, they will provide healthy animals, maintain healthy reefs, sustain reef animal populations, and adequately compensate fishing communities for their efforts. Also, responsible industry operators must minimize animal mortality and habitat impacts and focus on animal health and quality collection practices. The problem with this method, though, is that merely trust and word of mouth aren't enough. If we are to legitimately stop depleting the coral reefs in Southeast Asia, we must set international standards.

It describes the events after the birth of Jesus, the visit of the magi and the attempt by King Herod to kill the infant messiah, Joseph and his family's flight into Egypt, and their later return to live in Israel, settling in Nazareth. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 23 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (~325–350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (~330–360; complete) *Codex Washingtonianus (~400) *Codex Bezae (~400; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete) Analysis The Adoration of the Magi by Bartolomé Estéban Murillo Each of the four sections in this chapter refers to a quotation from the Old Testament which Matthew sees Jesus fulfilling: #Micah 5:2 - And you, Bethlehem ... #Hosea 11:1 - I called my son out of Egypt #Jeremiah 31:15 - A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are no more #He shall be called a Nazarene - Matthew's text states that these words were \\"spoken by the prophets\\", but \\"it is not clear which prophetic oracles Matthew alludes to\\".Footnote to Matthew 2:23 in Jerusalem Bible The last portion of Matthew 1 is similarly written, with a quotation from Isaiah 7:14, and is often seen as part of this same section. Theologian Krister Stendahl notes that each of the four quotes in this chapter contain place names, and sees this entire chapter as an apology for why the messiah moved from the important centre of Bethlehem to the minor one of Nazareth.Stendahl, K., The School of St. Matthew, and its use of the Old Testament, \\"Acta Seminarii Neotestamentici Upsaliensis\\", Vol. XX, Uppsala: Almquist and Wiksells, 1954 France notes that the Old Testament quotations in this chapter are \\"notoriously obscure and unconvincing.\\"France, R.T. The Gospel According to Matthew: an Introduction and Commentary. Leicester: Inter-Varsity, 1985. . Many of them are heavily modified from the originals, with some passages being reversed in meaning. Almost all of them are taken out of context, and presented as prophecy when they were not in the original. The most confusing is that cited in Matthew 2:23, which does not appear anywhere in the Old Testament. Jerome associates it with Isaiah 11:1, where the etymology of Nazareth is derived from the Hebrew word for branch (ne'tser).Jerome, \\"Letter 57--To Pammachius on the Best Method of Translating\\" That the quotations have been so contorted to fit the narrative, is to France and others, clear evidence that the narrative came first, and the quotations were added after. The author of Matthew firmly believed in the accuracy of the narrative he was recording, and would not alter it to make it better fit the prophecies. As with Matthew 1 most scholars see this chapter as geared towards proving that Jesus is the messiah who was foretold by the prophets. The chapter contains five references to the Old Testament, a greater density than anywhere else in the New Testament. The author of Matthew uses them to try and demonstrate that Jesus matches the predictions of the prophets. Schweizer sees the chapter as being divided into five subsections, each ending with an Old Testament quotation.Schweizer, Eduard. The Good News According to Matthew. Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975. . As with the genealogy of Matthew 1 many scholars feel that this chapter is trying to portray Jesus as the culmination of Jewish history with the author of Matthew relating events in Jesus' life to important ones in history. The author of Matthew is paralleling Exodus in this chapter with Jesus as Moses and Herod as Pharaoh. The Gospel also takes care to mention a sojourn by the Holy Family in Egypt that is mentioned nowhere else. Through a quote from Jeremiah (31:15), the Massacre of the Innocents is linked to the Babylonian Captivity, and Jesus being born in Bethlehem echoes King David who was also born in that village. At the same time this chapter also contains several passages that are often seen as anti-Semitic. Matthew 2:3 and Matthew 2:4 both show the Jewish leaders and people of Jerusalem acting in lockstep with the tyrant Herod who tries to kill the infant. The historicity of this is dubious as other sources show great rivalry and animosity between the two. American theologian Robert H. Gundry notes that persecution is an important theme of Matthew, who was writing at a time when a number of forces were working to crush the new religious movement.Gundry, Robert H. Matthew: a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art, Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982. . Most of what is in this chapter is found in no other gospel and differs sharply from the infancy narrative in Luke 2. Evangelical scholars have developed theories to explain these discrepancies which allow them to stand by the inerrancy of the Bible. Other scholars feel that this part of the Gospel of Matthew is not a literal work of history: for example, Gundry sees Matthew's gospel as a heavily embellished version of Luke's, with the humble shepherds transformed into the more exotic magi. Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330-360), Matthew 1:1-2:5 Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330-360), Matthew 2:5-3:7 Verses Full text In the King James Version this chapter reads: Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

Its collection consists of European and American paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, photographs, and decorative arts from the fourteenth to the early twentieth century. The Clark, along with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MassMoCA) and the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA), forms a trio of art museums in the Berkshires. The institute also serves as a center for research and higher learning. It is home to various research and academic programs, which include the Fellowship Program and the Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art. It is visited by 200,000 people a year. History =Origins= \\"The Clark\\" was created by entrepreneur, soldier, explorer, and prominent art collector Robert Sterling Clark, and his wife, Francine. After numerous adventures in the Far East, Sterling settled in Paris in 1911 and used a considerable fortune inherited from his grandfather (a principal in the Singer Sewing Machine Company) to begin amassing a private art collection. Francine joined him in collecting works of art after their marriage in 1919. The Clarks kept their collection largely private, rarely lending out any works. With the onset of the Cold War and rapid nuclear armament, they became increasingly worried about the safety of their artworks. They wanted to protect their collection from a possible attack on New York City, where they lived and where the expected heir of their collection, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was located. As such, the Clarks began looking at sites in rural New York and Massachusetts with the intention of founding a museum for their art. They visited Williamstown, Massachusetts in 1949 and began having conversations with town leaders and the administrators of Williams College and the Williams College Museum of Art. Sterling had ties to the college through his grandfather and father, both of whom had been trustees. A charter for the Clark was signed on March 14, 1950 and the Institute opened to the public on May 17, 1955 under its first director, former silver dealer Peter Guille. The Clark has since become a destination for tourists, art lovers, and scholars, helping to establish the cultural reputation of the Berkshires. Stone Hill Center at the Clark Art Institute. =Architecture= The original marble gallery building, designed by Daniel Deverell Perry, opened in 1955. The Pietro Belluschi-designed Manton Research Center, housing the library and research programs, was completed in 1973. The Clark embarked on a long-term project in 2001 to improve its campus, enlisting the help of landscape firm Reed Hildebrand and architects Tadao Ando and Annabelle Selldorf. Reed Hilderbrand redesigned the campus grounds, revamping nearby walking trails, planting 1,000 trees, and creating a reflecting pool fed by recycled water. Tadao Ando designed two additions: the Lunder Center at Stone Hill and the 42,600-square-foot Clark Center, which opened in 2008 and 2014, respectively. Envisioned as a sanctuary in the woods waiting to be discovered, the Lunder Center features two galleries and a seasonal terrace café. It is also home to the Williamstown Art Conservation Center, the largest regional conservation center in the country. The Clark Center includes more than 11,000 square feet of gallery space for special exhibitions; new dining, retail, and family spaces; and an all-glass Museum Pavilion that creates a new entrance to the original Museum Building. Situated northwest of the Museum Building, the stone, concrete, and glass Clark Center is the centerpiece of the Clark's campus and serves as its primary visitor entrance. Annabelle Selldorf was commissioned to renovate the campus’ existing structures. In the 1955 original marble building, galleries for American and decorative art were added and exhibition space was increased by 15%. In the Manton Research Center, which reopened in 2016, the auditorium and central courtyard were renovated and several galleries and a study center were created. Its renovation marked the completion of the Clark's all-encompassing expansion project. Research and Academic Program The Research and Academic Program is the manifestation of the Clark's original commitment to academic research and scholarly study. The program began in the late 1990s with the establishment of the Clark Library and the Graduate Program in the History of Art. Under the direction of John Onians, Michael Ann Holly, and Darby English, the program has since widened its purview to partner with both regional and international institutions and scholars to challenge and expand the scope of the study and production of the visual arts. Caroline Fowler is the Starr Director of the Research and Academic Program at the Clark and teaches in the Graduate Program in Art History at Williams College. The Research and Academic Program also awards between ten and sixteen Clark Fellowships a year, ranging in duration from four weeks to ten months. Clark Fellowships allow promising scholars, critics, and museum officials opportunities for research outside of their professional obligations. Fellows, along with scholars and students from all stretches of the world, are encouraged to participate in the various conferences, colloquia, workshops, curator round tables, and seminars hosted by the program. Publications like The Clark Studies in the Visual Arts, as based on the proceedings of the annual Clark Conferences, serve as another forum for the interdisciplinary exploration of art historical issues.  Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art  The Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art, established in 1972 in cooperation with the Clark, is an intensive two-year program that combines academic work, curatorial internships, workshops, an international study tour, and a range of instructors to culminate in a degree of the master of arts in the history of art. Located on the Clark Campus, the program draws on and works closely with the art history resources of both institutions. Of the nearly 1,500 graduates of the program, notable alumni include Cara Starke, Director of the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, James Rondeau, Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, and Paul Provost, Deputy Chairman of Christie's.  Educational programs  The Clark offers extensive public educational programs that range from guided gallery talks to lectures, film series, studio art courses, and interactive activities for children to engage visitors of all ages and backgrounds with the Clark's collections and exhibitions. The interactive nature of the programs reflects the general mission of the Clark to advance the public understanding of art's transformative power.  Clark Prize for Excellence in Arts Writing  The Clark Prize for Excellence in Arts Writing has been awarded every other year since 2006. The prize \\"celebrates informed, insightful, and accessible prose that advances the public understanding and appreciation of the visual arts.\\" The award is presented for \\"critical or historical writing that conveys complex ideas in a manner that is grounded in scholarship yet appealing to a diverse range of audiences.\\" In 2006, three people were honored. Since then, one person has been selected each time it has been given.[8] Winners of the Prize are: * 2006: Kobena Mercer, Linda Nochlin and Calvin Tomkins * 2008: Peter Schjeldahl * 2010: Hal Foster * 2012: Brian O'Doherty * 2015: Eileen Myles  Management  The museum's most recent $145 million expansion project has been funded through private donations, foundation support, the Massachusetts Cultural Facilities Fund, and bond financing organized in conjunction with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Collection Initially, the Clarks concentrated on Italian, Dutch, and Flemish Old Master paintings. Over time, their tastes shifted towards artists like John Singer Sargent, Edgar Degas, Winslow Homer, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. After 1920, the Clarks focused mainly on the art of 19th-century France — specifically works of Impressionism and the Barbizon School. Over the next 35 years, the Clarks would add to their private collection, increasing their holdings of paintings, porcelain, silver, prints, and drawings from the early fourteenth to the early twentieth century. Since its establishment in 1955, the Clark Art Institute has continued to grow its collection through acquisitions, gifts, and bequests, with a recent focus on expanding its photography collection. In 2007, the Manton Foundation donated the collection of its founders, Sir Edwin and Lady Manton, to the museum. The Manton Collection of British Art includes more than 200 works by British artists like J.M.W. Turner, Thomas Gainsborough, and John Constable. In 2013, Frank and Katherine Martucci gave the museum eight George Inness landscapes, supplementing his two works already in the collection. Today, the museum is best known for its works of French Impressionism, specifically the paintings of Renoir, academic paintings by Jean-Léon Gérôme and William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and its collection of European and American silver. Collection highlights Piero della Francesca, Madonna and Child, c. 1475-1482 J. M. W.

A German garden is a type of architecture of gardens, originating in Germany, influenced by the English garden concept. . With staffages (e.g. grotto) and weeping trees a sense of emotional aesthetics should be developed. Typical of this kind of park design is clear structure and domestic animals, a necessary component of the garden, as seen in former times in the Luisium Palace near Dessau in Germany or still existing the historistic park of Villa Haas (Hesse) from 1892. Livestock in the park serve to enhance the idyll (nature experience). The park area therefore had to be redesigned to protect the plants (walls, hedges, watercourses, fences). The term \\"Ornamental Farm\\", which is still used today in manors with small park areas, forms a flowing border to this. Here, too, beauty always serves the useful. An own German garden style, as demanded by the leading German garden theorist Hirschfeld and his pupils, is never concretized in the literature compared to the French or English style. Therefore, in addition to the usual references to ancient mythology, the German style is limited to the decoration of statues, memorial stones, etc. of national importance. If the English landscape garden mostly is the expression of a liberal bourgeoisie, the German garden is more oriented towards the model of the nobility and later incorporates elements of German Romanticism and other styles.

An imaginary portrait by Albrecht Dürer Imperial Crown (Reichskrone) Imperial Orb (Reichsapfel) Coronation Gospel (Krönungsevangeliar) Glove from Palermo before 1220 The Imperial Regalia, also Imperial Insignia (in German Reichskleinodien, Reichsinsignien or Reichsschatz), are regalia of the Holy Roman Emperor. The most important parts are the Imperial Crown, the Imperial orb, the Imperial sceptre, the Holy Lance and the Imperial Sword. Today they are kept at the Imperial Treasury in the Hofburg palace in Vienna, Austria. The Imperial Regalia are the only completely preserved regalia from the Middle Ages. During the late Middle Ages, the word Imperial Regalia (Reichskleinodien) had many variations in the Latin language. The regalia were named in Latin: insignia imperialia, regalia insignia, insignia imperalis capellae quae regalia dicuntur and other similar words. Components The regalia is composed of two different parts. The greater group are the so-called Nürnberger Kleinodien (roughly translated Nuremberg jewels), named after the town of Nuremberg, where the regalia were kept from 1424 to 1796. This part comprised the Imperial Crown, parts of the coronation vestments, the Imperial Orb, the Imperial Sceptre, the Imperial Sword, the Ceremonial Sword, the Imperial Cross, the Holy Lance, and all other reliquaries except St. Stephen's Purse. St. Stephen's Purse, the Imperial Bible, and the so-called Sabre of Charlemagne were kept in Aachen until 1794, which gave them the name Aachener Kleinodien (Aachen jewels). It is not known how long they have been considered among the Imperial Regalia, nor how long they had been in Aachen. {  colspan=\\"2\\" Present inventory in Vienna: ----- bgcolor=\\"#8DB6CD\\" !Aachen regalia (Aachener Kleinodien) !Probable place of origin, and date of production ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  width=\\"300px\\"  Imperial Bible (Reichsevangeliar or Krönungsevangeliar)  width=\\"300px\\"  Aachen, end of 8th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  St. Stephen's Purse (Stephansbursa)  Carolingian, 1st third of 9th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Sabre of Charlemagne (Säbel Karl des Großen)  Eastern Europe, 2nd half of 9th century } { ----- bgcolor=\\"#8DB6CD\\" !Nuremberg regalia (Nürnberger Kleinodien) !Probable place of origin, and date of production ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\" width=\\"300px\\" Imperial Crown (Reichskrone)  width=\\"300px\\"  Western Germany, 2nd half of 10th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Imperial Cross (Reichskreuz)  Western Germany, around 1024/1025 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Holy Lance (Heilige Lanze)  Langobardian, 8th/9th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Relics of the True Cross (Kreuzpartikel)  ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Imperial Sword (Reichsschwert)  Sheath from Germany, 2nd third-part of 11th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Imperial Orb (Reichsapfel)  Western Germany, around end of 12th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Coronation Mantle (Krönungsmantel) (Pluviale)  Palermo, 1133/34 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Alb  Palermo, 1181 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Dalmatic (Dalmatica or Tunicella)  Palermo, around 1140 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Stockings  Palermo, around 1170 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Shoes  Palermo, around 1130 or around 1220 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Gloves  Palermo, 1220 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Ceremonial Sword (Zeremonienschwert)  Palermo, 1220 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Stole (Stola)  Central Italy, before 1338 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Eagle-dalmatic (Adlerdalmatica)  Upper Germany, before 1350 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Imperial Sceptre (Zepter)  Germany, 1st half of 14th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Aspergille  Germany, 1st. half of 14th century ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Reliquary with chains  Rome or Prague, around 1368 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Reliquary with a piece of vestment of the John the Evangelist  Rome or Prague, around 1368 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Reliquary with a shaving of the Crib of Christ  Rome or Prague, around 1368 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Reliquary with an arm-bone of St. Anne  probably Prague after 1350 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Reliquary with a tooth of John the Baptist  Bohemia, after 1350 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Case (Futteral) of the Imperial Crown  Prague, after 1350 ----- bgcolor=\\"#FFF2CA\\"  Reliquary with a piece of the tablecloth used during the Last Supper  } History =Middle Ages= The Holy Lance The inventory of the regalia during the late Middle Ages normally consisted only of five to six items. Goffredo da Viterbo counted following items: the Imperial Cross, the Holy Lance, the crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the sword. On other lists, however, the sword is not mentioned. Whether the medieval chronicles really do refer to the same regalia which are kept in Vienna today depends on a variety of factors. Descriptions of the emperors only spoke of them being “clothed in imperial regalia” without exactly describing which items they were. The crown can only be dated back to the 13th century, when it is described in a medieval poem. The poem speaks of the Waise (i.e., The Orphan) stone, which was a big and prominent jewel on the front of the crown, probably a white opal with an exceptionally brilliant red fire and has since been replaced by a triangular blue sapphire. The first definite pictorial image of the crown can only be found later in a mural in the Karlstein Castle close to Prague. It is also difficult to define for how long the Imperial and Ceremonial Swords have belonged to the regalia. =Whereabouts in medieval times= Until the 15th century the Imperial Regalia had no firm depository and sometimes accompanied the ruler on his trips through the empire. Above all with conflicts around the legality of the rule it was important to own the insignia. As depositories during this time some imperial castles or seats of reliable ministerialises are known: Emperor Leopold II, September 1790 * Limburg Abbey near Dürkheim (Palatinate) (11th century) * Harzburg (11th century) * Imperial Palace of Goslar (11th, 13th century) * Castle Hammerstein at Rhine (1125) * Trifels Castle near Annweiler (12th, 13th century, with interruptions) * Imperial chapel of Haguenau (12th, 13th century, with interruptions) * Waldburg Castle near Ravensburg (c. 1220–1240) * Krautheim Castle on the river Jagst (probably 1240–1242) * Kyburg Palace, today Canton of Zurich in Switzerland (1273–1322, with one interruption) * Castle Stein, municipality of Rheinfelden in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland (about 1280 under Rudolf of Habsburg) * Alter Hof (Old Court) in Munich (under Ludwig the Bavarian, 1324–1350) * St. Vitus Cathedral (Prague) and Karlstein Castle in Bohemia (c. 1350/52–1421) * Plintenburg and Ofen in Hungary (1421–1424) =Committal to Nuremberg= Heilig-Geist-Spital in Nuremberg, along the Pegnitz river, with the Holy Ghost chapel to the left Emperor Sigismund transferred the Imperial Regalia \\"to everlasting preservation\\" to the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg with a dated document on 29 September 1423. They arrived there on 22 March the following year from Plintenburg, and were kept in the chapel of the Heilig-Geist-Spital. Once a year they were shown to believers in a so-called Heiltumsweisung (worship show), on the fourteenth day after Good Friday. For coronations they were brought to Frankfurt Cathedral. =Ceremonial decoration= The last Emperor Francis II, dressed with the Imperial Insignia of the Holy Roman Empire. Since the Age of Enlightenment at least, the imperial regalia had no constitutive or confirming character for the imperial function any more. It served merely as an adornment for the coronation of the emperors, who all belonged to the House of Habsburg and since the early 16th century had ceased to be crowned by the pope. Johann Wolfgang Goethe on 3 April 1764, was an eyewitness in Frankfurt during the coronation of the 18-year-old Joseph, Duke of Lorraine to King in Germany. He wrote dismissively about the event in his autobiography Dichtung und Wahrheit (): =Refuge in Vienna= While French troops were advancing in 1794 in the direction of Aachen during the War of the First Coalition, the pieces located there were brought to the Capuchin's monastery in Paderborn. In July 1796, French troops crossed the Rhine and shortly thereafter reached Franconia. On 23 July the most important parts of the Imperial Regalia (crown, sceptre, orb, eight pieces of the vestments) were hastily evacuated by Nuremberg colonel Johann Georg Haller von Hallerstein from Nuremberg to Regensburg, where they arrived the next day. On 28 September the remaining parts of the jewels were also delivered to Regensburg. Since this elopement parts of the treasure are missing. Until 1800 the Imperial Regalia remained in the Saint Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg, from where their transfer began to Vienna on 30 June. The committal there is verified for 29 October. The pieces from Aachen were brought in 1798 to Hildesheim and didn't reach Vienna before 1801. =Time of the National Socialism and post-war period= Checking the Imperial Regalia at delivery in 1946 in Austria's central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank in Vienna, National Archives Washington, DC After the Anschluss of Austria to the Nazi Reich in 1938 the imperial regalia were returned on instruction by Adolf Hitler to Nuremberg, where they were exhibited in the Katharinenkirche. In the Second World War they were stored for protection from air raids in the Historischer Kunstbunker () beneath Nuremberg Castle. In 1945 the imperial regalia were found there by US soldiers and were brought back in 1946 to the Hofburg in Vienna.

It is an agricultural and tourist center of some importance with a population of about 41,000. Its name refers to a type of bamboo cane. It is one of the cities on the Bogotá-Medellín highway. Its main plaza is featured on the Colombian ten-thousand pesos bill, and is one of the seats of the Roman Catholic Diocese of La Dorada–Guaduas  History  The early inhabitants of the \\"Valley of the Guaduas\\" were the indigenous Panche people. It was an important stop on the road from Santa Fe (now Bogotá) to Honda, located in a small, fertile valley. The town proper was founded on April 20, 1572 by Andrés Díaz Venero de Leiva. It was abandoned after its foundation until December 13, 1610, when Fray Tomas de Morales founded the Franciscan monastery of La Soledad on the same location. It was recognized officially as a villa on December 27, 1644 and formally re-founded by Francisco Pérez de Guzmán. In 1696, Guaduas became a parish seat, thanks to a charter from King Charles II. The convent was closed around 1805. In 1809 Fray Domingo de Petres, a Capuchin architect who also directed the construction of the Cathedral of Bogotá, began building a church in the village. The original convent building was subsequently transformed into a prison by order of the Congress of Cucuta. Guaduas was a center of botanical experimentation, which included the introduction of níspero trees from the West Indies in the late 18th century. The crop is now widely cultivated in the region. The provincial constitution of 1815 upgraded Guaduas to a canton, which in turn was incorporated into the province of Bogotá in 1824. The town experienced rapid growth after that. The first official school was opened in 1833, the town acquired the status of provincial capital in 1857, four years later the local hospital was founded, and in 1871 it was connected to the national telegraph network.  The 7 Wonders of Guaduas  In 2007, the school community of Guaduas picked 7 of the locality's most notable features or locations: * Convento de la Soledad Currently houses the municipal government, Simon Bolívar and Antonio Nariño are known to have stayed here. Built by Father Thomas Morales on December 13, 1610, this was the town's first colonial building. * Navarro bridge Inaugurated on January 16, 1899 and declared a National Monument on May 10, 1994 for its technical and aesthetic merits and relevance in national history as well as an example of engineering in Colombia. * Puerto Gallot Located 3 km from the Inspectorate of Puerto Bogota, the first river port in the new Kingdom of Granada. Well-preserved colonial buildings. * Salavarrieta Policarpa House Museum House where Policarpa Salavarrieta was born and lived. * Aboriginal settlement Located 22 km from the town. Archaeological pieces that date from about 200 BC C., fossilized stones and other samples are still routinely found here. * Mirador Piedra Capira Overlook point that covers much of the region, including the snow- covered Magdalena Ruiz, Santa Isabel and Tolima. * Puerto Bogotá One of the most well-known historical locations in Guaduas. Dating from 1555, there are plans to build a theme park there to showcase the culture and history not only of Guaduas, or Cundinamarca, but the Republic of Colombia as a whole.

(2001). Research Design Explained (4th Ed) New York:Harcourt. In other words, it is the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to and across other situations, people, stimuli, and times.Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., Akert, R. M., & Fehr, B. (2007). Social psychology. (4 ed.). Toronto, ON: Pearson Education. In contrast, internal validity is the validity of conclusions drawn within the context of a particular study. Because general conclusions are almost always a goal in research, external validity is an important property of any study. Mathematical analysis of external validity concerns a determination of whether generalization across heterogeneous populations is feasible, and devising statistical and computational methods that produce valid generalizations. Threats \\"A threat to external validity is an explanation of how you might be wrong in making a generalization from the findings of a particular study.\\"Trochim, William M. The Research Methods Knowledge Base, 2nd Edition. In most cases, generalizability is limited when the effect of one factor (i.e. the independent variable) depends on other factors. Therefore, all threats to external validity can be described as statistical interactions. Some examples include: * Aptitude by treatment Interaction: The sample may have certain features that interact with the independent variable, limiting generalizability. For example, comparative psychotherapy studies often employ specific samples (e.g. volunteers, highly depressed, no comorbidity). If psychotherapy is found effective for these sample patients, will it also be effective for non-volunteers or the mildly depressed or patients with concurrent other disorders? If not, the external validity of the study would be limited. * Situation by treatment interactions: All situational specifics (e.g. treatment conditions, time, location, lighting, noise, treatment administration, investigator, timing, scope and extent of measurement, etc.) of a study potentially limit generalizability. * Pre-test by treatment interactions: If cause-effect relationships can only be found when pre-tests are carried out, then this also limits the generality of the findings. This sometimes goes under the label \\"sensitization\\", because the pretest makes people more sensitive to the manipulation of the treatment. Note that a study's external validity is limited by its internal validity. If a causal inference made within a study is invalid, then generalizations of that inference to other contexts will also be invalid. Cook and Campbell made the crucial distinction between generalizing to some population and generalizing across subpopulations defined by different levels of some background factor. Lynch has argued that it is almost never possible to generalize to meaningful populations except as a snapshot of history, but it is possible to test the degree to which the effect of some cause on some dependent variable generalizes across subpopulations that vary in some background factor. That requires a test of whether the treatment effect being investigated is moderated by interactions with one or more background factors. Disarming threats Whereas enumerating threats to validity may help researchers avoid unwarranted generalizations, many of those threats can be disarmed, or neutralized in a systematic way, so as to enable a valid generalization. Specifically, experimental findings from one population can be \\"re-processed\\", or \\"re-calibrated\\" so as to circumvent population differences and produce valid generalizations in a second population, where experiments cannot be performed. Pearl and Bareinboim classified generalization problems into two categories: (1) those that lend themselves to valid re-calibration, and (2) those where external validity is theoretically impossible. Using graph-based calculus, they derived a necessary and sufficient condition for a problem instance to enable a valid generalization, and devised algorithms that automatically produce the needed re-calibration, whenever such exists. This reduces the external validity problem to an exercise in graph theory, and has led some philosophers to conclude that the problem is now solved. An important variant of the external validity problem deals with selection bias, also known as sampling bias—that is, bias created when studies are conducted on non- representative samples of the intended population. For example, if a clinical trial is conducted on college students, an investigator may wish to know whether the results generalize to the entire population, where attributes such as age, education, and income differ substantially from those of a typical student. The graph-based method of Bareinboim and Pearl identifies conditions under which sample selection bias can be circumvented and, when these conditions are met, the method constructs an unbiased estimator of the average causal effect in the entire population. The main difference between generalization from improperly sampled studies and generalization across disparate populations lies in the fact that disparities among populations are usually caused by preexisting factors, such as age or ethnicity, whereas selection bias is often caused by post-treatment conditions, for example, patients dropping out of the study, or patients selected by severity of injury. When selection is governed by post-treatment factors, unconventional re-calibration methods are required to ensure bias-free estimation, and these methods are readily obtained from the problem's graph. Examples If age is judged to be a major factor causing treatment effect to vary from individual to individual, then age differences between the sampled students and the general population would lead to a biased estimate of the average treatment effect in that population. Such bias can be corrected though by a simple re- weighing procedure: We take the age-specific effect in the student subpopulation and compute its average using the age distribution in the general population. This would give us an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect in the population. If, on the other hand, the relevant factor that distinguishes the study sample from the general population is in itself affected by the treatment, then a different re-weighing scheme need be invoked. Calling this factor Z, we again average the z-specific effect of X on Y in the experimental sample, but now we weigh it by the \\"causal effect\\" of X on Z. In other words, the new weight is the proportion of units attaining level Z=z had treatment X=x been administered to the entire population. This interventional probability, often written P(Z=zdo(X=x)), can sometimes be estimated from observational studies in the general population. A typical example of this nature occurs when Z is a mediator between the treatment and outcome, For instance, the treatment may be a cholesterol- reducing drug, Z may be cholesterol level, and Y life expectancy. Here, Z is both affected by the treatment and a major factor in determining the outcome, Y. Suppose that subjects selected for the experimental study tend to have higher cholesterol levels than is typical in the general population. To estimate the average effect of the drug on survival in the entire population, we first compute the z-specific treatment effect in the experimental study, and then average it using P(Z=zdo(X=x)) as a weighting function. The estimate obtained will be bias-free even when Z and Y are confounded—that is, when there is an unmeasured common factor that affects both Z and Y. The precise conditions ensuring the validity of this and other weighting schemes are formulated in Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016 and Bareinboim et al., 2014. External, internal, and ecological validity In many studies and research designs, there may be a trade-off between internal validity and external validity: Attempts to increase internal validity may also limit the generalizability of the findings, and vice versa. This situation has led many researchers call for \\"ecologically valid\\" experiments. By that they mean that experimental procedures should resemble \\"real-world\\" conditions. They criticize the lack of ecological validity in many laboratory-based studies with a focus on artificially controlled and constricted environments. Some researchers think external validity and ecological validity are closely related in the sense that causal inferences based on ecologically valid research designs often allow for higher degrees of generalizability than those obtained in an artificially produced lab environment. However, this again relates to the distinction between generalizing to some population (closely related to concerns about ecological validity) and generalizing across subpopulations that differ on some background factor. Some findings produced in ecologically valid research settings may hardly be generalizable, and some findings produced in highly controlled settings may claim near-universal external validity. Thus, external and ecological validity are independent—a study may possess external validity but not ecological validity, and vice versa. Qualitative research Within the qualitative research paradigm, external validity is replaced by the concept of transferability. Transferability is the ability of research results to transfer to situations with similar parameters, populations and characteristics.Lincoln, Y.S. & Guba, E.G. (1986). But is it rigorous? Trustworthiness and authenticity in naturalistic evaluation. In D.D. Williams (Ed.), Naturalistic evaluation (pp. 73–84). New Directions for Program Evaluation, 30. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. In experiments It is common for researchers to claim that experiments are by their nature low in external validity. Some claim that many drawbacks can occur when following the experimental method. By the virtue of gaining enough control over the situation so as to randomly assign people to conditions and rule out the effects of extraneous variables, the situation can become somewhat artificial and distant from real life. There are two kinds of generalizability at issue: # The extent to which we can generalize from the situation constructed by an experimenter to real-life situations (generalizability across situations), and # The extent to which we can generalize from the people who participated in the experiment to people in general (generalizability across people) However, both of these considerations pertain to Cook and Campbell's concept of generalizing to some target population rather than the arguably more central task of assessing the generalizability of findings from an experiment across subpopulations that differ from the specific situation studied and people who differ from the respondents studied in some meaningful way. Critics of experiments suggest that external validity could be improved by use of field settings (or, at a minimum, realistic laboratory settings) and by use of true probability samples of respondents. However, if one's goal is to understand generalizability across subpopulations that differ in situational or personal background factors, these remedies do not have the efficacy in increasing external validity that is commonly ascribed to them. If background factor X treatment interactions exist of which the researcher is unaware (as seems likely), these research practices can mask a substantial lack of external validity. Dipboye and Flanagan, writing about industrial and organizational psychology, note that the evidence is that findings from one field setting and from one lab setting are equally unlikely to generalize to a second field setting. Thus, field studies are not by their nature high in external validity and laboratory studies are not by their nature low in external validity. It depends in both cases whether the particular treatment effect studied would change with changes in background factors that are held constant in that study. If one's study is \\"unrealistic\\" on the level of some background factor that does not interact with the treatments, it has no effect on external validity. It is only if an experiment holds some background factor constant at an unrealistic level and if varying that background factor would have revealed a strong Treatment x Background factor interaction, that external validity is threatened. =Generalizability across situations= Research in psychology experiments attempted in universities are often criticized for being conducted in artificial situations and that it cannot be generalized to real life.Aronson, E., & Carlsmith, J.M. (1968). Experimentation in social psychology. In G. Lindzey & E. Aronson(Eds.), The Handbook of social psychology. (Vol. 2, pp. 1–79.) Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. To solve this problem, social psychologists attempt to increase the generalizability of their results by making their studies as realistic as possible. As noted above, this is in the hope of generalizing to some specific population. Realism per se does not help the make statements about whether the results would change if the setting were somehow more realistic, or if study participants were placed in a different realistic setting. If only one setting is tested, it is not possible to make statements about generalizability across settings. However, many authors conflate external validity and realism. There is more than one way that an experiment can be realistic: # The similarity of an experimental situation to events that occur frequently in everyday life—it is clear that many experiments are decidedly unreal. # In many experiments, people are placed in situations they would rarely encounter in everyday life. This is referred to the extent to which an experiment is similar to real-life situations as the experiment's mundane realism. It is more important to ensure that a study is high in psychological realism—how similar the psychological processes triggered in an experiment are to psychological processes that occur in everyday life.Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., & Brewer, m. (1998). Experimental methods. In D. Gilbert, S. Fiske, & G. Lindzey (Eds.), The handbook of social psychology. (4th ed., Vol. 1, pp. 99–142.) New York: Random House. Psychological realism is heightened if people find themselves engrossed in a real event. To accomplish this, researchers sometimes tell the participants a cover story—a false description of the study's purpose. If however, the experimenters were to tell the participants the purpose of the experiment then such a procedure would be low in psychological realism. In everyday life, no one knows when emergencies are going to occur and people do not have time to plan responses to them. This means that the kinds of psychological processes triggered would differ widely from those of a real emergency, reducing the psychological realism of the study. People don't always know why they do what they do, or what they do until it happens. Therefore, describing an experimental situation to participants and then asking them to respond normally will produce responses that may not match the behavior of people who are actually in the same situation. We cannot depend on people's predictions about what they would do in a hypothetical situation; we can only find out what people will really do when we construct a situation that triggers the same psychological processes as occur in the real world. =Generalizability across people= Social psychologists study the way in which people in general are susceptible to social influence. Several experiments have documented an interesting, unexpected example of social influence, whereby the mere knowledge that others were present reduced the likelihood that people helped. The only way to be certain that the results of an experiment represent the behaviour of a particular population is to ensure that participants are randomly selected from that population. Samples in experiments cannot be randomly selected just as they are in surveys because it is impractical and expensive to select random samples for social psychology experiments. It is difficult enough to convince a random sample of people to agree to answer a few questions over the telephone as part of a political poll, and such polls can cost thousands of dollars to conduct. Moreover, even if one somehow was able to recruit a truly random sample, there can be unobserved heterogeneity in the effects of the experimental treatments... A treatment can have a positive effect on some subgroups but a negative effect on others. The effects shown in the treatment averages may not generalize to any subgroup. Many researchers address this problem by studying basic psychological processes that make people susceptible to social influence, assuming that these processes are so fundamental that they are universally shared. Some social psychologist processes do vary in different cultures and in those cases, diverse samples of people have to be studied. =Replications= The ultimate test of an experiment's external validity is replication — conducting the study over again, generally with different subject populations or in different settings. Researches will often use different methods, to see if they still get the same results. When many studies of one problem are conducted, the results can vary. Several studies might find an effect of the number of bystanders on helping behaviour, whereas a few do not. To make sense out of this, there is a statistical technique called meta-analysis that averages the results of two or more studies to see if the effect of an independent variable is reliable. A meta analysis essentially tells us the probability that the findings across the results of many studies are attributable to chance or to the independent variable. If an independent variable is found to have an effect in only one of 20 studies, the meta-analysis will tell you that that one study was an exception and that, on average, the independent variable is not influencing the dependent variable. If an independent variable is having an effect in most of the studies, the meta analysis is likely to tell us that, on average, it does influence the dependent variable. There can be reliable phenomena that are not limited to the laboratory. For example, increasing the number of bystanders has been found to inhibit helping behaviour with many kinds of people, including children, university students, and future ministers; in Israel; in small towns and large cities in the U.S.; in a variety of settings, such as psychology laboratories, city streets, and subway trains; and with a variety of types of emergencies, such as seizures, potential fires, fights, and accidents, as well as with less serious events, such as having a flat tire. Many of these replications have been conducted in real-life settings where people could not possibly have known that an experiment was being conducted. Basic dilemma of the social psychologist When conducting experiments in psychology, some believe that there is always a trade-off between internal and external validity— # having enough control over the situation to ensure that no extraneous variables are influencing the results and to randomly assign people to conditions, and # ensuring that the results can be generalized to everyday life. Some researchers believe that a good way to increase external validity is by conducting field experiments. In a field experiment, people's behavior is studied outside the laboratory, in its natural setting. A field experiment is identical in design to a laboratory experiment, except that it is conducted in a real-life setting. The participants in a field experiment are unaware that the events they experience are in fact an experiment. Some claim that the external validity of such an experiment is high because it is taking place in the real world, with real people who are more diverse than a typical university student sample. However, as real-world settings differ dramatically, findings in one real-world setting may or may not generalize to another real-world setting. Neither internal nor external validity are captured in a single experiment. Social psychologists opt first for internal validity, conducting laboratory experiments in which people are randomly assigned to different conditions and all extraneous variables are controlled. Other social psychologists prefer external validity to control, conducting most of their research in field studies, and many do both. Taken together, both types of studies meet the requirements of the perfect experiment. Through replication, researchers can study a given research question with maximal internal and external validity.Latane, B., & Darley, J.M. (1970). The unresponsive bystander: Why doesn't he help?

Description The Tridentine Mass was the normative usage of the Roman Rite Mass from the time of the Council of Trent until the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. When the Mass of Paul VI, the newer usage of the Roman rite of Mass, replaced the Tridentine Mass, the older usage of the Roman rite of Mass, , but prior to ', celebrets were issued by the Holy See to some priests permitting them to licitly celebrate the older usage, but bishops complained about this approach. In 1971 Pope Paul VI permitted, in what is known as the Heenan or the Agatha Christie indult, local bishops in the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales to permit the occasional celebration of the older usage according to the 1967 modifications to the 1965 edition of the Roman Missal. In 1984, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments issued an indult to diocesan bishops, in ', which permitted the diocesan bishops to grant indults, under certain conditions, to churches and oratories permitting celebration of the older usage in Latin according to the 1962 edition.

They decried those who accepted the conditions attached to the ' indult, applying to them the term indult Catholics, and frequently did not recognise them as fellow traditionalists. In 1988 following the canonically illicit consecration, at Ecône, Switzerland, of four Society of St. Pius X members as bishops by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, John Paul II recommended, in Ecclesia Dei, a \\"wide and generous application\\" of the norms in ' and established the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei to facilitate the return of traditionalist Catholics into full communion with the Holy See.

It replaced the norms in ' and ', which regulated through diocesan level indults, with universal church law. Benedict XVI wrote that \\"precise juridical norms\\" regulating the use of the 1962 Missal were missing because some bishops \\"feared that the authority of the Council would be called into question.\\" Benedict XVI wrote that while \\"fidelity to the old Missal became an external mark of identity\\" in the Society of St. Pius X, \\"the reasons for the break which arose over this, however, were at a deeper level.\\" Notes References Category:Ecclesia Dei Category:History of the Catholic Church Category:Anti-Catholic slurs ","title":"Indult Catholic"},{"id":"1900629","text":"St Mary's College St Mary's College, founded as New College or College of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is the home of the Faculty and School of Divinity within the University of St Andrews, in Fife, Scotland.  History  The college was founded in 1538 by Archbishop James Beaton, uncle of Cardinal David Beaton on the site of the Pedagogy or St John's College (founded 1418).St John's College, St Andrews St Mary's College was intended to preserve the teachings of the Catholic church against the Protestant teachings of the reformers. It was dedicated to a revival of learning on the Continental trilingual model and from the outset laid emphasis on the knowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew. In 1579, nineteen years after the Reformation brought fundamental changes to the religious life of the Scottish nation, St Mary's College was reconstituted, under the influence of Andrew Melville, as the Faculty of Divinity of the university. At its foundation in 1538 St Mary's was intended to be a College for instruction in Divinity, Law, and Medicine, as well as in Arts, but its career on this extensive scale was short-lived. Under a new foundation and erection, confirmed by Parliament in 1579, it was set apart for the study of Theology only, and it has remained a Divinity College ever since. From 1580 onwards each Principal has acted as primarius Professor of Divinity, or first Master. St Mary's College retains much of its original sixteenth century buildings, specifically the north and West ranges. The Quad contains a thorn tree said to have been planted by Mary, Queen of Scots, during her many visits to St. Andrews. The Quad also contains the historic King James Library founded by King James VI & I in 1612. In addition the College has The Roundel, a 16th-century building dedicated for doctoral students studying divinity at the University of St Andrews. The Roundel The college is one of five approved centres for the training of Church of Scotland ministers. Graduates include the Very Rev Dr Finlay Macdonald, the immediate past Principal Clerk to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and a former Moderator. As of 1 May 2018, the Principal of St Mary's College was Rev. Dr. Stephen Holmes, also Head of the School of Divinity, who had replaced Ian Bradley (Professor Emeritus).  Rankings  As of May 2015, the Faculty and School of Divinity forms an academic community of some 131 persons: 16 members of staff; 55 postgraduate students; and 60 undergraduates. According to The Complete University Guide 2016 the School of Divinity is placed first in the United Kingdom for undergraduate studies ahead of Durham in second place and Cambridge in third. In the 2016 Guardian University Guide it is also ranked first in the United Kingdom in religious studies and theology.  Centres  College Hall, St Mary's College The college has four research centres. The Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts (ITIA) was founded within the college by professors Trevor Hart and Jeremy Begbie (currently Thomas A. Langford Research Professor at Duke Divinity School) in 2000. It \\"aims to advance and enrich an active conversation between Christian theology and the arts – bringing rigorous theological thinking to the arts, and bringing the resources of the arts to the enterprise of theology.\\" The current director is Dr Gavin Hopps. The Centre for the Study of Religion and Politics (CSRP) was founded in November 2004 by a group of academics attached to the Schools of Divinity, International Relations, Modern Languages, and Philosophical and Anthropological Studies. The need for a centre of learning to consider the role of religion and politics was highlighted by the support garnered from a diverse range of scholars and religious and political figures who endorsed the Centre's establishment. These supporters who have continued as Patrons of the Centre include Gustavo Gutiérrez, Cardinal O'Brien, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Carole Hillenbrand, Ian Linden, Julian Filochowski, J.D.Y.

The SSPX was an association of priests that Lefebvre had founded in 1970. Its members distrusted the changes then taking place in the Church in the years following the Second Vatican Council. Referring to these consecrations, the Pope wrote in Ecclesia Dei: \\"In itself, this act was one of disobedience to the Roman Pontiff in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church, such as is the ordination of bishops whereby the apostolic succession is sacramentally perpetuated. Hence such disobedience – which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy – constitutes a schismatic act (cf. Code of Canon Law, can. 751). In performing such an act, notwithstanding the formal canonical warning sent to them by the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops on 17 June last, Mons. Lefebvre and the priests Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson and Alfonso de Galarreta have incurred the grave penalty of excommunication envisaged by ecclesiastical law (cf. Code of Canon Law, can. 1382).\\"Ecclesia Dei , 3 Followers of Archbishop Lefebvre Pope John Paul II went on to make \\"an appeal both solemn and heartfelt, paternal and fraternal, to all those who until now have been linked in various ways to the movement of Archbishop Lefebvre, that they may fulfil the grave duty of remaining united to the Vicar of Christ in the unity of the Catholic Church, and of ceasing their support in any way for that movement. Everyone should be aware that formal adherence to the schism is a grave offence against God and carries the penalty of excommunication decreed by the Church's law (cf. Code of Canon Law, can. 1364).\\"Ecclesia Dei, 5 c) The Pope instituted the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei to assist those who had been associated with Archbishop Lefebvre but who wished \\"to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church, while preserving their spiritual and liturgical traditions, in the light of the Protocol signed on 5 May last by Cardinal Ratzinger and Mons. Lefebvre\\",Ecclesia Dei, 6 a) a protocol that Archbishop Lefebvre later repudiated. Use of the Tridentine Mass The Pope stated: \\"Respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition, by a wide and generous application of the directives already issued some time ago by the Apostolic See for the use of the Roman Missal according to the typical edition of 1962\\". In this the Pope expanded the scope of permission already granted under the 1984 special indult Quattuor Abhinc Annos.Congregation for Divine Worship, Letter Quattuor abhinc annos. 3 Oct. 1984: AAS 76 (1984) pp. 1088-1089) The conditions indicated in the document to which Pope John Paul referred were replaced on 7 July 2007 by those indicated in the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum.Summorum Pontificum , article 1 Pontifical Commission Pope Benedict XVI gave the Commission additional functions with respect to the use of Tridentine liturgy in Summorum Pontificum on 7 July 2007. On 8 July 2009, in Ecclesiae unitatem, he modified its position within the Roman Curia by making the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) the ex officio head of the Commission. On 17 January 2019, Pope Francis abolished the Commission and transferred its responsibilities to a \\"special section\\" within the CDF.

Overview Race categories vary by the number of athletes in the boat, the length of the course, and whether the boat is a canoe or kayak. Canoe sprints are sometimes referred to as flat water racing. The distances recognized by the ICF for international canoe sprint races are 200m, 500m, and 1000m. These races take place on straight courses with each boat paddling in its own designated lane. Longer marathon races do exist, notably the 5000m (also an ICF-recognized distance) – these usually have athletes starting in a large pack at a start line before paddling around a set course with marked turning points (there are no assigned lanes). For each race a number of heats, semi- finals and a final may be necessary, depending on the number of competitors. The sport is governed by the International Canoe Federation. The International Canoe Federation is the worldwide canoeing organization and creates the standard rules for the different disciplines of canoe/kayak competition. The ICF recognizes several competitive and non-competitive disciplines of canoeing, of which Sprint and Slalom are the only two competing in the Olympic games. On the whole, Europe has dominated the sport, winning over 90% of all available medals. The official boats recognized by the ICF as 'International Boats' are: K1, K2, K4, C1, C2 and C4, where the number indicates the number of paddlers, “K” stands for kayak and “C” for canoe. The ICF rules for these boats define, among others, the maximum length, the minimum weight and the shape of the boats – for instance, a K1 must be 520 cm long and weighs at least 8 kg for marathons or 12 kg for sprints. Originally, width (beam) restrictions were also enforced; these were revoked in 2000, spurring a flurry of innovations in boat designs. Modern boats are usually made of carbon fiber, aramid fiber (e.g., Kevlar) with epoxy resin, or variants of high-performance fiber-glass. Kayak In a kayak, the paddler is seated in the direction of travel, and uses a double-bladed paddle. Kayaks have a rudder for steering and course adjustment, which is operated by the feet of the paddler in the front. The paddle used is usually a 'wing paddle' (although standard asymmetrical paddles can also be used) – wing paddles have blades which are shaped to resemble a wing or spoon, creating lift and increasing the power and stability of the stroke. There are many variations of wing paddles, ranging from longer and narrower options for more stability throughout the entire stroke to more extreme 'teardrop' shaped paddles for a firmer application of power at the start of the stroke. Canoe In a canoe the paddler kneels on one knee with the other leg forward and foot flat on the floor of the boat, and paddles a single-bladed paddle on one side only with what is known as a 'J-stroke' to control the boat's direction. In Canada, a racing class exists for the C-15 or WC or \\"War Canoe\\", as well as a similarly designed C-4 (which is much shorter and more squat than an 'International' C-4). An antiquated boat class is the C-7, resembling a large C4 which was debuted by the ICF with little success. For racing canoes, the blade is typically short and broad, with a 'power face' on one side that is either flat or scalloped out. The shaft will typically be longer than a tripping canoe paddle, because the kneeling position puts the paddler higher above the surface of the water. More recent designs of canoe racing paddles often have a slight bent shaft, commonly 12–14 degrees. (a concept of canoe designer Eugene Jensen in the 1960s). Many high-performance canoe paddlers prefer the feel of a wooden handle with a carbon fiber shaft and blade, while nearly all high-performance kayak paddlers use paddles made completely of carbon fiber.

Like its predecessor (the Eye of Terror Campaign) and its successor (The War of the Ring Online Campaign), it was extremely popular, and attracted several thousand players. The basic premise was that players of Warhammer Fantasy Battle, Mordheim, and Warmaster were invited to register the results of their games at the Storm of Chaos Website, where a tactical map of the north of the Empire existed. Upon registering a battle, one army would be counted attacker, the other defender. Depending on which side the results favoured, either the attackers or the defenders would get a little more of the map, and occasionally some side benefits.  Campaign background  For several centuries, the Lord Archaon sought the six treasures of Chaos: The Armor, the Eye, the Blade, the Mark, the Steed, and the Crown. According to the myths of Chaos worshippers, the one who manages to gain them all will become the Everchosen, Lord of the End Times, the champion of the gods destined bring about the final triumph of Chaos. He finally managed to gain the six treasures in the year 2521 IC. At the same time, the Chaos Warlord Surtha Lenk attacked Kislev and pushed through to the Empire, sacking the Ostland capital of Wolfenburg before being crushed by Imperial reinforcements. At the same time, Luthor Huss, a self-styled prophet of Sigmar, had started to challenge the hierarchy of the church of Sigmar. Huss claimed that the priesthood had become corrupt and decadent, ignoring the teachings of Grand Theogonist Volkmar the Grim and abandoning Sigmar's mission. Volkmar raised an army and journeyed to Kislev to confront Archaon. They lost, Volkmar was slain, and the war altar of Sigmar was cast down. A new Grand Theogonist, Johann Esmer, was elected, and was the epitome of everything that Luthor Huss and other grassroots clerics despised. Trapped in the Kislevite city of Praag, the Tzarina Katarin asked for aid from her old Dwarven ally Ungrim Ironfist, the Slayer King of Karak Kadrin, who responded by sending his armies, led by his son Garagrim Ironfist, to their aid. As the horde of Archaon rampaged through Kislev and into the Empire, Emperor Karl Franz invited envoys from the neighbouring kingdoms, as well as representatives of the High Elves and from the Dwarfs to the \\"Conclave of Light\\". Here, he successfully gained the support of Bretonnia, the Dwarfs and the High Elves. Huss had in the meantime found a young man named Valten who bore striking physical resemblance to Sigmar as is described in the legends, except for a birthmark shaped like a twin-tailed comet, the main symbol of the Sigmarite church. Valten was also highly skilled in battle and had a will-power to endure wounds that would kill a normal man. Huss and his following travelled to Altdorf, the capital city of The Empire, where they demanded that Valten be recognised as the reincarnation of Sigmar and so proclaim him Emperor, ignoring the immense civil unrest such a declaration would cause. By now, it was late spring, and Karl Franz, both pragmatic politician and devout Sigmarite, could neither ignore nor accept Huss's demands. In the end, he proclaimed Valten was the \\"spiritual heir\\" of Sigmar, recognising that he was blessed to some degree, but wisely retained rulership for himself. In the summer of the year IC (Imperial Calendar) 2522 Archaon attacked The Empire with the specific goal of desecrating the city of Middenheim, a holy site to the followers of Ulric, a warrior god who is second in popularity only to Sigmar.  Characters active during the campaign  *Archaon - The Everchosen, the Lord of the End Times, and leader of the Swords of Chaos warband. *Ar-Ulric Emil Valgeir, High priest of Ulric *Be'lakor, The Dark Master, a demonic power that had been punished by the chaos gods for thinking he was their equal. Be'lakor was finally released from his prison to perform the Dark Coronation. * Borgut Facebeater - Grimgor Ironhide's second in command. * Boris Todbringer, Count of Middenland. * Deathmaster Sniktch - the most skillful Skaven assassin in the world. Thought to have been Valten's assassin. *Emperor Karl Franz - or more properly: 'His most Imperial Highness, Emperor Karl-Franz Holswig-Schliestein, Grand Prince of Altdorf, Count of the Reikland, Protector of the Empire'. * Feytor the Tainted - One of Archaon's four lieutenants. A Chaos Lord devoted to Nurgle. Feytor did not have his own rules. * Garagrim Ironfist - The son of Ungrim Ironfist, Garagrim had devised a plan to rid his family line of its dishonour. By dying in combat as his father's champion, Garagrim believed he would prove the worthiness of the bloodline. He was killed when a chaos giant fell on him as it died, thus fulfilling his slayer vow. * Grimgor Ironhide - The greatest living Orc warlord suffered defeat at the hands of Crom the Conqueror a couple of months before Archaon's horde attacked the Empire. Shamed and now in a risky position, Grimgor kept control by claiming that the Orc god Gork had given him a religious vision. Guided by this vision he ordered the massacre of all the goblins in his army. He later managed to defeat Archaon in single combat. Thus satisfied, the Orc quit the field. * Haargroth the Blooded One - Haargroth was a peasant boy who proved his mettle in combat, and became a Chaos Lord devoted to Khorne and one of Archaon's four lieutenants. He was slain by Ar-Ulric Valgeir while fighting a rearguard action for Archaon. He did not have his own rules. *Johan Esmer - The then Grand Theogonist of Sigmar, did not have a special character and did not get much attention throughout the campaign, but was central in its opening phases. *Kordel Shorgaar - One of Archaon's lieutenants and the standard bearer of the Swords of Chaos. * Mannfred von Carstein - The ruler of Sylvania and a powerful vampire lord. After scattering the remnants of Archaon's army, he attempted to march on Middenheim, but was stopped by Volkmar, who warned him he could easily be slain the same as Vlad. His smug confidence shattered, Mannfred retreated to Sylvania to deal with Vardek Crom. * Melekh the Changer - One of Archaon's four lieutenants and a Chaos Lord character devoted to Tzeentch. He was executed by Archaon. Did not have his own rules. * Morathi - Hag Queen of the Witch Elves. Morathi once more swore loyalty to Slaanesh and led the Dark Elf, Cult of Slaanesh in an invasion of Lustria. * Luthor Huss - The self-styled \\"prophet of Sigmar\\" who spoke up against corruption and complacency among the priesthood. * Styrkaar - A Norse prince and one of Archaon's four lieutenants. A Chaos Lord devoted to Slaanesh. Did not have his own rules. * Teclis - The Elven High Mage. Teclis has always been worried about the place of mankind in the struggle between chaos and the world, and was therefore eager to once again help them in battle. It was Teclis who presented Valten with the magical steed Althandir, and banished Be'lakor's daemonic legion. * Valten, exalted of Sigmar - existed before the campaign, but was given his final form in the campaign book. Valten was the young man who Luthor Huss claimed was the reincarnation of Sigmar. He clashed with Archaon but there was no clear winner until Grimgor's arrival. He was later assassinated by the Skaven assassin, Deathmaster Snikch.Children of the Horned Rat. * Vardek Crom, (Crom the Conqueror), Herald of Archaon - Archaon's second in command. During the Storm of Chaos, Vardek Crom was supposed to maneuvre his troops so that they could attack the Empire from the east. Crom defeated Orc Warlord Grimgor Ironhide in single combat, leading to the Orc’s shaming. At the end of the campaign, he is presumed to have died leading an army of Kurgan through Sylvania, Mannfred Von Carstein’s homeland. * Volkmar the Grim - The resurrected former grand theogonist of Sigmar. (Since reinstated.) * Ungrim Ironfist - The \\"Slayer King\\", or more properly, The dwarven king of Karak Kadrin. * Sea Lord Aislinn - Did not have his own rules. Players were asked to use an Elven High Lord and ignore the 'Intrigue at court' rule.  Aftermath of the campaign  According to Games Workshop, the Storm of Chaos affected the whole world. Still, at the end of the campaign, the world seems to have regained its Status quo ante. Gav Thorpe, the games designer who wrote the campaign, has stated that this was intentional and that the consequences of the Storm of Chaos will be up to the individual players. The Storm of Chaos was rendered non-canon by the more recent End Times books, which made massive overarching changes to the rules, armies, factions and canon of the game, notably by removing several armies and completely changing the army selection system.

In 1988, Pope John Paul II announced that Fellay and three others were automatically excommunicated for being consecrated as bishops by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, an act that the Holy See described as \\"unlawful\\" and \\"schismatic\\".Apostolic Letter 'Ecclesia Dei' Archbishop Lefebvre, and Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer who co-consecrated these four bishops, were also excommunicated. At that time, he was the youngest bishop of the Roman Catholic Church at 29 years old. In January 2009, at Fellay's request, on YouTube the Congregation for Bishops, on instructions from Pope Benedict XVI, rescinded the excommunication.Decree remitting the excommunication latae sententiae of the Bishops of the Society of St Pius X Early life and ministry Fellay was born in Sierre, Switzerland in 1958. In October 1977, at the age of nineteen, Fellay began studies for the priesthood at the International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône, Switzerland. On 29 June 1982 he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. After his ordination, he was named Bursar General of the SSPX and was stationed at Rickenbach, the headquarters of the SSPX in Switzerland. He continued in that position for the next ten years. He is fluent in French, Italian, English, German and knows Spanish.  Consecration and excommunication  In June 1988 Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate Fellay and three other priests (Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, Richard Williamson, and Alfonso de Galarreta) as bishops. Lefebvre did not have a pontifical mandate for these consecrations (i.e. permission from the pope), normally required by Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law. On 17 June 1988 Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, prefect of the Congregation for Bishops sent the four priests a formal canonical warning that he would automatically incur the penalty of excommunication if they were to be consecrated by Lefebvre without papal permission. On 30 June 1988, Fellay and the three other priests were consecrated bishop by Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer. On 1 July 1988, Cardinal Gantin issued a declaration stating that Lefebvre, de Castro Mayer, Fellay, and the three other newly ordained bishops \\"have incurred ipso facto the excommunication latae sententiae reserved to the Apostolic See\\". On 2 July 1988, Pope John Paul II issued the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei, in which he reaffirmed the excommunication, and described the consecration as an act of \\"disobedience to the Roman pontiff in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church\\", and that \\"such disobedience – which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy – constitutes a schismatic act\\".Apostolic letter Ecclesia Dei (July 2, 1988).

SSPX Superior General In July 1994 the General Chapter of the SSPX met at Écône and elected Fellay Superior General in succession to Father Franz Schmidberger. On 12 July 2006, he was re-elected for another term of 12 years. On 29 August 2005, Fellay was received in audience by Pope Benedict XVI at Castel Gandolfo.Interview with Bishop Fellay about Papal Audience The audience was also attended by Cardinal Castrillón Hoyos and Father Schmidberger. They discussed the present state of the Church and of the SSPX, the Society's concerns about Modernism in the Church, the restoration of the Tridentine Mass, and the possible recognition of the SSPX by the Holy See. Fellay in Lourdes in 2008 By a decree of 21 January 2009 (Protocol Number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request that Bishop Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by Pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of Saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the Pope's Magisterium and authority. The canonical situation of the four bishops thus became the same as that of the other clergy of the Society, who are suspended a divinis.Letter of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei of 29 September 1995) The remissions have not been unanimously welcomed by all members of the SSPX. Florian Abrahamowicz, a SSPX's dean of Northeastern Italy, called the action \\"insulting,\\" since it claimed to remit an excommunication of these four bishops that the Society had officially maintained since 1988 did not exist.Homily on 25 January 2009 Abrahamowicz was very soon expelled by the Italian chapter of the Society of Saint Pius X for either that comment or his Holocaust-related remarks.\\"Father Florian Abrahamowicz has for some time been expressing opinions differing from the official views of the Society of St. Pius X. The painful decision to expel him has become necessary in order to avoid having the image of the Society of St. Pius X further distorted with consequent harm to its work at the service of the Church.\\" Lefebvriani, Fraternità San Pio X espelle prete negazionista 5 February 2009 Cardinal Antonio Cañizares Llovera, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, has reported Fellay as declaring that if Archbishop Lefebvre had seen how Mass is celebrated in an abbey near Florence in strict accordance with the 1970 Missal, he would not have taken the step that he did take. Speaking in relation to the talks with Rome in an interview in July 2009, Fellay said of the significance of the Second Vatican Council, \\"We will not make any compromise on the Council. I have no intention of making a compromise. The truth does not tolerate compromise. We do not want a compromise, we want clarity regarding the Council.\\" In February 2011, Fellay said that the reconciliation talks with the Vatican would soon be coming to an end, with little change in the views of either side. In addition to disputes over the changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council, new problems have been created by plans for the beatification of Pope John Paul II. Fellay said the scheduled beatification of Pope John Paul II on 1 May 2011 posed \\"a serious problem, the problem of a pontificate that caused things to proceed by leaps and bounds in the wrong direction, along 'progressive' lines, toward everything that they call 'the spirit of Vatican II.'\\" Bishop Williamson, in his weekly message, attacked Fellay for being too open to dialogue between the Society of St. Pius X and the Holy See.Bishop Williamson, \\"Doctrine Undermined\\", 26 May 2012 However, on 12 October 2013, Fellay declared, \\"We thank God, we have been preserved from any kind of agreement from last year\\", saying that the society had withdrawn the compromise text that it presented to Rome on 15 April 2012.John Vennari, \\"Bishop Fellay on Pope Francis 'What we have before us is a genuine Modernist!'\\" in Catholic Family News, October 2013 On the same occasion, he spoke of the Third Secret of Fatima as seemingly foretelling \\"both a material chastisement and a great crisis in the Church\\" and described Pope Francis as \\"a genuine Modernist\\", who, in late July 2013, had begun a series of contacts, regarding which Fellay said: \\"We may not have the entire picture at this point, we have enough to be scared to death.\\" He expressed a different view about Pope Francis on 11 May 2014, saying that Francis had read twice a biography of Archbishop Lefebvre and enjoyed it: \\"With the current pope, as he is a practical man, he looks at people. What a person thinks, what he believes, is at the end a matter of indifference to him. What matters is that this person be sympathetic in his view, that he seems correct to him, one may say it like this. And therefore he read twice Bp. Tissier de Mallerais' book on Abp. Lefebvre, and this book pleased him; he is against all that we represent, but, as a life, it pleased him.\\" He also described how Pope Francis took a tolerant view of the FSSPX in Argentina, even saying that \\"I will not condemn them, and I will not stop anyone from visiting them.\\" On 28 December 2012, in a radio interview aired from Our Lady of Mount Carmel Chapel in New Hamburg, Ontario, Canada, Bishop Fellay declared, “Who, during that time, was the most opposed that the Church would recognize the Society? The enemies of the Church. The Jews, the Masons, the Modernists.” That was taken by various media entities to be an attack on the Jewish people. The Society of St. Pius X issued the following reply: \\"The word 'enemies' used here by Bishop Fellay is of course a religious concept and refers to any group or religious sect which opposes the mission of the Catholic Church and her efforts to fulfill it: the salvation of souls. ...By referring to the Jews, Bishop Fellay's comment was aimed at the leaders of Jewish organizations, and not the Jewish people, as is being implied by journalists. Accordingly the Society of St. Pius X denounces the repeated false accusations of anti-Semitism or hate speech made in an attempt to silence its message.\\" On 9 December 2014, Bishop Fellay came at the European Parliament of Bruxelles and blessed the nativity scene made by the Naples artisan masters of via Gregory the Illuminator, on an initiative of the Italian politician Mario Borghezio (Lega Nord) and at the presence of the Veneto's governor Luca Zaia. The same benediction was replicated four years later. It was reported on 24 May 2017, that SSPX bishops have been authorized by the Vatican to ordain priests without permission of the local bishop. In July 2017, Bishop Fellay signed a document along with a number of other clergy and academics labeled as a \\"Filial Correction\\" of Pope Francis. The twenty- five page document, which was made public in September after receiving no reply from the Holy See, criticized the Pope for allegedly promoting heresy through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate. Fellay's term as Superior General concluded on 11 July 2018 upon the election of Davide Pagliarani as his successor.

Jung, Man and his Symbols (London 1978) p. 40 As a student of alchemy, he (and his followers) 'compared the \\"black work\\" of the alchemists (the nigredo) with the often highly critical involvement experienced by the ego, until it accepts the new equilibrium brought about by the creation of the self'.Hans Dieckmann, \\"Shadow (Analytical Psychology)\\" Jungians interpreted nigredo in two main psychological senses. The first sense represented a subject's initial state of undifferentiated unawareness, 'the first nigredo, that of the unio naturalis, is an objective state, visible from the outside only...an unconscious state of non-differentiation between self and object, consciousness and the unconscious'.Paul W Ashton, From the Brink 9London 2007) p. 231 Here the subject is unaware of the unconscious; i.e. the connection with the instincts'.Gerhard Adler, Studies in Analytical Psychology (London 1999) p. 19 In the second sense, 'the nigredo of the process of individuation on the other hand is a subjectively experienced process brought about by the subject's painful, growing awareness of his shadow aspects'.Ashton, Brink p. 231 It could be described as a moment of maximum despair, that is a prerequisite to personal development.Jung, C.

They were established in 1885. The club plays home games at Bell Close and currently play in the . History = Early history = Leighton Town F.C. was formed in 1885 and in their early years were winners of the Leighton and District League on several occasions. They were one of the original members of the South Midlands League (then known as the Bedfordshire County League) in 1922, the same year they changed their name to Leighton United (a change which lasted until 1963). They were also members of the Spartan League from 1922 to 1952, but their only successes were two Spartan League Division Two titles in 1923–24 and 1927–28. In 1952, they became founder member of the Hellenic League but after two seasons moved back to the South Midlands League. In 1965–66, Leighton finished bottom of the Premier Division, but won the title the following season. They then returned to the Spartan League once again, followed by a two-year spell in the United Counties League before returning once again to the South Midlands League where they were to remain until 1992. = Promotion to Isthmian League = In the 1991–92 season Leighton won the South Midlands Premier Division title and stepped up to the Isthmian League, initially in Division Three, with promotion to Division Two following in 1996. The 2000–01 season brought relegation but the club bounced back in 2004, winning the title of what was now called Division Two. That same year re-organisation of the pyramid saw them switched to the Southern League. Craig Wells resigned from the club early into the 2012–13 season – despite a strong end to the previous campaign, however he rejoined the side as manager in June 2013. Due to heavy debt and increasing costs the club made the decision not to pay their players for the 2013–14 season, becoming the only amateur side in the division. Wells left the manager's position again in June 2014, replaced by former Ampthill Town boss Craig Bicknell. After only one season at the club, Bicknell was sacked as the manager, despite the team reaching their best league position in recent years, and was replaced by former Arlesey Town, Hemel Hempstead Town, Aylesbury United and Aylesbury boss Mark Eaton in June 2015, Eaton was sacked at the end of October 2015 following a poor run of results, however a dispute between the departing manager and the club unfolded in the local paper. Following Leighton Town's relegation from the Southern League Division One Central in 2016, the club parted company with manager Stuart Murray. = Return to Spartan South Midlands League = Murray was replaced by former Ashford Town (Middlesex) manager Paul Burgess in June 2016, as the club prepared for their first season back in the Spartan South Midlands Football League Premier Division following their relegation. Burgess resigned in November and was replaced with Scott Reynolds as interim manager, with Adam Kirkup and Lee Halling being appointed as his assistants, and Sean Downey continuing in his role as general manager. In May 2018, after a 4th placed finish in the league, manager Scott Reynolds resigned before being appointed as Aylesbury manager shortly afterwards. On 16 May, former Hemel Hempstead Town manager Danny Nicholls was appointed as his successor. However, in October 2018, Nicholls resigned after just 12 league games due to a poor run of form, with Aylesbury manager Reynolds also resigning just two days later. Joe Sweeney and Paul Copson were appointed as joint managers to replace Nicholls shortly after.

Its art style is anime-inspired. It markets itself as having a highly philosophical plot combined with a traditional Japanese RPG turn-based battle system. Alpha Kimori is independently developed by Sherman Chin and Sherman3D. It was produced using the RPG Maker engine. Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Episode One is the first of the trilogy of Alpha Kimori Role Playing Games and is a mix between science fiction and fantasy. The game differentiates itself based on character development in the JRPG type linear storyline. Great Doubt is named after the underlying Great Doubt philosophy which is inspired by the Japanese Zen and Chinese Tao philosophies. The story is arguably a metaphor for current real-world events. It tells of two opposing forces of Yin and Yang. Both forces are dependent on each other and the good and evil sides are not clearly defined. The story is presented with simple 2D graphics. =Plot= Alpha Kimori's story takes place 50 years after the alien invasion of Earth. The newly discovered planet Kimori plays host to two warring human factions – the Bidarians, who want to reclaim Earth, and the Jinrians, who are contented with their new home. The Bidarians are equipped with Robotic Intelligent Cybernetic Armor (RICA) technology while the Jinrians have the ability to transmute into colossal indigenous creatures. Despite the technological background story, the core is about a young Bidarian warrior, Rick, who falls in love with Jinrian princess, Yuki. =Characters= *Rick Brightheart :Rick is a Bidarian warrior who is coming into age. As a Kimorian enhanced human, the Elders expect Rick to perform and he also faces tremendous pressure from his prominent parents in the Bidarian army. Rick is skilled but his childhood memories of a girl with wings, prompting him to swear off violence, continue to haunt him. (Rick holds the God Angel Ki Crystal.) *Vanessa Avery :Vanessa is a warrior of Bidari who is a loyal childhood friend to Rick. She is an extremely gifted student and her sense of pride has earned her the reputation of a diva. Nevertheless, she is willing to make sacrifices because of her affection for Rick. To her utter dismay, Rick seems oblivious to her advances and views her as his sister. (Vanessa holds the Metal Angel Ki Crystal.) *Yuki Furikai :Yuki is a princess from Jinri adopted by Lord Magnus. Her actual origin is a mystery and so are her angelic wings. Yuki is usually on the front lines, holding her own as a martial artist of the highest caliber. Yuki is often too idealistic and would not openly admit her feelings for Rick, preferring instead to blame him for her grievances. (Yuki holds the Arch Angel Ki Crystal) *Elder Evlar :Evlar is a human Elder of the Bidarian High Council. Unlike the rest of the Elders, Evlar is particularly fond of Kimorians and does not treat them as mere servants or fighting machines. He has a close relationship with Rick and knows more about Kimori's history than he is letting on. Ultimately, he has his own agenda and is not about to be manipulated by anyone. (In the 2nd episode, he connects the Wood Angel Ki Crystal to his belt.) *Daygan Whitaker :Daygan is a Bidarian warrior whose noble heart is often overshadowed by his self-created rivalry with Rick. In actual fact, he is envious of Vanessa's affection for Rick. Daygan appears to be a big bully but he is not very confident deep down inside. His demeanor is simply a facade in an attempt to grasp at some form of control over his environment. (Daygan holds the Fire Angel Ki Crystal.) (Following characters are introduced in the 2nd episode) *Emelyn Lee :Emelyn is the courageous but brash leader of Tana. She has a personal vendetta against the Bidarian Elders who tried to kill her in an attempt to harness her Ki Crystal. Her thirst for vengeance stops for no one except her beloved little brother, Ken. She has little need for words and is precise in her execution. (Emelyn holds the Water Angel Ki Crystal) *Ken Lee :Ken possesses intelligence and wisdom beyond his years. He always seeks mutually beneficial solutions. In times of need, he can be counted on to calm his sister and to determine the best course of action. Despite his mental prowess, Ken suffers from an emotional weakness for Miyu of whom he admires greatly. (Ken holds the Earth Angel Ki Crystal) *Miyu Myu :Miyu is a half feline mutant who is supposedly a failed combination of Kimorians and Jinrian transmutations. Being the Karyian leader's younger sister, she partakes in dangerous missions. Miyu is resourceful and makes the best of her situation. She might act cute and funny at times. =Theme song= The Alpha Kimori theme song features vocals from the Hatsune Miku software and was written and recorded by Japanese composer Yossy. =Game trailer= The Alpha Kimori trailer featured the theme song sung by Hatsune Miku and 3D models of the game characters. =History= *2011 Mar 24  Alpha Kimori Episode One was released as a one-week exclusive on Big Fish Games. *2011 Apr 7  Alpha Kimori Episode One was released on the official http://www.AlphaKimori.com website. *2011 May 31  In the first official review of Alpha Kimori, Gamezebo gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars noting that \\"Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt is an excellent, thought-provoking RPG.\\" *2011 Oct 26  Alpha Kimori was reviewed by RPGFan noting that \\"Sherman3D created a brightly futuristic world with a style all its own that stands out from the pack.\\" *2011 Oct 26  Alpha Kimori was featured in the AnimationXpress Asia Pacific news portal. *2011 Oct 31  Alpha Kimori and its creators, Sherman Chin and Tiffany Lim, were featured on the cover and center spread of the New Straits Times newspaper's Tech pullout. *2011 Nov 11  An Alpha Kimori Episode One 200-page Official Strategy Guide was created for fans and announced on Gamasutra. *2011 Nov 25  Spinoff games based on the Alpha Kimori intellectual property was announced on Gamasutra. *2012 May 17  Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Episode Two Exclusive Edition was released on Sherman3D's website on May 17, 2012. *2012 Jun 6  In the review of Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Episode Two, Gamezebo gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars noting that \\"Alpha Kimori Episode 2 is an excellent continuation of the series.\\" *2012 Jul 12  Sherman3D's co-founder, Tiffany Lim, was interviewed by Casual Connect Association for the Casual Connect magazine. *2012 Jul 17  In the review of Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Episode Two, RPGFan gave it a rating of 84% noting that it is \\"one of the more professional-looking and aesthetically polished RPG Maker games I've seen.\\" *2012 Aug 31 Alpha Kimori was put up on Valve's Steam (software) Greenlight and was featured on Tech in Asia and Gamezebo. *2012 Sep 9  Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Episode One Exclusive Edition was released on Sherman3D's website. *2012 Sep 11  In the review of Alpha Kimori Great Doubt Episode One, Operation Rainfall gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars noting that \\"Alpha Kimori is a great indie RPG that starts out simply enough, but provides surprising depth in its themes and story.\\" *2012 Sep 20  Alpha Kimori was showcased at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan on September 20 and 21, 2012 and was praised by the Japanese media as a tribute to classic Japanese role-playing games. *2012 Dec 12  Alpha Kimori Episode Two strategy guide was released. *2013 Mar 7  Alpha Kimori Episode Two was released as a one-week exclusive on Big Fish Games. *2013 May 21  Alpha Kimori JRPG and Philosophy lecture by Sherman Chin at Casual Connect Asia in Singapore at the Tower Ballroom of Shangri-la Hotel. *2014 March 17  Alpha Kimori launches on Valve's Steam after being Greenlit. *2014 April 1  Alpha Kimori launches on Big Fish Games Japan. *2014 May 12  Alpha Kimori with Sherman Chin GameRamble interview. *2014 June 17  Alpha Kimori sold over 29,000 copies in the Groupees Be Mine 13 Game and Charity Bundle sponsored by Machinima. *2014 December 25  Alpha Kimori sold 31,657 copies in the Humble Weekly Bundle: RPG Edition Book 1 Bundle.

A 13-year-old girl, Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the House of Capulet. She falls in love with the main protagonist Romeo, a member of the House of Montague, with which the Capulets have a blood-feud. The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself. Juliet by Philip H. Calderon (1888).  Juliet's age  One aspect of the story which now seems problematic is Juliet's age. As the story occurs, Juliet is approaching her fourteenth birthday. She was born on \\"Lammas Eve at night\\" (1 August), so Juliet's birthday is 31 July (1.3.19). Her birthday is \\"a fortnight hence\\", putting the action of the play in mid-July (1.3.17). Her father states that she \\"hath not seen the change of fourteen years\\" (1.2.9). In many cultures and time periods, women did and do marry and bear children at an early age. Romeo and Juliet is a play about Italian families. Lady Capulet had given birth to her first child by the time she had reached Juliet's age: \\"By my count, I was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid.\\" (1.3.74–75). Even Capulet tries to encourage Paris to wait a little longer before even thinking of marrying his daughter, feeling that she is still too young; \\"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride\\". However, in the English poem the story is based on (Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke)The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet, Arthur Brooke. Juliet is approaching her sixteenth birthday and Romeo is the same age whereas in the Bandello novella she is nearly eighteen with Romeo about twenty.Franson, J. Karl. 1996. \\"Too Soon Marr'd\\": Juliet's Age as Symbol in 'Romeo and Juliet.' Papers on Language & Literature, Vol. 32, No. 3 The common English people of that age were very rarely in their teens when they married and even among the nobility and gentry of the age, brides thirteen years of age were rare, at about one in one thousand brides; in that era, the vast majority of English brides were at least nineteen years of age when they first married, most commonly at about 23 years, and most English noblewomen were at least sixteen when they married. That the parts of young women were played by pre-adolescent boys in Shakespeare's day also cannot be overlooked and it is possible that Shakespeare had the physique of a young boy in mind during composition, in addition to the fact that Romeo and Juliet are of wealthy families and would be more likely to marry earlier than commoners.Laslett, Peter. 1965. The World We Have Lost. New York City: Charles Scribner's Sons. p 82-86 At the time, English noblewomen married on average at 19–21 years (compared to 24–26 years for English noblemen) while the average marriage age in England was 25–26 years for women and 27–28 for men;Young, Bruce W. 2008. Family Life in the Age of Shakespeare. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. p 41 Sir Thomas More wrote in his Utopia that, in Utopia, women must be at least eighteen years of age when they marry and men at least 22 years.Life in Elizabethan England: Weddings and BetrothalsUzgalis, William. 1997. Utopia, by Sir Thomas More. New York: Ideal Commonwealths. P.F. Collier & Son. The common belief in Elizabethan England was that motherhood before sixteen was dangerous; popular manuals of health, as well as observations of married life, led Elizabethans to believe that early marriage and its consummation permanently damaged a young woman's health, impaired a young man's physical and mental development, and produced sickly or stunted children. Therefore, eighteen came to be considered the earliest reasonable age for motherhood and twenty and thirty the ideal ages for women and men, respectively, to marry. Shakespeare might also have reduced Juliet's age from sixteen to thirteen to demonstrate the dangers of marriage at too young of an age; that Shakespeare himself married Anne Hathaway when he was just eighteen might hold some significance.  In today's Verona  = Casa di Giulietta = Love-letter wall, Verona. Love-locket wall beneath the balcony, Verona. Juliet's purported balcony, in Verona. Beneath it, on the walls, there are love-letters. The entrance wall known as Juliet's wall. In Verona, an early 14th-century house at Via Cappello no. 23, claiming to be the Capulets' has been turned into a tourist attraction but it is mostly empty. The real second name was in Italian Cappelletti, a noble family, and not Capuleti. Cappelletti were in the past members of the light cavalry of the Republic of Venice. They fought for it since the 13th century and they were originally from Dalmatia and Albania. It features the balcony, and in the small courtyard, a bronze statue of Juliet. It is one of the most visited sites in the town. The metal of its chest is worn bare due to a legend that if a person strokes the right breast of the statue, that person will have good fortune and luck in love. Many people write their names and the names of their beloved ones on the walls of the entrance, known as Juliet's wall. Many believe that writing on that place will make their love everlasting. After a restoration and cleaning of the building, it was intended that further writing should be on replaceable panels or white sheets placed outside the wall. It is also a tradition to put small love-letters on the walls (which is done by the thousands each year), which are regularly taken down by employees to keep the courtyard clean. Another tradition that occurs in Juliet's courtyard is writing your name and that of your loved one on a lock and attaching it to a large ornamental gate in the back left. The gate is overwhelmed with locks that hold hope for lasting love. This tradition is seen throughout Europe on bridges and gates all over cities. = Club di Giulietta = Since the 1930s, letters addressed to Juliet keep arriving in Verona. As of 2010, more than 5,000 letters were received annually, three-quarters of which were from women. The largest single group of senders was American teenagers. The letters are read and replied to by local volunteers, organised since the 1980s in the Club di Giulietta (Juliet Club), which is financed by the City of Verona. The club has been the subject of a book by Lise and Ceil Friedman and is the setting for a 2008 book by Suzanne Harper and a 2010 USA movie, Letters to Juliet.

The Congregation subsequently granted diocesan bishops an indult to authorize specified priests and groups of the faithful who requested it, celebration of the Tridentine Mass according to the 1962 Roman Missal promulgated by Pope John XXIII.Levada, William. Instruction on the application of the apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum, §5, Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, 30 April, 2011 The permitted Tridentine Masses were to be in full accord with the 1962 Missal and in Latin. This was not the first time that such an indult had been granted: after the promulgation of the Ordo Missae of 1970, Pope Paul VI issued a letter on 30 October 1971,Bugnini, A., Heenan Indult, 5 November 1971, published by Latin Mass Society, accessed 22 August 2020 the so-called Agatha Christie indult, which gave permission to a large segment of priests in the United Kingdom to retain the usage of the classical Roman Rite.Kwasniewski, Peter A., \\"Introibo Ad Altare Dei\\", Ignatius Press, May/June 2000 Content maniple in an old church in Szydłowiec An important condition for granting the requests was \\"that it be made publicly clear beyond all ambiguity that such priests and their respective faithful in no way share the positions of those who call in question the legitimacy and doctrinal exactitude of the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1970.\\"Mayer, Augustin. Indult for Use of Roman Missal of 1962 (a), Congregation for Divine Worship, 3 October 1984 Diocesan bishops refused many requests by people whom they considered not to have met this condition. But authorization was in fact granted either by diocesan bishops or directly by the Holy See to many priests, parishes and priestly societies, who could then use the older forms of the Roman Rite either exclusively or only on occasion. The priestly societies included the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney. These used the \\"Tridentine\\" liturgical books exclusively, not only for celebrating Mass but also for the other sacraments and rituals and for the Divine Office. Individual priests and communities belonging to religious institutes also received the same authorization. There were such cases among the Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer, the Institute of Saint Philip Neri, the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem, the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius, the monasteries of Sainte Madeleine du Barroux and Sainte Marie de la Garde. Various diocesan clergy also availed of the document's provision. See Communities using the Tridentine Mass for a list of priestly societies and religious institutes which celebrate the Tridentine Mass. The Pope further expanded upon this with the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei of 1988, in which he exhorted the bishops to be generous in granting such a faculty for all the faithful who requested it. Ecclesia Dei supersedes Quattuor abhinc annos regarding the extent of the privilege. Groups such as the Society of St. Pius X, who maintained that they needed no permission to celebrate the Tridentine Mass decried the document and referred rather derisively to Masses celebrated with the Quattuor abhinc annos authorization as \\"Indult Masses\\". Several of these groups, such as the Society of St. Pius V, preferred to celebrate Mass according to pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal. The view that use of the earlier form of the Roman liturgy had never been formally abrogatedDossier by N. Bux and S. Vitiello on the motu proprio of Benedict XVI Summorum Pontificum cura was authoritatively confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI, who declared that permission to use it (which can be granted by the priest in charge of the church) is required only for public celebration.Summorum Pontificum, articles 1, 2 and 5 Pope Benedict XVI revoked the directives on 7 July 2007, replacing them with the norms enunciated in his motu proprio Summorum Pontificum.Summorum Pontificum, article 1 References External links *Translation of the letter, L'Osservatore Romano (English edition), 22 October 1984 *Text of the circular letter in Latin Category:Tridentine Mass Category:Ecclesia Dei Category:Documents of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments Category:1984 documents Category:Pope John Paul II Category:Traditionalist Catholicism Category:Society of Saint Pius X Category:1984 in Christianity Category:Liturgical law ","title":"Quattuor abhinc annos"},{"id":"1900792","text":"Far East University is located in Gamgok-myeon, Eumseong County, North Chungcheong province, South Korea.

It is a malignant neoplasm and is one of the most treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate above 95% if discovered in early stages. Testicular seminoma originates in the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules. About half of germ cell tumors of the testicles are seminomas. Treatment usually requires removal of one testicle. However, fertility usually isn't affected. All other sexual functions will remain intact. Signs and symptoms The average age of diagnosis is between 35 and 50 years. This is about 5 to 10 years older than men with other germ cell tumors of the testes. In most cases, they produce masses that are readily felt on testicular self-examination; however, in up to 11 percent of cases, there may be no mass able to be felt, or there may be testicular atrophy. Testicular pain is reported in up to one fifth of cases. Low back pain may occur after metastasis to the retroperitoneum. Some cases of seminoma can present as a primary tumour outside the testis, most commonly in the mediastinum. In the ovary, the tumor is called a dysgerminoma, and in non- gonadal sites, particularly the central nervous system, it is called a germinoma. Diagnosis Ultrasound image of a seminoma Blood tests may detect the presence of placental alkaline phosphatase (ALP, ALKP, ALPase, Alk Phos) in fifty percent of cases. However, Alk Phos cannot usefully stand alone as a marker for seminoma and contributes little to follow-up, due to its rise with smoking.Nielsen et al, Eur J Cancer. 1990;26(10):1049-54 Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be elevated in some cases, but this correlates more to the presence of trophoblast cells within the tumour than to the stage of the tumour. A classical or pure seminoma by definition do not cause an elevated serum alpha fetoprotein . Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be the only marker that is elevated in some seminomas. The degree of elevation in the serum LDH has prognostic value in advanced seminoma. The cut surface of the tumour is fleshy and lobulated, and varies in colour from cream to tan to pink. The tumour tends to bulge from the cut surface, and small areas of hemorrhage may be seen. These areas of hemorrhage usually correspond to trophoblastic cell clusters within the tumour. Microscopic examination shows that seminomas are usually composed of either a sheet-like or lobular pattern of cells with a fibrous stromal network. The fibrous septa almost always contain focal lymphocyte inclusions, and granulomas are sometimes seen. The tumour cells themselves typically have abundant clear to pale pink cytoplasm containing abundant glycogen, which is demonstrable with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. The nuclei are prominent and usually contain one or two large nucleoli, and have prominent nuclear membranes. Foci of syncytiotrophoblastic cells may be present in varied amounts. The adjacent testicular tissue commonly shows intratubular germ cell neoplasia, and may also show variable spermatocytic maturation arrest. POU2AF1 and PROM1 have been proposed as possible markers.

Image:Testis showing seminoma.jpgOrchidectomy specimen showing seminoma =Relation to spermatocytic tumor= Spermatocytic tumors are not considered a subtype of seminoma and unlike other germ cell tumours do not arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia. Treatment Intratesticular masses that appear suspicious on an ultrasound should be treated with an inguinal orchiectomy. The pathology of the removed testicle and spermatic cord indicate the presence of the seminoma and assist in the staging. Tumors with both seminoma and nonseminoma elements or that occur with the presence of AFP should be treated as nonseminomas. Abdominal CT or MRI scans as well as chest imaging are done to detect for metastasis. The analysis of tumor markers also helps in staging. The preferred treatment for most forms of stage 1 seminoma is active surveillance. Stage 1 seminoma is characterized by the absence of clinical evidence of metastasis. Active surveillance consists of periodic history and physical examinations, tumor marker analysis, and radiographic imaging. Around 85-95% of these cases will require no further treatment. Modern radiotherapy techniques as well as one or two cycles of single-agent carboplatin have been shown to reduce the risk of relapse, but carry the potential of causing delayed side effects. Regardless of treatment strategy, stage 1 seminoma has nearly a 100% cure rate. Stage 2 seminoma is indicated by the presence of retroperitoneal metastasis. Cases require radiotherapy or, in advanced cases, combination chemotherapy. Large residual masses found after chemotherapy may require surgical resection. Second-line treatment is the same as for nonseminomas. Stage 3 seminoma is characterized by the presence of metastasis outside the retroperitoneum—the lungs in \\"good risk\\" cases or elsewhere in \\"intermediate risk\\" cases. This is treated with combination chemotherapy. Second-line treatment follows nonseminoma protocols.

Its functions were originally exercised by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, set up in January 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. Current Superiors * Prefect: Cardinal Robert Sarah * Secretary: Archbishop Arthur Roche * Undersecretary: Rev. Corrado Maggioni History The congregation is the direct successor of the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments (Sacra Congregatio de Disciplina Sacramentorum) (1908–1969). In 1975 it was given the title \\"Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship\\" (Congregatio de Sacramentis et Cultu Divino) and incorporated the functions of the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship (Sacra Congregatio pro Cultu Divino) which had been created in 1969 to take on responsibility for the liturgical affairs previously handled by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (Sacra Rituum Congregatio) (1588–1969). Between 1984 and 1988 it was briefly redivided into the Congregation for the Sacraments (Congregatio de Sacramentis) and the Congregation for Divine Worship (Congregatio de Cultu Divino) under a single Prefect. Responsibilities The apostolic constitution Pastor bonus, issued by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988, established the congregation's functions: * Regulation and promotion of the liturgy, primarily of the sacraments * Regulation of the administration of the sacraments, especially regarding their valid and licit celebration * Promoting liturgical pastoral activity, especially regarding the celebration of the Eucharist * Drawing up and revision of liturgical texts * Reviewing particular calendars and proper texts for the Mass and the Divine Office * Granting the to translations of liturgical books and their adaptations * Promoting the liturgical apostolate or sacred music, song or art * Ensuring that liturgical norms are accurately observed, and that abuses are avoided and eliminated where they are found to exist. * Examining the fact of non-consummation in a marriage and the existence of a just cause for granting a dispensation. * Examining cases concerning the nullity of ordination. * Regulating the cult of relics, the confirmation of heavenly patrons in diocese or locality * The authorisation of Canonical Coronations for venerated Catholic images * The elevation of sanctuaries to the title of Minor Basilica. * Giving assistance to bishops so that the prayers and pious exercises of the Christian people may be fostered and held in high esteem On 30 August 2011, Pope Benedict XVI transferred jurisdiction over unconsummated marriages and the nullification of ordinations to the Roman Rota to relieve the Congregation of administrative burdens and allow it to focus on liturgy, its principal responsibility. In 2012, the Congregation added an office devoted to liturgical architecture and music. On 9 September 2017, Pope Francis weakened the congregation's authority with his motu proprio titled Magnum principium, ensuring that, starting 1 October 2017,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/09/world/europe/pope-francis-liturgical- reform.html?mcubz=3 the nation's Conference of Bishops will manage local liturgical translations.https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2017/09/09/170909a.html Since 2001, the Congregation had greater authority over a nation's liturgical translations. On October 22, 2017, the Vatican released a letter that Pope Francis had sent to the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacrament, Cardinal Robert Sarah, clarifying that the Vatican and its departments would have limited authority to confirm liturgical translations recognized by a local Conference of Bishops,http://www.thecatholictelegraph.com/in-letter-to-cardinal-sarah-pope- clarifies-new-translation-norms/45928 thus retracting a commentary which Sarah had published on 13 October 2017.http://www.ncregister.com/daily- news/cardinal-sarah-confirms-vatican-retains-last-word-on-translations  Cardinal Prefects  * Domenico Ferrata (1908–1914) * Filippo Giustini (1914–1920) * Michele Lega (1920–1935) * Domenico Jorio (1935–1954) * Benedetto Aloisi Masella (1954–1968) * Francesco Carpino (7 April 1967 – 26 June 1967) * Francis James Brennan (1968) * Antonio Samorè (prefect, Divine Worship, 1968–1969; prefect, Discipline of the Sacraments, 1968–1974) * Benno Walter Gut (1969–1970) * Arturo Tabera (1971–1973) * James Knox (1974–1981) * Giuseppe Casoria, (pro-prefect 1981–1983, prefect 1983–1984) * Paul Mayer (pro-prefect 1984–1985, prefect 1985–1988) * Eduardo Martínez Somalo (1988–1992) * Antonio María Javierre Ortas (1992–1996) * Jorge Arturo Medina Estévez (pro-prefect 1996–1998, prefect 1998–2002) * Francis Arinze (2002–2008) * Antonio Cañizares Llovera (2008–2014) * Robert Sarah (2014–)  Secretary  *Annibale Bugnini, C.M.

They play at Wright's Meadow on Leighton Road, in the Parish of Stanbridge. In 2020-21 the 1st XV will play in London 1 North - a league at the 6th tier of the English rugby union system - following their promotion from Midlands 2 East (South) at the end of 2019-20. History =Early years= The club was founded in 1934 with the enthusiastic support of the town's Cedars Grammar School with which it has always maintained a close support. The club flourished during those early years, playing its home matches at the Cricket Club's Bell Close headquarters, but like many others, was disbanded with the outbreak of World War II. Many of the founder members did not return from the hostilities and probably in consequence the club was not reformed until mid-way through season 1948–49. Several successful seasons followed, with the club supported by local schools and locally based service personnel, but fell into decline and was disbanded at the end of the 1955–56 season. Rugby during this immediate post-war period was played at the Capshill Meadow on the Hockliffe Road which is just big enough for one pitch. The club of today arguably owes its existence to the enthusiasm of a 19-year-old Howard Ansdell who initiated the reforming of the club in time for the 1958–59 season and to local businessman Geoff Wright who steered the club into erecting its first clubhouse in 1962, and in 1965 to the purchase of the Capshill Meadow ground. Proceeds from the sale of the ground in 1973 established the splendid facilities we now enjoy. The move to Stanbridge Road occurred at a time when the Town was expanding and with many new players available to the club, was able to attract much stronger fixtures for its Senior XV. The transformation of Cedars Grammar to a comprehensive did not stop the flow of good rugby players to the club as rugby remained the primary winter sport at the school. Thanks to Cedars, Leighton was always able to punch above its weight for a club from a relatively small town. Each of the club's six sides would always have a good representation of Old Cedarians. =The slow build (1960s and 1970s)= Admirably fed by a regular intake of players from particularly the Cedars but also the Vandyke Schools, Buzzards grew in stature so that by the 1970s they had a strong fixture list and almost always finished a season with more wins than losses. During this time the club built a strong bond with the club from Leighton Buzzard's French twin town Coulommiers in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Ile de France region. On one memorable occasion the club also stepped in to host top Romanian club CSA Steaua București when bad weather had forced the cancellation of one of their tour matches. At that time Romanian rugby was a force to be reckoned with and if not close to acceptance into the then Five Nations Championship, then they ought to have been as they would score reasonably regular victories over France, Wales and Scotland. =Years of success (1980–1995)= The club's golden period could be traced from the early-mid 80s to mid 90s. Prior to the RFU's implementation of a national league structure, the only measure of success for junior clubs like Leighton were the cup competitions of the RFU constituent county bodies. Winning the County Cup enabled a club to gain entry to the following season's National Knockout Cup and the chance to have a tilt at one of the big clubs. In Leighton Buzzard's case this came in the shape of the East Midlands Cup for clubs based in Bedfordshire and Northants. In 1985–86, Paul Whiting became the first Buzzards skipper to lift the Cup when Peterborough were beaten in the final. The draw for the following season's National Cup, then called the John Player Cup, saw them paired with Birmingham, at the time a club on the cusp of first class status who were later to become Birmingham & Solihull R.F.C.. Led by David Yirrell, Buzzards produced the upset of the round winning 20–11. Buzzards fell at the next hurdle to Lichfield but with confidence brimming the season culminated with the retention of the East Midlands Cup when Northampton Trinity were beaten at Franklin's Gardens. The following season, 1987–88 the inaugural season of league rugby, saw Buzzards placed in Midlands Division 2 (East). They also made their second appearance in the John Player Cup as a result of their County Cup win. Again they conquered higher ranked opposition in the first round when Derby, then of National Division 4 (North), were beaten 10–7 in a close encounter at Stanbridge Road (the name Wright's Meadow was still to be coined). The second round draw paired them with first class opposition in the form of nearby Bedford Blues, again at home. Led by John Orwin who was to captain England later that season, and also including former and future Buzzard stalwarts in Pete Ellam and John Davidson, Bedford had to work hard to subdue a spirited Buzzards effort. Buzzards conceded just one try in a 24–6 defeat in front of probably the largest crowd to assemble at the ground. Later that season their attempt to land a hat-trick of East Midlands Cup wins was dashed at the last when they fell to Stockwood Park in the final. A fifth place in their first league campaign was a disappointing return for a season that had started with such promise. However this disappointment was tempered slightly by the RFU's decision to expand the entry to the following season's National Cup, now to be called the Pilkington Cup, meaning that Leighton would be included as East Midlands Cup Runners-Up. In 1988–89 with John Fraser now installed as skipper, the second season of league rugby was a successful one as they finished as champions of Midlands 2 (East) to bring about what became a five-season stay in Midlands Division 1 (now named National League 3 Midlands). At the time this was the fifth tier of the National League structure. Their National Cup heroics didn't quite reach their previous heights as they made an 18–12 first round exit to Hereford. In 1993–94 the club suffered their first relegation dropping back into what was now Midlands Division 2 (the East/West split having been discarded for 1994–95). In terms of silverware the Club now embarked on probably its most successful season. Under the captaincy of Ian Smith, the league title was secured with a win in the last-day winner-takes-all clash against Broadstreet at Wright's Meadow. Not only was there the league success but the Bedfordshire Cup was regained and the East Midlands Cup won for a third time with local rivals Stockwood Park vanquished in both finals. =60th anniversary and beyond= There followed the club's 60th anniversary season which began with celebration matches against Aylesbury, who had been the club's first opponents in 1934, and a London Wasps XV. The East Midlands Cup win of the previous April had also given them another Pilkington Cup excursion. Again they were paired with Birmingham & Solihull. Though this time they had home advantage, history was not to be repeated and their campaign faltered at the first hurdle as they went down 29–11. By now, with the league system having taken deep root very quickly, a club's position within the league structure was now seen as all important with the Pilkington Cup now seen as a diversion, albeit a pleasant one with some kudos if early rounds could be successfully negotiated. Buzzards achieved their primary aim in their first season back in Midlands 1 by consolidating its place with a 10th-place finish in the 13-team table. The club's most successful league campaign came in the 1997–98 when Carl Siddon led them to a mid-table finish in Midlands Division 1. The following season, however, saw a sharp decline in playing strength and performance and inevitably relegation followed. The club has not been at Level 5 since. Today, the club fields four senior adult senior sides, in addition to this the club also field; Veterans (over 35's), a Colts XV and since 1995 a Ladies XV. The club relies heavily on developing players from within its own ranks and is very proud of its long-established Mini/Junior section which currently boasts a membership of approximately 200 children aged between 5 and 17 years. Never having had a large benefactor may have meant that Buzzard's league position has slipped, but it has meant that the club still belongs to the town and the members and retains the \\"club feel\\". The 1st XV starting line up and subs for the side's last home League match of the successful 2013–14 season contained 11 players whose fathers had also played for the club. Signs that their star might be in the ascendent once more came in 2006–07 when the Colts XV swept the board winning the East Midlands League and Cup competitions along with the Bedfordshire Cup. The side was captained by Ryan Fraser emulating his father John in lifting silverware in the name of LBRFC. It is hoped that a majority of those Colts players will filter into the senior setup and possibly bring on another era similar to that of the late '80s and early '90s. Back then however, rugby union was an amateur game. Buzzards only had to contend with Northampton Saints and Bedford to keep their players. Now in the \\"open era\\", the pendulum of playing strength and more tellingly, financial muscle, has swung so that Luton and Ampthill for long the subordinates, are now also potential predators. Still, from those humble beginnings in 1934 LBRFC now provides a sporting centre with which the town has every right to be proud. However, as an organisation, fully aware that standing still is not an option, the club's committee are actively looking at ways of improving the facilities for the playing of sport and enjoyment of associated social activities.

'Matthew Barnett-Vincent joined the club as a 16-year-old England age group international Hooker and made several appearances for the 1st XV splitting his time with Bedford Blues who he made his 1st team debut for aged 17 years on Boxing day 1992. Matthew played age group international (up to U21) and club rugby with Bedford for the next few seasons and was highly thought of, forging an impressive international front row partnership with future England captain Phil Vickery and Phil Greening (playing at prop)the game at this time was still amateur and despite having an offer to join Harlequins Matthew became increasingly disillusioned with the sport, after suffering several injuries he quit playing to concentrate on building a career in his Fathers engineering company. Several years later Matthew became a semi professional motorcycle racer competing in National Superstock aboard a Yamaha R1, enjoying some success at National level he was signed to Global Motorport Marketing, bad luck and poor finances plagued the team and he rode his last race, which he won at Snetterton, Norfolk in 2003.He returned to the game and played the 2007/8 season with Pataya Panthers in Thailand alongside several ex international Australian and Kiwi players, on his return to the UK Matthew once again returned to Leighton Buzzard and on his retirement had represented the club a total of 43 times. Matthew now runs CHS Electrical Services in Leighton Buzzard and is involved in coaching junior players at Buckingham RUFC. Stuart Maxwell joined following a stint with Bedford having played previously for New Brighton and Richmond. Brother of Andy, who won 7 England caps between 1975 and 1978, Stuart notched up some notable achievements of his own. In 1972 he scored two tries for the North-West Counties in their historic 16–14 win over New Zealand at Workington, the first time an English regional side had beaten the All Blacks. In 1975 having moved on to Bedford, he bagged another touchdown against international opposition when representing the Southern Counties in their match against Australia during the latter's 1975−76 UK tour. He was also an accomplished Sevens exponent having been a member of the Richmond side that won the Middlesex Sevens in 1974 and 1975. John Surguy joined the club having completed two spells at Northampton Saints. He continued his prolific points scoring habit displayed at Franklins Gardens and previously at junior level for nearby Bletchley. Through his time at each club, Surguy had lived in Leighton and his town club was grateful he eventually made his way there. He featured prominently in the East Midlands Cup wins of 1986 and 1987. He also represented East Midlands in the Mobbs Memorial Match against the Barbarians whilst at Northampton. Chris Gibbons, though never leaving the Leighton Buzzard club did score the achievement of representing East Midlands on more than one occasion in the annual Mobbs Memorial Match against the Barbarians. At the time it was extremely rare for a player outwith Northampton Saints and Bedford Blues to be invited into the East Midlands side for the match, especially if that player was plying his trade at a junior club. Gibbons was one of the very few to buck the trend. Pete Ellam spent a number of seasons at Bedford and was a regular during the latter's Centenary Season of 1985–86. He returned to Buzzards and was 1st XV captain for 1991–92 season. John Davidson arrived from Bedford in 1988−89 for the season following the Buzzards v. Bedford John Player Cup clash. An England 'B' cap, Davidson had been a stalwart with Moseley for whom he played in the 1982 John Player Cup Final at Twickenham when they shared the trophy with Gloucester following a 12–12 draw after extra time. When it comes to international representation the club can point to recent 1st XV skipper Bert Yirrell who when a member of the club's Junior section represented England at Under-16 level. Neil Wise is the club's only player to win senior international recognition. Having moved to the Grand Duchy with work in the late-'90s, Wise represented the Luxembourg national side on a number of occasions including Rugby World Cup qualifiers. Henry Peck was selected for England Schools whilst at the club. He now plays for Cambridge in National Division 1, the third tier of the RFU league structure George Messum represented England Students whilst studying at Loughborough University. He also played for Northampton Saints and Bedford before winning a Blue for Oxford University in the 2014 Varsity Match when the Dark Blues scored their record win (43−6) and in doing so notched a fifth consecutive win for the first time in the fixture. He was elected OURFC captain for the 2015−16 season but was prevented from taking part in Oxford's record sixth consecutive Varsity Match victory owing to new eligibility rules surrounding degree courses. He returned to win another Blue in the 2019 match. He currently plays for Old Elthamians in National Division 1, tier 3 of the League setup.

It was developed by the AM2 division of Sega for the Sega Naomi Multiboard arcade system board under the direction of Yu Suzuki, and was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 video game consoles under the names F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa and Ferrari F355 Challenge respectively for both American and European releases. The only model of car featured in the game is the Ferrari F355 Challenge model. The game was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 possible up until that time. Some versions of the arcade cabinet are noteworthy for having three screens, allowing the player to look through the side windows as they would in a real car. The three-screen cabinet version also features an H-shaped gear stick and three foot pedals, and presents a tough challenge to any player who decides to use them. The cabinet itself is composed of four NAOMI units: one for each of the three screens and one to sync them all. The game also allows the player to use an automatic transmission or paddle-shift the gears. It also uses a real-time \\"Magic Weather\\" system similar to Shenmue.https://web.archive.org/web/20101123004347/http://gameindustry.com/review/item.asp?id=418 The Dreamcast version has link cable play for direct competition; however, as of January 2006, the online servers for F355 Challenge are now offline, and the website has gone offline. The game features an original soundtrack featuring Genki Hitomi and Minoru Niihara that mimics the style of 1980s hard rock/heavy metal which is integrated into a radio station format during gameplay (some music was later reused for another AM2 game, Shenmue). The radio DJ and the announcer are played by Alan J (Alan John Peppler), an American DJ who works at the Japanese radio station Bay FM. Yu Suzuki is a keen Ferrari enthusiast who allegedly used data from his own Ferrari 355 at certain tracks to implement in the game during its development. Circuits Sega F355 Challenge three screen arcade unit The 1999 arcade version of the game includes six circuits: * Motegi (Oval Circuit) * Suzuka (Short Configuration) * Monza (1998 configuration) * Sugo * Suzuka (Full Configuration) * Long Beach In addition, the home console versions of the game include five extra unlockable circuits: * Atlanta * Nürburgring * Laguna Seca * Sepang * Fiorano (real life track used by Ferrari to test their cars) All these circuits can be unlocked by either finishing in certain positions in a certain race or championship, driving over a certain cumulative distance in the game, or by entering a password in a revealable password entry screen. These tracks were also included in the F355 Challenge 2: International Course Edition arcade machine, released in 2001. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed F355 Challenge on their January 1, 2000 issue as being the seventh most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. John Gaudiosi reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"F355 offers plenty of eye candy and deep gameplay for dedicated, hardcore Ferrari aficionados.\\" The Dreamcast version received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

He is the fifth Bishop of Honolulu, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI on May 17, 2005, to oversee the Diocese of Honolulu. Previous to his appointment to the epicopacy, he served as a diocesan priest and later vicar general of the Diocese of Oakland in California. He is the first person born in Hawaii to lead the Roman Catholic community of the Hawaiian Islands. He is also the second person of Portuguese ancestry to serve the community as its ordinary. As Bishop of Honolulu, Silva has his liturgical and canonical seat or cathedra at the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace; he also has a cathedra at the Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus in Kapālama. At both of the above cathedral churches, rectors and parochial vicars administer the daily liturgical and pastoral work. The bishop's administrative offices are located in the Bishop Street chancery. Education Silva was born on the island of O'ahu to electrician and refrigeration mechanic Richard Silva and homemaker Catherine Alves Silva at Saint Francis Hospital in Liliha. The great grandson of immigrants from the Azores, Silva was baptized at Saint Anthony Church in Kailua but moved to California during his first year of life. He attended Saint John the Baptist School in San Lorenzo and together with Frank De Lima at Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland. Convinced of a calling to Holy Orders, Silva spent his undergraduate years at Saint Joseph College Seminary in Mountain View where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree and Saint Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park where he later obtained a Master of Divinity degree. Silva studied the Spanish language in Cuernavaca, Mexico in 1975 and 1978. During his first sabbatical leave, he studied at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, Italy in 1991. California apostolate After completing theological studies, Silva was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Oakland on May 2, 1975 by Floyd Lawrence Begin, Bishop of Oakland. Silva served as associate pastor and pastor at nine parish churches throughout the Diocese of Oakland: Saint Bernard Church from 1975 to 1978, Our Lady of the Rosary Church from 1978 to 1979, Saint Bede Church in Hayward from 1983 to 1984, Saint Peter Martyr Church in Pittsburg from 1984 to 1986 and Saint Anthony Church in Oakland from 1986 to 1991. After taking sabbatical leave from January to August 1991, he returned to his home diocese to serve at Saint John the Baptist Church in El Cerrito from 1991 to 1994, Saint Andrew and Saint Joseph Church in Oakland from 1994 to 1999 and Saint Leonard and Saint Paula in Fremont from 2000 to 2003. Employing parish clustering, he served as pastor of two parishes at a time. He oversaw the merger of two parishes into one several times. Silva served under various leadership positions in the Diocese of Oakland. While associate pastor and pastor of various parish churches, Silva also served as diocesan vocations director from 1979 to 1983. He recruited religious brothers and priests for the Diocese of Oakland. In 2003, Allen Henry Vigneron, Bishop of Oakland, appointed Silva his vicar general and moderator of the diocesan curia. As vicar general and moderator of the diocesan curia, Silva was instrumental in the planning for the construction of the Cathedral of Christ the Light, the replacement of the Cathedral of Saint Francis de Sales destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17, 1989. Episcopacy =Bishop of Honolulu= Silva's consecration as bishop and installation as prelate over the Hawaiian Islands occurred on July 21, 2005 at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center Arena. It was the first joint consecration and installation ceremony in Hawaii; former bishops had already been consecrated on the mainland prior to their installation. It was also the first such ceremony held at the Neal S. Blaisdell Center since 1982. Silva was consecrated by William Joseph Levada, principal consecrator, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and Archbishop of the metropolitan archdiocese of San Francisco to which the Diocese of Honolulu is suffragan. The co-consecrators were Allen Henry Vigneron, Oakland ordinary, and his predecessor, John Stephen Cummins, Bishop Emeritus of Oakland. Several other bishops were in attendance: Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo Higuera, the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States; Msgr. Anthony Apuron, Archbishop of Hagatna in Guam; Msgr. Tod Brown, Bishop of Orange; Msgr. Daniel F. Walsh, Bishop of Santa Rosa in California; Msgr. Tomas Camacho, Bishop of Chalan Kanoa (Saipan); Msgr. Quinn Weitzel, Bishop of Pago Pago, American Samoa; Msgr. Wilfredo D. Manpalaz, Bishop of Tagum, Philippines; Msgr. Juan De Dios Pueblo, Bishop of Butuan, Philippines; Msgr. William Skurla, Eparch of the Eparchy of Van Nuys in Phoenix, Arizona; Msgr. John C. Wester, Auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco; Msgr. George Thomas, Bishop of Helena; Msgr. Joseph Estabrook of the Military Ordinariate of the United States; Msgr. Richard Garcia, Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento; Msgr. Patricio Alo, Bishop of Mati in the Philippines; and Msgr. Stephen E. Blaire, Bishop of Stockton. Roger Cardinal Mahony, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles was expected to attend the event, but was unable to attend due to airplane problems in Los Angeles. The Episcopal coat-of-arms for Bishop Silva was designed by Father Quang Dong and Thanh Dong of the Diocese of Oakland. Silva means \\"forest\\" in Portuguese. The sinister impalement contains three trees in the \\"forest\\"; the kukui (Aleurites mollucana) on the right, symbolizing Hawai'i, the birthplace of the bishop, his parents and grandparents. The kukui yields an oil with healing properties that also provides light; the oak (Quercus alba) on the left, symbolizing Oakland (Quercopolitana) where Bishop Silva grew up and where he served as a priest for 30 years; and the cross - the tree of life - in the center, with olive leaves symbolizing Malia O Ka Malu (Mary, Queen of Peace), patroness of the Diocese of Honolulu (Honolulu is translated from Hawaiian as \\"peaceful harbor\\") under whose protection Bishop Silva entrusts his episcopal ministry. Bishop Silva's episcopal motto, \\"Witness to Jesus\\" derives from Revelation 19:10. In April 2020, Bishop Silva announced during a Sunday mass that the Diocese of Honolulu was paying millions to settle prior sex abuse cases.https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2020/04/25/about-victims-come-forward- with-new-claims-sex-abuse/ Silva also acknowledged that the Diocese was still facing a large of number of sex abuse lawsuits as well. Hawai'i ministry Silva assumes the episcopacy as successor to Francis Xavier DiLorenzo, fourth Bishop of Honolulu. He was the first Bishop of Honolulu to have originally come from Hawaii. DiLorenzo dealt with priests accused of abusing minors. Issues facing Silva upon assuming the episcopacy include the decline of vocations and consequent difficulties in staffing parishes, and sex abuse scandals. He was a principal promoter for the causes of sainthood for St. Damien of Moloka'i and Blessed Marianne of Moloka'i. One of his first acts as bishop-elect was to travel on pilgrimage to Kalaupapa on the island of Moloka'i on May 19, to pay homage to then-Blessed Damien and then-Blessed Marianne. Marianne had only been beatified and raised to the title of Blessed by Pope Benedict XVI a few days earlier on May 14. Speaking of his pilgrimage Silva said, \\"I will let that empower me in my ministry to the people of Hawai'i. Damien has been my hero since I was a boy.\\" Silva's great grandfather was a patient of the leper colony. After the 2009 Canonisation of Father Damien and the 2012 Canonisation of Mother Marianne, Bishop Silva had the unique distinction of being the only Bishop in American history who had two people from his diocese canonised during his episcopate. (Although the Archdiocese of Philadelphia also has two canonised members, they were during the episcopates of two different archbishops.) Msgr. Silva was inducted into the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 2005 and holds the rank of Grand Officer. He is also a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In June 2013, a special ceremony was held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, inducting him into the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, where he holds the rank of Knight Companion. He had especially been cited for having \\"gained the respect and admiration of the High Chiefs, Chief, Officers, Mamo Hawaii and Na Wahine Hui o Kamehameha I for his ecumenical spirit of aloha, kindness sensitivity to our island ways and for his love of the Hawaiian culture and all the cultures for people from around the world who call Hawaii home.\\" Msgr. Silva first ordination was Brother Johnathan Hurrell, SS.CC., to the priesthood on November 25, 2005, at Saint Patrick Church in Kaimuki, Honolulu.

Etymology  Nazilli is a Turkish name that has somehow evolved from the former (also Turkish) name of Pazarköy (market place). According to legend, the son of Aydın's governor in the Ottoman period, fell in love with a young woman from Pazarköy but was rejected by the girl's father. The young man later named the town Nazlı Ili (Nazlı's Home) after his loved one. The 17th century traveller Evliya Çelebi held that the town was named for the capriciousness (\\"naz\\") of the local women in this wealthy town. Or it could have been the name of a family of Oghuz Turks that settled here. Nazilli was still called Nazli by the British as of 1920.  History  These people practiced weaving and thus planted cotton in the area for this purpose. The Oghuz Turks were succeeded by the Anatolian beyliks of Menteşe (in 1280) and then Aydinids. In 1390 Bayezid I brought the area into the Ottoman Empire. At this time the town comprised two villages, Cuma Yeri (Friday Square) and Pazarköy (Weekday Market). The town was only later referred to as Nazliköy. In 1402 Tamerlane defeated Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara and took control of the Aegean region, giving the Nazilli area back to the Aydinid family. it was quickly recovered for the Ottomans by Sultan Murat II. During the Turkish War of Independence Nazilli was occupied by Greek forces and came under Turkish control in September 5, 1922.  Geography  Nazilli stands on the Menderes River and much of the district is in the Menderes valley, full of citrus trees, olives and figs as well as cotton, wheat and other crops. Economy Historically Nazilli was a producer of lignite. As of 1914, they were producing large quantities which was managed by a company from the United States. The lignite, in 1920, was described as being \\"deplorably bad,\\" despite demand for it to be exported to Smyrna. Just north of Nazilli, in 1920, were reported emery mines, too. Contemporary Nazilli Nazilli today has a population of 156,748 (according to the 2018 census). The Basmane-Nazilli Regional railway service runs between İzmir and Nazilli.

It is used for picnics, camping, hiking, and other outdoor recreation. It is known for the bluebell flowers that bloom there every spring. It is located in the Driftless Area of Minnesota. This is an area that escaped glaciation during the last ice age, i.e. the Wisconsinian glaciation. Geology Beginning 450 million years ago, a shallow sea covered much of North America, including what is now southeastern Minnesota. Layers of sediment, hundreds of feet thick, were deposited on the sea bed and became cemented together to form the limestone bedrock. Although this area was not covered by the last glaciers, the effect of that period on the landscape is striking. Glacial action caused the formation of huge amounts of powdered rock and fine particles from its constant grinding. These fine particles, blown by the wind after the retreat of the glacier, were deposited over southeastern Minnesota in a thick blanket of soil known as loess. The surrounding rich farmland is a testament to the benefits of this soil type. Wildlife The park's hardwood forest and adjacent agricultural land is home to mammalian species of white-tailed deer, two species of fox, beavers, and coyotes. Birds that inhabit here are pileated woodpeckers, great horned owls, and many migratory songbirds. Cultural history Dakota Native Americans once hunted, farmed and gathered wild food in and around the Whitewater River Valley. They gave the Whitewater River its name because the river turned a murky white color in the spring as high water eroded the light colored clay of the valley floor. In 1851, the United States government and the Dakota tribe signed a treaty that opened most of southern Minnesota for European settlers. The nearest settlement to the park, Plainview, was named for the large, upland fields of prairie grass that surrounded the river valley. The land for the park was donated to the State of Minnesota in 1948 by State Senator James A. Carley and the Ernestina Bolt family in hopes of preserving an outstanding grove of native white pines. In 1957, a severe hailstorm ravaged the trees. The stand of white pines towers in the steep, rugged valley of the Whitewater River, opposite the picnic area, and can be seen from the trail observation platform.

As autacoids similar to hormones acting on local tissues, resolvins are under preliminary research for their involvement in promoting restoration of normal cellular function following the inflammation that occurs after tissue injury. Resolvins belong to a class of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites termed specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). Biochemistry and production Resolvins (Rvs) fall into several sub-classes based on the straight chain PUFA from which they are formed and/or a unique aspect of their structure. The Resolvin Ds (RvDs) are metabolites of the 22-carbon PUFA, DHA (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoic acid); the resolvin Es (RvEs) are metabolites of the 20-carbon PUFA, EPA (i.e. 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid); the resolvin Dn-6DPA (RvDsn-6DPA) are metabolites of the DPA isomer, osbond acid (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosapentaenoic acid); the resolvin Dn-3DPA (RvDn-3DPA) are metabolites of the DPA isomer, clupanodonic acid (i.e. 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosapentaenoic acid); and the resolvin Ts (RvTs) are metabolites of clupanodonic acid that, in contrast to (RvDsn-3DPA (all of which possess a 17S-hydroxyl residue), possess a 17R-hydroxyl residue. Certain isomers of RvDs are termed aspirin-triggered resolvin Ds (AT-RvDs) because their synthesis is initiated by a drug-modified COX2 enzyme to form 17(R)-hydroxyl rather than 17(S)-hydroxyl residue of the ReVEs; however, an as yet unidentified cytochrome P450 enzyme(s) may also forms this 17(R)-hydroxy intermediate and thereby contribute to the production of AT-RvEs. All of the cited resolvins except the RvDsn-6DPAs are metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids. The following oxygenase enzymes may be responsible for metabolizing PUFA to resolvins: 15-lipoxygenase-1 (i.e. ALOX15), possibly 15-lipoxygenase-2 (i.e. ALOX15B), 5-lipoxygenase (i.e. ALOX5), cyclooxygenase-2 (i.e. COX-2), and certain Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. = Resolvin Ds = RvDs are poly- hydroxyl metabolites of DHA. To date, six RvDs, which vary in the number, position, and chirality of their hydroxyl residues as well as the position and cis-trans isomerism of their 6 double bonds, have been described. These are: RvD1 (7S,8R,17S-trihydroxy-DHA), RvD2 (7S,16R,17S-trihydroxy-DHA), RvD3 (4S,7R,17S-trihydroxy-DHA), RvD4 (4S,5,17S-trihydroxy-DHA; chirality at position 5 not yet determined), RvD5 (7S,17S-dihydroxy-DHA), and RvD6 (4S,17S-dihydroxy-DHA). (The structures of these RvDs are further defined at Specialized proresolving mediators#DHA-derived Resolvins). These metabolites are formed by a wide range of cells and tissues by the initial metabolism of DHA to 7S-hydroperoxy-DHA and 4S-hydroperoxy-DHA by a 15-lipoxygenase (either ALOX15 or possibly ALOX15B) followed by the further metabolism of the two intermediates by ALOX5 to their 17-hydroperoxy derivatives; these di- hydroperoxy products are further altered to the cited RvDs by these oxygenases or by non-enzymatic reactions and the conversion of their peroxy residues ubiquitous cellular peroxidases. = Resolvin Es = RvEs are di- or tri- hydroxyl metabolites of EPA. To date, four RvEs have been described: RvE1 (5S,12R,18R-trihydroxy-EPA), 18S-Rv1 (5S,12R,18S-trihydroxy-EPA), RvE2 (5S,18R-dihydroxy-EPA), and RvE3 (17R,18R/S-dihydroxy-EPA). (Structures of the RvEs are further defined at Specialized proresolving mediators#EPA-derived Resolvins.) Resolvin Es are formed in manner similar to AT resolving Ts. COX-2 modified in activity by aspirin or atorvastatin or, alternatively, a microbial or possibly mammalian cytochrome P450 monoxygenase metabolizes EPA to its 18R-hydroperoxy derivative; this intermediate is then further metabolized by ALOX5 to a 5,6 epoxide which is hydrolyzed enzymatically or non-enzymatically to RvE1 and 18S-RvE1 or reduced to RvE2; alternatively the 18R-hydroperoxide is converted to the 17R,18S vicinal diol product, RvE3. = T series resolvins = Human platelets pretreated with aspirin or atorvastatin metabolize the omega-3 DPA, clupanodonic acid (DPAn-3) by aspirin-treated or atorvastatin- treated COX2 to a 13S-hydroperoxy intermediate (aspirin and atorvastatin change the activity of COX2 from a cyclooxygenase to an hydroxyperoxidase- forming enzyme. The intermediate is then passed to nearby human neutrophils which metabolize it, probably by ALOX5 enzyme activity, to four poly-hydroxyl metabolites: RvT1 (7,13R,20-trihydroxy-DPAn-3); RvT2 (7,8,13R-trihydroxy- DPAn-3); RvT3 (7,12,13R-trihydroxy-8Z,10E,14E,16Z,19Z-DPAn-3) and RvT4 (7,13R-dihydroxy-DPAn-3). Subsequent studies found that these four RvTs are also formed by mixtures of human neutrophils and vascular endothelium cells and, additionally, are detected in the infected tissues of rodents and humans.  Putative mechanisms  Following tissue injury, the inflammatory response is a protective process to promote restoration of the tissue to homeostasis. Resolution of inflammation involves various specialized lipid mediators, including resolvins. Resolvins are under laboratory research for their potential to act through G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs): 1) RvD1 and AT- RvD1 act through the Formyl peptide receptor 2, which is also activated by certain lipoxins and is therefore often termed the ALX/FPR2 receptor; 2) RvD1, AT-RVD1, RvD3, AT-RvD3, and RvD5 act through the GPR32 receptor which is now also termed the RVD1 receptor; 3) RvD2 acts through the GPR18 receptor also now termed the RvD2 receptor; and 4) RvE1 and the 18(S) analog of RvE1 are full activators while RvE2 is a partial activator of the CMKLR1 receptor. All of these receptors activate their parent cells through standard GPR-mobilized pathways. RvE1, 18(S)-RvE1, and RvE2 inhibit the Leukotriene B4 receptor 1 which is the receptor for inflammation-promoting PUFA metabolites such as LTB4 and the R stereoisomer of 12-HETE; by inhibiting the action of these pro- inflammatory mediators.  Preliminary research  Resolvin metabolites of EPA, DHA, and DPA and the maresin and protectin D1 metabolites of DHA are under basic research for their potential influences on inflammation. One human study reported no increase in urine or plasma resolvin content after consumption of fish oil compared to a non-omega-3 oil, either before or after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide known to induce an inflammatory reaction. Preliminary studies in people with cancer, kidney disease or cystic fibrosis while receiving dietary PUFA or fish oil supplements indicated improvement of inflammation biomarkers, possibly resulting from resolvins.

It is a large bird, long, approximately tall and weighing about with pinkish legs, grey and white striped neck, and a red face patch. The white-naped crane breeds in northeastern Mongolia, northeastern China, and adjacent areas of southeastern Russia where a program at Khingan Nature Reserve raises eggs provided from U.S. zoos to bolster the species. Different groups of the birds migrate to winter near the Yangtze River, the DMZ in Korea and on Kyūshū in Japan. They also reach Kazakhstan and Taiwan. Only about 4,900 and 5,400 individuals remain in the wild. Its diet consists mainly of insects, seeds, roots, plants and small animals. Due to ongoing habitat loss and overhunting in some areas, the white-naped crane is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of CITES. In South Korea, It has been designated natural monument 203. The white-naped crane was formerly placed in the genus Grus but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, four species, including the white-naped crane, were placed in the resurrected genus Antigone that had originally been erected by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853.

The school building is located on Highway 285 in Park County. Remodeling Platte Canyon School originally housed all grades, K through 12, in a one-story, long building. Grade school students were in one half of the building, while junior high and high school students were in the other half. Entry was in the middle with school offices located inside the front door, and the original gym located straight back. During 1965 and 1966, a small new two-story building was constructed. Some of the new classes offered included Home Economics and Shop. The kitchen and lunchroom were also located in the new building. Remodeling and construction took place several years ago. This construction led to the annexation of the middle and high schools into a larger building commonly known as the West Building. The former high school became the East Building, now functioning primarily as the district office. The East Building also contains two high school gyms, the auditorium, the swimming pool and the old track field. A newer track and football field were created with the new school. This field is actually on the opposite side of Highway 285. Access to the field is gained by way of an old railroad bridge spanning the highway. A new baseball field was also planned, but lack of funds and a decreasing enrollment rate had placed those plans on hold. As of late 2010 a softball field had been completed, but not the baseball field. Student population per grade climbed to a peak of about 90 students per class before beginning an eventual decline during the construction of the new school building. Inflated price of education Due to a lack of sufficient funds, the school has recently begun a search to find new sources of money. For instance, student parking was free to all in 2001, but in the 2004 school year, a fee of $50 per year was implemented. To participate in an after-school activity in 2001, a student was expected to pay $85, whereas the same activities were $35 in 2003. Although the school is public, students wishing to enroll at Platte Canyon High can purchase an \\"Activities Card\\" for $35. A new card must be purchased at the beginning of each school year. The card grants the student free or discounted access to dances, sporting events, and performances at the school. The funds from card fees are used to support such student activities. Even the modest pricing of school lunch has climbed in the last few years. The cost of a pint of milk jumped from twenty-five cents to thirty-five cents within a short time span, while the overall cost of an average lunch was $2 and rising as of 2004. Over time, the school's lack of funds has meant the closure of several classes and clubs, including home economics, wood shop, German, drafting and boys' swimming. The Marge E. Hudak Pool, located in the school's East Building, had been another part of the school in constant jeopardy. However, in 2005 a referendum was approved by the residents of the school district to provide the pool with an annual budget sufficient to maintain its programs. The Friends of the Pool Inc, a 501(c)3 tax exempt corporation, was formed to raise funds in support of the pool. Athletics Platte Canyon High School is a member of the Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) and the Frontier League. The Platte Canyon Huskies participate in 2A football (Colorado Conference) and 3A Frontier League basketball, baseball, cheer, cross country, speech and debate, softball, track & field, volleyball, wrestling, along with 4A Inter-League girls' swimming and 5A State League alpine skiing. 2006 hostage crisis On September 27, 2006, a \\"hostage situation\\" was reported at 11:40 a.m. local time (1740 UTC) at the high school. Duane R. Morrison, 53, of Denver, reportedly said that he had a bomb. He had taken six students as hostages in a second-floor room and released four of them while keeping the other two; each of the six hostages was female. Once SWAT members approached, one of the female hostages, identified as 16-year-old Emily Keyes, was shot and critically wounded. She was taken away by a helicopter, and was later declared dead from her injuries. The hostage-taker then shot and killed himself. The other female was not wounded.

Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 Under some simplifications about the production technology, growth in TFP becomes the portion of growth in output not explained by growth in traditionally measured inputs of labour and capital used in production. TFP is calculated by dividing output by the weighted average of labour and capital input, with the standard weighting of 0.7 for labour and 0.3 for capital. Total factor productivity is a measure of economic efficiency and accounts for part of the differences in cross-country per-capita income. The rate of TFP growth is calculated by subtracting growth rates of labor and capital inputs from the growth rate of output. Background Technology growth and efficiency are regarded as two of the biggest sub-sections of Total Factor Productivity, the former possessing \\"special\\" inherent features such as positive externalities and non-rivals which enhance its position as a driver of economic growth. Total Factor Productivity (TFP) is often considered the primary contributor to GDP Growth Rate. While other contributing factors include labor inputs, human capital, and physical capital. Total factor productivity measures residual growth in total output of a firm, industry or national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of traditional inputs such as labor and capital. Since this cannot be measured directly the process of calculating derives TFP as the residual which accounts for effects on total output not caused by inputs. It has been shown that there is a historical correlation between TFP and energy conversion efficiency. Also, it has been found that integration (among firms for example) has a causal positive impact on total factor productivity. Calculation The equation below (in Cobb–Douglas form) is often used to represent total output (Y) as a function of total-factor productivity (A), capital input (K), labour input (L), and the two inputs' respective shares of output (α and β are the share of contribution for K and L respectively). As usual for equations of this form, an increase in either A, K or L will lead to an increase in output. :Y = A \\\\times K^\\\\alpha \\\\times L^\\\\beta Estimation and refinements As a residual, TFP is also dependent on estimates of the other components. In 2001, William Easterly and Ross Levine estimated that for an average country the TFP accounts for 60 percent of growth of output per worker. A 2005 study on human capital attempted to correct for weaknesses in estimations of the labour component of the equation, by refining estimates of the quality of labour. Specifically, years of schooling is often taken as a proxy for the quality of labour (and stock of human capital), which does not account for differences in schooling between countries. Using these re- estimations, the contribution of TFP was substantially lower. Robert Ayres and Benjamin Warr have found that the model can be improved by using the efficiency of energy conversion, which roughly tracks technological progress. Critiques The word \\"total\\" suggests all inputs have been measured. Official statisticians tend to use the term \\"multifactor productivity\\" (MFP) instead of TFP because some inputs such as energy are usually not included, attributes of the workforce are rarely included, and public infrastructure such as highways is almost never included.Robert Shackleton. 2013.

Therefore, some economists believe that the method and its results are invalid or need to be carefully interpreted and used along with other alternative approaches. Sickles, R., & Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 On the basis of dimensional analysis, TFP has been criticized as lacking meaningful units of measurement. The units of the quantities in the Cobb–Douglas equation are: * Y: widgets/year (wid/yr) * L: man-hours/year (manhr/yr) * K: capital- hours/year (caphr/yr; this raises issues of heterogeneous capital) * α, β: pure numbers (non-dimensional), due to being exponents * A: (widgets * yearα + β – 1)/(caphrα * manhrβ), a balancing quantity, which is TFP. In this construction the units of A would not have a simple economic interpretation, and the concept of TFP appear to be a modeling artifact. Official statistics avoid measuring levels, instead constructing unitless growth rates of output and inputs and thus also for the residual.

Located in the South Pacific Ocean, the heavily-camouflaged island serves as the secret base of the International Rescue organisation. The island has had several releases as a children's toy, most notably in the early 1990s, 2000 and 2015. The first two models were commercially very successful, causing retailers to run out of stock. It was the 1993 British Association of Toy Retailers' \\"Toy of the Year\\". Depiction Thunderbird 1 is launched from a hangar underneath the island's retractable swimming pool, at the foot of the main Tracy Villa. The entrance to the Thunderbird 2 hangar is concealed by a false rock-face and leads onto the island's runway. On exiting the hangar, the palm trees lining the runway swing outwards to accommodate the wingspan of Thunderbird 2. After taxiing along the runway, Thunderbird 2 takes off from a hydraulic launch platform. Thunderbird 3 is launched from underneath the Round House. Features such as the outside staircase descending to water, the large windows, and the prominent stone chimney, suggest that the design was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater House. In the 2004 live-action film, a projection of the flightpath from Tracy Island to London clearly shows the former as being located in the Atlantic Ocean, whereas in the original TV series the island was located in the Pacific. Although the security of the island is stated to be assured by jamming equipment, it proves to be somewhat vulnerable in the comic strips of TV Century 21 due to the machinations of The Hood. Learning everything about the island by brainwashing the technically minded Brains and extracting all of his knowledge concerning the island, the Hood launches his strongest attack yet on IR, destroying several Thunderbird craft and many of their hangars, with the exception of Thunderbirds 1 and 4. (The canonicity of the Thunderbirds comics adventures is open to interpretation.) Production Shooting locations for the live-action version of Tracy Island included Anse Lazio beach on the island of Praslin in Seychelles (pictured). Derek Meddings, special effects supervisor on the puppet series, described his excitement at designing Tracy Island as \\"one of those feelings you get when you're a kid, imagining that you're Robinson Crusoe living on a lovely island.\\" For the 2004 live-action film, the main shooting location for the island exteriors was North Island in the Seychelles. Co-producer Mark Huffam described Tracy Island as \\"the most idyllic [...] imaginable, with crystal-clear waters, tropical jungle and mountainous peaks\\", adding that it was \\"fantastic\\" that North Island provided \\"all these essential elements\\". Various locations on Praslin, including Anse Lazio beach and Vallée de Mai nature preserve, were also used. The buildings on the re-imagined island were deliberately given a \\"retro-futuristic\\" appearance, described by production designer John Beard as \\"based in the '60s and '70s, which is similar to what we were doing for Brazil.\\" Further inspiration was drawn from the work of Oscar Niemeyer and others. The interiors set at Pinewood Studios was built in what Beard described as a \\"kind of double-'S' shape\\". He added that \\"because we're not building the top, it means we can hang the building from the top ceiling in the studio, which we couldn't have done outside.\\" Merchandise and Blue Peter In the UK, repeats of Thunderbirds on BBC2 in the early 1990s led to renewed public interest in the series and a fresh wave of tie-in toys. In the run-up to Christmas 1992, demand for Tracy Island playsets increased considerably and retailers ran out of stock, leading to overnight queues outside stores. The story was reported in the national news and has since been cited as the archetypal mistake to be avoided by the toy industry during the Christmas shopping season; according to the BBC, the toy \\"caused hysteria in shops across the UK.\\" The playset was a contender for the British Association of Toy Retailers' (BATR) 1992 Toy of the Year Award, but due to the stock shortages lost to WWF Hasbro action figures. It subsequently won the 1993 award. In January 1993, the BBC children's TV programme Blue Peter responded to the stock shortage by showing viewers how to build a home- made version out of household waste. The BBC was then, in turn, overwhelmed by requests for copies of an instruction sheet for making the model. Eventually the broadcaster stopped sending out the sheets and released a recording of presenter Anthea Turner's demonstration, titled \\"Blue Peter Makes a Thunderbirds Tracy Island\\", on VHS. In 2015, Radio Times described Blue Peters island-building demonstration as \\"one of the most iconic moments\\" in the programme's history. The BBC's re-launch of Thunderbirds in 2000 prompted a resurgence in the toy's popularity and a second Blue Peter demonstration. The new Tracy Island playset by Vivid Imaginations was released to a positive critical response and was listed as one of the top ten children's toys by the BATR. As before, supply of the toy did not keep up with demand. In December, the BBC reported that only 60,000 copies of the Chinese-made product would be shipped to the UK before Christmas, despite demand being estimated at half a million. Vivid attributed the stock shortage to a lack of microchips caused by high demand from the mobile phone industry. The playset ultimately became one of the best-selling toys of 2000, with demand estimated to be up to ten times greater than supply. In 2015, to coincide with the debut of the remake series Thunderbirds Are Go, Vivid released a new Tracy Island toy incorporating smart technology. Reception Tim Bevan, producer of the live-action film, called Tracy Island \\"one of the main characters of the original Thunderbirds series\\". Rob McLaughlin of the entertainment website Den of Geek named it the seventh- best secret base in film and TV but challenged one particular design aspect: \\"There's the small matter of the ever-present risk of a great big rocket ship appearing out the bottom of [the swimming pool] and squashing you.\\" Jon Abbott of TV Zone magazine criticised the base's layout, questioning why the control centre is located in the lounge when a hidden control room would eliminate the need for \\"Operation Cover-Up\\" – the procedure used to rid the lounge of all trace of International Rescue's presence whenever the island receives visitors from the outside world. As part of this operation, wall portraits of the Tracy brothers in their International Rescue uniforms are replaced with alternatives showing them in casual attire. Abbott asks why Jeff Tracy would even need uniformed photographs of his sons, regarding this as one of several aspects that make the Tracy Island lounge a \\"delightful deranged indulgence\\". However, he concedes that for child viewers, the existence of these features made Thunderbirds \\"much more fun to watch than Z-Cars or Dr. Finlay's Casebook\\". In a publicity exercise, Ford Motor Company, which built the re-imagined FAB 1 for the live-action film, commissioned a Thunderbirds-themed live event and interactive experience for the 2004 British International Motor Show. The stand was designed as a replica of Tracy Island, complete with a beach, a lake, an aircraft hangar and an overhead model of Thunderbird 2. Titled \\"Thunderbirds Powered By Ford\\", it was one of the largest exhibits ever built by construction company Imagination and proved to be a success, attracting 250,000-300,000 visitors and winning a certificate of \\"High Commendation\\" at the 2004 Marketing Brand Design Awards. The new version that was modelled for the remake series Thunderbirds Are Go (2015-20) was positively received by Wired UK magazine, whose reporter Matt Kamen described the island as \\"stunningly detailed, and any returning viewers will be delighted to see classic features such as the retractable swimming pool revealing a rocket silo have been retained for the update.\\" In popular culture *Tracy Island and Thunderbirds are referenced in the Arctic Monkeys' song \\"R U Mine?\\" in the lines \\"I'm a puppet on a string / Tracy Island, time-travelling diamond\\".

It stars Chang Son Hui and Pak Sung Ho and features special effects by Duk Ho Kim, supervised by Teruyoshi Nakano. The film is loosely based on the legend of the Bulgasari. Director Shin had been kidnapped in 1978 by North Korean intelligence on the orders of Kim Jong-il, son of the then-ruling Kim Il-sung, and was coerced into making several films as a director, with Pulgasari being his final before he and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, escaped to the United States.Backrow Banter, The Dear Leader, The Director And The Director’s Wife  Plot summary  In feudal Korea, during the Goryeo Dynasty, a king controls the land with an iron fist, subjecting the peasantry to misery and starvation. An old blacksmith who was sent to prison for defending his people creates a tiny figurine of a monster by making a doll of rice, and before dying asks the gods of earth and sky to make his creation a living creature that protects the rebels and the oppressed. When the figurine comes into contact with the blood of the blacksmith's daughter, the creature springs to life, becoming a giant metal- eating monster whom the blacksmith's daughter names Pulgasari, which is the name of the mythical monster her father used to mention as an eater of iron and steel. Pulgasari now shares a special bond with the blacksmith's daughter, and after he starts eating some of the farmer's tools, becomes a giant and powerful figure. After much suffering, the peasants form an army, storm the palace of the region's Governor and kill him. Soon after the evil King becomes aware that there is a rebellion being planned in the country, and he intends to crush it, but he runs into Pulgasari, who fights with the peasant army to overthrow the corrupt monarchy. Pulgasari wins many battles because of his unending hunger for all kind of metal, readily provided by its enemies. Nevertheless, after capturing and executing the leader of the rebellion (who was also the future husband of the blacksmith's daughter), the King's army threatens to kill the blacksmith's daughter if Pulgasari does not surrender. Pulgasari lets itself be trapped to save the woman, and the royal army apparently kill the creature by burying it under the ground. After escaping, the blacksmith's daughter revives Pulgasari by again pouring some of her blood on the burial site. Pulgasari grows strong once more and attacks the King's palace, destroying it and simultaneously killing the King. After the defeat of the King, Pulgasari becomes a new problem, since he starts eating the rebel's weapons and farmer's tools, which are given to the creature without objection, since the peasants still believe Pulgasari is a benign saviour. The blacksmith's daughter realizes that Pulgasari's hunger will never stop, and that he is inadvertently oppressing the people he fought for. She decides to sacrifice herself by hiding inside a big bell that Pulgasari finds and quickly eats. Pulgasari yells in anguish as the blacksmith's daughter's presence in its system causes its stomach to explode, tragically killing both of them, but saving the people once and for all.

The original story was set in the city of Songdo (now Kaesong, North Korea). Production Kim was a lifelong admirer of the director, as well as Godzilla and other kaiju films. He kidnapped the former director and his wife, famous actress Choi Eun-hee, with the specific purpose of making fantasy/propaganda films for the North Korean government. Kim Jong-il also produced Pulgasari (through Korean Film Studio) and all the films that Sang-ok made before he and Choi managed to escape from their minders while on a festival tour in Austria. Specifically, the film was inspired by The Return of Godzilla. The staff from Japan's Toho Studios, the creators of Godzilla, participated in creating the film's special effects. They were tricked into coming as they thought they were filming in China. Jonathan Ross stated that the film was intended by the North Korean government to be a propaganda metaphor for the effects of unchecked capitalism and the power of the collective.  Legacy  Kenpachiro Satsuma was quoted as saying he preferred Pulgasari to TriStar's Godzilla.First NK Monster Faces Hollywood-Born Godzilla in Japan The People's Korea There has been some speculation that the director Shin Sang-ok included a hidden message of his own in the film; the monster of the movie was to be interpreted as a metaphor for Kim Il-sung betraying a people's revolution for his own purposes. After finding out that his credit was removed from the movie, Shin Sang-ok also wrote a remake called The Adventures of Galgameth. In 2006, Pulgasari made its New York debut at the end of Columbia University Japanese culture center's yearlong “Godzilla” festival. = Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee's story = Pulgasari has gained some popularity over the years because of the shocking story of Shin Sang-ok and Choi Eun-hee's kidnapping at the hands of North Korea's government. During their strange captivity in the country Shin and Choi were, respectively, director and leading actress in a number of North Korean films produced by Kim Jong-il. The director and leading actress made together a total of seven films, for which the couple – who were separated before their kidnapping – was simultaneously commissioned and forced to do by North Korea's government. However, Pulgasari does not feature Choi. Pulgasari was made in 1985, the same year that Shin's North Korean films Salt and The Tale of Shim Chong were released. It was the last film directed by Shin before he and Choi escaped to the United States.

In the spring of 2005 the editor began The Dhamma Transcription Project, which formalizes transcription procedures that he had been following over the previous few years. In October 2013 the editor announced changes to Access to Insight. On December 10, 2013, he announced his withdrawal from further personal contributions, but encouraged others to develop online tools for Dhamma studies ( \\"A Parting Note to ATI Techies\\"). He said that his annual financial support of US$1,500 was to be discontinued, and encouraged the future support and maintenance of a commercial-free search engine. In September 2017 the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies assumed ownership of the domain name and management of the website.

He primarily worked for various National Wrestling Alliance member territories, including Florida Championship Wrestling and Jim Crockett Promotions. He is also known as Yoshi Kwan, initially from World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Professional wrestling career Ashford-Smith started wrestling in 1984 using the ring name Dennis Smith. =Florida Championship Wrestling (1986–1987)= In 1986, he began working for Florida Championship Wrestling and changed his ring name to \\"Chris Champion\\", the name he would be most known under. Champion teamed up with Sean Royal to form a tag team called The New Breed. The \\"gimmick\\" of the New Breed was that they claimed to be sent back from the year 2002 to 1986 to compete. As part of their gimmick they claimed that Dusty Rhodes would be elected President of the United States in the 2000 election, and addressed him as \\"Mr. President\\". They also referred to having robots and sported very unusual haircuts and bright \\"futuristic\\" ring gear in neon colors. Their entrance music was the Beastie Boys' song \\"Fight For Your Right to Party\\". On August 3, 1986, Champion defeated Tyree Pride to win the NWA Florida Bahamian Championship from him, a title he would hold until September 28, 1986 where he lost it to The Falcon. The New Breed won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship when they defeated Kendall Windham and Vic Steamboat in the finals of a tournament for the vacant titles. The New Breed held the Florida Tag titles from December 25, 1986 until February 21, 1987 where they lost the belts to the Southern Boys (Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers). Shortly after the title loss the New Breed left Florida to work for Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). =Jim Crockett Promotions (1987–1988)= Champion competed in the 1987 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament, teaming with Denny Brown. The team defeated Bill and Randy Mulkey in the first round, but were defeated by Giant Baba and Isao Takagi in the second round. In JCP the New Breed worked a feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, but the storyline was abruptly ended when the New Breed were involved in a car accident that meant Chris Champion could not wrestle for several months. When he returned, he wore a cast on his arm, decorated with computer parts, claiming it was a \\"future cast\\". The car crash and return turned the New Breed face (\\"good guys\\") and they began a feud with The Midnight Express (Stan Lane and Bobby Eaton). The feud did not last long as Sean Royal retired a short time later, ending the New Breed team. After the New Breed broke up, Champion participated in the 1988 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament, teaming with his brother Mark Starr. The team defeated the Twin Devils in the opening round, but were defeated by the Powers of Pain in the second round. Following the Crockett Cup Champion briefly competed in the NWA as \\"The Karate Kid\\", but Ric Flair, Barry Windham and others complained of Champion's stiff kicks and he was soon pushed out of the Crockett territory. =Continental Wrestling Association/United States Wrestling Association (1988–1991)= Following his departure from JCP Champion showed up in Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) teaming with his brother, Mark Starr to form a team called \\"Wild Side\\", a team that feuded with the Rock 'N Roll Express, just as the New Breed had done years before. On July 3, 1989, Wild Side faced then CWA Tag Team Champions Action Jackson and Billy Travis for the titles, in a match that became so out of control that it ended in a \\"no contest\\" and the titles being vacated. The following week Wild Side defeated Jackson and Travis in the rematch and won the CWA Tag Team Championship. Their title reign lasted until the Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated them for the belts on September 11, 1989. In late 1989 CWA became United States Wrestling Association (USWA), with the new name came a new attitude from Chris Champion, who broke up Wild Side and began working as a face. Champion worked feuds with USWA's top talent such as Jerry Lawler and The Dirty White Boy. For a while Champion worked as \\"Kowabunga\\", dressed in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bodysuit and mask. Champion left the USWA in 1991. =Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling and Independent circuit (1991–1993)= Champion, using the Kowabunga gimmick, but using the name \\"Turtle Kamen,\\" wrestled a tour of Japan for Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling in August 1991. While in FMW, he teamed up with the likes of his brother Mark Starr, Jimmy Backlund, Ricky Fuji, and Amigo Ultra and battled the likes of Eiji Ezaki, Masashi Honda, and kickboxer Katsuji Ueda. After FMW, Champion returned to the States to compete in the independent circuit, namely the International Championship Wrestling Alliance in Florida and the Mountain Wrestling Association in Kentucky. He would briefly appear in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. =World Championship Wrestling (1993)= In June 1993, Champion returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he was given the ring persona \\"Yoshi Kwan\\", and was managed by Harley Race. Originally, the name was supposed to be \\"Yo Chi Kwan\\"- a Chinese name, but announcer Tony Schiavone announced the first name as \\"Yoshi\\" (which is Japanese), and it stuck. The Yoshi Kwan character was billed as being from Asia (either Hunan or Hong Kong) and wore makeup to make him appear to be Asian. Kwan scored victories over Brad Armstrong, Marcus Alexander Bagwell, 2 Cold Scorpio and others while managed by Race. Kwan feuded with Cactus Jack, with the two facing off in a singles match at WCW's 1993 Fall Brawl which Cactus Jack won. Kwan was set to face Ricky Steamboat at Halloween Havoc, but a knee injury prevented him from wrestling and he was soon out of WCW. =Independent circuit (1993–2008)= Champion worked as \\"Yoshi Kwan\\" on the American independent circuit, as well as returning to FMW for a tour in March 1996. He would also return to the USWA in April 1996, but would leave the company three months later. He would resurrect the Turtle Kamen character for BattlARTS in 1999. Champion later adopted a character called \\"Sinn\\" that he used both in the United States and, later, in the United Kingdom. In 1998, Champion worked with Chris Alexander against Frost and Mindbender for the New Age Wrestling Alliance Tag Team Championship. The title was held up due to a double countout. In July 2002, Champion had a major stroke and was in the critical care unit for a while after that. He was able to make a full recovery from the stroke and returned to wrestling. In 2006, he teamed with Blackie West in the Southern Wrestling Federation, as \\"The SS\\". They won the SWF Tag Team Championship from \\"Team Freedom\\" (JP Jones and Max Carnage) in 2006. He also worked as a booker there. Death Champion died on August 22, 2018, at the age of 57.Former NWA Star Chris Champion Passes Away at Age 57 According to Ringsidenews.com, it is rumored that Champion's death was caused by another stroke.Former WCW Star Chris Champion Passes Away A YouTube user claiming to be Champion's daughter verified this, saying he suffered multiple strokes during his final days.

Life William Ogilvie was hired by Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster to tutor her children after the death of her eldest in London. He was introduced to her by Dean Marley and was described as speaking with a harsh Scots voice, was dour, ungainly, often rude and frequently unshaven. Eccentric in his age this shy, reserved, rather grubby man believed that children were sensible immature people and had an excellent rapport with them. He had a particular fondness for Lord Edward FitzGerald, preparing him for his military career. After leaving the army Lord Edward was appointed commander in chief of the United Irishmen just before the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Ogilvie visited him whilst he was in hiding from the authorities. Ogilvie married Lady Emily, who continued to be known as the Dowager Duchess of Leinster, months after the death of her husband, but their love affair had begun before his death in Frescati House. Ogilvie is known to be the biological father of Lord George Simon FitzGerald. A further three children were born to them after their marriage: *Cecilia Margaret Ogilvie (9 July 1775–1824) she married Charles Lock on 12 July 1795. They had three daughters. *Charlotte Ogilvie (born and died 1777). *Emily Charlotte \\"Mimie\\" Ogilvie (May 1778–22 January 1832) she married Charles George Beauclerk (son of Topham Beauclerk and his wife Diana Spencer; briefly an MP) on 29 April 1799. They had thirteen children. Ogilvie purchased the Ardglass estate in County Down from his stepson Rear Admiral Lord Charles FitzGerald and he and Lady Emily lived there for part of their marriage in Ardglass Castle. He spent his latter years rebuilding the town which was once a major trading port. He successfully established a harbour here in 1813 and built public baths making the town one of the most fashionable watering places in the north of Ireland. A firm believer in self- sufficiency, Ardglass had gardens laid out for residents to grow their own produce. He died in 1832 and his remains were interred in the Church of Ireland on Kildare Street in Ardglass. He died fondly remembered as \\"a man of character, a man of splendid determination, a man absolutely devoid of petty meanesses, and a man of exceptional tenderness\\".

Originally known as O. L. Kipp State Park, it was renamed in the late 1990s to describe better its resources. The park preserves steep-sided bluffs rising above the river and the narrow valleys between them, which support rare and fragile plant communities. Two of the bluffs have received further protection under the Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas program, which are known as King's and Queen's Bluff Scientific and Natural Area.  Geology  The region lies on sedimentary rock layers deposited on the floor of a shallow sea 500 million years ago. The lower, older layer is sandstone overlain by more recent dolomite rock. Much later a deep channel was carved into this stone by the ancient Mississippi River, which 10,000 years ago was greatly swollen from the melting glaciers to the north. The softer sandstone was eroded more easily, undercutting the dolomite on both banks of the river. The dolomite fractured off along vertical joints, leaving sheer rock faces still visible today. Side streams flowing into the Mississippi cut gullies into the river banks, creating a series of bluffs capped with erosion-resistant dolomite. Located in the Driftless Region of southeast Minnesota, the area was missed by the most recent Wisconsonian glaciation, and therefore is a region of deep river valleys dissecting the upland plains.  Park creation  In the 1960s a state park was envisioned on the Mississippi river bluffs in the proximity of a highway bridge which carried many westbound travelers into Minnesota. Legislation authorizing a park was passed in 1963. The layout was a long, narrow strip along the blufftops between La Crescent and Dresbach, sandwiched between U.S. Route 61 at the foot of the bluffs and a county road atop them. To befit a roadside park, the state highway department was asked to provide a name. They suggested O. L. Kipp State Park after Orin Lansing Kipp, who had worked for them from 1916 to 1955 and helped establish the Minnesota state highway system. However, when the state contacted the current private owners of the designated land, they proved unwilling to sell their river views, and none of the property was ever acquired. However an alternative property to the north appeared which was both better shaped and already owned by the state. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' Division of Forestry had been buying up lots in the region since 1962 for what was to become the Richard J. Dorer Memorial Hardwood State Forest. Legislation in 1971 transferred from the forestry division to the parks division, and O. L. Kipp State Park finally came into being. Development of the modest recreational facilities was slow, and the park officially opened to the public in 1976.  Flora and fauna  King's and Queen's Bluffs, with sheer sides facing the Mississippi River and \\"goat prairies\\" facing the southwest European settlers had cleared much of the land for farming, but this led to significant erosion on the steep slopes. The state forestry division had been planting nonnative as well as native trees to curtail the erosion and produce harvestable timber. Under the Division of Parks and Recreation, the plantations of nonnatives like red pine went against the policy of restoring a natural habitat. As a compromise, the nonnative trees are being harvested as they reach maturity and are being replaced with more appropriate vegetation. High up on the sides of several bluffs are rare habitats called goat prairies by locals, because they are so steep it would seem only goats could graze on them. These patches of prairie grow only on slopes between 40 and 50 degrees which face south to southwest. This orientation catches prodigious amounts of sunlight, which in winter means the ground thaws daily and freezes nightly, retarding the establishment of any woody plants. The park also contains a relict stand of northern white cedar on Queen's Bluff, well south of its normal distribution. It arose during glacial periods and survived the subsequent warming of the local climate.  Recreation  The park's unstaffed welcome center Development in the park was limited by the steep terrain and fragile habitats. Thus the roads and trails snake along the ridgetops and are fairly level despite the varied topography. The King's Bluff Nature Trail leads out onto King's Bluff (although the far tip is still privately owned). Other short trails lead out to viewpoints, some of the Mississippi River and Wisconsin shore, and some to goat prairies overlooking a narrow valley. Queen's Bluff and certain other areas of the park are off-limits except for research, due to the rare plants and treacherous slopes (in 1976 an early visitor fell to her death from Queen's Bluff). There is a picnic area whose tables are screened from each other by trees. The campground features 31 sites and a restroom with showers and flush toilets. The separate group camp can host up to 80 tenters. There is also a 5-site campground at the base of the bluffs for bicyclists traveling the Great River Road.  References  * Meyer, Roy W.

It was built in 1902–1903 and was designed by the architecture firm of Henry Hertz and Hugh Tallant;Alexander, Cathy. \\"New Amsterdam Theatre\\" in , pp.888-89 the Roof Garden, where more risqué productions were presented, and which no longer exists, was added in 1904, designed by the same firm., p. 88, p. 256 The remainder of the building was utilized for offices. From 1913 to 1927, the theatre was the home of the Ziegfeld Follies, whose producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., maintained an office in the building, and operated a nightclub on the roof. George White's Scandals and Eva LeGallienne's Civic Repertory Theatre were subsequent tenants. It was used as a movie theatre beginning in 1937, closed in 1985, and was leased by The Walt Disney Company and renovated by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer in 1995–97 to be the flagship for Disney Theatrical Productions presentations on Broadway. Both the Beaux-Arts exterior and the Art Nouveau interior of the building are New York City landmarks, having been designated in 1979. In addition, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Along with the Hudson and Lyceum Theatres, also built in 1903, the New Amsterdam is one of the oldest surviving Broadway venues. Construction and original run The theatre in 1905 The Beaux-Arts facade of the New Amsterdam is a narrow slice which leads to the theatre's interior, the first concrete example of architectural Art Nouveau in New York.Waters, Theodore \\"The New Amsterdam Theatre: A triumph of the new art\\", Everybody's Magazine (July–December 1903) pp 488 The building was constructed in 1902–03 by the partnership of impresarios A.L. Erlanger and Marcus Klaw, was designed by architects Herts & Tallant. Decoration was carried out by an extensive team of painters and sculptors that included George Gray Barnard, Robert Blum, the brothers Neumark, George Daniel M. Peixotto,The Jewish Encyclopedia: \\"Peixotto\\" Roland Hinton Perry and Albert Beck Wenzell. At the time of construction, it was the largest theatre in New York, with a seating capacity of 1,702. The theatre opened October 23, 1903 with a production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. For many years, it hosted the Ziegfeld Follies, showcasing such talents as Fanny Brice, Bert Williams, Will Rogers, Eddie Cantor, W.C. Fields, Marilyn Miller, Van and Schenck, Helen Morgan, Sophie Tucker, Eaton siblings and silent film star Olive Thomas whose ghost supposedly haunts the theatre. A racier sister show of the Follies, the Midnight Frolics, played in the New Amsterdam's Roof Garden theatre. The New Amsterdam was the scene of Marilyn Miller's greatest triumphs in the musicals Sally (1920) and Sunny, which opened in September 1925 co-starring Clifton Webb as Harold Wendell-Wendell and ran for three seasons.Parker, John (ed), Who's Who in the Theatre, 10th revised edition, London, 1947: 1429 But the theatre also hosted serious productions, and in June 1927 Basil Rathbone appeared there as Cassius in Julius Caesar.Parker, John (ed), Who's Who in the Theatre, 10th revised edition, London, 1947: 1184 The premiere of the Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach scored Roberta starring Bob Hope, George Murphy, Fay Templeton and Lyda Roberti opened at the New Amsterdam November 18, 1933. Restoration The Great Depression did much harm to the legitimate-theatre business, and in 1936 the New Amsterdam closed. It reopened on a limited basis in 1937 but was soon converted to a movie theatre. The New York City Industrial Development Corporation raised a bond issue to purchase the property in 1982 and retained title while responsibility for development and bond payment rested with the Nederlander Organization. In 1984, the Empire State Development Corporation and New York City Economic Development Corporation purchased the property. After having spent on the property, Nederlander announced in 1990 that it did not consider restoration of the property to be economically feasible; thereafter in 1992, a settlement was reached where the New York State Urban Development Corporation would take ownership and begin \\"structural stabilization\\" immediately through the 42nd Street Development Project.Dunlap, David. \\"State Acquires Landmark Theater to Salvage While It Still Can\\" The New York Times (September 10, 1992) During its years as a movie theatre, the Roof Garden was used as a rehearsal space for a number of shows, including the original Broadway productions of My Fair Lady, Gypsy and Camelot. In 1936, the theatre staged its last play, Sigmund Romberg's Forbidden Melody, until Disney control. Disney Theatrical Productions signed a 49-year revenue-based lease for the property in May 1995, with Disney Development restoring the building. The theatre, which had recently been used as a filming location for the movie Vanya on 42nd Street, was dilapidated; it would take several years, and millions of dollars, to restore it to its original use and grandeur. The roof garden remained closed when inspectors discovered that it could not meet modern building codes. The New Amsterdam was officially reopened on April 2, 1997. In November 1997, after the premiere of the film Hercules and a limited engagement of a concert version of King David, Disney's stage version of The Lion King opened. On June 4, 2006, The Lion King closed in The New Amsterdam Theatre, moving two blocks uptown to the Minskoff Theatre on June 13, 2006. Mary Poppins began previews at the New Amsterdam Theatre on October 16, 2006 and opened on November 16, 2006,Staff. \\"The Lion King is moving theatre\\" New York Theatre Guide (June 2, 2006) where it continued to run until March 3, 2013.

It has various descriptions, all of which are of algorithmic nature, it has many remarkable properties, and it has applications in combinatorics and other areas such as representation theory. The correspondence has been generalized in numerous ways, notably by Knuth to what is known as the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence, and a further generalization to pictures by Zelevinsky. The simplest description of the correspondence is using the Schensted algorithm , a procedure that constructs one tableau by successively inserting the values of the permutation according to a specific rule, while the other tableau records the evolution of the shape during construction. The correspondence had been described, in a rather different form, much earlier by Robinson , in an attempt to prove the Littlewood–Richardson rule. The correspondence is often referred to as the Robinson–Schensted algorithm, although the procedure used by Robinson is radically different from the Schensted–algorithm, and almost entirely forgotten. Other methods of defining the correspondence include a nondeterministic algorithm in terms of jeu de taquin. The bijective nature of the correspondence relates it to the enumerative identity: :\\\\sum_{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathcal{P}_n} (t_\\\\lambda)^2= n! where \\\\mathcal{P}_n denotes the set of partitions of (or of Young diagrams with squares), and denotes the number of standard Young tableaux of shape .  The Schensted algorithm  The Schensted algorithm starts from the permutation written in two-line notation :\\\\sigma=\\\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & \\\\cdots & n\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_1 & \\\\sigma_2 & \\\\sigma_3 & \\\\cdots & \\\\sigma_n \\\\end{pmatrix} where , and proceeds by constructing sequentially a sequence of (intermediate) ordered pairs of Young tableaux of the same shape: :(P_0, Q_0), (P_1, Q_1), \\\\ldots, (P_n, Q_n), where are empty tableaux. The output tableaux are and . Once is constructed, one forms by inserting into , and then by adding an entry to in the square added to the shape by the insertion (so that and have equal shapes for all ). Because of the more passive role of the tableaux , the final one , which is part of the output and from which the previous are easily read off, is called the recording tableau; by contrast the tableaux are called insertion tableaux. = Insertion = thumbright180pxInsertion of (4): • (4) replaces (5) in the first row • (5) replaces (8) in the second row • (8) creates the third row The basic procedure used to insert each is called Schensted insertion or row-insertion (to distinguish it from a variant procedure called column-insertion). Its simplest form is defined in terms of \\"incomplete standard tableaux\\": like standard tableaux they have distinct entries, forming increasing rows and columns, but some values (still to be inserted) may be absent as entries. The procedure takes as arguments such a tableau and a value not present as entry of ; it produces as output a new tableau denoted and a square by which its shape has grown. The value appears in the first row of , either having been added at the end (if no entries larger than were present), or otherwise replacing the first entry in the first row of . In the former case is the square where is added, and the insertion is completed; in the latter case the replaced entry is similarly inserted into the second row of , and so on, until at some step the first case applies (which certainly happens if an empty row of is reached). More formally, the following pseudocode describes the row-insertion of a new value into .Adapted from # Set and to one more than the length of the first row of . # While and , decrease by 1. (Now is the first square in row with either an entry larger than in , or no entry at all.) # If the square is empty in , terminate after adding to in square and setting . # Swap the values and . (This inserts the old into row , and saves the value it replaces for insertion into the next row.) # Increase by 1 and return to step 2. The shape of grows by exactly one square, namely .  Correctness  The fact that has increasing rows and columns, if the same holds for , is not obvious from this procedure (entries in the same column are never even compared). It can however be seen as follows. At all times except immediately after step 4, the square is either empty in or holds a value greater than ; step 5 re-establishes this property because now is the square immediately below the one that originally contained in . Thus the effect of the replacement in step 4 on the value is to make it smaller; in particular it cannot become greater than its right or lower neighbours. On the other hand the new value is not less than its left neighbour (if present) either, as is ensured by the comparison that just made step 2 terminate. Finally to see that the new value is larger than its upper neighbour if present, observe that holds after step 5, and that decreasing in step 2 only decreases the corresponding value . = Constructing the tableaux = The full Schensted algorithm applied to a permutation proceeds as follows. # Set both and to the empty tableau # For increasing from to compute and the square by the insertion procedure; then replace by and add the entry to the tableau in the square . # Terminate, returning the pair . The algorithm produces a pair of standard Young tableaux.  Invertibility of the construction  It can be seen that given any pair of standard Young tableaux of the same shape, there is an inverse procedure that produces a permutation that will give rise to by the Schensted algorithm. It essentially consists of tracing steps of the algorithm backwards, each time using an entry of to find the square where the inverse insertion should start, moving the corresponding entry of to the preceding row, and continuing upwards through the rows until an entry of the first row is replaced, which is the value inserted at the corresponding step of the construction algorithm. These two inverse algorithms define a bijective correspondence between permutations of on one side, and pairs of standard Young tableaux of equal shape and containing squares on the other side.  Properties  One of the most fundamental properties, but not evident from the algorithmic construction, is symmetry: * If the Robinson–Schensted correspondence associates tableaux to a permutation , then it associates to the inverse permutation . This can be proven, for instance, by appealing to Viennot's geometric construction. Further properties, all assuming that the correspondence associates tableaux to the permutation . * In the pair of tableaux associated to the reversed permutation , the tableau is the transpose of the tableau , and is a tableau determined by , independently of (namely the transpose of the tableau obtained from by the Schützenberger involution). * The length of the longest increasing subsequence of is equal to the length of the first row of (and of ). * The length of the longest decreasing subsequence of is equal to the length of the first column of (and of ), as follows from the previous two properties. * The descent set } of equals the descent set } of . * Identify subsequences of with their sets of indices. It is a theorem of Greene that for any , the size of the largest set that can be written as the union of at most increasing subsequences is . In particular, equals the largest length of an increasing subsequence of . * If is an involution, then the number of fixed points of equals the number of columns of odd length in .

Professional wrestling career =Early career (1984–1986)= Sean Royal made his professional wrestling debut in 1984 after training under Hiro Matsuda. He initially worked for Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling based in Charlotte, North Carolina. =Championship Wrestling from Florida (1986–1987)= In 1986 he began working for Championship Wrestling from Florida. Initially he worked as a singles wrestler, but it was not long into his tenure in Florida that the promoter and match makers decided to team Royal up with another young wrestler, Chris Champion; and together the two became a regular tag team called The New Breed. The New Breed tag team was given an elaborate back story and \\"science fiction\\" flavor as they were marketed as wrestlers sent back in time from 2002 to 1986. The duo was presented as having \\"futuristic technology\\", wore bright neon colored ring gear and unusual haircuts that were supposed to be the fashion of the future, and at one point had a robot as their manager. The team made various references to future events such as referring to wrestler Dusty Rhodes as \\"President Rhodes\\", indicating that Rhodes would win the 2000 presidential election. The team would come to the ring to the sound of the Beastie Boys' song \\"Fight For Your Right to Party\\". The team made a special appearance in Memphis, working for the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they lost to the MOD Squad on a show in the Mid-South Coliseum on September 1, 1986. On December 25, 1986, the New Breed defeated Vic Steamboat and Kendall Windham in the finals of a tournament for the vacant NWA Florida Tag Team Championship, which had been inactive since 1981. After the title win the New Breed was put into a story line feud with the Face (those that portray the \\"good guys\\") team The Southern Boys (Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers). The feud between the two teams led to the Southern Boys defeating the New Breed for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on February 11, 1987. Shortly after their title loss the New Breed left Florida. =Jim Crockett Promotions (1987–1988)= The duo made their debut for National Wrestling Alliance Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which was in the process of expanding from the mid- Atlantic region to a national promotion. The team kept their futuristic gimmick and their Heel (those that portray the bad guys) characters as they were immediately put up against the popular the Rock 'n' Roll Express team of Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson, stating that they had been sent back from the future to save the fans from the Rock 'n' Roll Express, who would supposedly go crazy over what happened to Rock and Roll in the year 2000. They also claimed that in the future Jimmy Valiant had corrupted future Dusty Rhodes, leading to a dictatorship. mockingly calling him \\"Father Time\\". They also claimed that masked wrestler LazorTron was in reality a robot from the future, sent to stop them. In the spring of 1987 the New Breed was one of 10 teams competing in a tournament for the vacant NWA United States Tag Team Championship. The team wrestled the father/son duo of Bob Armstrong and Brad Armstrong to a draw, eliminating both teams from the tournament. The story line with the Rock 'n' Roll Express was still in its infant stages when the New Breed was involved in a car accident and Chris Champion's injuries forced him to not wrestle for an extended period. Royal teamed up with Gladiator #1 and Gladiator #2, losing to the trio of Kendall Windham, Jimmy Valiant and LazerTron on the undercard on one of JCP's 1987 The Great American Bash series. JCP used the sympathy that Royal and Champion garnered from the car accident to turn the team into faces, as Jim Cornette, the manager of the Midnight Express tried to recruit Royal to his group, but Royal refused. During his recovering Chris Champion appeared on television with circuit boards and wires glued to his cast, making it look like it was a futuristic \\"Healing device\\". Once Champion returned to action the New Breed feuded with the Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane). The two teams clashed several times, often over the NWA United States Tag Team Championship where most of the matches ended inconclusively. In an attempt to bolster the fan favorite image and congruent with their futuristic characters, JCP officials decided to give the New Breed a manager, a small remote controlled robot called \\"XTC-1\\" On November 26, 1987 the New Breed lost to The Sheepherders (Luke Williams and Butch Miller) for the UWF World Tag Team Championship as part of the Universal Wrestling Federation's Superdome show, losing to the defending champions. The New Breed broke up a short time after as Royal retired from full-time wrestling, opting to become a construction worker instead. =New Japan Pro Wrestling (1993)= Royal made a return to pro wrestling in 1993, travelling to Japan to work for New Japan Pro Wrestling in the fall. Royal teamed up with Brad Armstrong to compete in NJPW's Super Grade Tag League III, a monthlong round-robin tournament NJPW holds each year. The duo ended the tournament with 0 points, losing to teams such as Jushin Thunder Liger and Wild Pegasus, The Barbarian and Masa Saito, Takayuki Iizuka and Akira Nogami, Shiro Koshinaka and Michiyoshi Ohara, the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior), Tatsumi Fujinami and Osamu Kido, Masahiro Chono and Shinya Hashimoto as well as semi-finalists the Jurrasic Powers (Scott Norton and Hercules Hernandez) and tournament winners Hiroshi Hase and Keiji Mutoh. He wrestled his last NJPW match on November 4, 1993 as part of a special NJPW show in Sumo Hall. Royal teamed up with the Barbarian, losing to the Jurrasic Powers. =NWA Wildside (2001–2002)= In 2001 Royal returned to pro wrestling, teaming up with Rusty Riddle to form a team known as \\"Total Destruction\\" in NWA Wildside. As a member of Total Destruction Royal once again plays a heel character, leading to a story line where the team was banned from NWA Wildside for 30 days. During that time period the team won the NWA Wildside Tag Team Championship from Blackout (Homicide and Rainman) after a surprise challenge, but since the team was supposed to be banned from working in NWA Wildside they were forced to return the championship to Blackout a week later. The duo also had a long running storyline with The Kohl Twins. At the 2001 Freedom Fight, Total Destruction challenged the Kohl Twins for the Wildside Tag Team titles, with Riddle also putting his hair on the line. Royal and Riddle lost and Riddle was shaved bald as a result. On August 8, 2001 Total Destruction defeated the NWA World Tag Team Champions The New Heavenly Bodies (Chris Nelson and Vito DeNucci) by disqualification and thus did not win the championship.

A week later, The New Yorker reported the words of Pakistani politician Imran Khan: \\"This is what the U.S. is doing—desecrating the Koran.\\" This incident caused upset in parts of the Muslim world. The Newsweek article, parts of which were subsequently retracted, alleged that government sources had confirmed that United States personnel at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had deliberately damaged a copy of the book by flushing it in a toilet in order to torment the prison's Muslim captives. The Newsweek article stated that an official had seen a preliminary copy of an unreleased U.S. government report confirming the deliberate damage. Later on, the magazine retracted this when the (still) unnamed official changed his story. A Pentagon investigation uncovered at least five cases of Quran mishandling by U.S. personnel at the base, but insisted that none of these were acts of desecration. The Pentagon's report also accused a prisoner of damaging a copy of the Quran by putting it in a toilet. In 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union, suing under the Freedom of Information Act, secured the release of a 2002 FBI report containing a detainee's accusation of ill-treatment, including throwing a Quran into a toilet. This specific accusation had been made on several occasions by other Guantanamo detainees since 2002; Newsweek's initial account of a government report confirming it sparked protests throughout the Islamic world and riots in Afghanistan, where pre-planned demonstrations turned deadly. A worldwide controversy followed. The Newsweek affair turned the spotlight on earlier media reports of such incidents. Accusations of Quran desecration as a part of U.S. interrogations at prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as Guantánamo Bay had been made by a number of sources going back to 2002. History There were over a dozen pre-Newsweek reports in the mainstream media alleging U.S. Quran abuse, including the following: * Several times in 2002 and in early 2003, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported complaints by detainees at Guantanamo Bay prison of desecration of the Quran by U.S. guards in Guantanamo. * In 2003, an Afghan former prisoner told The Washington Post that U.S. soldiers tormented him by throwing the Quran in the toilet. * The BBC reported on December 30, 2004, that the former Guantánamo prisoner Abdallah Tabarak maintained that \\"American soldiers used to tear up copies of the Quran and throw them in the toilet.\\" * In a book review dated January 16, 2005, the Hartford Courant reported that five British detainees, after their release, claimed that they \\"had seen other prisoners sexually humiliated, had been hooded, and were forced to watch copies of the Koran being flushed down toilets.\\" * The Philadelphia Inquirer reported on January 20, 2005, that there were complaints concerning guards who had \\"defaced their copies of the Koran and, in one case, had thrown it in a toilet.\\" * The Miami Herald reported on March 6, 2005, that three Guantánamo captives — Fawzi al Odah, 27, Fouad al Rabiah, 45, and Khalid al Mutairi, 29 — \\"separately complained to their lawyer that military police threw their Quran into the toilet.\\" * The Miami Herald also reported on March 9, 2005, that Guantánamo Base staff insulted Allah and \\"threw Qurans into toilets\\".  The Newsweek report  On April 30, 2005, Newsweek magazine published an article claiming that an unnamed United States official had seen a government report supporting a \\"previously unreported\\" charge. Among the previously unreported cases that sources reportedly told Newsweek: interrogators, in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a Quran down a toilet and led a detainee around with a collar and dog leash.John Barry and Michael Isikoff, Gitmo: SouthCom Showdown , Newsweek, May 9, 2005 The prospect that U.S. personnel may have deliberately defaced the Quran provoked massive anti-U.S. demonstrations throughout the Islamic world, with at least 17 deaths during riots in Afghanistan. The Newsweek article, by reporter Michael Isikoff, was one of over a dozen such reports of similar incidents that had surfaced in prior months in the U.S. and UK media, but the first involving a U.S. government source acknowledging an inquiry into the event. The Isikoff article was later retracted by Newsweek, which nonetheless defended both its reporter and the story, stating \\"neither we nor the Pentagon had any idea it would lead to deadly riots.\\" The case turned the spotlight on other reports of desecration of the Quran at Guantánamo. The article went largely unnoticed for five days. On May 6, Pakistani politician, Imran Khan, held a press conference. Khan criticized his country's government, saying, \\"This war on terrorism is self-defeating if, on the one hand, you [Musharraf] are demanding that we help them and on the other hand, they are desecrating the book on which our entire faith is based.\\" Khan's press conference was rebroadcast throughout the Muslim world. The Newsweek report cited an anonymous source, said to be a senior government official, who claimed to have seen a confidential investigative report documenting the alleged incident — in which interrogators, \\"in an attempt to rattle suspects, reportedly flushed a Quran down a toilet.\\" However, on May 16, Newsweek retracted the statement that the abuse had been uncovered by an \\"internal military investigation.\\" after the source of the story was later unable to confirm where he had seen the information. In its May 23 issue, Newsweek stated that The New York Times quoted Isikoff as saying: International reaction  On May 10 and continuing the following week, many anti-American protests took place. In Afghanistan, demonstrations that began in the eastern provinces and spread to Kabul were reported to have caused at least seventeen deaths. The United Nations, as a precautionary measure, withdrew all its foreign staff from Jalalabad, where two of its guest houses were attacked, government buildings and shops were targeted, and the offices of two international aid groups were destroyed. Demonstrations also took place in Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, Pakistan and Indonesia, leading to the death of at least 15 people. White House press secretary Scott McClellan said, \\"The report had real consequences, people have lost their lives. Our image abroad has been damaged.\\" However, in a press release issued by the United States Department of State on May 12, General Richard B. Myers claimed that the Newsweek story was not a chief cause of the riots: \\"He has been told that the Jalalabad, Afghanistan, rioting was related more to the ongoing political reconciliation process in Afghanistan than anything else.\\" On May 27, thousands of demonstrators gathered in what The New York Times referred to as \\"waves of protest\\" in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the Middle East, \\"mostly centered on Friday prayer gatherings\\". The New York Times reported that U.S. flags were burned at some demonstrations, and that, although most of the protests were peaceful, overt calls for an \\"Islamic revolution\\" were loudly supported by the crowds in Pakistan, further complicating a difficult political situation for General Musharraf. A Red Cross spokesperson Simon Schorno confirmed that U.S. personnel at Camp X-ray had displayed \\"disrespect\\" to the Quran, and that U.S. officials knew of this activity. Delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross informed U.S. authorities, who took action to stop the alleged abuse, said Schorno. He declined to specify the nature of the incidents. The cousin of Shehzad Tanweer, who participated in the 7 July 2005 London bombing, claimed that Tanweer's ideology was reinforced by allegations of Quran abuse, \\"incidents like desecration of the Koran\\" had \\"always been in his mind.\\" Other news reports * The New York Times reported on May 1, 2005 that \\"[Mr. al-Mutairi] said ... a protest of guards' handling of copies of the Quran, which had been tossed into a pile and stepped on, a senior officer delivered an apology over the camp's loudspeaker system, pledging that such abuses would stop.\\" * Former Guantánamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg gave an interview in 2005 in which he claimed to have witnessed \\"incidents that provoked fury, including the placing of Qurans in an area used as a latrine.\\" US military findings On June 3, 2005, a U.S. military investigation by the base commander, Brigadier General Jay Hood, reported four (possibly five) incidents of \\"mishandling\\" of the Quran by U.S. personnel at Guantánamo Bay. Hood said his investigation \\"revealed a consistent, documented policy of respectful handling of the Quran dating back almost two and a half years.\\" CBC News reported: According to the Hood report: * a soldier intentionally kicked a Quran; * an interrogator intentionally stepped on a Quran; * a guard's urine came through an air vent, unintentionally splashing a detainee and his Quran; * water balloons thrown by prison guards at one another unintentionally caused a number of Qurans to get wet; and * a two-word obscenity was written in English on the inside cover of a Quran (whether US personnel were responsible for this act, however, could not be confirmed). The report laid out the circumstances of these incidents and disciplinary actions taken. It also stressed that such mishandling was rare, and that guards were usually respectful of the Quran, following strict regulations the military laid down for handling the Quran. (The Quran handling policy was codified in a policy letter in January 2003 in response to reports by the Red Cross of Quran abuse. ) The Hood report also listed 15 reported incidents of detainees mishandling their own copies of the Quran, including complaints made by other detainees. One of these cases involved a prisoner \\"attempting to flush a Quran down the toilet and urinating on the Quran.\\" The statement did not provide any explanation about why the detainees might have abused their own holy books. FBI documents and other reports The Newsweek article and the ensuing controversy turned the spotlight on other reports of Qu'ran desecration and spurred additional investigations by others. After a verdict by a federal court on May 25, 2005, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained documents from the FBI interrogations of Guantánamo Bay detainees dating back to August 2002. The documents stated that some detainees had claimed to have witnessed Quran desecration (including \\"flush[ing] a Quran in the toilet\\"), among other acts, on many occasions by their guards — in a document dated August 1, 2002. The pertinent excerpt reads as follows: The ruling of the court forcing the release of this and other documents came under the Freedom of Information Act.News - AlertNet The ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, in a news release, that \\"The United States government continues to turn a blind eye to mounting evidence of widespread abuse of detainees held in its custody.\\" The FBI declared that it could not investigate the matter, as it was up to the Defense Department to do so. For its part, the Pentagon, through its spokesman Lawrence Di Rita, appeared to have transitioned from flat denials to vagueness and unsettled syntax: \\"There have been instances, and we'll have more to say about it as we learn more, but where a Quran may have fallen to the floor in the course of searching a cell.\\" Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters that \\"past accusations have had credibility issues.\\" James Jaffer, an attorney working for the ACLU, was quoted by the New York Times as stating that errors in the Newsweek story had been used to discredit other investigative efforts conducted by his organization and other groups \\"that were not based on anonymous sources, but [on] government documents, reports written by FBI agents.\\" Many questioned the veracity of such accounts, noting that the FBI, in 2004, had released a captured Al-Qaeda training manualcaptured Al-Qaeda training manual which Bush Presidency spokesmen claimed shows that Al-Qaeda members are trained to make false accusations once captured. The SERE connection Several reports have alleged a connection between events at Guantanamo Bay and a Department of Defense program \\"Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape\\" (SERE). On May 16, 2005, Juan Cole published an email from a former SERE attendee who reported abuse of the Christian holy book in training. The emailer had no direct knowledge of operations at Guantanamo, but noted that this tactic sounded similar to that alleged in the Newsweek story. In July 2005, an article in The New Yorker magazine suggested that the SERE program involved a number of techniques which paralleled those allegedly used at Guantánamo Bay, including the desecration of religious texts. The writer contacted Juan Cole's anonymous source who said that in 1999 he attended a Navy SERE program in California. :So the Bible trashing happened when this guy had us all in the courtyard sitting for one of his speeches. They were tempting us with a big pot of soup that was boiling - we were all starving from a few days of chow deprivation. He brought out the Bible and started going off on it verbally - how it was worthless, we were forsaken by God, etc. Then he threw it on the ground and kicked it around. It was definitely the climax of his speech. Then he kicked over the soup pot and threw us back in the cells. The SERE program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for \\"behavioral science consultants\\" who helped to devise Guantánamo's interrogation strategy—although Banks has emphatically denied that he advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees. However, General James T. Hill, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, confirmed that a team from Guantanamo went \\"up to our SERE school and developed a list of techniques\\" for \\"high-profile, high-value\\" detainees.

The storyline began shortly after the WWF's acquisitions of WCW and ECW in March and April 2001, respectively, and concluded with a \\"winner takes all\\" match between The Alliance and the WWF at Survivor Series. The idea of a supercard featuring the two top promotions of the Monday Night Wars was considered to be a dream match scenario in the eyes of many fans, as it would allow the fans to see which promotion would be superior in storyline. The angle began when Mr. McMahon's son, Shane McMahon, announced as part of the storyline on WWF's Raw Is War and the final episode of WCW's Nitro (which merged into a simulcast) that he had bought WCW from under his father's nose. This led to several run-in appearances of WCW wrestlers during Raw Is War and SmackDown! over the months after WrestleMania X-Seven. In June 2001, the angle grew in intensity as the WWF storylines somewhat abated to make room for the central Invasion storyline. WCW and ECW merged to form The Alliance and challenged the WWF's control over the wrestling industry. An Inaugural Brawl took place at the WWF Invasion pay-per- view, where Stone Cold Steve Austin defected and joined The Alliance. Many inter-promotional matches occurred after the Invasion between The Alliance and the WWF, leading up to the climax of the angle at Survivor Series, when Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, Big Show, The Undertaker and Kane) defeated Team Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T and Shane McMahon) in a Winner Take All elimination tag team match.  History  = Monday Night Wars = Vince McMahon and the WWF acquired the rights to WCW in March 2001 During the Monday Night Wars, the WWF and WCW, the two top North American wrestling promotions, competed for ratings. Through developments such as the creation of the New World Order (nWo) and the Montreal Screwjob, fans continually compared the two promotions, and the Internet wrestling community was full of debate as to which of the two was superior. Among other factors, however, mismanagement within WCW (such as allowing wrestlers themselves to book matches and various instances of corporate politics) eventually led WCW to a downward spiral from which it never recovered. The Monday Night Wars came to an end on March 23, 2001, when the WWF bought the rights to WCW's video library, trademarks, 24 contracts for selected wrestlers, championships, and other properties (talent names, images, likenesses, slogans, rings, and belts) for what was considered to be a lower bargain price. The final night of the Monday Night Wars occurred on March 26, 2001: Raw Is War primarily focused on the major storylines heading into WrestleMania X-Seven, while Nitro held their final episode with a \\"Night of Champions\\". Mr. McMahon opened up Nitro and announced a simulcast later that night to address the future of WCW. Throughout Raw Is War, McMahon publicly named several WCW wrestlers who would not be retained. Though most would wrestle for the WWE in the ensuing years, he did legitimately fire Jeff Jarrett on TV due to animosity between the two dating back in 1999, when Jarrett blackmailed McMahon for payment when Jarrett was booked for a match at No Mercy when his contract expired the day before. After Sting defeated Ric Flair in WCW's final match, the simulcast began. McMahon talked about the buyout of WCW and toyed with the idea of making WCW into a huge media conglomerate, much like the WWF. He asked the crowd who he should keep under his belt by mentioning names of WCW wrestlers and asking for a reaction. Lex Luger received a negative reaction from fans, and Hulk Hogan, Buff Bagwell, Booker T, Scott Steiner, Sting, and Goldberg received positive reactions. Vince then proceeded to fire them all, however, to the cheers of the Raw Is War crowd and the jeers of the Nitro crowd. McMahon then announced that he would sign the contract and make the purchase official at WrestleMania, on the condition that Ted Turner brings the contract for McMahon to sign personally. Shane McMahon, however, appeared on Nitro and announced in kayfabe that he had signed the contract and purchased WCW out from under his father's nose, planting the seed for what was considered a lucrative future storyline opportunity. The Invasion did not begin immediately afterwards, as the WWF was preparing for WrestleMania X-Seven, the year's largest show, which was mere days away. = Invasion = Shane McMahon owned WCW throughout the Invasion storyline The WWF had effectively doubled the size of its roster through its acquisition of WCW, and as a result, there was not enough screen time for everyone. The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity. Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when no TV station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money. The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension, effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions, each with one of the WWF's two existing televised shows, Raw and SmackDown!. As part of its plans, Lance Storm became the first WCW wrestler to appear on WWF programming, by performing a run-in during a match on the May 28 episode of Raw Is War. Hugh Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4 episode of Raw Is War by attacking Edge. At King of the Ring on June 24, then-WCW wrestler Booker T interfered during the triple threat main event match for the WWF Championship and almost cost Stone Cold Steve Austin the title. Additionally, Austin legitimately suffered fractured bones in his hand from the side slam he took from Booker T into an announce table. The next night on Raw Is War, which was held in New York City's Madison Square Garden, a confrontation occurred between WCW owner Shane McMahon and WWF owner Vince McMahon. While Vince was in the ring, Booker T came from behind to deliver a scissor kick to Vince. The WWF roster ran to the ring to aid Vince, but Booker T and Shane McMahon escaped through the crowd. This incident marked the official start of the Invasion storyline; Raw Is War commentator Jim Ross announced, \\"The battle lines have been drawn!\\" WCW Tag Team Champions Chuck Palumbo and Sean O'Haire then made their WWF debuts on June 28, 2001, by invading SmackDown! and attacking the Hardy Boyz and Dudley Boyz during a tag team match, before fleeing after WWF wrestlers came after them in the ring. As they were exiting the arena, they were attacked from behind by other WWF wrestlers led by Hardcore Holly and the APA, preventing what happened with the previous WCW wrestlers running to the arena exits undisturbed and rushing them back into the ring, where they were beaten up by WWF wrestlers. The WWF eventually began to recognize WCW and tested the idea of a brand extension by giving WCW the final twenty minutes of Raw Is War, with Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson as the announcers in place of Jim Ross and Paul Heyman. During a match between Buff Bagwell and Booker T for the WCW Championship, WWF wrestlers Kurt Angle and then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered in retaliation by beating Booker T up, with Bagwell joining Angle and Austin by attacking Booker T. This match was poorly received by the audience in attendance at the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington; sports journalist Michael Landsberg reported that many have called the bout \\"the worst match ever\\". One source cited that the match should have showcased the best of WCW, but instead featured too many restholds and not enough action. The audience jeered the wrestlers with chants of \\"This match sucks!\\" and \\"Boring!\\" A WWF source close to Vince McMahon said that he \\"absolutely hated\\" the segment. In a podcast interview with Stone Cold Steve Austin in 2015, Bagwell expressed his suspicions of the WWF's true plans for the WCW product, stating his confusion as to why his match with Booker T took place in Tacoma, Washington (very much a pro-WWF area) instead of on the following week's RAW show at the Philips Arena in Atlanta (the former headquarters city of WCW), where the match likely would have received a more positive fan reception.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LDQcaOAq-o Up until this point, the WCW contingent were being built up to being malcontent faces rising up against the heel Vince McMahon, because of Vince's bluster during the final Nitro broadcast and Shane's usurping of the WCW ownership. Originally, WCW talents were meant to attack strictly heel WWF wrestlers. The strongly negative reaction of the core WWF viewership to the WCW product and talent, however, coupled with the reality that a WCW wrestling program tailored to appeal to WWF fans would not come to fruition, led to the entire WCW contingent being abruptly turned heel. One example was the heel gimmick of then WCW Alliance member Diamond Dallas Page, whose first WWF appearance was built up over several weeks in a storyline in which he was portrayed as an anonymous stalker sending invasive videotapes to then-babyface, The Undertaker. = Addition of ECW = Stephanie McMahon became the storyline owner of ECW and she joined with her brother to form The Alliance On the July 9 episode of Raw Is War, Kane was scheduled to face Mike Awesome and Lance Storm in a handicap match. Chris Jericho came out and offered to be Kane's partner, thus turning it into a tag team match. Near the end of the match, Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Lance Storm. As the move was being applied, however, Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho. In response, WWF wrestlers consisting of The Dudley Boyz, Tazz, Justin Credible, Rhyno, and Raven (all former ECW wrestlers) ran to the ring. After a brief stand-off, the WWF cavalry turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho. This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring. After high-fiving the wrestlers, he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion. Heyman talked about how tired he was sitting beside Jim Ross and discussing WCW vs. WWF, stating that he felt that everyone had forgotten about ECW and announced, \\"This Invasion just got taken to the extreme!\\". Later during the night, Shane and Vince McMahon bumped into each other backstage. Shane told his father that ECW needed to be taken care of and pointed out that there were ten ECW wrestlers under Heyman's belt. He suggested that WWF and WCW field five wrestlers each to take out ECW; Vince agreed, but he stubbornly insisted that WCW would eventually meet its demise when all was said and done. At the end of the night, the WCW wrestlers came into the ring, accompanied by Shane McMahon. The WWF wrestlers then came into the ring and, before ECW entered, the WCW and WWF wrestlers started to brawl. The WWF wrestlers cleared the ring, but then were stormed by the ECW wrestlers and taken out. The WCW wrestlers came into the ring, high-fived the ECW men and then dismantled the WWF wrestlers as Paul Heyman and Shane McMahon hugged in triumph. Upon seeing a stunned Vince McMahon asking what was going on, Shane admitted being responsible for all the events that just transpired and announced that ECW and WCW merged to form The Alliance – with Stephanie McMahon as ECW's new owner. = Stone Cold Steve Austin's departure and return = Stone Cold Steve Austin Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had turned heel at WrestleMania and formed an alliance with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed from the threat of The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince a cowboy hat as a present. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Austin played \\"Kumbaya\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\" for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him hugs and gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the \\"old\\" Stone Cold who was a \\"beer-swilling, foul- mouthed SOB\\" and the \\"old\\" Stone Cold that \\"didn't take shit from anyone\\". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, \\"If you want Stone Cold to beat the living hell out of Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!\\" to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, shook his head and proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed. On the July 16 episode of Raw, Austin was shown drinking and playing pool at a bar downtown. During the night, Vince McMahon held a WWF meeting backstage. Undertaker and the APA gave a motivational speech on how they should not tolerate the Alliance any longer. After they were finished, Brooklyn Brawler wheeled Freddie Blassie into the room so he could address the wrestlers and pump them up for the night. As the WWF wrestlers united, Austin could be seen watching the events on the television at the bar. He proceeded to slam his cue stick on the pool table and left. Later that night, DDP and Rhyno faced Kane and the Undertaker. During the match, there was interference from the Alliance. In response, The Hardy Boyz, the APA, Jericho, and Kurt Angle came to help their WWF allies, but more Alliance members came in and overwhelmed the WWF wrestlers. Backstage, many WWF and Alliance wrestlers were fighting each other, and the WWF seemed to be on the losing end of things. A truck was seen driving up to the arena, however, and Austin came out with his cue stick and proceeded to beat down any WCW and ECW wrestlers in his path. He then came to the ring, trash-talking on the way down, and beat down the Alliance wrestlers, giving Stunners to most of the men in the ring. The WWF wrestlers had cleaned house and were standing tall. The WWF seemed to be in good shape for the upcoming pay-per-view with Austin's return. = InVasion = At InVasion, the Inaugural Brawl took place between Team WCW/ECW and Team WWF. Team WWF consisted of Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Kane, and the Undertaker, who all squared off against the team of DDP, Booker T, Rhyno, and the Dudley Boys. Near the end of the match, all of the wrestlers were outside of the ring except Booker T and Angle. Kurt Angle applied the ankle lock on Booker T, who tapped out, but no referee was there to witness it. Austin then dragged a referee into the ring, but in a swerve, kicked Kurt Angle in the head, hit him with a Stunner, and placed Booker T on top of Kurt Angle and told the referee to count. Team WCW/ECW won the match due to Austin's betrayal of the WWF. The next night, Austin claimed he joined the Alliance because they appreciated him. He cited Vince's hugging of Angle and calling The Rock on the phone as signs that Vince did not appreciate Austin and accused McMahon of grooming Angle to be the next WWF Champion. = WWF gains momentum = Booker T lost his WCW Championship to WWF wrestlers Kurt Angle and The Rock throughout the summer On the July 26 episode of SmackDown!, Shane McMahon extended an invitation to The Rock, who had not been seen since the Raw Is War following WrestleMania X-Seven, to join the Alliance. Also that night, Kurt Angle challenged Booker T to a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match, which Booker T accepted. The WWF gained momentum when Angle made Booker T submit with an ankle lock, taking the WCW Championship away from the Alliance. Angle's title run proved to be short-lived, as Booker T won it back on the July 30 episode of Raw. On that same Raw Is War at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, The Rock returned for the first time since his kayfabe suspension (in reality, he was given the \\"suspension\\" to take time off to film The Scorpion King) on the April 2 episode of Raw Is War. Shane, Stephanie, and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, trying to convince The Rock to join them. Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier in the year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him. He promised The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also noted that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, then he just might do it. He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to stare down Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn – but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, \\"Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF,\\" thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation. His return led to a WCW Championship match between The Rock and Booker T at SummerSlam, which The Rock won, marking the second time the WCW Championship belt changed sides to the WWF. At that same pay-per-view, Austin retained his WWF Championship against Angle after Angle won by disqualification. The following Raw Is War and SmackDown! showings featured primarily interpromotional matches between the two companies. Austin stole Kurt Angle's medals during one of the shows, and on the August 30 episode of SmackDown!, tied them to a cinder block and threw them in a river. On the following September 3 episode of Raw Is War, Debra and Stephanie bought a new truck for Austin, but Angle came up from behind and nailed Austin in the back of the head with a pipe. He put a cinder block and rope in the truck, put Austin in it, and drove away on the truck. He blindfolded Austin and threatened to throw him into a river if he did not get a title shot. Austin, fearful for his life, \\"broke down in tears\\" and agreed to give Angle a title shot at the upcoming pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Angle said, however, that Austin was \\"still going into the water\\", but instead simply embarrassed Austin by throwing him into a kiddie pool. The WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven, as The Rock retained the WCW Championship in a handicap match against Booker T and Shane McMahon, and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock, winning the WWF Championship from Austin, putting both belts into the hands of the WWF. Diamond Dallas Page's feud with The Undertaker culminated in a loss against him in a tag team match at SummerSlam Almost every other championship had changed hands during this period of time, being exchanged between WWF Superstars and Alliance members. For example, The Undertaker and Kane beat Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon in a steel cage match at Summerslam to become co-holders of both the WWF and WCW Tag Team titles. Also, X-Pac beat Billy Kidman to become double champion of WWF Light Heavyweight Champion as well as WCW Cruiserweight Champion. = Chris Jericho and The Rock feuds as The Alliance mounts a comeback = The Rock There were several interpromotional matches after Unforgiven. Furthermore, a crucial plot point formed when, on the October 8 airing of Raw, Jericho and The Rock teamed up against Shane McMahon and Rob Van Dam. During the match, Jericho mistakenly struck The Rock with a steel chair, costing them the match. The Rock confronted Jericho backstage after the match, leading to a brawl between the two. The two of them began a feud, although they often tagged together, had similar gimmicks of hurling comedic insults at Stephanie McMahon, and at one point won the WWF Tag Team Championship. Also that night, Steve Austin and Kurt Angle faced off for the WWF Championship, and then-WWF Commissioner William Regal, who sat at ringside to ensure a fair match would take place, hit Kurt Angle with the belt, thereby backstabbing the WWF and costing Angle the title. On the following October 11 episode of SmackDown!, Linda McMahon promptly fired Regal from his position as WWF Commissioner, and named Mick Foley as his replacement. Regal was then declared the Commissioner of the Alliance by Shane and Stephanie. The feud between Jericho and The Rock built up to a match at No Mercy on October 21, where Jericho beat the Rock to win the WCW Championship (Jericho's first world title), and Steve Austin defeated Angle and Rob Van Dam to retain his WWF Championship. On the October 29 episode of Raw, Shane McMahon told his father, Vince McMahon, that a member of the WWF would jump ship to the Alliance that night. Later that same night, Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho, The Rock, Undertaker, and Kane with steel chairs. On the following episode of SmackDown! on November 1, Angle, who originally led the WWF wrestlers, explained that he represented what is great about America—he was a winner, and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side. That side included Steve Austin, a man Angle claimed knew how to win. = End of the invasion = swerve, Kurt Angle joined The Alliance, only to defect back to Team WWF at Survivor Series On the November 5 airing of Raw, Vince McMahon countered Kurt Angle's defection by stating that a member of Team Alliance would defect during a match at the upcoming Survivor Series. Steve Austin came out to confront Vince about it, and Vince stated that Austin would be the one to defect. Because of this announcement, many Alliance members began to distrust Austin, who vehemently denied the charges and called Vince a liar. Stone Cold went on to interrogate members of Team Alliance, questioning Booker T and sitting Rob Van Dam down in a room with a light shining on him. That same night The Rock won the WCW World Title from Chris Jericho, but Jericho assaulted The Rock in the ring following the match.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/raw01.htm All of this led to a Winner Take All match at Survivor Series 2001, which pitted Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and The Big Show) against Team Alliance (Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon). The final three men in the match were The Rock and Jericho vs. Austin. Jericho was eliminated and, to continue the feud between the two men, attacked The Rock with a Breakdown, even though Jericho's future was on the line if The Rock lost. The Rock and Austin continued to battle it out, each stealing and reversing their signature maneuvers and the referee was knocked down in the match. Austin Stone Cold Stunnered the Rock and pinned him, but there was no referee to count it. Austin approached the downed referee to try to revive him. As this was occurring, Angle ran to the ring, picked up the WWF championship belt, and nailed Austin with it, revealing himself to be the defector to which McMahon was referring to the entire time. The Rock got up to his feet and followed this with a Rock Bottom and a pin on Austin, to which the referee woke up and groggily counted the three count. Team WWF prevailed, thus ending the storyline. It was also on this night that several titles were unified; Edge defeated Test to unify the WCW United States Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, while The Dudley Boyz beat The Hardy Boyz in a Steel Cage match to unify the WCW Tag Team Titles with the WWF Tag Team Titles. The final ECW member, Jazz, made her debut during a Six Pack Challenge for the vacant Women's Championship, which was won by Trish Stratus.  Aftermath  The WCW World Heavyweight Championship was later unified with the WWF Championship to form the Undisputed WWF Championship, which Triple H won at WrestleMania X8 in March 2002 after defeating Chris Jericho. = WCW = After The Alliance was disbanded, the WWF was faced with a title crisis; that is, they had too many championships (due to them acquiring all of WCW's championships), and each individual title became devalued. To combat this, the WWF began to unify many championships. Survivor Series 2001 saw two title unification matches: WCW United States Champion Edge defeated Test to become the WWF Intercontinental Champion, retiring the US title, while WCW World Tag Team Champions The Dudley Boyz defeated The Hardy Boyz to win the WWF Tag Team Championships, retiring the WCW tag titles. The following month at Vengeance, the WCW Championship (simply renamed the World Championship after Survivor Series) was unified with the WWF Championship in which Chris Jericho became the champion by defeating both The Rock and Steve Austin in a three-match tournament to form the Undisputed WWF Championship, which continued the lineage of the WWF Championship, while the former World Championship was retired. Another WCW championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, was rebranded as a WWF title (and later, WWE) and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. The Undisputed Championship was originally represented by both the original WWF and WCW title belts, and the champion would carry both belts around until replaced with a single belt the following year on the April 1 edition of Raw. At the beginning of the WWE brand extension, the Undisputed Champion would appear on both Raw and SmackDown! until then-champion Brock Lesnar signed an exclusive deal with SmackDown! after his victory over The Rock at SummerSlam 2002, thus making the championship exclusive to the brand. In response, then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff introduced the World Heavyweight Championship, represented by the former WCW/World Championship belt, and awarded it to Triple H, who was the number one contender for the Undisputed title. The Undisputed Championship would be renamed the WWE Championship, as it was no longer undisputed as there were two world championships in the promotion. On the June 19 2003 edition of SmackDown!, the United States Championship was revived as a SmackDown!-exclusive title, thus becoming the WWE United States Championship (and counterpart to Raw's Intercontinental title)—it is the only active title currently in the WWE to not have originated in the promotion. Although the WWF acquired all of WCW's championships, several were never used following the purchase of WCW, such as the WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship and the WCW World Television Championship, which was quietly retired a year before WCW went out of business. Jim Ross made a passing mention of the WCW Hardcore Championship at WWF Invasion when mentioning all the titles Lance Storm had held in WCW, but the title never appeared during the storyline. = ECW = Although Tazz briefly appeared on WWF television with the ECW Championship in 2000 (while under contract with the WWF) after reigning ECW Champion Mike Awesome unexpectedly signed with WCW, none of ECW's titles were shown on WWF television during the Invasion angle due to ECW's assets being held up in bankruptcy court; the WWE eventually purchased ECW's assets in 2003. Although the WCW brand effectively died once and for all following the end of the Invasion storyline, ECW was temporarily revived by WWE in 2005 for the purposes of a special reunion show, ECW One Night Stand, held on June 12, 2005. The build-up to this one-shot event featured former ECW talent putting over the virtues of the brand versus the WWE product and appearances by several former ECW wrestlers not under contract to WWE. In 2006, it was announced that WWE would be reviving ECW as its third brand (to complement Raw and SmackDown!). The second One Night Stand, held on June 11, 2006, led to the official debut of the new ECW the following Tuesday. Rob Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship for his victory in winning the WWE Championship over John Cena, thus officially reviving the title for the ECW brand, as well as the only wrestler to hold the ECW and WWE titles simultaneously. This was the only ECW title to be reactivated by WWE for the ECW brand. The brand would continue to operate until February 2010, when it was announced by Vince McMahon that ECW would be replaced by a developmental series for new talent entitled WWE NXT, which eventually took the place of FCW (Florida Championship Wrestling), WWE's former developmental territory located in Florida. The ECW Championship was retired along with the closure of the brand. = Fallout after Survivor Series = Longtime WCW star Ric Flair returned to WWF for the first time since 1993 on the Raw after Survivor Series Alliance member Test won a battle royal at Survivor Series that featured both Alliance and WWF wrestlers battling for the right to be immune from termination for a year. Over the next several weeks Test began using that immunity to his advantage, attacking and bullying other wrestlers for no reason and often assaulting referees. Whenever he would be called on it, he would bring up his immunity from being fired. Shortly after Survivor Series, however, this was eventually forgotten. The immunity was also extended to any Alliance member who held a championship at the conclusion of Survivor Series. Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was the WWF Champion, The Dudley Boyz, who held the tag team championships; Rob Van Dam, who was the Hardcore Champion, and Christian, who was European Champion also saw that extended to them. Of these wrestlers, everyone except RVD (who was already cheered by fans despite being in the Alliance) remained a heel after the Alliance. Also receiving immunity was Stacy Keibler the manager of the Dudleys, and Tazz who was a commentator on SmackDown! and had been kicked out of the Alliance several weeks prior. On the Raw the night after Survivor Series, WWF Commissioner Mick Foley resigned. Vince McMahon celebrated his (assumed) complete and sole ownership of the WWF and his final victory over the Alliance, going on a power trip the entire night. His power trip included firing the Alliance's Paul Heyman from his broadcasting position and replaced him with a returning Jerry Lawler, who had been absent from the company since February. He later had his daughter escorted from the building by security (with his son, Shane McMahon, leaving the arena on his own accord). Perhaps his most egotistical move during this power trip was making Alliance commissioner William Regal become the inaugural member of the infamous Kiss My Ass Club in order to retain his job. McMahon also announced that he would strip Alliance leader Steve Austin of his WWF Championship and award it to Kurt Angle, who had portrayed himself as the hero of Survivor Series the entire night and bragged about his actions in an egotistical matter to other face wrestlers, to which they all gave him negative reactions. This led to an upset Angle telling McMahon that nobody thanked him and appreciated him for his actions, which then McMahon told Angle that he would award him the WWF Championship. In doing so, McMahon completed a slow heel turn he had begun at the beginning of the night. Before McMahon could announce Angle as his new champion, Ric Flair (who was making his return to the WWF after leaving in January 1993) announced that he \\"bet on a winner\\" at Survivor Series. When pressed, Flair revealed to McMahon that he was not in fact the sole owner of the WWF as he had originally thought. When Shane McMahon and Stephanie McMahon had bought WCW and ECW earlier in the year they had sold their shares in the WWF to \\"a consortium\\", and that Flair was the man who had bought them, making him half-owner of the WWF. Immediately after making the declaration Austin made his return and attacked Angle for costing him the win at Survivor Series against The Rock and also attacked Vince McMahon for attempting to strip him of his title, ending the heel run he had begun at WrestleMania. He turned face by aligning himself with Flair and reclaiming his WWF Championship belt.  Reception  The Invasion angle was a large storyline that spanned for almost half of 2001 and brought about financial success for the WWF, such as the InVasion pay-per-view being one of the highest non-major event buyrates in the history of pay-per-views. However, the Invasion storyline has come under criticism by wrestling fans and wrestling media, with the storyline being called a flop. Other media refer to the storyline as \\"one of the most poorly handled, ego-filled storylines in wrestling history\\". = Weakness of The Alliance = Throughout the storyline, many interpromotional matches had WWF wrestlers winning over WCW/ECW wrestlers, usually cleanly. In contrast, most of the Alliance's wins were controversial due to interference or disqualification. For example, it took Tazz assisting Raven at InVasion to beat William Regal. The Rock, however, won cleanly at SummerSlam, despite Shane McMahon's assistance to Booker T. A few other critics also noticed the overemphasis on Steve Austin. Critics believed that Austin was the only credible superstar in the Alliance. One particular example of this was during the Inaugural Brawl at the InVasion pay-per-view. Besides Austin's turn in the match that was needed to secure a WCW/ECW win over the WWF, SLAM! Wrestling alleged that the Alliance wrestled poorly in comparison to the WWF wrestlers: > Portrayed as disorganized and inferior grapplers, the ECW-WCW Team had more > than its fair share of mistimed moves which hurt their own team members > while the \\"WWF squad\\" of course wrestled like a well-oiled machine.

It has been speculated that the reason for this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while fighting the Alliance, as he worked very hard to put down his competition, especially WCW. Smash Wrestling alleges that WWF wrestlers needed to defect to make the Alliance appear to be a credible threat. = Overemphasis on the McMahons = The Invasion storyline was presented with a backdrop of a McMahon feud. In the storyline, the WWF was owned by Vince McMahon, WCW was owned by Shane McMahon, and ECW was owned by Stephanie McMahon. Although the feud did not center completely around the McMahons, the family feud storyline had been done many times before. In addition to this, the Steve Austin versus Vince McMahon feud was to start again when Vince McMahon hit Austin in the back of the head with a chair at No Mercy. As stated by a SLAM! Wrestling synopsis of No Mercy: > For fans who didn't catch it the fifth, tenth or twentieth time they've run > the angle, \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin and Vince McMahon are about to feud > once again... First up was Vincent McMahon labelling Austin with a steel > chair as he was waiting to put a dazed RVD away... Three minutes later, it > was Shane McMahon's turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel > ring post. Vince tackled Shane over the announce table and the two began > pummeling one another. Back in the ring, Austin laid a \\"Stone Cold\\" Stunner > on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled. Gee, how many times > have we seen that scenario play itself out before? Austin wins. Vince fumes. > Fans snore. Whatever. The storyline also allegedly centered too much on the McMahons, who were getting more airtime than the wrestlers. = Lack of big-name WCW talent, overemphasis on WWF defectors and issues with ECW = The nWo (Kevin Nash, Hollywood Hogan and Scott Hall) did not sign with the WWF until 2002 Many fans had dreamed of a day where they could pit WWF and WCW wrestlers against each other, but the storyline's final match ended with four WWF wrestlers brawling it out. On TSN's Off the Record, host Michael Landsberg asked Booker T why the Invasion – which he stated should have been one of the biggest money angles in wrestling history – was in his words a failure on pay-per-view. Booker responded: > That wasn't the true WCW. I mean, we didn't have guys like Goldberg. We > didn't have Sting. We didn't have Kevin Nash. We didn't have all the major > players in the WCW to face the WWF superstars. WCW mainstay Sting wrestled his first WWE match at WrestleMania 31 in 2015 Some of the WCW wrestlers' absences were out of the WWF's control. Many of WCW's top wrestlers had contracts with AOL Time Warner, WCW's parent company, and were willing to sit at home rather than wrestle for less money; Booker T, the reigning WCW Champion at the time of WWF's purchase, was a notable exception, agreeing to a buyout of the remainder of his contract with AOL Time Warner in order to wrestle for the WWF immediately. McMahon had the option of taking on any contract he wanted with his purchase, but chose to let AOL Time Warner continue to pay out what were considered bad deals. Ric Flair (who would appear on the Raw following Survivor Series) and Rey Mysterio were not signed until the end of the Invasion because they were tied to their contracts, and therefore their absence was out of the WWF's control. In addition, Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury. Others, such as Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Goldberg, were not signed until well after the storyline finished. As for WCW's other top superstars, Sting was still under contract to AOL Time Warner, and did not join the now-WWE until late 2014, while Lex Luger and Randy Savage would never reappear in the company on TV (in May 2011, Luger rejoined WWE in a backstage role related to the company's Wellness Program, while Savage died of a sudden heart attack later the same month). Bret Hart, who made his name in the WWF but was last seen wrestling for WCW, was retired from wrestling due to his concussion he suffered in a match with Goldberg at Starrcade 1999 and estranged from Vince McMahon after the 1997 Montreal Screwjob; he would eventually return to WWE in 2010, having been inducted to the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. Jeff Jarrett, despite his contract being dealt with WCW rather than AOL Time Warner, was another missing name as he was legitimately and publicly fired during the Raw/Nitro finale simulcast owing to disputes between Jarrett and McMahon that was not settled until 2018. Fans were confused by McMahon's decisions seeing as the WWF would make more than enough to cover all these wrestlers contracts in 2001. Because of this, the WWF's opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW. Many ECW Originals did not sign until the ECW brand launched in 2006 In correlation with WCW, ECW was also missing most of their key superstars such as The Sandman, Sabu, Balls Mahoney, Little Guido and Tony Mamaluke (all of whom would later join WWE's relaunched ECW). Other wrestlers such as Shane Douglas, Masato Tanaka, Terry Funk, New Jack, 2 Cold Scorpio and Mikey Whipwreck would also be missing from the storyline. During that period, the usage of the ECW name on-air was subjected to dispute despite Heyman still technically owning the company while the WWF faced legal action by Harry Slash & The Slashtones for the use of its theme song \\"This Is Extreme!\\". The WWF itself would be missing some of its biggest stars, most notably Triple H, who tore his left quadriceps muscle on the May 21 episode of Raw Is War, weeks before the start of the storyline and wouldn't return until the following year on the January 7 episode of Raw, however he didn't compete as an in-ring competitor until the January 17 episode of SmackDown! in a tag team match and would also go on to win the main event a few days later at Royal Rumble 2002, well after the Invasion angle ended. Shawn Michaels, who was under a four-year retirement at the time, was on hiatus from WWF and also didn't appear during the Invasion storyline. Rikishi was inactive throughout the entire storyline with an injured shoulder, and didn't return to the WWF until December 2001. Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit who were former WCW/ECW stars, working for WWF at the time, were also absent from the storyline. Benoit was hinted to defect to WCW before his injury in June 2001 at King of the Ring. Guerrero was also hinted to defect to WCW but was sent to rehabilitation after an addiction with painkillers in May 2001 before being released that November. Both Guerrero and Benoit would not return to the company until April and July 2002 respectively. Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn, who were Benoit and Guerrero's former stablemates from The Radicalz were also absent from the storyline as well, with Malenko officially retiring from professional wrestling in July 2001 while Saturn was involved in a shoot incident during a Jakked/Metal taping and was minimally involved in the storyline; whenever Saturn appeared on match cards during the storyline, it is indicated that he is aligned with the WWF side. To bolster the ranks of WCW (in lieu of big WCW names), some WWF wrestlers (such as Steve Austin) defected and joined the Alliance and were pushed as the leaders of the Alliance. Austin, who had worked in WCW and ECW but had found his greatest success in the WWF and was seen primarily as a WWF wrestler, was pushed as the leader of the Alliance and a more important player during the Invasion than the bona fide WCW or ECW members of the Alliance. Several top WCW and ECW talents who were top superstars in their previous companies, such as Diamond Dallas Page, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, The Dudley Boyz, Justin Credible, Raven and Tazz, were put down into low-mid card matches, while lesser-ranked WWF wrestlers who defected to the Alliance, such as Test, were given a greater push. Sting would cite this as the reason he would never sign with the WWF (until 2014) despite being offered a contract. In the final Survivor Series main event between the WWF and the Alliance, the Alliance was represented by five wrestlers. Three of these were WWF wrestlers who had defected. Shane McMahon and Kurt Angle had never wrestled a match for WCW or ECW prior to the Invasion. Only three wrestlers who had worked in WCW or ECW, Austin, Booker T and Rob Van Dam, were on the team. McMahon, Booker T and Rob Van Dam were the first three wrestlers eliminated on the Alliance's team, resulting in the last survivors representing the ostensible WCW/ECW entity being two wrestlers who were already in the WWF before the Invasion.

They are humus-rich shallow soils that are usually formed from carbonate- or occasionally sulfate-rich parent material. Rendzina soils are often found in karst and mountainous regions. The term rendzina originated via Russian from the Polish rędzina, of unknown origin.https://books.google.com/books?id=627Qopsj7bsC&pg;=PA1482&lpg;=PA1482&dq;=rendzina+russian&source;=bl&ots;=RXa6wIetgM&sig;=D_E_Hmba9Zb3mTw3MreR9rwEUlY&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjwnbWfi97YAhUQ9mMKHQO5DHMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q;=rendzina%20russian&f;=false Encyclopedia of Soil Sciencehttps://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=rendzina American Heritage Dictionaryhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rendzina Merriam-Webster In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, rendzina soils would be classified as leptosols, chernozems, kastanozems, or phaeozems, depending on their specific characteristics. Development and distribution Rendzina soils typically develop from solid or unconsolidated rocky material that is carbonate- or sulphate-rich. Limestone is by far the most common, but others include dolomite, gypsum, marble, chalk and marlstone. Alongside physical weathering, which breaks down the structure of rocky material, chemical weathering, in particular the dissolution of carbonate, contributes to rendzina development. When water with dissolved carbon dioxide comes into contact with carbonate minerals, the carbonate is dissolved and leaches out with the water. The overall reaction is as follows: CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(aq) → 2 HCO3−(aq) + Ca2+(aq) Loss of soluble minerals leaves the upper part of the soil enriched in insoluble materials, particularly clay minerals. At the same time, biological activity leads to an accumulation of humus in the surface soil, which is protected from further decomposition by the clay. The upper soil horizon of a rendzina therefore contains considerable amounts of humus. It can also be relatively carbonate- or gypsum-rich, although at levels much lower than in the rocky parent material. Progressive breakdown of the parent material and loss of carbonate or gypsum will ultimately convert a rendzina into another soil type. Since these processes occur relatively fast in comparison to weathering of most carbonate- and gypsum-free materials, rendzinas represent a transitory stage in soil development. However, they can persist over the long term if soil loss by erosion counteracts the soil development process. Typical areas for rendzina soils are in karst and mountain landscapes, where carbonate-rich material occurs on slopes. They are common in scarpland, wherever limestone is exposed. The rendzinas in Wales, for example constitute a simple A-C profile, a dark calcareous topsoil immediately over shattered limestone. Properties and use The combined effects of clay and humus content produce dark colours and crumb structure. Typical pH for Rendzina soils is between 5 and 8, and base saturation is high. Calcium and magnesium are abundant, but potassium content is often low, so nutrient imbalances are common. Rendzina soils are usually poorly suited to agricultural use. Mechanical tillage is hindered by their shallowness, and the small soil volume limits their capacity to store and supply water. Additionally, these soils often occur on slopes, where the risk of erosion is high. As a result, there is much semi-natural vegetation to be found in these areas.

W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. It is located along the Atlantic Ocean in the northeast United States, on Walker's Point (previously known as Point Vesuvius and home to a Kennebunkport city park called \\"Damon Park\\"). Walker's Point juts out into the ocean in southern Maine, in the town of Kennebunkport, approximately midway between the cities of Portland, Maine, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The property has been a family retreat for more than a century, starting with Bush's maternal grandfather History The estate was purchased in the late 19th century jointly by Bush's great- grandfather David Davis Walker, and his son, St. Louis banker George Herbert \\"Bert\\" Walker. Both built mansions on the point in 1902. D. D. Walker's mansion has since been torn down. In 1921, Dorothy Walker and Prescott Bush were married, and Bert Walker built a \\"bungalow\\" on the Point and gave it to them as a wedding present. When Bert died in 1953, his son, George Herbert Walker Jr. (\\"Herbie\\"), purchased the property from his father's estate. It was not willed to him. Upon the death of Herbie in 1977, the property again went up for sale and was purchased by Herbie's nephew, George H. W. Bush. The estate has since remained in the Bush family. President Bush spent much of his childhood at the Kennebunkport estate. As an adult, Bush, his wife Barbara, and their children George W., Jeb, Marvin, Neil, Dorothy, and Robin spent most summers at the estate. The estate has been a backdrop of family weddings, holidays, and receptions. While at the \\"Summer White House,\\" Bush hosted world leaders including Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev for informal and private meetings. As a young man, Bush relocated to Houston, Texas; eventually the Bushes maintained a working residence in Tanglewood, where they spent most of their time. George H. W. wrote of his memories there to Portland Magazine in 1997 after reading the article \\"Inventing the Campbells.\\" The Campbells were the heirs to the Palm Beach clothing fortune and had a home in the Kennebunks. \\"I really enjoyed that article about the Campbells by Colin Sargent, July/August 1997).

It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment. The property includes a 72,299 square-foot casino along with 3,460 hotel rooms. The architectural theme is reminiscent of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of Miami and South Beach. Staying true to its theme and name, the hotel includes a garden courtyard which serves as a wildlife habitat for flamingos. The hotel was the third resort to open on the Strip and remains the oldest resort on the Strip in operation today, and it has been since 2007 with the closure and demolition of The New Frontier. It is also the last remaining casino on the strip that opened before 1950 that is still in operation. The Flamingo has a Las Vegas Monorail station called the Flamingo & Caesars Palace station at the rear of the property. After opening in 1946, it has undergone a number of ownership changes. History =Land background and hotel design (1945)= The Flamingo site occupies 40 acres originally owned by one of Las Vegas' first settlers, Charles \\"Pops\\" Squires. Squires paid $8.75 an acre for the land. In 1944, Margaret Folsom bought the tract for $7,500 from Squires, and she then later sold it to Billy Wilkerson. Wilkerson was the owner of The Hollywood Reporter as well as some very popular nightclubs in the Sunset Strip: Cafe Trocadero, Ciro's and La Rue's (Hollywood). In 1945, Wilkerson purchased 33 acres on the east side of U.S. Route 91, or about a mile south of the Hotel Last Frontier, in preparation for his vision. Wilkerson then hired George Vernon Russell to design a hotel influenced by European style. Wilkerson also requested that the hotel be different than the \\"sawdust joints\\" on Fremont Street. He planned a hotel with luxurious rooms, a spa, a health club, a showroom, a golf course, a nightclub, an upscale restaurant and a French style casino. Because of high wartime material costs, Wilkerson ran into financial problems almost at once, finding himself $400,000 short and hunting for new financing. =Development under Bugsy Siegel (1945)= Bugsy's original Flamingo Las Vegas in 1947 In late 1945, mobster Bugsy Siegel and his partners came to Las Vegas. Vegas reportedly piqued Siegel and his mob's interest because of its legalized gambling and off-track betting. At the time, Siegel held a large interest in Trans America Wire, a racing publication. Siegel began by purchasing El Cortez on Fremont Street for $600,000. His expansion plans were hampered by unfriendly city officials aware of his criminal background, so Siegel began looking for a site outside the city limits. Hearing that Wilkerson was seeking extra funding, Siegel and his partners posed as businessmen and directly bought a two-thirds stake in the project. Siegel took over the final phases of construction and convinced more of his underworld associates, such as Meyer Lansky to invest in the project. Siegel reportedly lost patience with the project's rising costs, and he once mentioned to his builder, Del Webb, that he had personally killed 16 men. Reportedly, when Webb appeared scared upon hearing that, Siegel reassured him, \\"Don't worry – we only kill each other.\\"The Green Felt Jungle Siegel had also built a secret ladder in the \\"Presidential Suite\\" to escape if necessary. The ladder led down to an underground garage where a chauffeured limo was always waiting.http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/13488 =The Flamingo Hotel & Casino opens (1946)= \\"The West's Greatest Resort Hotel\\", matchbook advertising the Flamingo resort, circa 1946 Siegel finally opened The Flamingo Hotel & Casino on December 26, 1946, at a total cost of $6 million. Billed as \\"The West's Greatest Resort Hotel\\", the 105-room property – and first luxury hotel on the Strip – was built from Downtown Las Vegas. During construction, a large sign announced the hotel as a William R. Wilkerson project. The sign also read Del Webb Construction as the hotel's primary contractor and Richard R. Stadelman (who later made renovations to the El Rancho Vegas) as the building architect. Allegedly, Siegel named the resort after his girlfriend, Virginia Hill, who loved to gamble and was nicknamed \\"Flamingo\\". It is reported that Siegel called her this because of her long, skinny legs. Organized crime king, Lucky Luciano, wrote in his memoir that Siegel once owned an interest in the Hialeah Park Race Track and viewed the flamingos who populated nearby as a good omen. The \\"Flamingo\\" name is reported to have been given to the project at its inception by Wilkerson. =Siegel's death (1947)= Siegel's trouble with the Flamingo began when, a year after its official groundbreaking, the resort had produced no revenue and drained the resources of its mob investors. Then Meyer Lansky charged – at a major mob conference in Cuba – that either Siegel or Hill was skimming from the resort's building budget. This charge was amplified at a time when Hill was revealed to have taken $2.5 million and had gone to Switzerland, where the skimmed money was believed to be going. Las Vegas Sun' Ad Congratulating Flamingo's Grand Opening in 1945 \\"There was no doubt in Meyer's mind,\\" Luciano recalled in his memoir, \\"that Bugsy had skimmed this dough from his building budget, and he was sure that Siegel was preparing to skip as well as skim, in case the roof was gonna fall in on him.\\" Luciano and the other mob leaders in Cuba asked Lansky what to do. Torn because of long ties to Siegel, whom he considered like a brother, Lansky nevertheless agreed that someone stealing from his friends had to die. At first, Lansky persuaded the others to wait for the Flamingo's casino opening: if it was a success, Siegel could be persuaded in other ways to repay. Luciano concurred and persuaded the others to agree. Bugsy Siegel Memorial at Flamingo Las Vegas in 2012 The splashy opening – stars present included Spanish band leader Xavier Cugat (whose band provided the music), George Jessel, George Raft, Rose Marie, and Jimmy Durante as entertainment, with guests including Clark Gable, Lana Turner, Cesar Romero, Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, and others – was a flop. Lansky managed to persuade the mob chiefs to reprieve Siegel once more and allow the Flamingo more time. But by January 1947 Siegel had to order the resort closed until the hotel could be finished. The Flamingo re-opened in March despite the hotel not being complete, and this time, the results proved different. By May, the resort reported a $250,000 profit, allowing Lansky to point out that Siegel was right about Las Vegas after all. But it wasn't quite enough to save Siegel. On June 20, 1947, relaxing in the Beverly Hills house he shared with Hill, who was away at the time, Siegel was shot to death. A memorial plaque exists on the Flamingo site near the outdoor wedding chapel. =Post-Siegel ownerships (1947–1960)= Casino management changed the hotel name to The Fabulous Flamingo on March 1, 1947. After Siegel's death, Moe Sedway and Gus Greenbaum, magnates of the nearby El Cortez Hotel, took possession of it. Under their partnership, it became a non-exclusive facility affordable to almost anyone. They made the enterprise extremely successful. In the year 1948 alone, it turned a $4 million profit. The Fabulous Flamingo presented lavish shows and accommodations for its time, becoming well known for comfortable, air conditioned rooms, gardens, and swimming pools. Often credited for popularizing the \\"complete experience\\" as opposed to merely gambling, its staff became known for wearing tuxedos on the job. Among the many entertainers who performed there between 1947 and 1953 were Martin and Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Danny Thomas, Tony Martin, Marge and Gower Champion, Polly Bergen, Lena Horne, The Mills Brothers, Alan King, Betty Hutton, Billy Eckstine, Sophie Tucker, Pearl Bailey, and Spike Jones. Rose Marie, who was one of its first entertainers under Siegel's ownership in 1946, remained loyal to the property for the rest of her life, only performing at other casinos with permission from \\"the boys\\" at the Fabulous Flamingo, according to her last words. In 1953, the hotel's management spent $1 million in renovations and remodeling. The original entrance and signage was destroyed. A new entrance with an upswept roof was built and a pink neon sign was designed by Bill Clark of Ad- Art. A neon-bubbled \\"Champagne Tower\\" sign with pink flamingos rimming the top was also installed in front of the hotel. From 1955 to 1960, the property was operated by Albert Parvin of the Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation. Parvin owned 30% of the stock while businessman Harry Goldman owned 7.5%; other investors included singer Tony Martin and actor George Raft. =Recent years (1960–present)= In 1960, it was sold for $10.5 million to a group including Samuel Cohen, Morris Lansburgh, and Daniel Lifter, Miami residents with reputed ties to organized crime. Lansky allegedly served as middleman for the deal, receiving $200,000. The Flamingo name has been applied to gambling operations elsewhere, such as this New Orleans riverboat, circa 1997 Kirk Kerkorian acquired the property in 1967, making it part of Kerkorian's International Leisure Company, but the Hilton Corporation bought the resort in 1972, renaming it the Flamingo Hilton in 1974. The last of the original Flamingo Hotel structure was torn down on December 14, 1993, and the hotel's garden was built on-site. The Flamingo's four hotel towers were built (or expanded) in 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1990, and 1993. A 200-unit Hilton Grand Vacations timeshare tower was opened in 1993. In 1998, Hilton's gaming properties, including the Flamingo, were spun off as Park Place Entertainment (later renamed to Caesars Entertainment). The deal included a two-year license to use the Hilton name. Park Place opted not to renew that agreement when it expired in late 2000, and the property was renamed Flamingo Las Vegas. In 2005, Harrah's Entertainment purchased Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and the property became part of Harrah's Entertainment. The company changed its name to Caesars Entertainment Corporation in 2010. On September 9, 2012, Port Adelaide Football Club AFL footballer John McCarthy died after falling from a rooftop of the hotel. The incident occurred at the start of a post-season holiday for McCarthy and other Port Adelaide players. They had arrived in Las Vegas only a few hours before the incident. After reviewing evidence, police said that McCarthy had attempted to jump off the roof onto a palm tree, but fell to the ground. The hotel underwent a $90-million makeover which was completed in 2018. The designer, Forrest Perkins, used gold and pink in the 3500 upgraded rooms and described them as contemporary retro-chic with a focus on the 70-year history of the hotel. Facilities and attractions The 15-acre site's architectural theme is reminiscent of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of Miami and South Beach, with a garden courtyard housing a wildlife habitat featuring flamingos. It was the third resort to open on the Strip, and it is the oldest resort on the Strip still in operation today. The Flamingo has a Las Vegas Monorail station, the Flamingo/Caesars Palace station, at the rear of the property. Flamingo Las Vegas Front Entrance in 2010 The garden courtyard houses a wildlife habitat featuring Chilean flamingos, Ringed Teal ducks, and other birds. There are also koi fish and turtles. It was the home of penguins, but they have since been moved to the Dallas Zoo. Extending the hotel's tropical theme, a Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville restaurant and gift shop was opened in December 2003. An adjacent Margaritaville \\"minicasino\\" opened in October 2011. Headlining acts perform in the Donny and Marie Showroom. The throwback venue was remodeled in 2014 that included many technological updates improving the sound systems and lighting. It seats 780 with floor seating and a balcony. It maintains the style and feel of early Vegas with red and white themed booths and chairs, red velvet curtains as well as red carpets. It provides for close intimate interactions between the performers and audience due to the clam-shell layout. It was officially named the Donny & Marie Showroom at Flamingo Las Vegas after the Brother and Sister duo that headlined for an eleven-year span between 2008 and 2019. Starting late November 2019 the “Donny & Marie Showroom” went back to its original name “Flamingo Showroom”. The theater Bugsy's Cabaret host the show \\"X Burlesque\\" which debuted in 2002. In addition the Piff X-Perience uses the same stage. The flamingo habitat =Current headliners= Paula Abdul began a residency on August 13, 2019 with her Forever Your Girl production and is currently scheduled through January 4, 2020. Alongside Paula Abdul's residency, RuPaul's Drag Race Live! will also debut in January 2020, featuring drag queens that once competed on RuPaul's Drag Race and RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars such as Aquaria, Derrick Barry, and Yvie Oddly. =Past headliners= From 2008 through November 2019 the headlining show at the Flamingo featured brother-sister musical duo Donny and Marie Osmond. Their show premiered in September 2008, and was extended through November 2019 for an eleven-year run. The show was rated in The Best of Las Vegas online contest. Donny and Marie Osmond were voted \\"Best Performers of Las Vegas\\" in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The final show was on November 16, 2019 and holds the record for the longest running musical act in Vegas history with 1730 performances with more than 9 million tickets sold during the production. Earlier headliners include Gladys Knight in 2003 with her Knight in Vegas residency. Toni Braxton's show ran from August 2006 to April 2008 and closed due to Braxton's health problems. Singer Olivia Newton-John maintained a long term residency at the Flamingo from April 2014 through 2016. Additional past performers at The Flamingo include Judy Garland in '58, Bobby Darin in '63 (for several weeks), Fats Domino in '63 (and for several years), Jerry Lee Lewis in '63, and Ray Charles in '63. The Supremes in '66, James Brown in '67, Little Richard in '67, Tom Jones in '68 (for the album Tom Jones Live in Las Vegas), Wayne Newton (longtime Vegas resident) in '68, Ella Fitzgerald in '70, B.B. King in '71, Kenny Rogers in '97, Foreigner in '00, Vinnie Favorito in '03, The Beach Boys in '03, Jimmy Buffett in '04, Sly & the Family Stone (from San Francisco) in '07, Old Dominion in '17, Aaron Carter in '17, Everclear in '17, Lit and Alien Ant Farm (both from L.A.) in '17, Richard Marx in '17, Smash Mouth (from San Jose) in '17. Rita Ora in '18, and Gin Blossoms (from Phoenix) in '18. In popular culture =Film= The 1964 film Viva Las Vegas and the 1960 version of Ocean's 11 were filmed at the hotel, as was a flashback sequence from the 2001 version of the latter film. In the 1960 version, the Flamingo was one of the five Las Vegas casinos robbed by characters played by Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis Jr. and others. The 1991 film Bugsy starring Warren Beatty depicted Bugsy Siegel's involvement in the construction of the Flamingo, though many of the details were altered for dramatic effect. For instance, in the film, Siegel originates the idea of the Flamingo, instead of buying ownership from Billy Wilkerson, and is killed after the first opening on December 26, 1946, rather than the second opening of the Flamingo in 1947. =Television= The Netflix original series Lilyhammer featuring E-Street Band guitarist and singer Steven Van Zandt features a nightclub in Lillehammer, Norway, named the Flamingo. During its construction, Van Zandt's character, Giovanni Henriksen (aka Frank \\"The Fixer\\" Tagliano), referenced the hotel and casino, as well as Benjamin Siegel, as his inspiration for the nightclub. In the television series \\"Vega$\\" (1978-1981), starring Robert Urich, and filmed entirely in Las Vegas, the Flamingo Hilton is featured prominently in the opening montage. =Music= The debut solo album from The Killers' lead singer Brandon Flowers, Flamingo, is named after the casino. =Literature= Hunter S. Thompson and Oscar Zeta Acosta stayed at the Flamingo while attending a seminar by the National Conference of District Attorneys on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs held at the Dunes Hotel across the street. Several of their experiences in their room are depicted in Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream. The Flamingo figures prominently in the Tim Powers novel Last Call. In the novel, the Flamingo is supposedly founded on Siegel's mythical/mystical paranoia of being pursued and killed for his archetypal position as the \\"King of the West\\", known mythologically as \\"Fisher King\\". Supposedly the Flamingo itself was meant to be a real-life personification of \\"The Tower\\" card of the tarot deck.

Professional wrestling career =Early career= Rick Harris started wrestling in 1975. He went through several names, such as \\"Man Mountain Harris,\\" \\"Hangman Harris,\\" and \\"Hangman Ricky Harris\\". =Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling= In 1981, Harris competed as a preliminary wrestler on the Jim Crockett Promotions \\"Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling\\" program as \\"Ricky Harris\\". =Universal Wrestling Federation and Mid South Wrestling= It was during his \\"Hangman\\" Rick Harris phase, working for Bill Watts, that he debuted as a bounty hunter for Skandor Akbar in 1982 Mid South Wrestling and before settling on the name of \\"Black Bart\\" which was given to him by Dusty Rhodes in 1984.Wrestler Profiles – Online World of Wrestling =Championship Wrestling from Florida and the Long Riders and Jim Crockett Promotions = Harris formed a tag team called the \\"Long Riders\\" with Ron Bass in Florida Championship Wrestling in 1984 and they would hold the NWA United States Tag Team Titles (Florida) and work a program with Barry Windham and Mike Rotunda and went on to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions later that year and were managed by J.J. Dillon. After splitting with Bass in 1985, Harris feuded with Ron Garvin, Terry Taylor and Sam Houston over the NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship which he won and defended. During this time Black Bart developed his second-rope leg drop to a prone opponent finishing move known as the \\"Texas Trash Compactor\\".The True Mid- Atlantic Title Story =World Class Championship Wrestling= In late 1986, Bart went to World Class Championship Wrestling where he feuded with Chris Adams and Kevin Von Erich over the World Class title. When Adams, who held the World Class title, left the promotion in September 1986, Bart was awarded the championship...but not before the promotion explained that Bart won the belt from Adams in a fictitious match held in Los Angeles. Bart lost the championship to Von Erich a month later in Dallas, then, like other major World Class stars, left WCCW to join the UWF. =Universal Wrestling Federation= While in the Universal Wrestling Federation they would co- promote shows with the NWA. While wrestling in the NWA for Jim Crockett Promotions, he received a sizable push in the midcard, winning the NWA National Heavyweight Championship and the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. He also wrestled in the tournament for the NWA Western States Heritage Championship. Harris lost in the final match to Barry Windham. =New Japan Pro Wrestling; Championship Wrestling from Florida; Continental Wrestling Association= In 1987 Black Bart wrestled in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling and had some matches with Antonio Inoki. He then went back to Championship Wrestling from Florida and teamed with Bobby Jaggers and Tony Anthony while feuding with Dustin Rhodes and Mike Graham and The Nasty Boys. He then went to the Continental Wrestling Association where he feuded with Dutch Mantel. =USWA Memphis, TN= In May 1989 Bart went to Memphis and feuded with Jerry Lawler & Jeff Jarrett =World Wrestling Federation (1990–1991) = On January 22, 1990 Black Bart made his debut for the World Wrestling Federation when he defeated Lee Peak in a dark match at a WWF Superstars of Wrestling taping in Miami, Florida. Four weeks later Bart made his first appearance on television, when he was defeated by Tito Santana on Prime Time Wrestling on February 19. For the remainder of the year he worked mostly as enhancement talent. Bart appeared in well over one hundred matches and was featured regularly on television. He did, however, score victories over enhancement talent such as Jim Powers (a five match winning streak in July), Paul Diamond, Mark Young, Jim Evans, and Pez Whatley, and even managed to get a shot at the WWF World Tag Team Titles to wrestle then-champions Demolition alongside Bart's partner for the match, Mark Ming, in a losing effort. Bart was the opponent for several wrestlers making their debuts in the WWF. On April 24, 1990 Bart was defeated by Dustin Rhodes at a dark match at a Wrestling Challenge taping in San Antonio, Texas. This was Dustin's debut. On the July 21 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Bart teamed with Tom Stone to face The Legion of Doom in their first match with the company. On July 24, 1990, he defeated Shane Douglas at a house show in Los Angeles, California. Following a series of matches in July against Jim Powers where he emerged victorious in every encounter, he entered a house show series in August with Pez Whatley. Again he was unbeaten, and then moved on a to another house show program – this time with the former Killer Bee Jim Brunzell. Brunzell would win all of these encounters. In October Bart would enter a house show series with Dustin Rhodes and again would come up winless. That winter he began a series of matches with Saba Simba and Shane Douglas. On the January 19, 1991 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Bart went after the Tag-Team Championship again when he teamed with WT Jones in an unsuccessful challenge to The Hart Foundation. This would be his final WWF match, as he returned to WCCW shortly thereafter.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm =Return to WCCW= After leaving WWF he wrestled for the USWA owned World Class Championship Wrestling promotion in Texas where he struck up another feud with Sam Houston. =World Championship Wrestling (1991) = Less than a month after his final televised WWF appearance, Black Bart signed with World Championship Wrestling. He made his first appearance at house show in Jacksonville, FL on February 15, 1991. Teaming with Dan Spivey and Buddy Landell, the trio mounted an unsuccessful challenge to WCW Six-Man Tag-Team Champions Junkyard Dog, Ricky Morton, and Tommy Rich.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw91.htm That spring he renewed several rivalries, as he faced Sam Houston and Dustin Rhodes on the house show circuit. WCW created a stable known as \\"the Desperados\\" consisting of Dutch Mantell, Black Bart, and Deadeye Dick. The Desperados were packaged with the gimmick of being three bumbling cowboys looking to meet up with Stan Hansen to go to WCW and become a team. Over the course of a few months, they were promoted through a series of vignettes by which they would be beaten up in saloons, searching ghost towns, and riding horses. The Desperadoes entered the ring for the first time at house show in Charlotte, NC on May 12, 1991, where they (Bart and Dutch Mantell) were defeated by The Young Pistols. Bart made his first WCW PPV appearance seven days later at SuperBrawl I, when he substituted for Larry Zybysko in a match against Big Josh. Later that month Bart began teaming regularly with Deadeye Dick in house show matches against Ricky Morton and Dustin Rhodes. The full Desperadoes trio entered the ring for the first time on July 3, 1991 in East Rutherford, NJ at the start of the 1991 The Great American Bash tour, where they were defeated by The Freebirds and Badstreet Brad Armstrong. On July 14 he wrestled Junkyard Dog in the dark match of the Great American Bash PPV. He later appeared as a lumberjack in a match between Big Josh and Black Blood. While the Desperadoes angle continued and the trio was shown as late as the June 29th WCW Power Hour program still looking for Stan Hansen, the former AWA champion reportedly wanted no part of the storyline and left for Japan, never to return to wrestle in North America. Without Hansen, the group were pushed into service as jobbers and were dissolved as a stable before the end of the year. Bart's final match was on August 24, 1991 on the WCW Power Hour, when he teamed with Richard Myers against The WCW Patriots. =Global Wrestling Federation (1991–1994)= Two months after departing from WCW, Bart re-emerged in Global Wrestling Federation.

The odd 300mm gap between the westmost unit and the next building is explained by the need to maintain daylight to the inner building (bonds could not have open flames for lighting so before electricity had to be fully daylit).

G. Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in The Strand Magazine in London in June 1922, and then in Cosmopolitan in New York that same month. The story was also included in the collection The Inimitable Jeeves as two separate stories.Cawthorne (2013), p. 57. In the story, Bertie and others make bets on an event called the Great Sermon Handicap. This story's plot continues into that of \\"The Purity of the Turf\\", though the two may be read as independent stories. Plot Bertie receives a letter from his cousin Eustace, who is with his twin Claude and Bertie's friend Bingo Little at Twing Hall. Eustace invites Bertie, claiming there is an opportunity to make money. The letter includes a baffling list of ministers, times, and prices. Bertie goes to Twing, where he talks to a friend, Lady Cynthia. Bertie later sees Bingo, who confesses to being in love with Cynthia. The next morning, Bingo enters Bertie's bedroom to share his poetry about Cynthia. Claude and Eustace follow. Eustace says that an acquaintance, Steggles, came up with a fun variation on the standard horse race: the Sermon Handicap. Each local parson's Sunday sermon will be timed, and the parson who preaches the longest wins. Steggles made the list of parsons, their handicaps, and their current odds being taken for bets. One parson, Heppenstall, gives long sermons, but has a moderate handicap since Steggles underestimated him; Bertie funds bets on Heppenstall for a syndicate made of himself, Bingo, Claude, and Eustace. Eustace invites Jeeves to join them but Jeeves declines. Later, Claude and Eustace alert Bertie that another parson, G. Hayward, also gives long sermons. To protect their bets, Bertie asks Heppenstall to preach his long sermon on Brotherly Love. However, Heppenstall falls ill; his succinct nephew Bates will take his place. Bertie's syndicate placed ante-post (pre-event) bets; consequently, they will lose their wagers when Heppenstall fails to appear at the event. They bet on G. Hayward to make up for their anticipated losses. On Sunday, G. Hayward gives a long sermon. Bertie and Bingo return to the Hall, where Bingo chastises Jeeves, who placed an S.P. (starting price, i.e. price at start of event) bet on Bates. Jeeves gives Bertie a letter, delivered earlier by Heppenstall's butler Brookfield, informing that Bates will give the full sermon on Brotherly Love. Jeeves had heard this from Brookfield. Jeeves adds, to Bingo's dismay, that Bates is engaged to Lady Cynthia.  Publication history  1922 Strand illustration by A. Wallis Mills The story was reprinted separately as its own book, published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1933. The dust wrapper shows Bertie saying to Jeeves, \\"Jeeves old son, do you want a sporting flutter?\\"; however, it was Eustace who said this to Jeeves in the story.McIlvaine (1990), p. 43, A30B, and p. 64, A49.

The group consisted of political activists who acquired a stronger ecological perspective and environmental activists who acquired a stronger political perspective. The basic founding document of the Philippine Greens is the Manifesto of the Philippine Greens, which summarizes their fundamental outlook. In 1999, the Philippine Greens published their program of action under the title Society, Ecology and Transformation: a program for transforming Philippine society based on the Green worldview. The group has been very active on mining issues, transport, ecological waste management, clean air and clean water advocacy, genetic engineering, sustainable agriculture and other issues. Among the more high-profile actions led by the Philippine Greens include demonstrations against mining, a picket against Bill Gates, whom they called a \\"cyberlord\\", and a 30-day hunger strike against genetically engineered Bt corn. The Philippine Greens have focused on environmental issues and have not actively participated in Philippine elections. They based their decision on their analysis that Philippine electoral processes were so corrupt that participation in elections tended to corrupt the contestants themselves and the results often did not reflect the true will of the people. In 2004, Philippine Greens secretary-general Roberto Verzol published an analysis which showed how widespread fraud in election tabulation could have altered the results of the presidential elections. Verzola also pointed out the errors of the National Movement for Free Elections's (NAMFREL) independent tally in the May 10, 2004 elections in his 12-page study. Some of Philippine Green members subsequently initiated the formation of an independent election monitoring group, Halalang Marangal (Network of Citizens for Honest Elections and Truthful Statistics), to work for clean and honest elections. Today, the Philippine Greens continue to focus on environmental issues and concerns. Their members are spread out within other environmental groups in the Philippines and they conduct regular fellowship meetings to share experiences, discuss the current situation, formulate a common stand, and make plans for intensifying and expanding their environmental advocacies. In 2007, Reido Panaligan, coordinator of the Ecowaste Coalition of the Philippines, was selected by consensus to become the group's secretary-general.

Sometimes the Jeffreys prior cannot be normalized, and is thus an improper prior. For example, the Jeffreys prior for the distribution mean is uniform over the entire real line in the case of a Gaussian distribution of known variance. Use of the Jeffreys prior violates the strong version of the likelihood principle, which is accepted by many, but by no means all, statisticians. When using the Jeffreys prior, inferences about \\\\vec\\\\theta depend not just on the probability of the observed data as a function of \\\\vec\\\\theta, but also on the universe of all possible experimental outcomes, as determined by the experimental design, because the Fisher information is computed from an expectation over the chosen universe. Accordingly, the Jeffreys prior, and hence the inferences made using it, may be different for two experiments involving the same \\\\vec\\\\theta parameter even when the likelihood functions for the two experiments are the same—a violation of the strong likelihood principle. Minimum description length In the minimum description length approach to statistics the goal is to describe data as compactly as possible where the length of a description is measured in bits of the code used. For a parametric family of distributions one compares a code with the best code based on one of the distributions in the parameterized family. The main result is that in exponential families, asymptotically for large sample size, the code based on the distribution that is a mixture of the elements in the exponential family with the Jeffreys prior is optimal. This result holds if one restricts the parameter set to a compact subset in the interior of the full parameter space. If the full parameter is used a modified version of the result should be used. Examples The Jeffreys prior for a parameter (or a set of parameters) depends upon the statistical model. =Gaussian distribution with mean parameter= For the Gaussian distribution of the real value x : f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu) = \\\\frac{e^{-(x - \\\\mu)^2 / 2\\\\sigma^2}}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi \\\\sigma^2}} with \\\\sigma fixed, the Jeffreys prior for the mean \\\\mu is : \\\\begin{align} p(\\\\mu) & \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{I(\\\\mu)} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\mu} \\\\log f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu) \\\\right)^2\\\\right]} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{x - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} f(x\\\\mid\\\\mu) \\\\left(\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)^2 dx} = \\\\sqrt{1/\\\\sigma^2} \\\\propto 1.\\\\end{align} That is, the Jeffreys prior for \\\\mu does not depend upon \\\\mu; it is the unnormalized uniform distribution on the real line — the distribution that is 1 (or some other fixed constant) for all points. This is an improper prior, and is, up to the choice of constant, the unique translation-invariant distribution on the reals (the Haar measure with respect to addition of reals), corresponding to the mean being a measure of location and translation-invariance corresponding to no information about location. =Gaussian distribution with standard deviation parameter= For the Gaussian distribution of the real value x : f(x\\\\mid\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{e^{-(x - \\\\mu)^2 / 2 \\\\sigma^2}}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi \\\\sigma^2}}, with \\\\mu fixed, the Jeffreys prior for the standard deviation \\\\sigma > 0 is : \\\\begin{align}p(\\\\sigma) & \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{I(\\\\sigma)} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\sigma} \\\\log f(x\\\\mid\\\\sigma) \\\\right)^2\\\\right]} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{(x - \\\\mu)^2-\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\sigma^3} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} f(x\\\\mid\\\\sigma)\\\\left(\\\\frac{(x-\\\\mu)^2-\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\sigma^3}\\\\right)^2 dx} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sigma^2}} \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma}. \\\\end{align} Equivalently, the Jeffreys prior for \\\\log \\\\sigma = \\\\int d\\\\sigma/\\\\sigma is the unnormalized uniform distribution on the real line, and thus this distribution is also known as the '. Similarly, the Jeffreys prior for \\\\log \\\\sigma^2 = 2 \\\\log \\\\sigma is also uniform. It is the unique (up to a multiple) prior (on the positive reals) that is scale-invariant (the Haar measure with respect to multiplication of positive reals), corresponding to the standard deviation being a measure of scale and scale-invariance corresponding to no information about scale. As with the uniform distribution on the reals, it is an improper prior. =Poisson distribution with rate parameter= For the Poisson distribution of the non-negative integer n, : f(n \\\\mid \\\\lambda) = e^{-\\\\lambda}\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^n}{n!}, the Jeffreys prior for the rate parameter \\\\lambda \\\\ge 0 is : \\\\begin{align}p(\\\\lambda) &\\\\propto \\\\sqrt{I(\\\\lambda)} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\lambda} \\\\log f(n\\\\mid\\\\lambda) \\\\right)^2\\\\right]} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{n-\\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right)^2\\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\\\infty} f(n\\\\mid\\\\lambda) \\\\left( \\\\frac{n-\\\\lambda}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right)^2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}}.\\\\end{align} Equivalently, the Jeffreys prior for \\\\sqrt\\\\lambda = \\\\int d\\\\lambda/\\\\sqrt\\\\lambda is the unnormalized uniform distribution on the non-negative real line. =Bernoulli trial= For a coin that is \\"heads\\" with probability \\\\gamma \\\\in [0,1] and is \\"tails\\" with probability 1 - \\\\gamma, for a given (H,T) \\\\in \\\\\\\\{(0,1), (1,0)\\\\\\\\} the probability is \\\\gamma^H (1-\\\\gamma)^T. The Jeffreys prior for the parameter \\\\gamma is : \\\\begin{align}p(\\\\gamma) & \\\\propto \\\\sqrt{I(\\\\gamma)} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{d\\\\gamma} \\\\log f(x\\\\mid\\\\gamma) \\\\right)^2\\\\right]} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{H}{\\\\gamma} - \\\\frac{T}{1-\\\\gamma}\\\\right)^2 \\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma} - \\\\frac{0}{1-\\\\gamma}\\\\right)^2 + (1-\\\\gamma)\\\\left( \\\\frac{0}{\\\\gamma} - \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\gamma}\\\\right)^2} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma(1-\\\\gamma)}}\\\\,.\\\\end{align} This is the arcsine distribution and is a beta distribution with \\\\alpha = \\\\beta = 1/2. Furthermore, if \\\\gamma = \\\\sin^2(\\\\theta) the Jeffreys prior for \\\\theta is uniform in the interval [0, \\\\pi / 2].

This amounts to using a pseudocount of one half for each possible outcome. Equivalently, if we write \\\\gamma_i = \\\\varphi_i^2 for each i, then the Jeffreys prior for \\\\vec{\\\\varphi} is uniform on the (N − 1)-dimensional unit sphere (i.e., it is uniform on the surface of an N-dimensional unit ball).

It is related to chemically induced dynamic electron polarization (CIDEP) insofar as the radical-pair mechanism explains both phenomena. Concept and experimental set-up The effect is detected by NMR spectroscopy, usually using 1H NMR spectrum, as enhanced absorption or emission signals (\\"negative peaks\\"). The effect arises when unpaired electrons (radicals) are generated during a chemical reaction. Because the magnetic moment of an electron is more than 600x that of a proton, the spins of many protons are polarized beyond the usual thermal Boltzmann distribution. The CIDNP experiment is conducted within the NMR tube. The radicals are produced by thermal or photochemical reactions, usually from colligation and diffusion, or disproportionation of radical pairs. Radical pair mechanism The generation of CIDNP in a typical photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and approximately half of the molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The kinetics are complicated and may involve multiple protonations and deprotonations, and hence exhibit pH dependence. An example of Radical Pair Mechanism The radical pair may either cross over to a singlet electron state and then recombine, or separate and perish in side reactions. The relative probability of these two pathways for a given radical pair depends on the nuclear spin state and leads to the nuclear spin state sorting and observable nuclear polarization. Applications Detected as enhanced absorptive or emissive signals in the NMR spectra of the reaction products, CIDNP has been exploited for the last 30 years to characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms. In certain cases, CIDNP also offers the possibility of large improvements in NMR sensitivity. The principal application of this photo-CIDNP technique, as devised by Kaptein in 1978, has been to proteins in which the aromatic amino acid residues histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics as photosensitisers. The key feature of the method is that only solvent accessible histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues can undergo the radical pair reactions that result in nuclear polarization. Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe the surface structure of proteins, both in native and partially folded states, and their interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains. Although usually observed in liquids, the photo-CIDNP effect has also been detected in solid state, for example on 13C and 15N nuclei in photosynthetic reaction centres, where significant nuclear polarization can accumulate as a result of spin selection processes in the electron transfer reactions. History CIDNP was discovered in 1967 by Bargon and Fischer, and, independently, by Ward and Lawler. Early theories were based on dynamic nuclear polarisation (hence the name). The subsequent experiments, however, have found that in many cases DNP fails to explain CIDNP polarization phase. In 1969 an alternative explanation was proposed by Closs, and, independently, by Kaptein and Oosterhoff, which relied on the ability of nuclear spin interactions to alter the recombination probability in reactions that proceed through radical pairs. This mechanism, known as the radical pair mechanism is currently accepted as the most common cause of CIDNP. There are, however, exceptions, and the DNP mechanism was found to be operational, for example, in many fluorine-containing radicals.

Built on the River Feorish at the foot of Arigna Mountain, it lies between Loughs Skean and Meelagh with Lough Arrow, Lough Allen, Lough Bo and Lough-na- Sool nearby. It lies on the Sligo/Leitrim R284 regional road on the border with County Sligo. The first church at Kilronan, Keadue, County Roscommon, was built in the 8th century by St. Ronan and his daughter St. Lasair. It was replaced in 1339 by one built by Fergal O'Duigenan which was burned down in 1340 and replaced three years later by the church, one gable of which stands today. Sheltered by that gable is the vault of the McDermott Roes, in which Turlough O'Carolan was interred in 1738. This gable is a memorial to the Gaelic Literary tradition from the 13th -18th century as represented by the O'Duigenans, hereditary erenachs of Kilronan (lay abbots who held church land from generation to generation), and chroniclers (as well as bards and ollavs- hereditary poets) to the MacDermots, Princes of Moylurg, down to Turlough O'Carolan, sometimes styled \\"The Last of the Bards\\". The O'Duigenans maintained a school of history on this site. Kilronan Castle Kilronan Castle, which was also known as Castle Tenison, is a 19th-century castle dating from two different periods. The earlier part was built by Thomas Tenison, consisting of a 3-storey-over-basement, 3-bay symmetrical castellated block with slender corner turrets, pinnacled buttresses and tracery windows. This was built in about 1820, and may incorporate a Palladian style Georgian house. The later part is two storeys high, is irregular, and of rubble stone with a baronial tower. The castle was inherited by Florence (née Tenison) wife of the Henry King-Tenison, 8th Earl of Kingston whose husband assumed the additional name of Tenison. The Tenisons were early photographers. In particular Edward King-Tenison travelled in Spain in the 1850s, where he took pictures of its castles and scenery.National Photographic Library E.K. Tenison took photographs of Kilronan Castle in 1859 which were printed with albumen. In 1814 the castle was occupied by Thomas Tenison. The castle is a now a hotel. Amenities A memorial to a local musician and songwriter, Josie McDermott, lies in the village centre, and a memorial garden on the Feorish bank is dedicated to all who attended fair days in the village for centuries, and who worked in Arigna Coal Mines overlooking the village. Kilronan Castle Hotel can be seen on walks to Lough Meelagh, the former home of the Earl of Kingston, and Alderford House, the last home of Turlough O'Carolan, is adjacent to the village. Turlough O'Carolan is buried in nearby Kilronan Abbey. There is also a primary school, church, and GAA grounds in the area. There are two pubs in the village, although one is not open full-time. There is a garage/petrol-station a shop and hardware store. St. Lasair's well is a spring feed well outside the village.

History Early planning for the dam began in 1972 when the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River (Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal, or OMVS) was set up by Mali, Mauritania and Senegal to develop the agricultural and hydropower potential of the basin. The World Bank declined to fund the dam in 1979, considering it an unreasonable investment. However, financing was secured mainly from Europe and construction on the dam began in 1982. It was completed in 1988, but without the hydropower plant. In 1989 the Mauritania–Senegal Border War stopped all work on the project. A Swiss journalist who visited Manantali in 1988 described the project as a \\"luxury car without a motor\\". In 1993 Carl–Dieter Spranger, then Germany's minister for development assistance, called Manantali an \\"act of economic and environmental nonsense\\". When the conflict subsided in 1991 the OMVS sought a new loan package for the hydropower plant, which was finally put together in 1997. The dam began to produce electricity for Senegal, Mali and Mauritania in 2001. Today the dam is managed by the tripartite Manantali Energy Management Company, the Société de gestion de l’énergie de Manantali (SOGEM) created in 1997. SOGEM in turn has signed a 15-year concession contract with the private company EEM, a subsidiary of the South African national power company ESKOM, to operate the plant. OMVS is represented on the board of SOGEM. Citing \\"contractual difficulties in executing the contract\\", Eskom has entered into an agreement with SOGEM to terminate it as of 1 October 2011, according to the company's 2011 financial report. Cost and financing The total cost of the dam, its associated hydropower plant, the deforestation of the future reservoir, studies and \\"complementary measures\\" was 1.02bn Euro. The construction cost of the related Diama Dam further downstream was an additional 50m Euro. The dam was jointly financed by 16 donors, including German (14%) and French (13%) development cooperation, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Nations Development Program. The three benefiting African countries also contributed to the financing. 64% of the foreign financing was through soft loans and 36% through grants. The European Community, the Islamic Development Bank, the West African Development Bank, and the Nordic Development Fund also contributed to the financing. The government of Norway had declined to finance the dam because of concerns about its health impact. Benefits Map of the Senegal river basin. The Manantali dam is shown in the Southeastern corner of the basin. The expected benefits included electricity generation, increased agricultural production through irrigation and improved river navigability. Electricity generation. A 2008 evaluation of the dam conducted by three financiers (EIB, German KfW and French AFD) concluded that the main benefit of the dam is the generation of hydro-power, where the production of 740 GWh per year exceeded expectations of 540 GWh. About 55% of the electricity is used in Mali, 30% in Senegal and 15% in Mauritania. In 2006 in Mali more than 90% of all electricity generated came from Manantali, in Mauritania 34% and in Senegal 13%. The dam has not resolved the power problem of the three countries, where power outages regularly occur and the few existing industries have to produce their own power. As for the economic efficiency of the project, the European evaluation calculated an economic rate of return of the hydro-power component of 8%.This includes a 44% pro rata share of the costs of the dam itself, but excludes any benefits from the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to power generation from fossil fuels. Environmental costs are also not included. A World Bank evaluation even calculated an economic rate of return of 12 to 24%. The plant load factor of the planned hydro-power plant - the expected electricity production divided by the potential production if the power plant was utilized permanently at full capacity, is 42% compared to 45-60% for other hydro-power plants.740GWh/1752GWh=42%; 200MW*366days*24hours=1752GWh However, these economic benefits did not translate into financial benefits for two reasons: First, bulk electricity tariffs were set at only about half of production costs (4.7 Euro Cents/kWh compared to 8.8 Cents). Second, the national power utilities of the three countries that buy the electricity in bulk regularly pay only about half their bills. The entity in charge of operating the hydro- power plant, SOGEM, thus accumulates deficits. A Hydrology Risk Fund was to be gradually replenished in order to pay for operating costs of the plant in the case of a revenue shortfall due to drought. The Fund received only limited contributions, since the payments earmarked for the fund were instead used for rural electrification in areas near the power transmission lines in response to pressure from local communities. The agricultural benefits achieved through the dam were \\"below reasonable expectations\\". The dam irrigates an additional 78,100 hectares (781 square kilometres) of land in Senegal (54,700 hectares), Mauritania (20,400 ha) and Mali (3,000 ha), which actually exceeds expectations. However, yields remain low and only a single crop is harvested each year, partly because in all three countries producer prices for rice are set by the governments below the world market price, thus providing little incentive for farmers to increase production to its full potential. The stated project goal to increase food self-sufficiency has not been achieved: The share of rice self-sufficiency decreased in Senegal from 23% in 1980 to 20% in 2006 and rice production has stagnated since 1990. The share of cereal self- sufficiency in Mauritania decreased from 80% to 30%. The objective of increasing the navigability of the Senegal River between Saint-Louis, Senegal and Ambidédi, Mali had already been abandoned in 1980 prior to its construction because it proved unfeasible. Environmental and social impact The dam has proved controversial for its displacement of 10,000 people from the flooded area, and for its environmental and health-related impacts.World Bank:Projects - Senegal : Regional Hydropower Development project, Implementation Completion Report, 7 January 2005 In the irrigated areas the incidence of water-borne diseases such as bilharzia increased substantially, while local fisheries declined sharply. The annual flood of the Senegal river had been the basis of flood recession agriculture, fishing, and cattle grazing. With the Manantali dam, the annual flood has been reduced to an artificial two–week flood. Traditionally, the Senegal river inundated about 150,000 hectares on average, and up to 350,000 hectares in high–flow years.

Flood recession agriculture has now completely disappeared. Only a small share of the farmers affected was compensated with land irrigated from the Manantali reservoir.

Henry Gage was born in Montreal, the eldest son of General Thomas Gage, military leader of British Forces at the beginning of the American Revolution, and Margaret Kemble. He was educated at Westminster School. He joined the British Army and was made a lieutenant in the 7th Foot (Royal Fusiliers) in 1777, captain in the 26th Foot in 1779, and major in the 93rd Foot in 1783. He was subsequently promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1794, colonel in 1798 and major-general in 1805. He was also a captain in the Sussex yeomanry (1798), a lt.-colonel in 1798 and Colonel of the South Pevensey Volunteers in 1803. He was made Lieutenant- Colonel-Commandant in 1804. He was elected Member of Parliament for Warwick from 1790 and sat until 11 October 1791, when he inherited the title Viscount Gage in the Peerage of Ireland and Baron Gage in the Peerage of Great Britain from his uncle, William Gage and was called to the House of Lords. In 1789 he married his cousin, Susanna Maria Skinner, a descendant of the Delancey family. Both Henry and his wife shared extensive Dutch roots in British North America, including the Schuyler family and Van Cortlandt family, among others. Through his wife, Gage inherited a large part of the American estate of Vice- Admiral Sir Peter Warren (Warren was Susanna's grandfather). The historic letters and documents from this inheritance were later donated to the Sussex Archaeological Society of Lewes. They had two sons.

It was the first papal bull issued with a crusade as its subject. The bull was issued in response to the fall of Edessa, in December 1144. Pilgrims from the east had brought news of the fall of Edessa to Europe throughout 1145, and embassies from the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Kingdom of Armenia soon arrived directly at the papal court at Viterbo. Hugh, Bishop of Jabala, one of the dioceses of Jerusalem, was among those who delivered the news. As with most papal bulls, it had no specific title, and has come to be known by its opening words; in Latin the first sentence read \\"Quantum praedecessores nostri Romani pontifices pro liberatione Orientalis Ecclesiae laboraverunt, antiquorum relatione didicimus, et in gestis eorum scriptum reperimus\\" – in English, \\"How much our predecessors the Roman pontiffs did labour for the deliverance of the oriental church, we have learned from the accounts of the ancients and have found it written in their acts.\\" The bull, issued at Vetralla, briefly recounted the acts of the First Crusade, and lamented the loss of Edessa, Mesopotamia, one of the oldest Christian cities. The bull was addressed directly to Louis VII of France and his subjects, and promised the remission of sins for all those who took the cross, as well as ecclesiastical protection for their families and possessions, just as Pope Urban II had done before the First Crusade. Those who completed the crusade, or died along the way, were offered full absolution. Louis was already preparing a crusade of his own, independent of Eugenius' bull, and it appears that Louis may have at first ignored the bull completely. It is possible that the embassies from the east had visited Louis as well. However, in consultation with the preacher Bernard of Clairvaux, Louis eventually sought Eugenius' blessing, and Louis' crusade enjoyed full papal support. The bull was reissued on March 1, 1146, and Bernard began to preach the crusade throughout France and later in Germany as well, where he persuaded Conrad III to participate. Although this is the first papal bull calling for a crusade, the papacy was largely absent from the rest of the expedition. The First Crusade had no such bull – support was gathered at the Council of Clermont in 1095, and spread quickly through popular preaching. Urban II was seen as the leader of the crusade, through his legates, such as Adhemar of Le Puy. By the mid-12th century, papal power had dwindled somewhat, and Rome was controlled by the Commune of Rome. Although there were papal legates accompanying the crusade, the expedition was controlled by Louis and Conrad, not a religious leader. The crusade was mostly destroyed during its march through Anatolia. Louis and Conrad later joined with the army of Jerusalem at the unsuccessful Siege of Damascus in 1148.

Career Whatley played football and wrestled for Notre Dame High School in Chattanooga, Tennessee and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC). He was UTC's first African- American wrestler. Whatley was also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Whatley started wrestling in 1973 after a brief career as a power lifter. He wrestled with the (original) Sheik's Big Time Wrestling, after which he wrestled primarily in Alabama and Tennessee before going to Florida Championship Wrestling in 1984. He won the Southern Title twice while there. He was one-third of the \\"Convertible Blondes\\" with Rip Rogers and Gary Royal in the Angelo Poffo-promoted ICW, even though he didn't dye his hair blonde. One of Whatley's best-known moments in ICW was the \\"Mop Head\\" angle where Whatley had to wear a mop wig after losing a match to Ron Garvin. The match stipulation also required him to keep wearing it until he won another match. This led to not only a lengthy feud with Garvin but also to a long losing streak for Whatley. Most of Whatley's losses were by disqualification due to outside interference when Garvin would attack Whatley's opponent. The angle lasted for several months until Whatley finally won a match. He went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985 and often teamed with Jimmy Valiant against members of Paul Jones' Army. In 1986, after Valiant called Whatley \\"the best black athlete in professional wrestling\\", Whatley turned on Valiant and cut some of Valiant's hair, thinking Valiant's comment was racist. Whatley then became a \\"Heel\\", joined Jones' Army and renamed himself \\"Shaska Whatley\\". He frequently teamed with The Barbarian and Baron von Raschke in their war against Valiant, and would frequently spit on his opponents during matches. He eventually lost a hair vs. hair match to Valiant and was shaved bald. In 1986, during a short stint when Dusty Rhodes was NWA Champion, Whatley appeared to freelance during a TV interview and made the announcers visibly uncomfortable when he said that he wanted to become the first black NWA Champion. In late 1987, Whatley had left Jones and started teaming with Tiger Conway Jr. as \\"The Jive Tones\\". They did not have much success, and Whatley left for Florida in 1988. He was part of Kevin Sullivan's goon squad in Florida and departed for Alabama shortly after his arrival. In Alabama's Southeast Championship Wrestling, Whatley became \\"Willie B. Hert\\" and was one of the top faces for the company. In the early 1990s Pez Whatley had a short stint in Japan's UWFi. He also worked for the World Wrestling Federation as an enhancement talent on their weekly television programs from January 1990 until April 1991, putting over many of the WWF's top stars. He also picked up a few victories on house shows, most notably over Paul Diamond and The Genius. Whatley then made sporadic appearances in World Championship Wrestling throughout the 90s as an enhancement talent as well as appearances at the 1995 and 1996 World War 3 events until his in-ring retirement in 1998, becoming a backstage worker for WCW and an assistant trainer at the WCW Power Plant. Death While working for WCW in the late 1990s, Whatley was hospitalized for bronchitis, where doctors discovered he had an enlarged heart which would likely stop pumping sooner than normal. In the years waiting for a transplant (which he didn't get), he was prematurely pronounced dead twice. On January 15, 2005, he had a heart attack and died in hospital in Chattanooga on January 18.

It is located in the Region of Kayes at the confluence of the Bafing and Bakoy rivers which join to become the Sénégal River. Bafoulabé is the capital of the Cercle of Bafoulabé, which in 1887 was the first Cercle to be created in Mali. Local administration Until the 1996 law creating communes, Bafoulabé Commune was an arrondissement. While now deprecated, the commune retains the same boundaries, extending far beyond the town of Bafoulabé, its seat (chef-lieu). Bafoulabé is also the seat of the larger Bafoulabé Cercle. Apart from the town, there are 28 villages, official rural subdivisions within the Commune. It is a Rural Commune, meaning it is subdivided in villages, in contrast to the smaller Urban Commune, divided into urban Quarters. Commune affairs are directed by an elected Commune Council (conseil communal) of 23 members and a Commune executive (bureau communal) of the elected Mayor and three adjutants. The executive is tasked with carrying out the directives voted by the Council. National policies are carried out by a Sub-Prefect (sous préfet), who also carries out certain of the Council's directives over the local arms or national bodies.Presidency of the Republic of Mali, Project on Food Security.

Projet de Mobilisation des Initiatives en matière de Sécurité Alimentaire au Mali (PROMISAM), l'USAID/Mali (December 2006) Geography and climate 300px At Bafoulabé the Bafing and Bakoy rivers meet to form the Sénégal River. In Bambara, Bafoulabé means \\"meeting of two rivers\\". The Manantali hydroelectric dam and its reservoir, Lake Manantali, the largest in Mali, is located 90 km to the south-east of Bafoulabé on the Bafing. Extending across two banks of the Senegal River, the Commune is bounded to the east by Kontéla Commune and Oualia Commune, to the north Tomora Commune and Sidibéla Commune, to the south by Mahina Commune and to the west by Diamou Commune of Kayes Cercle. The climate is Sahelian. The June to October rainy season accounts for all the less than 900 mm of precipitation a year. While hot year round by temperate standards, a hot season lasts from roughly February to June, and a cooler season runs from roughly November to February. Maximum yearly temperature may reach 41 °C in the shade. =Vegetation= The Sahel landscape of the Commune is made up of grasslands punctuated by trees, often large. These include the baobab, the rônier, raffia palm (from which textiles, rope, and palm oil is made), shea (from which Shea Butter is made), duguto, and néré trees. Population and culture Bafoulabé had a population of 16,670 in 1998 and 19,955 in 2009. Prior to colonialism, Bafoulabé had been a thriving commercial center. The construction of the Dakar Bamako railway in the early 20th century bypassed the river trade, making Kayes the center of commercial activity in the area. Jim Jones.

The picture focuses on the competition between naval fixed-wing and airship pilots to reach the South Pole by air. The female lead is played to Fay Wray. The action scenes feature the stars Jack Holt and Ralph Graves, who also played fliers two years earlier in Capra's 1929 airborne adventure Flight. This film had been intended to emulate the success of Wings (1927), another production with a similar plot. Dirigible was characterized as \\"marginally science fictional\\" by scifilm.org. (Capra later planned to make a fully science fictional movie but was never able to.)Sindelar, David. \\"'Dirigible' (1931)\\". scifilm.org, 2008. Retrieved March 21, 2010. Plot When the famed explorer Louis Rondelle (Hobart Bosworth) requests the U.S. Navy's assistance in reaching the South Pole, officer Jack Bradon (Jack Holt) convinces Rear Admiral John S. Martin (Emmett Corrigan) to offer his dirigible, the USS Pensacola, for the attempt. Jack asks his best friend, \\"Frisky\\" Pierce (Ralph Graves), to pilot the biplane that will be carried on the airship. Frisky, who is adventurous to the point of recklessness, is eager to go even though he has just completed a record-setting coast-to-coast flight and has barely spent any time with his wife, Helen (Fay Wray). Basking in the acclaim, he has even forgotten to read the sealed love letter she gave him to open when he arrived. Helen loves Frisky but cannot make him believe how much she is hurt by the risks he takes. She sees Jack without her husband's knowledge and begs him to drop Frisky from the expedition, and for the sake of their marriage, not tell him why. Jack, who also loves her, agrees. Frisky, assuming Jack does not want to share the fame, ends their friendship. The expedition soon ends in disaster: the Pensacola breaks in two and crashes into the ocean during a storm. Frisky participates in the rescue of the expedition by aircraft carrier. He now gets a leave of absence from the Navy to pilot a Fokker Trimotor transport aircraft for Rondelle's next attempt at the South Pole. This proves too much for Helen. When she is unable to get Frisky to change his mind, she gives him another sealed letter (to be read when he reaches the Pole), but this time it says that she is divorcing him and will ask Jack to marry her. Frisky, Rondelle, Sock McGuire (Roscoe Karns), and Hansen (Harold Goodwin) reach the South Pole. When Frisky suggests landing on the snow, Rondelle accepts his judgment that there will be no danger. But in fact the aircraft flips over and bursts into flames, destroying most of their supplies. Rondelle's leg is broken and Sock's foot is injured. After radioing their base camp, they attempt to walk the 900 miles back to it, dragging Rondelle on a sled. Rondelle soon dies and is buried. Later, Frisky has to amputate Sock's foot. When Sock realizes he is too much of a burden, he drags himself away to die while the other two are sleeping. They carry on, but Hansen breaks down when he finds they have been going in a circle and have returned to Rondelle's grave. Frisky refuses to give up and forces Hansen to continue on. When Helen hears the news of the crash, she realizes no longer wants a divorce and wishes she could go to Frisky. Jack realizes he can, and talks Rear Admiral Martin into letting him attempt a rescue with his new dirigible, the USS Los Angeles. The two survivors are found and rescued. On the way back, Frisky remembers that he has again forgotten to read Helen's letter, but he has snow blindness and asks Jack to read it to him. Jack quickly substitutes his own improvised version, in which Helen is proud of his accomplishment and waiting for her husband with undiminished love. He then destroys the letter. When they return, Frisky uncharacteristically skips a ticker tape parade through New York City to be with his wife. He is the first to mention the contents of the letter; to Helen's great relief, she realizes that Jack has not only brought Frisky back to her but also saved their marriage.

Shot at Lakehurst, New Jersey, at the hangar that would house the U.S. Navy and later the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg. The Navy gave \\"its full resources at Lakehurst\\" including the pride of the fleet, the USS Los Angeles to lend an air of authenticity to the production.McBride 1992, p. 224. The Los Angeles was featured prominently and also portrayed the fictional USS Pensacola. US Navy Lieutenant Commander Frank \\"Spig\\" Wead, a former pilot, was given the story credit and stayed on as a technical consultant. As production began, the old Arcadia airfield was converted into a set, complete with \\"artificial snow, fake ice mounds and painted backdrop attached to the back side of the dilapidated Army barracks.\\" With principal photography slated for September, dry ice in metal containers stuffed in actor's mouths sufficed for the usual Arctic breath.

The aircraft carrier USS Lexington, with her 8-inch guns, can be spotted in the background during the takeoff of an aircraft. The aerial cinematography was coordinated by Elmer Dyer. Reception Dirigible was Capra's and Columbia's first film to be given prominence with a premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, but despite high hopes, the film received lukewarm reviews.Scherle and Levy 1977, p. 92.

Early and personal life Born in New York City, he was the second of four sons of Harry Scharaga Sherry and Mildred “Minnie” (Walman) Sherry, and is Jewish.\\"Norm Sherry,\\" Society for American Baseball Research. Both sides of the family were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and his maternal great-grandfather was a rabbi. The families escaped separately from anti-semitic pogroms. Some of his relatives who settled in Europe were killed in the Holocaust. His paternal grandparents, Max and Sarah Scharaga, came to the United States in 1898, and around 1920 his father changed their surname to Sherry. His father worked in the dry cleaning business, and his mother Mildred was a seamstress and milliner. The Sherry family moved to Los Angeles during the early 1930s.  Baseball career  Sherry attended Fairfax High School, and signed with the Dodgers while they were still in their original home of Brooklyn in . His brothers, George and Larry Sherry, were pitchers in professional baseball. Larry had a successful, 11-season MLB career as a relief pitcher and was the Most Valuable Player of the 1959 World Series; he was Norm's teammate from 1959 through 1962 and on May 7, 1960, they became the first all-Jewish battery in Major League Baseball history.

By the time Norm reached the Dodgers, in 1959 for a two- game \\"cup of coffee,\\" he was 28 years of age and the team was based in his home city of Los Angeles. He made the team as second-string backstop (behind John Roseboro) from through . In , Sherry's advice contributed to the career turnaround of left-handed pitcher Sandy Koufax, perhaps the greatest southpaw hurler in baseball history. Sherry and Koufax were the Dodger battery against the Minnesota Twins in a spring training game in Orlando, Florida, and Koufax was struggling with his control, up to then a career-long problem. After Koufax had walked the first three hitters he faced, Sherry went out to the mound and said: \\"'Why don’t you take something off the ball and just put it in there? Don’t try to throw it so hard. Just put it in there and let them hit it.' I went back behind the plate. Good God! He tried to ease up, and he was throwing harder than when he tried to. We came off the field, and I said, 'Sandy, I don’t know if you realize it, but you just now threw harder than when you were trying to.'\\" As for Sherry, he batted .283 with eight home runs in a part-time role in 1960, but his statistics suffered as he sat on the bench, or in the bullpen, in 1961–62.\\"Norm Sherry Stats,\\" Baseball- Reference.com.

The population in 2011 was 10,647,Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 75.11 km². It is a planned city built in the 1980s, to serve the region's oil industry. It is, from all of Santiago do Cacém's parishes, the one nearer to the sea and it is surrounded as follows: to the North, by Melides; to the West, by the Atlantic Ocean; to the East, by Santiago do Cacém and Santa Cruz; and to the South, by Sines. It is one of the youngest cities in the world with approximately two years as a city and 30 years since it was founded. It is mostly a residential suburb for the industrial city of Sines, from which is about 10 miles. Origin  The choice of Saint Andrew for patron of the Church that would give name to the present city (Cidade de Vila Nova de Santo André) and village (Aldeia de Santo André), simultaneously, is easily understood: Saint Andrew, brother of Saint Peter, was, like him, a fisherman, and the first of the two to meet and follow Christ. His life is intimately connected to the sea and fishing culture as so was that of the people who lived in Aldeia de Santo André. It was promoted to city (Cidade) in 2003 History Surrounding the first church of Santo André the first houses sprung, as is natural, and, as expected, it inhabitants were deeply connected to the religious cult. Some of them preserved the church (where an old cemetery use to lay), while others were related to the fishing activities in Santo André's lagoon and others, still, were economically linked to the region's annual fair (that still exists nowadays). According to Father António Macedo e Silva, a precious source of information about the municipality of Santiago do Cacém, Santo André was created after other parishes in the municipality, either during the reign of D. João I (1385–1433) or during the reign of D. Duarte (1433–1438). All the rural parishes of this time, except for Santo André, already existed in the year of 1528. Either created in the 15th century or not, it is known for a fact that the parish already existed in the 16th century, with half a dozen houses that lived in the shadow of the Church who had given name to this place and whose population lived of the exploration of the lagoon, soil and fair commerce. According to the obtained information there was, in the Church, a \\"very thick book and very old with a cover of sheep wool\\", that certainly must have contained records of baptisms, deaths and marriages, as well as other important documents referring to the life of the locals. It is known, however, that the Church was built in 1834. Santo André, first a parish then a village, started to turn into a meeting point for people of the land and people of the sea. The main income source was the rice culture. The rice cycle, that started in 1804, would only end in 1974, when the Gabinete da Área de Sines (an organism created on June 19, 1971, that created and managed the Santo André as an Urban Center up until the December 29, 1988, when it was extinct) started a new cycle that would come to be known as concrete cycle. In the beginning of 1973, taking advantage of the oil exploration in that was taking place in Cabinda and providing huge amounts of oil, the Portuguese government decided to create and industrial complex destined to implant the petrochemical exploration in the country, and thus make a stand in the European context where industries of this type were already being developed and used to create wealth. Thus, the Urban Center of Santo André was born, which would be raised to city on July 1, 2003. Prior to this large expropriations took place, and an area (integrated between the municipality of Santiago and Sines) was delineated for the birth of Santo André. The industrial platform eventually grew and came to be known as Complexo Petroquímico de Sines (Sines' Petrochemical Complex), where the country's largest oil refinery, Petrogal (former Petrosul), as well as other important industries (among which a thermal electrical power station and the to-be-biggest port of Europe), still operates. As there was a preoccupation with the environment as well as with the health of the industrial complex's workers, Santo André was kept at a minimum distance of 10 km and a pine forest that works as a protection from eventual catastrophe.

It is very near the sea (2 km) and also near the Alentejo Southwest and Vicentyne Coast, a protected area. Its climate is temperate, with monthly means ranging from 8 to 16 °C in the winter and 18 to 28 °C in the summer. Absolute extremes are 0 °C in winter and 41 °C in summer. In terms of precipitation, the climate is somewhat dry, with annual mean of 570–620 mm falling mostly between November and April. Thin-sand soil can be found in some places and in the city there are a lot of pine trees. There are some extensive sandy beaches within. The extensive forest that protects Santo André is a good example of possible respect between the protection of the environment and the industrial development. Economy Santo André was built during the 1970s to answer the housing needs of the workers of the industrial complex of Sines. For the next two decades it attracted inhabitants from all over the country and especially people from Portugal's African ex-colonies. These people were mainly skilled technicians and people with an average education (9th–12th grade) or higher (university). This originated a very young population with a wealth considerably higher than the national average. Santo André's inhabitants enjoy a higher-than-average living quality, for which the beaches, as well as the proximity of the Natural Park of Southwest Alentejo and Costa Vicentina, help contribute. Sines, only a few minutes from Santo André, by car, is one of the most dynamic cities of the Alentejo, having kept all its historical charm. It still represents a main center for development in the province of Alentejo, especially since the University was built in Santo André. Before Santo André was built the locals made their livings from fishing (in the sea and in the lagoon), agriculture (mainly rice) and fairs. Nowadays, industry is very important to the economy, giving work to thousands of the people of Santo André. Local commerce is also important, but on a smaller scale.  Demographics  Santo André occupies an area of 74.32 km² with a population of 10,751 (1991 census), most of whom are Roman Catholic. In the beginning of 2005 it was considered to have about 14,000 inhabitants.  Patrimony  = Historical = * Igreja Paroquial de Santo André - 18th century :Built in Santo André, and rebuilt in 1815, Baroque style, it possesses a beautiful porch from the Manueline architecture of the 16th century, that had belonged to the initial church and under which people are nowadays baptized. * Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Graça - 18th century :Also of Baroque style, this fountain was built in 1744, in a pleasant place outside Aldeia de Santo André. It owes its name to a previously existing fountain. * Igreja de Santa Maria - 20th century :Built in Vila Nova de Santo André, this modern style church was inaugurated on December 8, 1993. On the inside, one can appreciate the Via Sacra, a creation of artist Graça Lagrifa. On the outside there is a tile panel, with an image of Mary, by Chloe Mac Millan. = Natural = Beaches There are beaches of fine sand. The paths of the \\"Blue Coast\\" (as it is classified) seem to characterize the landscape of Alentejo. The first impression one has (when in Portugal) when talking about the Alentejo is the image of a burning plain (this is one of Portugal's hottest regions). However, there are dozens of kilometers of beach throughout the coast of Alentejo, ranging from Sado's southern margin (in Tróia) to the beginning of the Algarve. The giant extension of sand that connects Tróia to Sines, with over 60 km, has some of the best beaches in Portugal (better water quality, cleaner sand and water, as well as good surf spots, than most of the country). They include: * \\"Costa\\" (Coast) beach - has watchers; good for surfing, windsurfing and fishing. * \\"Areias Brancas\\" (White Sands) beach - ideal windsurf conditions. * \\"Fonte do Cortiço\\" (Cork Fountain) beach - good windsurf conditions and considered one of this area's natural sanctuaries. * \\"Monte Velho\\" (Old Mountain) beach - good windsurf conditions; classified by the Environment Ministry as a Golden Beach for presenting itself as one of the best-preserved beaches in the country; it is a part of the protected area of the Lagoons of Sancha and Santo André and contains several walking trails through its dunes, that lead to places of natural and ecological value. Lagoons Santo André Lagoon, near the sea Up to the 17th century, Santo André's Lagoon this lagoon was called Lagoa de Pêra (Pear Lagoon) and was always communicating with the sea Nowadays it is kept \\"closed\\" from contact with the sea most of the time, but sometimes (for health purposes) the water is \\"renewed\\". The lagoon and the beach are a perfect match when it comes to creating a splendid place on its calm waters, with the green from the wild pine trees and low flights of birds their combination makes for a heavenly place to rest, defining the most direct contact in nature-type holidays. It is considered a Wet Spot of International Importance, for there are some bird species that do their nests in its surrounding and for being the biggest lagoon system of all of Alentejo's Coast, offering a landscape of particular interest and great natural conditions, a fundamental aspect of attraction to becoming a great tourist center in a delicate and tranquil environment. Its connection to the sea is made once per year - by Man - in Spring, thus matching the reproduction periods of numerous marine species. The nature reserve of the Lagoons of Santo André and Sancha is one of the most emblematic places of Santo André, one where we can enjoy the variety of fauna and flora of this region, and which is chosen for the protection of a very rich diversity of aquatic birds: ducks, geese, cranes, grebes, curlews, gannets and coots, that used to be hunted every year. It is also the passing ground for many migratory birds. There are some otter shelters in the Lagoons.

It also has a secondary school named Padre António Macedo which is an extended secondary school, with students from the 7th grade to the 12th grade. Santo André, although small, contains a University Campus made up by Instituto Superior de Estudos Interculturais e Transdisciplinares, loosely translated as \\"Higher Education Institute for Intercultural and Transdiciplinary Studies\\" and has based its teaching policy in the region's characteristics: Sines' industries, the lacks of the Alentejo interior and its potential as a tourist region. To find a suitable example between the academic environment and Santo André's surroundings one needs only to go to the beach after school. This institute's activity was started in the year 2002. The following courses can be studied: *Human Motricity *Tourism and Hotel Management The latter one is supported actively by a local Hotel, Vila Park, a project associated with the Piaget Institute. The Higher Education School of Health will be teaching health- related subjects in the future. The campus has labs, computer rooms and a library, as well as facilities for sports and services. Other facilities include: an amphitheatre, an auditorium, a fitness gym, a psycomotion therapy room and an exposition room.

Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge located in southern New Jersey along the Atlantic coast north of Atlantic City, in Atlantic and Ocean counties. The refuge was created in 1984 out of two existing refuge parcels created to protect tidal wetland and shallow bay habitat for migratory water birds. The Barnegat Division (established in 1967) is located in Ocean County on the inland side of Barnegat Bay. The Brigantine Division (established in 1939) is located approximately 10 miles (16 km) north of Atlantic City along the south bank of the mouth of the Mullica River. The two divisions are separated by approximately 20 miles (32 km). The refuge is located along most active flight paths of the Atlantic Flyway, making it an important link in the network of national wildlife refuges administered nationwide by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Forsythe Refuge is a part of the Hudson River/New York Bight Ecosystem and The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. The refuge is named for Edwin B. Forsythe, conservationist Congressman from New Jersey. Description The Refuge protects more than 40,000 acres (162 km2) of southern New Jersey Coastal Habitats and tidal wetlands. 6,000 acres (24 km2) of the refuge are designated as a wilderness area, meaning that public access is limited or even entirely prohibited at times. These areas include Holgate and Little Beach, two of the few remaining undeveloped barrier beaches in the state. Here the rare piping plover and other beach-nesting birds raise their young. Great blue heron The beach areas provide fragile ecosystems for birds whose populations have already been impacted by development, so Holgate is closed to all public during the nesting season; Little Beach is closed all year except by special permit for research or education. Almost 90% of Forsythe Refuge is tidal salt marsh, interspersed with shallow coves and bays. Each year thousands of ducks and geese, wading birds and shorebirds concentrate here during spring and fall migration, making the Refuge a good site for birdwatching, nature photography and related activities. More than 3,000 acres (12 km2) of the Refuge are woodlands with a wide variety of tree and plant species, thus also providing vital habitat for a variety of upland species such as songbirds, woodcock, white-tailed deer and box turtles. Primary access to this refuge is by automobile and bicycle. While there are no specific guided programs, visitors may drive an eight-mile (13 km) long trail over dams guided by a brochure which points out the various features. Foot travelers can walk one of four trails which range from 1/4 mile () to in length. Sedimentary Pollution A team from the University of Pennsylvania and the British Geological Survey have measured organic pollutants and mercury in the sediments within the refuge and Barnegat Bay and Little Egg Harbor. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were found in low amounts in creek and marsh sediments. Evaluation of the PAH compound distribution suggested that most of the creeks received small amounts of PAH derived from burning of wood or coal and or traffic sources.

Early life Sciarra was born in Seymour, Indiana on February 7, 1954. He graduated from Seymour High School in 1972 and went on to attend Indiana Central College, graduating in 1976. Sicarra worked as a teacher for a year before deciding to become a professional wrestler. Professional wrestling career Rip Rogers started wrestling in 1977. He formed the \\"Convertible Blondes\\" with Pez Whatley and Gary Royal in Angelo Poffo's International Championship Wrestling (ICW) and won the Tag Team Titles with Royal. As with The Fabulous Freebirds defending regional NWA tag team championships with any two of the three members, the Convertible Blondes also used the so-called \\"Freebird Rule\\" to defend the ICW Tag Team Championship in this manner. He left the ICW following a dispute with Angelo Poffo's son Randy Poffo, better known by his ring name Randy Savage. In 1979, Rogers went to the National Wrestling Alliance's Portland territory, Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he was aligned with Buddy Rose and Ed Wiskoski. He would also make trips to Vancouver's All-Star Wrestling. In 1984, he went to the Mid-Atlantic territory, Jim Crockett Promotions, where he formed \\"The Hollywood Blonds\\" with Ted Oates and won the National Tag Team Titles. By early 1986, he was in the Memphis territory, Continental Wrestling Association, feuding with Dutch Mantel. In September 1986, \\"The Hustler,\\" managed by his then-wife Brenda Britton, joined Continental Championship Wrestling and immediately feuded with \\"The Exotic\\" Adrian Street and Miss Linda, until leaving the Gulf Coast area in March 1987. Rogers wrestled as a heel in Bob Geigel's Central States promotion during most of 1987. The Ripper spent most of 1988 and 1989 in Calgary Stampede Wrestling. Strangely given his history and reputation he was mainly a lower to mid card performer. Yet he always seemed to get a rise out of the crowd as an antagonizing heel. Rogers received a small push near the end of his run in Stampede (the territory shut up shop at the end of '89). When he teamed with longtime Stampede veteran Kerry Brown as part of the Midnight Cowboys tag team. They had a running feud with popular International Tag Team Champs Bad Company, which included Bruce Hart & Flyin' Brian Pillman. In 1989, he wrestled for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) in Puerto Rico as one of their top heels with partner Abbuda Dein. He was back in the NWA in time for it to be renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW) he wrestled in WCW from 1991 to 1994 as a jobber and he lost several matches to Pillman. Rogers later substituted for Pillman, being the scapegoat in the ill-fated Yellow Dog angle. His biggest win was at Battlebowl in 1993 where he teamed with Road Warrior Hawk and defeated Davey Boy Smith & Booker T (then named Kole). By late 1993, he had left WCW for the Global Wrestling Federation where he joined The Cartel, which included Scotty Anthony, Makhan Singh and Cactus Jack. They were the top heels for several months and he created a lot of havoc while there. After that run, he occasionally wrestled in the United States, wrestling for a time with a promotion in Indianapolis known as Circle City Wrestling. He finally settled in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in 1997. He teamed with Dave the Rave and formed the \\"Suicide Blondes\\" with Jason Lee. When he retired from active competition in 2000, he was named head trainer at OVW. At the age of 48, Rogers was hit by a car and sustained injuries which forced him to completely retire from in-ring competition; according to a 2011 story on OVW, the accident left him \\"with a stiff limp\\". Rogers currently runs an advanced wrestling class at OVW, where he teaches up and coming wrestlers. As head trainer for OVW, Rogers has been involved in training over thirty wrestlers who appeared in WWE or Impact Wrestling, notably including Brock Lesnar, John Cena, Mark Henry, Dave Bautista, and Randy Orton. Rogers was known for his berserk reaction after losing a match. Even after being cleanly pinned, Rogers would vociferously protest to the referee that his opponent had cheated. Usually, he would claim that his hair or trunks had been pulled by the other wrestler to score the victory. These claims would be accompanied by a frenzied voice and wild pantomimes of hair and trunk pulling. Rip also fought in 3 pro boxing matches in 1996 at 41 years old. His record stands at 1 win, 1 loss, 1 draw, with 1 TKO. He was trained by longtime friend Bobby 'Sweetpain' Duchi a veteran pro boxer, kickboxer, and champion weightlifter.  Other media  Rip made an appearance in the 1993 music video for \\"Human Wheels\\" by fellow Seymour native John Mellencamp. Rip has done some appearances on The Pat McAfee show podcast while it was part of Barstool Sports. Personal life Sciarra is married.

A founding member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), circa 1930 Golos became involved in the covert work of Soviet intelligence agencies. He participated in procuring American passports by means of fraudulent documentation, and the recruitment and coordination of activities of a broad network of agents. Biography =Early years= Yakov Naumovich Reizen was born April 24, 1889, in Ekaterinoslav, Russian Empire, since 2016 known as Dnipro in Ukraine, to a Jewish family.Svetlana Chervonnaya, \\"Jacob Golos (1889-1943),\\" Documents Talk, www.documentstalk.com/ Yakov's father worked as a shop assistant.

Moscow: \\"International relations\\", 2003. A revolutionary from a young age, Reizen joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1904, becoming active in the group's Bolshevik wing headed by V.I. Lenin.This information imported from the Golos biography at Russian Wikipedia, version of February 18, 2011. He participated in the 1905 Revolution, serving as a member of the first soviet of Ekaterinoslav, the city known today as Dnipro. In 1906 Reizen organized an illegal revolutionary printing press, for which he was arrested in the last days of that year. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to eight years of hard labor, a term ultimately commuted by the government of Tsar Nikolai II to lifetime exile to Yakutia in northern Siberia. =Emigration to America= Reizen escaped by fleeing to the east, traveling to the United States by way of China and via a ship from Japan. In the United States at some point, he adopted the surname \\"Golos,\\" by which he will subsequently be known here. In 1909 Golos reached San Francisco, California, where he obtained work in a print shop as a pressman. By 1912, Golos had found his way to New York City, where he helped to raise funds for political prisoners in Russia. Golos was active in the Russian Socialist Federation in May 1915 he gained membership in the Socialist Party of America when the Russian Federation joined that party.Tim Davenport, \\"Russian Federations,\\" Early American Marxism website, www.marxisthistory.org/ Golos returned to California in 1917, where he supported himself by working for fruit picking and packing firms. He also worked as an organizer for the Socialist Party of California. He remained in California until 1919. Toward the end of August 1919, Golos was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Federation by the organization's 5th Convention, held in Detroit, Michigan. Immediately after the close of the Detroit gathering, Golos and a number of his comrades in the Russian Federation, including Alexander Stoklitsky and Nicholas Hourwich, traveled to Chicago to attend another convention. This one established the Communist Party of America, forerunner of the Communist Party, USA.\\"Golos/Reisen, Yakov Naumovich,\\" Russian State Archive for Social and Political History (RGASPI), Moscow, f. 17, op. 98, d. 8536, ll. 2, 3, 5. In his personal history and personnel forms written in Moscow in 1926, Golos dated his work as a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Section (New York) as from 1919-1925. In December 1922, Golos was elected to the nine-member Bureau of the Russian Federation of the Workers Party of America, the \\"legal\\" public face of the then-underground Communist Party of America. In 1921-1922, Golos worked as an organizer at the Communist Party HQ in Chicago. In 1922-1923 he was an organizer for the organization in its Detroit district. In 1923 Golos became head of the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, one of the party's technological aid initiatives; he worked in that capacity until 1926.John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America.

In 1926 Golos traveled to the Soviet Union as a participant in the American \\"Kuzbas\\" (Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony), located near the Russian city of Kemerovo. His membership was transferred to the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), the VKP(b), in this interval. When the Kuzbas project was essentially terminated in 1927, Golos was transferred to Moscow. There he was offered a job in a book publishing house. In 1927 a Communist Party-sponsored travel agency, called World Tourists, Inc.s, was established. Golos would later become closely connected to it in the United States.\\"Report of the Sub-Committee of the Central Control Committee to the Central Control Committee on the World Tourists, Inc. , Personal Papers Relating to Jacob Golos, Silvermaster file vol. 146 (FBI file 65-14603), serial 3687, pp. 25-28. (pdf pp. 68-71). Originally started as an economic venture intended to help subsidize the Communist Party's press, the firm ultimately served not only as the coordinator of propaganda tours to the Soviet Union but also as a means to facilitate the travel of party officials and Soviet agents between the USSR and the USA, sometimes under the cover of falsified documentation. In September 1928, American Communist Party leader Jay Lovestone, noting Golos' \\"significant influence among the Russian working masses in the United States,\\" sent an appeal to the Central Committee of the VKP(b) to have Golos be returned to the United States for work. He made a second appeal along these lines in December 1928, and Golos returned to the United States around January 1929. =Espionage activity= Golos settled again in New York City, this time in the borough of the Bronx. He worked as the business manager of Novyi Mir (New World), the Communist Party's Russian-language newspaper, based in New York. . Included in Golos' activities was coordination of the CPUSA's operation to produce false passports for party members wanting to travel abroad. Golos remained in charge of the passport operation until turning the job over to Hungarian party functionary J. Peters, who also served as a link with the Soviet intelligence in 1930s. According to Peters' biographer the transfer took place in 1932. In the spring of 1930, Golos became involved in the Communist Party's \\"machinery of investigations,\\" charged with keeping tabs with the activities of a number of labor unions and party-affiliated mass organizations. He appears to have begun working for the secret intelligence apparatus of the Soviet Union by this time, as it was in 1930 that he is first referred to in archival documents as a \\"reliable man.\\" According to archival notes taken in the early 1990s by Alexander Vassiliev, a former KGB foreign intelligence officer and journalist, Golos' initial contact seems to have been with the GPU's New York station chief, Chivin (\\"Smith\\"). Another interpretation of the documents, favored by historian Svetlana Chervonnaya, argues that first contact was made by Abram Einhorn (\\"Taras\\"), a Soviet intelligence agent who worked in the United States from 1930 to 1934. It is clear that by the early 1930s, Golos was in the employ of Soviet intelligence. By the start of 1933, Golos was heading the Communist Party's World Tourists venture, an operation that generated revenue and provided funds for various CPUSA activities. Golos was active in the acquisition and supply of American naturalization papers and birth certificates, which were used to obtain American passports to \\"legalize\\" Soviet intelligence agents around the world — initially in Europe and Asia, but later in the Americas as well. In order to convert these fraudulent application papers into authentic passports, Golos worked closely with a clerk in the Brooklyn passport office. That person had been recruited because of his vulnerability of a gambling addiction. During this period Golos was identified by his Soviet intelligence handlers with the code name \\"Sound\\" — a pun on his adopted surname of Golos, the Russian word for \\"voice.\\"Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies, pg. 497. Throughout the 1930s Golos was a member of the CPUSA's Central Control Commission, a body in charge of party discipline, background investigations, and audits. He could assist in the recruitment and verification of potential agents on behalf of Soviet intelligence. As head of World Tourists, Golos visited the Soviet Union every year from 1932 onward to attend the celebrations of the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. This coincidentally gave him an opportunity to bring his Russian-born wife and American-born son there in 1936, so that his son could receive \\"a Soviet education.\\" In 1937, the pair gained Soviet citizenship. The last of these visits took place in 1937, during the height of the Ezhovshchina (or the Great Purge)— the mass campaign by Stalin of secret police terror in which millions of Soviet citizens suspected of political disloyalty, espionage, or economic crime were arrested, and hundreds of thousands executed. Millions more were sent to the brutal labor camps of the Gulag.For a sampling of current scholarship on the \\"Great Terror\\" of 1937-38, see Barry McLoughlin and Kevin McDermott (eds.), Stalin's Terror: High Politics and Mass Repression in the Soviet Union. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. Upon his return to the United States in January 1938, Golos confirmed at a session of the governing Political Committee of the American Communist Party that there was indeed a mass secret police operation in effect in the USSR. Golos' faith in the communist cause seems to have remained unshaken in the aftermath. Vassiliev's notes revealed that in late 1940, Golos recruited author Ernest Hemingway, assigning him the code name: \\"Argo\\"; the author had offered to work covertly for the Soviets. From 1940 onward Golos was subject to the Foreign Agent Registration Act. While he did not curtail his NKVD activities, he had to assume he was under FBI surveillance. Moscow became nervous at the risk of him being arrested and made attempts to convince him to return to Russia. Worried that if he returned to the Soviet Union he would be jailed or killed, Golos not only refused to share his sources with other NKVD officers, but he also told them that he had hidden a sealed envelope containing details of Russia's spy operations in America. In 1941, Golos had set up a commercial forwarding enterprise, called the U.S. Shipping and Service Corporation. He assigned Elizabeth Bentley, his assistant, courier and lover, as one of its officers. The pair occupied a suite in the Commodore Hotel, in New York City, across the street from Amtorg. In 1942, Golos transferred a Communist cell of engineers headed by Julius Rosenberg into direct contact with Soviet intelligence operatives in New York. The cell provided information on newest developments in electrical and radio engineering to the XY Line of the NKGB foreign intelligence. The XY Line began efforts to penetrate the Manhattan Project, code-named ENORMOUS (ENORMOZ). Sometime in November 1943, Golos met in New York with key figures of one of the so-called \\"information groups\\" of the CPUSA, which would come to be known as the Perlo group. Its members worked in several government departments and agencies in Washington, D.C. and provided information to the CPUSA leader, Browder, the General Secretary of the Communist Party USA. =Death and legacy= Golos suffered a series of heart attacks during the first years of the 1940s. On November 27, 1943, a fatal heart attack ended his life while he was sleeping with Elizabeth Bentley. Immediately Bentley began a search for a secret file that Golos had kept to protect himself from being recalled to Russia; she destroyed it. Following his death, Bentley took over Golos's espionage operations. The code name Zvuk (Sound) appears in the Venona decryptions as a Soviet source; this has been identified as Jacob Golos. In these decrypts, Golos is identified as an \\"illegal colleague,\\" generally meaning a Soviet officer or professional agent who operated without the protection of diplomatic or official status with a Soviet embassy or consulate. Soviet officers with the latter status were said to be \\"legal.\\" Golos's legacy can be read about in books by Harry Dexter White, Nathan G. Silvermaster, and Elizabeth Bentley.

Gauge The Budenberg Gauge Company was founded in 1918. The original parent company was Schäffer & Budenberg founded in 1850 by and in Prussia. The Budenberg Gauge Company is now based in Irlam, Salford. The company is renowned for the manufacture of high quality pressure gauges, thermometers, valves and manifolds. Budenberg also produce monoflanges and close coupled systems, chemical seals, hygienic seals, and transmitters.  Early history  In 1849, B. Schäffer patented the design of a diaphragm pressure gauge. The following year he formed a business partnership with his brother-in-law C.F. Budenberg, The Schäffer & Budenberg Machinery & Boiler Fittings Company, in the altstadt of the Prussian town of Magdeburg Germany. They began manufacturing pressure gauges and all items relating the steam industry. In 1858 they moved to purpose built premises on Schoenebecker Strasse in the suburb of Buckau. The company became known by the shorter name of The Schäffer & Budenberg Manufacturing Company (S&B;) \\"a special factory for the production of fine mechanical instruments\\". However, locally in Buckau they were always known as 'Schäffers'. Export success on the back of the every increasing steam industry led to the formation of manufacturing and sales subsidiaries all over the world. In c1875 the company produced its first Bourdon type pressure gauges thanks to the expiry of patents. They opened American Schäffer & Budenberg office & factory in Brooklyn, New York in 1876, and briefly a second factory in Foxboro, Massachusetts. They had 5 factories, 4 depots, 25 offices and numerous agencies over five continents by the beginning of WWI employing nearly 8,000.  The Manchester connection  The company's history in Manchester began in 1855 when Arnold Budenberg, the younger brother of C.F. Budenberg, established a sales office in St. Mary's Gate. A Glasgow office opened in Hope Street in 1861. In 1876 the assembly of pressure gauges and other instruments began in Manchester. Arnold's son Fred Budenberg took over the running of the Manchester operation in 1888. The company continued to expand and relocated to a larger factory in Whitworth Street in 1896. In the decades running up to the First World War and the race for naval superiority, products had to be made in Britain if the company wanted to sell to the British Admiralty. To cement this the company was registered as British in 1902, even though it was still almost completely owned and controlled from Germany.  First World War  In 1914, the company moved from Whitworth Street to a new purpose built factory at Woodfield Road, Broadheath, Altrincham. Following the outbreak of war with Germany, Schaeffer & Budenberg was one of many German owned companies in the United Kingdom to be expropriated by the British Crown. Following the seizure of the company's Manchester subsidiary, Fred Budenberg (who was British born), was ordered to continue to run the business by the British Government for the duration of the war. Both of Fred's sons were fighting for the British in France. In 1917 Fred bought the company back from the British Crown, with the proviso by the Crown that all Board Directors were English born, and so the Budenberg Gauge Company Ltd. was formed and shares were held by a Public Trustee. The American branch was taken over by the Alien Property Custodian in 1917 and sold off in May 1919 to the American Gauge and Valve Co, with no continuing family connection, although it continued to operate as an independent entity until 1923. American Gauge was then bought by Manning Maxwell Moore and S&B; continued as a separate division, even though sometimes working from the same premises. The Italian branch was liquidated by the Italian Government in 1915. The company business connections in St. Petersburg, Riga, Moscow, Vladivostock & Kiev were severed with the war and the Russian Revolution. The South American agencies stayed connected with the German company. The French and Belgian offices continued to operate by the Germans during the war. The Swedish and Swiss offices continued in a lesser way in neutral territories. The Polish, Czech and Austrian factories continued to operate as they were essential to the German war effort. The Warsaw factory ceased operations at the end of 1918, but there was a factory at Lodz at one period. A new office started in The Hague in 1918, and the offices in Lille and Liege continued after the war. During the huge inflation of 1923 in Germany the factory had problems with output and cash flow. Hitler's early preparations for the 1939-1945 war ensured the Germany company's existence and growth. During the Second World War the Magdeburg-Buckau factory was badly bombed and 60% of it was destroyed. It continued to operate under the Schaeffer & Budenberg name until 1946 when it was taken over and run by the Soviets as a form of war reparation. Its name was changed to the Karl Marx Messgeräte & Armaturenwerke in the newly communist East Germany. The British company, Budenberg Gauge continued to provide gauges for all areas of pressure work and flourished after a slow period in the 1950s due to the inability to source raw materials post WWII.  Later history  In 1961 the individual states agencies for Australia came back under Budenberg Gauge Co., and Budenberg Australia Pty Ltd was set up with a factory in Melbourne. Two years later a third factory was opened in Amlwch, Anglesey. Budenberg Gauge remained a family-owned company from its inception in 1850 until 1991 when it was sold to Burnfield plc. In 2002 the company vacated its historic Broadheath factory and moved to Irlam, where it continues to manufacture pressure gauges and accessories. In 1996 DH-Budenberg was established from the merger of Desgranges & Huot from France (known widely as \\"DH\\") and the calibration division of Budenberg Gauge Co. Budenberg had been manufacturing pressure calibration equipment - deadweight testers and calibrators - since the 1920s. The newly formed company DH-Budenberg Group has since expanded the calibration equipment produced, to a wide range of primary standard & premium industrial pressure calibration equipment, which now includes: automated primary pressure standards, manual primary standards, differential primary standards, automatic pressure controllers, hydraulic, pneumatic, and portable deadweight testers, and a range of portable calibrators. Along with manufacturing bases in Manchester UK, Paris France & Rodgau Germany, recent DH-Budenberg expansion has included opening new offices in San Marcos - Texas, Dubai - UAE, Chennai - India, Singapore, & Perth - Australia.

The Castle is similar to medieval monuments in France. The structure was built by local craftsmen with bricks taken from two other archaeological sites, the Achaemenid Darius/Dariush castle and the Elamite Choqazanbil ziggurat. It is built atop a hill (\\"tappeh\\") which may contain other relics of past times. It is an example of the pre-scientific era of archaeology, when explorers mutilated or destroyed sites in the process of examining them. The former French government property was taken over by the Islamic Republic after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. It is now used as a museum. Its best-known holding is a cuneiform tablet inscribed with the Code of Hammurabi, however this is now on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.

While vice- consul in Marseilles, France between 1941 and 1944, he gave documents of citizenship to dozens of Turkish Jews living in France who did not have proper identity papers, to save them from deportation to the Nazi gas chambers. Biography =Early life and education= Necdet Kent was born in 1911 in Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire and got his secondary education from Galatasaray Lycee, as did some of his colleagues in the foreign ministry. He travelled to the United States for his university studies, earning a degree in public law from New York University. =Career= Returning to Turkey, Kent entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1937. He was first posted as vice consul to Athens, Greece. In 1941, he was appointed to the post of vice consul at Marseilles, France, a post which he held until 1944. Many refugees gathered in southern France during the war, and Marseilles was a major port of embarkation. At some time in 1943, an assistant at the Turkish consulate told Kent that the Germans had just loaded 80 Turkish Jews living in Marseilles into cattle cars for immediate transport to probable death in Germany. Kent later recalled, \\"To this day, I remember the inscription on the wagon: 'This wagon may be loaded with 20 heads of cattle and 500 kilograms of grass'.\\" Etgar Lefkovits, \\"Necdet Kent: Le Consul turc qui a stoppé le train de la mort!\\" (The consul who halted the death train) , Bleublancture.net, 21 Sep 2000, accessed 3 Dec 2009 Kent approached the Gestapo commander at the station, and demanded that the Jews be released, as they were Turkish citizens and Turkey was neutral. The official refused to do so, saying that the people were nothing but Jews. Kent and his assistant quickly got on the train, too. The German official asked him to get off, but Kent refused. At the next station, German officers boarded and apologized to Kent for not letting him off at Marseilles; they had a car waiting outside to return him to his office. Kent explained that the mistake was that 80 Turkish citizens had been loaded on the train. \\"As a representative of a government that rejected such treatment for religious beliefs, I could not consider leaving them there,\\" he said. Surprised at his uncompromising stance, the Germans ultimately let everyone off the train.\\"True courage of one who had to act: Necdet Kent, Turkish diplomat 1911-2002\\", The Daily Telegraph, London; reprinted on Sydney Morning Herald.com, 1 Oct 2002, accessed on September 25, 2008 \\"I would never forget,\\" Kent later said, \\"those embraces around our necks and hands ... the expressions of gratitude in the eyes of the people we rescued ... the inner peace I felt when I reached my bed towards morning.\\" Kent's heroism was not limited to this one action. In contrast to some of other foreign representatives stationed in Marseilles, Kent reached out to the Jewish community, issuing Turkish identity documents to scores of Turkish Jews living in southern France, or those who had fled there and did not hold valid Turkish passports. Kent went to Gestapo headquarters to protest against their latest action in Marseilles: the stripping of males in the street to determine whether or not they were Jews (by circumcision). The Vice Consul rebuked the German commander and informed him that circumcision did not necessarily prove an individual's Jewishness. Kent said, \\"When I saw the emptiness in the commander's eyes, I realize that he did not understand what I am saying. And I said that I will accept to be examined by their doctors.\\" He told the Germans that Muslim men, as he was, were also circumcised. After World War II, Kent continued his career in the Turkish foreign service. He served as Consul General at the Turkish Consulate General in New York City.

It was first described by Pierre André Latreille in 1804, though many of its species have been moved elsewhere. The majority of these were moved to Eratigena, including the giant house spider (Eratigena atrica) and the hobo spider (Eratigena agrestis). They can be difficult to identify because they resemble wolf spiders and other funnel-web spiders in their area, unless found in an area where they don't occur naturally. They live on sheet webs, usually stretching across the corner between two walls. They have eight eyes in two straight or almost straight rows. Size varies from one species to another, but the body length of adults can range from to , not including the legs. The cardinal spider is the largest funnel weaver, with females that can grow up to long.

A hot comb is heated and used to straighten the hair from the roots. It can be placed directly on the source of heat or it may be electrically heated. History The hot comb was an invention developed in France as a way for women with coarse curly hair to achieve a fine straight look traditionally modeled by historical Egyptian women.Byrd, Ayana D., Tharps, Lori L. Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America. New York: St. Martin’s Press. 2001 p. 20 Parisian Francois Marcel Grateau is said to have revolutionized hair styling when he invented and introduced heated irons to curl and wave his customers' hair in France in 1872. His Marcel Wave remained fashionable for many decades. Britain's Science and Society Library credits L. Pelleray of Paris with manufacturing the heated irons in the 1870s. An example of an 1890s version of Pelleray's curling iron is housed at the Chudnow Museum in Milwaukee. Elroy J. Duncan is believed to have invented and manufactured the first hot comb or heated metal straightening comb in America. Sometimes the device is called a \\"pressing comb.\\" During the late 19th century, Dr. Scott's Electric Curler was advertised in several publications including the 1886 Bloomingdale's catalogNancy Villa Bryk Bloomingdale's Illustrated 1886 Catalog. New York: Dover Publications. 1988 p. 152 and in the June 1889 issue of Lippincott's MagazineLippincott's Magazine of Literature, Science and Education, Volume 43, June 1889 p. 971 Marketed to men to groom beards and moustaches, the rosewood-handled device also promised women the ability to imitate the \\"loose and fluffy\\" hairstyles of actress Lillie Langtry and opera singer Adelina Patti, popular white entertainers of the era. Mme. Baum's Hair Emporium, a store on Eighth Avenue in New York with a large clientele composed mostly of African American females, advertised Mme. Baum's \\"entirely new and improved\\" straightening comb in 1912.New York Age, February 1, 1912, page 8 In May and June 1914, other Mme. Baum advertisements claimed that she now had a \\"shampoo dryer and hair straightening comb,\\" said to have been patented on April 1, 1914.New York Age, June 25, 1914, page 8 U.S. Patent 1,096,666 for a heated \\"hair drying\\" comb – but not a hair straightening comb – is credited to Emilia Baum and was granted on May 12, 1914.Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office, May 12, 1914, Volume 202 In May 1915, the Humania Hair Company of New York marketed a \\"straightening comb made of solid brass\\" for 89 cents.Kansas City Sun, May 15, 1915 That same month, Wolf Brothers of Indianapolis advertised its hair straightening comb and alcohol heater comb for $1.00.New York Age, May 20, 1915 The La Creole Company of Louisville claimed to have invented a self-heating comb that required no external flame.New York Age, May 20, 1915 In September 1915, J. E. Laing, owner of Laing's Hair Dressing Parlor in Kansas City, Kansas claimed to have invented the \\"king of all straighteners\\" with a 3/4 inch wide, 9 1/2 inches long comb that also had a reversible handle to accommodate use with either the left or right hand.Kansas City Sun, September 25, 1915 Indol Laboratories, owned by Bernia Austin in Harlem, offered a steel magnetic comb for $5.00 in November 1916.New York Age, November 23, 1916, page 2 Walter Sammons of Philadelphia filed an application for Patent No. 1,362,823 on April 9, 1920. The patent was granted on December 21, 1920. Poro Company founder Annie Malone has been credited by some sources with receiving the first patent for this tool in that same year but the Official Gazette of the U. S. Patent Office does not list her as a holder of a hot comb patent in 1920.The Black Inventor Online Museum, Blackinventor.com (broken link) The Patent Office Gazette of May 16, 1922, however, includes Annie M. Malone of St. Louis in a list of patentees of designs as being granted Patent No. 60,962 for \\"sealing tape,\\" which Chajuana V. Trawick describes in a December 2011 doctoral dissertation as an ornamental tape used to \\"secure the closure of the box lid of Poro products\\" to prevent others from selling products in packages made to look like Poro products.Chajuana V. Trawick. Annie Malone and Poro College: Building an Empire of Beauty in St. Louis, Missouri from 1915 to 1930. Ph.D. dissertation University of Missouri, December 2011 Hair care entrepreneur Madam C. J. Walker never claimed to have invented the hot comb,A'Lelia Bundles On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker Scribner/Lisa Drew, 2001 though often has been inaccurately credited with the invention and with modifying the spacing of the teeth, but there is no evidence or documentation to support that assertion. During the 1910s, Walker obtained her combs from different suppliers, including Louisa B. Cason of Cincinnati, Ohio, who eventually filed patent application 1,413,255 on February 17, 1921 for a comb Cason had developed some years earlier. The patent was granted on April 18, 1922Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office, April 18, 1922 page 492 and page ii though Cason had been producing the combs for many years without a patent. Potential consequences It is not uncommon to burn and damage hair when using a traditional hot comb. A hot comb is often heated to over 65 degrees Celsius (149 degrees Fahrenheit), therefore if not careful severe burns and scarring can occur. The hot petrolatum used with the iron was thought to cause a chronic inflammation around the upper segment of the hair follicle leading to degeneration of the external root sheath.Philip LoPresti, MD; Christopher M. Papa, MD; Albert M. Kligman, MD, PhD.”Hot Comb Alopecia” Arch Dermatol. 1968; 98(3)p 234 In 1992, a hot comb alopecia study was conducted, and it was discovered that there was a poor correlation between the usage of a hot comb and the onset and progression of disease. The study concludes that the term follicular degeneration syndrome (FDS) is proposed for this clinically and histologically distinct form of scarring alopecia.LTC Leonard C. Sperling, MC; COL Purnima Sau, MC, “The Follicular Degeneration Syndrome in Black Patients: ‘Hot Comb Alopecia’ Revisited and Revised” Archives of Dermatology. 1992;128(1) p68 Hot comb alopecia and follicular degeneration syndrome are irreversible alopecia of the scalp that was believed to occur in people who straighten their hair with hot combs, but this idea was later debunked.

The actress Geraldine Somerville is her niece. Title Although the family home is the 17th century Megginch Castle in Perthshire, Scotland, the family title, Baron Strange, is in the English peerage. Her father, John Drummond, 15th Baron Strange, had spent many years attempting to terminate an abeyance that arose on the death of the Duke of Atholl in 1957; he was confirmed in the title in 1965. The title went into abeyance once again on his death in 1982, but it was terminated in Cherry's favour in 1986, and she made her maiden speech on 4 March 1987. Upon the Baroness's death the title was inherited by her eldest son, Adam. Politics and public life She held traditional conservative views, but resigned the Conservative Party whip in December 1998 when William Hague dismissed Lord Cranborne for negotiating with Tony Blair on reform of the House of Lords.

Crawley shot and directed the film that won the Hiram Percy Maxim Award from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for Best Amateur Film in 1939, making their collaboration the first Canadian film to receive this type of recognition. Crawley was a pioneer in the creation of an independent Canadian film sector. Although he worked intermittently as an independent filmmaker on contract with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), Crawley chose to work independently rather than with NFB or the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Crawley was known for making avant-garde films with his wife Judith Crawley. Together they owned the Crawley Films company which produced numerous short films, feature films, television commercials, animated cartoons and other productions. The first Canadian Film Award (a precursor to the contemporary Canadian Screen Awards) in 1949 went to Crawley Films for The Loon's Necklace (1948), a film based on a Tsimshian legend. After the Second World War, the company grew quickly and provided a great training ground for young Canadian filmmakers eager to launch film careers.

During World War II, Yolga was the Vice-Consul at the Turkish Embassy in Paris, France. He claimed to have saved the lives of Turkish Jews from the Nazis but this has been challenged due to lack of evidence. In fact, evidence suggests that Yolga was actually instrumental in stripping France- born Turkish Jews of citizenship, which could have saved them from the Holocaust. He has been given a self-congratulatory award by the Turkish government and a Jewish foundation in Turkey heavily affiliated with the state. Career Namık Kemal Yolga was posted to the Turkish Embassy in Paris in 1940 as the Vice-Consul, his first diplomatic post in a foreign country. Two months later the Nazis invaded and occupied France. They forced the roundup of Jews, sending those from the Paris area to the Drancy deportation camp. From there they were to be sent east to concentration camps. Young Yolga claimed to have saved Turkish Jews one by one from the Nazi authorities, by picking them up from Drancy, driving them in his own car and hiding them in safe places. In his autobiography, Yolga described his efforts as: In fact, according to Serge Klarsfeld's \\"Mémorial de la Déportation des Juifs de France\\", 1300 Turkish Jews, among which 939 officially recognized as Turkish by the Nazis, were deported. Their fate depended entirely of the versatile decision of the Turkish bureau staff. According to the laws enacted by Turkey during the 1930s, all emigrated citizens who did not register at the Consulates, or did not fulfill their military duty, lost their Turkish nationality, and this was the situation for the majority of the Jews. Thanks to the efforts of the well known Auschwitz survivor Haim Vidal Sephiha, a Turkish Jew deported from Belgium, monuments, plaques and listings of Turkish Jews names are now present on the main extermination sites. See also Benjamin Schatzma's \\"Journal d'un interné, Volume II\\", the works of historian and university scholar Esther Benbassa, and the article by Claude Wainstain on Necdet Kent, another \\"Turkish Schindler\\", whose biography seems also legendary.

Roosevelt as part of his brain trust. Among other contributions, he wrote the original idea for the Point Four Program. He also worked for several congressional committees and hired Lyndon B. Johnson for his first Federal job. Kramer was alleged a Soviet spy as member of the Ware Group, but no charges were brought against him. Biography Kramer's family lost everything in the Depression as a result of his youngest brother's illness, and Kramer was forced to quit medical school and go to work. He was forced to take menial jobs such as farm labourer, sailor and stenographer.http://spartacus-educational.com/Charles_Kramer.htm Evidence of Kramer's membership in the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and his contacts with known Soviet agents comes from several sources: the direct testimony of Whittaker Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley, Lee Pressman, and Nathaniel Weyl; the Venona decrypts; and the Moscow archives of the Soviet Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). Hope Hale Davis and her husband, Karl Hermann Brunck, were both members of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). They were invited to the home of Charles Kramer, for their first meeting. Also in attendance were Victor Perlo and Marion Bachrach. Kramer explained that the CPUSA was organized in units. \\"Charles... explained that... we would try to limit our knowledge of other members, in case of interrogation, possible torture. Such an idea, he admitted, might seem rather remote in the radical Washington climate, but climates could change fast. In most places members of units knew each other only by their Party pseudonyms, so as not to be able to give real names if questioned.\\" Other alleged members of the CPUSA underground allegedly assisted Kramer in obtaining some of his positions in the American government. John Abt hired him for the Senate Civil Liberties Subcommittee (the La Follette Committee). Nathan Witt helped him get a job within the Department of Labor National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) before World War II. Victor Perlo signed Kramer's job performance rating at the Office of Price Administration (OPA) during the war and was listed as a job reference. Allen Weinstein has pointed out that Kramer was the head of a Soviet spy network (codename Mole later changed to Lot).Allen Weinstein, The Hunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America (1999) page 96 His wife, Mildred Kramer, was a NKVD courier. According to the Soviet archives Charles Kramer was instructed to try and recruit Robert Oppenheimer as a spy. Kramer's report sent to Anatoly Gorsky on 19 October 1945, shows that Oppenheimer refused to pass on information from the Manhattan Project. Kramer described Oppenheimer as a \\"liberal\\" and not a \\"covert Communist\\".Charles Kramer, report to Anatoly Gorsky (19th October, 1945) Kramer took time off in 1944 to work for the Democratic National Committee and in 1946 to assist the reelection campaign of California Democratic representative Ellis Patterson, and he also worked for the United States Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization (the Kilgore Committee ) and the Senate Subcommittee on Wartime Health and Education during the war; and the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee after the war. Kramer is supposed to have provided information to the Soviets from his position as staff member of the Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization on a dispute among American policy makers concerning the French National Committee of Charles de Gaulle and an internal U.S. government investigation of German corporate links to American companies. Kramer also allegedly passed information from the Democratic National Committee about President Harry S. Truman's likely appointments in the State Department and views of Truman by various Senators. The Venona decrypts from 1945 suggest that Kramer was an unwilling source. His contacts with Anatoli Gorsky, the legal Rezident, provided little information beyond what could be obtained from a newspaper article or overheard at a Washington D.C. restaurant.

It was resurrected on a new six-cylinder midsize car from the British Motor Corporation in the 1950s to replace the Morris Six MS. The name died out in 1958. Morris Isis (1929–35) and Twenty Five (1933–35) The Isis announced in July 1929 was a revised version of the 1927 Morris Six JA series and used the same 2468 cc engine and 3-speed gearbox. It had an all-new chassis, and the steel body had an American look, not surprising, as the body pressing dies made by Budd for the Morris-Budd joint venture, Pressed Steel Company, were shared with some Dodge models. William Morris had recognised the potential of pressed steel car bodies and introduced them to Europe in Pressed Steel Company, a joint venture with Budd, sited beside William Morris's Cowley plant. It was the first Morris to have hydraulic brakes and chromium plating replaced the previous nickel finish on brightwork. The car could exceed and return . { Isis Special Coupé reg'd 1933 Morris Twenty-five } =Facelift= After 3939 of the original Isis model had been made it received a facelift announced 1 September 1932. Following the court-forced separation of William Morris from his joint venture with Edward G Budd the all-steel body was replaced by a traditional wood frame construction. Mechanically the car was similar but the gearbox received syncromesh and a fourth speed (Twin-Top), the chassis received additional cross bracing in 1934 and an automatic clutch and freewheel were fitted to some models. 3467 of the new Isis were made (including Twenty-Five models). Isis saloon reg July 1934 =Morris Twenty-Five= A de-luxe version, the Morris Twenty-Five was launched 12 October 1932 for the 1932 London Motor Show with larger 3485 cc engine. It was replaced in July 1935 by a new Twenty-Five, the flagship of the Morris Big Six series II range, and given an overhead valve engine (as the series III) in August 1938 with the rest of the Morris range. Isis Series I (1955–56) The Series I Isis was launched in 1955 as a replacement for the Morris Six MS. It featured a six-cylinder engine, the 2.6 L (2639 cc/161 in³), C-Series unit from the Austin Westminster. Unlike the Westminster, the Isis had a single SU carburettor. The four-speed gearbox had a column change and was available with an optional Borg-Warner overdrive unit. The car was based on the 4-cylinder Morris Oxford series II, sharing its almost-unibody shell and torsion bar front suspension. The wheelbase and front end were lengthened to accept the larger straight-6 engine, and a \\"woody\\" 2-door estate version was also available. With the strong engine, the Isis could reach 90 mph (145 km/h). Unlike its sister car, the Austin Westminster, which enjoyed moderate success against the volume-selling Ford and Vauxhall sixes of the time, sales were poor, with only 8,500 sold. File:Morris_Isis_Series_I_side.jpgMorris Isis Series I File:Morris_Isis_Series_I_rear.jpgMorris Isis Series I Isis Series II (1956–58) The Morris Isis Series II was based on the Morris Oxford Series III body but with longer wheelbase and front wings and bonnet to accommodate the 6-cylinder engine. In line with changes to the corresponding Oxford line, BMC redesigned the Isis for 1956 with updated styling including a more elaborate mesh grille, chrome side strips and small fins. The engine power increased to . An automatic transmission option was also added. The manual version had a four-speed box operated by a short gearstick on the right-hand side of the front bench seat. The handbrake lever was just behind the gearstick. Sales remained weak, and the line ended in 1958. A de luxe saloon with overdrive tested by British magazine The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0– in 17.6 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1025 including taxes. The overdrive unit had added £63 to the price. There was also a Traveller version with similar rear design to the Morris Oxford Estate car. The Isis Traveller accommodated the spare wheel either within the rear well or, when it was required to use this region for a passenger (the small floor area was hinged with a padded underside so that the passenger faced \\"backwards\\"), then the spare would be attached to the nearside, again to the rear of the vehicle. In this way it would be possible to accommodate two adult passengers on the front bench seat next to the driver, three in the middle rear bench seat and one in the very back.

Founded in the autumn of 1872 as an outgrowth of the Union Colony in nearby Greeley, the colony was instrumental in the early growth of Fort Collins, as well as in making it an agricultural center in the Colorado Territory at a time when the region was still known primarily for its mineral resources. History The town of Fort Collins had been founded in the previous decade on the site of the decommissioned Camp Collins of the United States Army. Moreover, the territorial legislature had designated the site of the Colorado Agricultural College to be in Fort Collins in 1870, although no money had been allocated for structures. A recurring source of anxiety among local leaders was the lack of railroad, which would not arrive until 1877. The 1872 colony came two years after the establishment of the Greeley Colony downstream on the Poudre and was led by General Robert A. Cameron, an officer in the Greeley Colony. The success of the Greeley Colony, which was intended by its founder Nathan Meeker as a religiously- oriented utopian community, prompted its officers to expand the enterprise, although without quite the degree of religious idealism of the first effort. Rather the Fort Collins was as much of a local effort at boosting the population as it was a means of establishing a religiously-oriented cooperative. In addition to Cameron, officers and trustees included many early prominent residents and business owners of Fort Collins, including John C. Matthews, Judge A.F. Howes, J.M. Sherwood, Colonel J.E. Remington, N.H. Meldrum, B.T. Whedbee, Benjamin Harrison Eaton, and Joseph Mason. The colony plan called for the division of 3,000 acres (12 km²) of land immediately adjoining the existing town to divided into 10, 20, and 40 acre (40,000, 81,000 and 162,000 m²) lots. The new platted lands were largely west and south of the existing town of Fort Collins, and contiguous the existing grid. Thus the colony would extend the town away from the Cache la Poudre River . Unlike the existing town plat, which was roughly parallel to the along the old Overland Stage road along the Poudre, the new lands would be oriented towards the compass. College Avenue, Mountain Avenue, and other major thoroughfares of the grid plan of downtown Fort Collins were laid out in the new plan of the colony. The older part of town has since become known as \\"Old Town Fort Collins.\\" The colony invited anyone to join \\"who is possessed of a good moral character\\" by purchasing a certificate ranging in price from 50 to 250 USD. A fifty-dollar certificate entitled the purchased to one town lot. Larger certificates entitled the purchaser to locate both a business and residence in the colony, as well as certain water rights. At the time, the town possessed a post office, grist mill, and numerous other small businesses and stores. The colony specifically issued an appeal for a \\"good country newspaper, hardware store, bank, as well as farmers and other \\"industrious people.\\" It specifically discouraged whiskey saloons or gambling halls. The first drawing of lots for the colony was held in December 1872, at which time one-fifth of the lots were disbursed. The colony quickly resulted in the addition of several hundred new residents to the town, as well the erection of many new buildings. Among the recipients of lots in the drawing was Franklin Avery, who would later become one of the most prominent citizens of the town, as well as Jacob Welch, would become one of the most prominent merchants. Both received lots along College Avenue, which would become the principal thoroughfare in the new expanded town plan. References *History of Larimer County, Colorado, Ansel Watrous (1911).

Intentionally insulting the Quran is regarded by Muslims as blasphemous. Most traditional schools of Islamic law require wudu (ritual washing) before a Muslim may touch the Quran. Muslims must always treat the printed book with reverence, which may even extend to excerpts of text. Disposal of worn copies is also of concern to Muslims. Because the Quran contains no specifics on how to dispose of a worn or defective text, different and conflicting methods of disposal have been adopted in different regions by different sects. According to Islamic historian Michael Cook the Quran should be wrapped in cloth and buried on holy ground where it is unlikely to be trampled on or \\"safely\\" placed where it is unlikely to come into contact with impurity. According to Arab News, Muslims are forbidden to recycle, pulp, or shred worn-out copies of the text; instead, burning or burying the worn-out copies in a respectful manner is required. Reprint from Our Dialogue Q&A; series, Adil Salahi, Arab News, Jeddah Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious faith in Islam. Intentionally desecrating a copy of the Quran is punishable by imprisonment in some countries (up to life imprisonment in Pakistan, according to Article 295-B of the Penal Code) and could lead to death in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Pakistan. Notable instances =c650-656, Uthman burns Qurans= Uthman ibn 'Affan, the third Caliph of Islam after Muhammad, who is credited with overseeing the collection of the verses of the Qur'an, ordered the destruction of any other remaining text containing verses of the Quran after the Quran has been fully collected, circa 650. This was done to ensure that the collected and authenticated Quranic copy that Uthman collected became the primary source for others to follow, thereby ensuring that Uthman's version of the Quran remained authentic. Although the Qur'an had mainly been propagated through oral transmission, it also had already been recorded in at least three codices, most importantly the codex of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud in Kufa, and the codex of Ubayy ibn Ka'b in Syria. Sometime between 650 and 656, a committee appointed by Uthman is believed to have produced a singular version in seven copies, and Uthman is said to have \\"sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered any other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.\\" = Pre-1924 Qurans dumped in the Nile= Following the printing of the 1924 \\"royal\\" edition (amīriyya).\\"Michael W.

He later cancelled the plans; however, on March 20, 2011, he oversaw the burning of a Quran. In response, Muslims in Afghanistan rioted and 12 people were killed.

At least 30 people were killed and hundreds injured. Also,6 U.S. soldiers were killed after members of the Afghan National Security Forces turned their weapons on them and the Afghan protesters. On March 19, 2015, Farkhunda Malikzada, a 27-year- old Afghan woman, was publicly beaten and slain by a mob of hundreds of people in Kabul. Farkhunda had previously been arguing with a mullah named Zainuddin, in front of a mosque where she worked as a religious teacher, about his practice of selling charms at the Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque, the Shrine of the King of Two Swords, a religious shrine in Kabul. During this argument, Zainuddin reportedly falsely accused her of burning the Quran. Police investigations revealed that she had not burned anything. A number of prominent public officials turned to Facebook immediately after the death to endorse the murder. After it was revealed that she did not burn the Quran, the public reaction in Afghanistan turned to shock and anger. Her murder led to 49 arrests; three adult men received twenty-year prison sentences, eight other adult males received sixteen year sentences, a minor received a ten-year sentence, and eleven police officers received one-year prison terms for failing to protect Farkhunda. Her murder and the subsequent protests served to draw attention to women's rights in Afghanistan. =Others= Saudi Arabia destroys Qurans of pilgrims that fall short of state standards.Dissing the Koran, The Weekly Standard, May 30, 2005, retrieved Feb 7 2012 The preferred method is by burning, to avoid soiling the pages.

On April 11, IRIB published statements from an Iranian MP who said the West must stop the event and warned that \\"the blasphemous move will spark an uncontrollable wave of outrage among over 1.6 billion people across the globe who follow Islam.\\" In Pakistan, protesters set the American flag and effigy of the US pastor Terry Jones on fire, condemning the 9/11 plan, according to an April 14, 2013 article in The Nation. In October 2013, a Turkish woman was arrested on suspicion of blasphemy and inciting religious hatred after allegedly stepping on Quran and then posting the picture on Twitter.

He played first-class cricket for Hampshire.Chisholm, 1911 Military career He was educated at Brighton College and then Winchester CollegeSabben-Clare, James. Winchester College. Paul Cave Publications, 1981. p. 144 before entering the army in 1863. After serving in India with his regiment (37th Foot) he returned to England in 1873, having exchanged into the 3rd Dragoon Guards. In the year of 1877 he entered the staff college and also the Inner Temple. In 1878 he was sent to South Africa, served in both the Zulu War and against Sikukuni. As the chief staff- officer under Sir George Pomeroy Colley, he was present at Majuba (27 February 1881), where he was made prisoner by a Boer patrol and detained until the end of that March. In August 1882, he was placed on the staff of the cavalry division in Egypt. After Tel-el-Kebir (13 September 1882), he headed a brilliant advance upon Cairo, taking possession of both the town and citadel. He was three times mentioned in despatches, and made a brevet-colonel, CB, and aide-de-camp to the Queen. In January 1884, he was sent to Suakin in command of the cavalry under Sir Gerald Graham, and took part as brigadier in the actions from El Teb to the advance on Tamai. His services were recognized by him being knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and he was made assistant adjutant and QMG in the south-eastern district of England from April to September 1884. Medallion From The Memorial To Sir Herbert Stewart at Hans Place, London He then joined the expedition for the relief of Khartoum, and in that December, when news from Gordon decided Lord Wolseley to send a column across the desert of Metemma, Stewart was entrusted with the command. On 16 January 1885, he found the enemy in force near the wells of Abu Klea, and brilliantly repulsed their fierce charge on the following morning. Leaving the wounded under guard, the column moved forward on the 18th through bushy country towards Metemma, 23 miles off. Meanwhile, the enemy continued their attacks, and on the morning of the 19th, Stewart was wounded and obliged to hand over the command to Sir Charles Wilson. He lingered for nearly a month, living long enough to hear of his promotion to the rank of major-general \\"for distinguished service in the field.\\" He died on the way back from Khartoum to Korti on 16 February, and was buried near the wells of Jakdul. In the telegram reporting his death, Lord Wolseley summed up both Stewert's character and career with the words: \\"No braver soldier or more brilliant leader of men ever wore the Queen's uniform.\\" A similar sentiment was felt by the Chief: \\"A finer soldier never existed in HM Service. He was a young officer, who by his own merits and his personal bravery had brought himself into a prominent position in the Army much earlier than usually happened in the ordinary course of events.\\"Cambridge, p.112 Stewart seemed to epitomize the selfless spirit of the age, embodying the heroic sacrifice for Queen and Country that was supposed to symbolize a civilized Empire.

Changing of the Guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow) in Moscow The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Могила Неизвестного Солдата in Russian, ) is a war memorial, dedicated to the Soviet soldiers killed during World War II.  History  The day of celebration for the unknown soldier has been celebrated in Russia since December 3, 2014. After World War II, millions of Russian soldiers were reported missing, or pronounced dead. In 1997, a Guard of Honour of the Kremlin Regiment (which had guarded the Lenin Mausoleum) was restored at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier by the federal law of December 8, 1997, \\"On Immortalizing the Soviet People’s Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941–1945\\". A Changing of the Guard Ceremony takes place every hour.  Location  The Tomb is located at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden in Moscow. The remains of the unknown soldiers killed in the Battle of Moscow in 1941 were initially buried in a mass grave of the Shtyki Memorial at the 40th km of the Leningrad highway at the city of Zelenograd. This was the location of the closest approach of the German armies to Moscow during the war. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the battle, in December 1966 these remains were relocated to the Kremlin Wall. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was designed by architects D. I. Burdin, V. A. Klimov, Yu. R. Rabayev and sculptor Nikolai Tomsky, and was unveiled to the public on May 8, 1967.  Appearance  The dark red porphyry monument is decorated with a bronze sculpture of a laurel branch and a soldier's helmet laid upon a banner. In front of the monument, there is a five-pointed star in a square field of labradorite, which emanates the Eternal Flame from its center. The flame illuminates a bronze inscription \\"Имя твоё неизвестно, подвиг твой бессмертен\\" (translit.: Imya tvoyo neizvestno, podvig tvoy bessmerten, \\"Your name is unknown, your deed is immortal\\"). The torch for the memorial's Eternal Flame was transported from Leningrad, where it had been lit from the Eternal Flame at the Monument to the Fighters of the Revolution on the Field of Mars. To the left of the tomb is a granite wall with an inlay stating: \\"1941 – To Those Who Have Fallen For The Motherland – 1945\\". To the right of the tomb, lining the walkway are dark red porphyry blocks with incapsulated soils from hero cities, Leningrad, Kiev, Stalingrad, Odessa, Sevastopol, Minsk, Kerch, Novorossiysk, Tula and Brest, Murmansk and Smolensk. The plate for “Stalingrad” read “Volgograd” until September 2004. Further to the right of these monuments is an obelisk in red granite, listing the names of 40 “Cities of Military Glory” divided into groups of four. This monument was dedicated on May 8, 2010.

Five of these inlets are natural and have mobility characteristics. The sixth is an artificial inlet that was opened with the purpose of allowing easier access to the port of Faro. Presently the main inlet of the system is the Faro-Olhão inlet, which was artificially opened. The process started in 1927 but only in 1952 were the engineering works completed and it assumed the present configuration. Within the Ria Formosa system, different and sometimes antagonistic uses may be found. Part of the system is a Natural Park but Ria Formosa also plays an important role in the region's economy. Beyond the tourist use the system also supports other economic activities like seafood farms (including grooved carpet shell harvesting) and the port of Faro. The Ria Formosa is also a designated Natural Park of over 170 km² and a stopping place for hundreds of different birds during the spring and autumn migratory periods. Besides being a natural park, Ria Formosa is classified as a Ramsar site Ria Formosa is also listed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area, both in its lagoon area with 23296 hectares and the oceanic zone with 19900 hectares. The most important cities near the Ria Formosa are Tavira, Faro and Olhão. There are also some towns in this area, whose names are: Fuzeta (which belongs to the municipality of Olhão), Santa Luzia, Cabanas de Tavira (these last two belonging to Tavira) and Cacela Velha (which belongs to Vila Real de Santo António). Several buses run from Tavira to Cabanas and back each weekday, but there are no buses on Saturday afternoons nor all day Sundays and Holidays, even in summer. The nearest train station is in nearby Conceição which is on the Tavira to Vila Real line. That's about and an easy walk. Trains stop there daily, but at very irregular intervals of 1-3 h.  Entertainment  Little villages and towns in the area, such as Cabanas de Tavira, have a large number of bars, cafés and restaurants which run along the riverfront and are also dotted around a couple of blocks inland. Annually, about 30'000 birds can be observed from Ria Formosa, since the region serves as a migratory corridor and contains some the last remaining nesting grounds in Europe for some bird species.  Beaches  The coast of east Algarve has a remarkably mild climate, with sunny days all year round. Winters are usually mild and summers are not very hot. Because of these features, beaches in the Ria Formosa area are well known, like Vale do Lobo, Faro Island, Culatra, Barril, Tavira Island, Cabanas de Tavira, Cacela Velha and Manta Rota. Barril attracts a good number of naturists. Tavira Island Beach has a camping park.

He has since gone on to feature for Bournemouth and Leeds United before finishing his career with non-league side Slough Town in 2009. In 2011, he joined the coaching staff at Sutton United and also agreed to make a return to the playing side of the game. Football career Telfer was born in Edinburgh, but began his career at Luton Town as a right-sided midfielder. He made over 150 competitive first team appearances for Luton including 144 league games. In November 1992, Telfer and then Luton teammate Darren Salton were involved in a head on car crash in Bedfordshire. Telfer, the driver of the car, suffered only minor injuries and went on to make a full recovery. Salton spent seven days on a life support machine and a further two and half weeks in a coma.

At Southampton, Telfer was converted from midfielder to right-back, and was a member of the side that reached the 2003 FA Cup Final. He scored once during his spell at Southampton, in a 3–1 win over Newcastle in May 2002. =Celtic= In 2005, Strachan became manager at Celtic, and again made Telfer one of his first signings. Telfer played just under two years at Parkhead, where he won two Scottish League championships and scored once in the league against Aberdeen. However, his family had difficulty settling in Glasgow, and on 3 December 2006, Telfer announced he would not renew his contract with Celtic because he wished to spend more time with his family in Winchester.

Gary McAllister was sacked in December, and new manager Simon Grayson left Telfer out of all of his first team squads during his first month at the club. On 2 February 2009, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent with Telfer saying he didn't want Leeds to spend money paying his wages whilst he wasn't going to play. =Slough Town and Sutton United = In April 2009, Telfer signed for non-league Slough Town, but failed to appear in the 2009–10 season.

Although the Surf Coasters did not win the competition, their success on the show led to a loyal fan following. They succeeded to make it into the final round of the competition, where they finished in second place; however, they still received a record deal, which led to the release of their debut CD, Surf Panic '95, which, despite being an instrumental album, sold well. The band also played that year with surf music legend and \\"King of the Surf Guitar\\", Dick Dale, who was on his first tour of Japan. Reportedly, after the tour Dale referred to Naka as the \\"Prince of the Surf Guitar.\\". Since then, the band has released upwards of twenty records, for the Columbia, Victor and BMG record labels, and have become the number one instrumental band across Japan. Their sound has varied since 1995, including dancehall, acoustic arrangements, blues, and heavy metal. Naka has also gone on to record, with and without the rest of the band, on other musical projects, including soundtracks for film and video games.

Houston formed a cowboy-themed tag team with Nelson Royal during the summer of 1986. = Central States Wrestling (1986) = Houston moved on to the Central States Territory later that year, where he won the title while feuding with Bulldog Bob Brown and Bill Dundee. = Universal Wrestling Federation (1987) = His first few months of 1987 were spent in the Universal Wrestling Federation where he teamed up with Terry Taylor for a short period of time. = World Wrestling Federation (1987-1991) = Houston moved on to the WWF in the spring, making his debut on May 9, 1987, by defeating Sika on a house show in St. Louis, Missouri. Houston was undefeated in his first month, defeating Terry Gibbs, Steve Lombardi, and others at TV taping dark matches and arena shows.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm On June 7 he made his first television appearance, defeating Gibbs on Wrestling Challenge in a match taped in Houston, TX. At the same event Houston came out to help a newly arrived Ted DiBiase (who had made his first WWF appearance as a babyface) clear the ring of The One Man Gang. Houston's first loss came a few weeks later when he was defeated by another new arrival, Bam-Bam Bigelow at a house show in Jackson, Mississippi on June 25. One night later in Houston, Texas he tag-teamed with DiBiase against The One Man Gang and Ron Bass. The babyface duo lost when DiBiase turned heel on his partner. Houston remained off US television, wrestling opening matches on house shows against Tiger Chung Lee, Jose Estrada, Barry Horowitz, and others, winning most of these encounters. He finally made his television debut on October 31, 1987, on WWF Superstars when he upset Danny Davis, handing the former referee his first televised loss. He moved into the winter wrestling Outlaw Ron Bass on the house show circuit, with many of the matches ending in draws. In December 1987 he began a series with Danny Davis, trading wins with him on various house show matches in a feud that lasted all the way into June 1988, and would continue sporadically into 1989. During his time in WWF he teamed with fellow cowboy Scott Casey on a number of occasions and a match that included his brother Jake Roberts (though the audience didn't know the relationship at the time), with Houston saving Roberts from elimination on a number of occasions. He wrestled in the first ever Royal Rumble match on January 24, 1988, and two months later made his first pay-per-view appearance when he appeared at WrestleMania IV's twenty man battle royal.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm That summer Houston entered a house show series with Big Boss Man, but unlike his previous house show series he was winless. Houston also fell in matches against King Haku, Frenchy Martin, and the newly arrived Curt Hennig and Terry Taylor. His biggest win in the summer of 1988 was against Jos LeDuc. He also continued to gain televised victories on Prime Time Wrestling, and was usually successful against lower-level competition such as Steve Lombardi. He made his second PPV appearance of the year when he teamed with The Ultimate Warrior, The Blue Blazer (Owen Hart), Jim Brunzell, and Brutus Beefcake in a winning effort against Honky Tonk Man, Greg Valentine, Ron Bass, Bad News Brown, and Danny Davis in the second annual Survivor Series. Houston defeated Steve Lombardi in the dark match at the 1989 Royal Rumble but was unable to move past lower- level competition. On the February 11th edition of WWF Superstars he lost to The Honky Tonk Man in less than two minutes.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm After this Houston wrestled primarily on house shows, facing Barry Windham and The Genius. In 1990 he appeared sporadically, although he wrestled Jerry Sags in the dark match of the 1991 Royal Rumble.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm His final match was against The Barbarian on February 7, 1991, in Salt Lake City, UT. = World Championship Wrestling (1991) = After continuing to flounder in the WWF's mid-card as a jobber to the stars, Houston left WWF in February 1991 and joined World Championship Wrestling.

Houston would go on to face The Diamond Studd, Larry Zbyszko, Arn Anderson, and Steve Austin that summer. His final match came on August 11 when he was defeated by The One Man Gang at a house show in Roanoke, Virginia. = Independent circuit (1991-1993) = Houston next went to the United States Wrestling Association promotion, which had bought up the World Class Championship Wrestling promotion in Dallas, where he feuded once again with Black Bart. After leaving there he then wrestled on the independent wrestling scene before showing up in January 1992 at the Global Wrestling Federation. His first appearance came on January 3 when he faced Bull Pain.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=8&nr;=84&page;=8&s;=100 Wrestling as The Midnight Rider he enjoyed greater success, even winning there Television Championship, and teaming with Rockin' Robin and Baby Doll in mixed tag matches against Bull Pain and Samantha Pain. = World Championship Wrestling (1993-1994) = Houston returned to WCW in the summer of 1993, appearing first at a house show in Burlington, NC in a match against Frankie Lancaster. On September 7 he wrestled in a dark match WCW Saturday Night, teaming with Mark Starr to defeat JD Wolfe and Chick Donovan. In a match taped that night and aired on October 9, 1993, Houston and Starr were defeated by Harlem Heat. A follow-up appearance on October 16, teaming with Pez Whatley against The Nasty Boys.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm His final appearance would come on September 26, 1994, when he was defeated by The Honky Tonk Man at a WCW Pro taping in Knoxville, TN.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm = Independent circuit (1994-present) = He returned to wrestling on the independent wrestling circuit for GWE, OWE, and others in 2007.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sam-houston.html Wrestling against some top independent wrestling talent, such as Mike DiBiase. He won the Ark-La-Tex Heavyweight title on November 7, 2015, in Longview, Texas. Personal life Michael Smith is a second generation professional wrestler, his father being former wrestler Grizzly Smith. His siblings were also wrestlers; his half-brother is Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, and his younger sister is Rockin' Robin. Before his departure from the NWA, Smith had begun dating Tully Blanchard's valet Nickla Roberts, better known by the name Baby Doll. They were married in Lubbock, Texas on July 30, 1986, and went on to have two daughters together, named Mikala Joy and Mikka Tyler (Smith). Roberts chose to devote her time to her new baby girls instead of returning to wrestling. She divorced Houston in 1994, claiming Smith wanted to \\"be the life of the party\\". In August 2005, Smith was sentenced to 10 years in prison for repeated DUI arrests. He had been arrested numerous times before, with his ex- wife Roberts claiming in 2005 that he had had an average of two DUI arrests per year for the past ten years before he was sent to prison. Smith's home near New Orleans was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. He worked part-time at a construction company, and also helped his father at a cemetery, which is operated by the Firemen's Charitable and Benevolent Association, near the French Quarter in New Orleans. In 2009 Smith resurfaced on the Louisiana indy scene wrestling for Old School Wrestling Entertainment based in New Orleans and Mid South Wrestling Entertainment in Houma, Louisiana. Smith also tried to open his own wrestling company called Mid South Entertainment. He ran only one show booking the likes of Rod Price, One Man Gang, and many local wrestlers.

Dick. It was his first sold work, although not his first published story.Rickman, Gregg (1989), To The High Castle: Philip K. Dick: A Life 1928-1963, Long Beach, Ca.: Fragments West/The Valentine Press, p.388  Plot summary \\"Roog\\" is a story told from the point of view of a dog named Boris, who observes his masters carefully storing food in containers outside of their house day after day. Unbeknownst to the dog, these are the human's trash cans for garbage. The dog is later horrified to witness some food being 'stolen' by garbagemen who the dog believes are predatory carnivores from another planet. The dog comes to know these beings as 'Roogs', and tries to warn his master of each 'theft' with cries of 'Roog!' 'Roog!'. The humans, unable to comprehend the hound's message, think the dog is just being rowdy. Thus they attribute the sound the dog makes to be the sound that all dogs make when they are excited: 'Roog!' 'Roog!' The tale concludes with the animal being somewhat distraught, barking \\"ROOG!\\" very loudly at the garbagemen before they make off once more with trash in their garbage truck.  Publication  \\"Roog\\" was written in November 1951 and appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (February 1953, page 123) without illustration.Levack, Daniel (1981). PKD: A Philip K. Dick Bibliography, Underwood/Miller, p. 121 During this time Dick worked in a record store. In an essay prefacing a collection of his short stories published in 1978, Dick recalled the story's gestation, as well as discussing its plot, its general themes and his reaction at the time. Dick relates that he contacted Anthony Boucher, a sci-fi/fantasy publisher, editor and fellow writer whom Dick recalls as a kind friend. Dick wrote, \\"Without [Boucher's] help I'd still be in the record business. I mean that very seriously.\\" As a young man, Dick was very pleased with the publication, and wondered if he could quit his job at the record store and work full-time as an author, while the older Dick (27 years on) dismissed that aspiration as delusional. Soon after \\"Roog\\"'s original publication, Boucher attempted to get it published once more, in a science fiction anthology being compiled by a person Dick refers to as \\"Ms. J.M.\\" (Judith Merrill Interview with Lupoff). However, she disliked the story, finding it obscure and hard to understand. She also criticized Dick's description of the garbagemen as inaccurate, apparently unable to see that the description is from the protagonist dog's perspective. Despite Dick explaining the story in a letter to J.M. regarding the themes of the work, she rejected the story. Boucher, however, proceeded to publish it, and it remains in print today, at one time even appearing in a high school literature textbook.  Reception Dick regarded Roog as \\"quite a serious story\\". Dick explained in the introduction to The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick that \\"Roog\\" \\"tells of fear, it tells of loyalty, it tells of obscure menace and a good creature who cannot convey knowledge of that menace to those he loves\\". Furthermore Aaron Barlow suggests an insightful connection of the story to the nature and themes of his writings:  Trivia  * The dog in \\"Roog\\", Boris, was based upon a real dog called Snooper, who belonged to a neighbor of Dick.The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, Volume 1, The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford, (1990) Citadel Twilight p. 401 Snooper became very alarmed every time the garbagemen arrived to pick up trash, and this inspired Dick to write the short story.

Colley was killed in action, at the Battle of Majuba Hill. Early years He was third and youngest son of the Hon. George Francis Pomeroy (George Francis Colley from 1830) of Ferney, co. Dublin, by his wife, Frances, third daughter of Thomas Trench, dean of Kildare, and was grandson of John Pomeroy, 4th Viscount Harberton. Raised in Rathangan, County Kildare, he was educated at Cheam, Surrey, where his headmaster, Dr Mayo, described him as ‘swift to take offence, prompt and vigorous in resenting it.’ Sir William Francis Butler, ‘The life of Sir George Pomeroy-Colley, K. C. S. I., C. B.,C. M. G., 1835-1881; including services in Kaffraria--in China--in Ashanti--in India and in Natal’ (1889). He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was first in general merit and good conduct at the examinations in May 1852, and was appointed at the age of sixteen to an ensigncy without purchase in the 2nd or Queen's foot. His biographer Sir William F. Butler writes: ‘George Colley at this time has been described to me by one who remembers him well in his seventeenth year. He was slight and well proportioned, but with a look of great physical strength. The features possessed the strongly moulded type noticeable in several branches of the Colley race; the brown hair fell upon a forehead already suggesting intellectual power. His chief interests at this time were the artistic and literary pursuits which always held their own, notwithstanding an arduous professional life, until in the stress of the last few years they were necessarily laid aside. On such topics he was, I am told, often full of talk — at other times silent and dreamy. Though finished in manner even as a lad, he himself seems in his boyish years to have suffered from a quite disproportionate sense of shyness.' After two years' service with the depot, he was promoted to a lieutenancy without purchase, and joined the headquarters of his regiment, then on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony. In 1857-8 he held a border magistracy at the Cape, and showed great energy. On one occasion he received notice from the governor, Sir George Grey, of an insurrection which he had already suppressed. He was also employed to execute a survey of the Trans-kei country, a dangerous service in the then disturbed state of Kaffirland. When the Queen's were ordered to China, Colley rejoined his regiment, in which he obtained his company on 12 June 1860, and was present with it at the capture of the Taku forts, the actions of 12–14 August and 18–21 September 1860, and the advance on Peking. Staff College His regiment went home, and he returned for a brief period to the Cape to complete his work there, and then entered the Staff College, Sandhurst. He came out at the head of the list the same year, having passed with great distinction in ten months instead of the ordinary two years. Colley was an accomplished artist in water-colours, and spent much of his leave in sketching tours on Dartmoor, in Normandy, Spain, and other places. His literary attainments were considerable. He was in the habit of rising early, and securing always two hours before breakfast time for some special study. He thus acquired the Russian language, and studied chemistry, political economy, and other subjects not directly connected with his profession. In recognition of his services he was promoted to a brevet-majority on 6 March 1863. After serving for some years as major of brigade at Plymouth, the headquarters of the western district, he was appointed professor of military administration and law at the Staff College. While there he wrote the article 'Army,' extending over sixty pages, for the ninth edition of the 'Encyclopædia Britannica.' He was engaged on this work from June to November 1873. The last portion of the manuscript was sent in a few days before the author, now a lieutenant-colonel, started for the at the Gold Coast to join the Ashanti expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley. Arriving at a time when the failure of the transport was causing serious apprehension, Colley infused new life into that service; and the administrative skill and energy which he displayed contributed largely to the success of the expedition. He became part of the 'Africa Ring'.Shannon, pp. 265–7. Early in 1875 Colley, who had been made a colonel for his services in Ashanti, accompanied Sir Garnet Wolseley on a special mission to Natal, where he temporarily undertook the duties of colonial treasurer, in which capacity he was instrumental in introducing many reforms into the administration of the colony. But the chief feature of this visit to South Africa was a journey that he made into the Transvaal, and thence through Swaziland to the Portuguese settlement at Delagoa Bay, which bore fruit in a valuable report, and a map, which is entered in the 'British Museum Map Catalogue,' 67075. When Lord Lytton was appointed viceroy of India, early in 1876, he took Colley as his military secretary. This appointment was subsequently exchanged for the higher one of private secretary to the viceroy. It is no secret that in this capacity Colley exercised great influence in the events which led to the occupation of Kabul and the Treaty of Gandamak. He was still holding the office of private secretary to the viceroy when Sir Garnet Wolseley, on being ordered from Cyprus to Natal, after the disasters in Zululand, asked that Colley might join him, to which Lord Lytton consented. Colley accordingly served as chief of the staff to Wolseley in Zululand and the Transvaal, until the murder of Sir Louis Cavagnari at Kabul, and the outbreak of the second Afghan war caused his recall to India, when he resumed his post of private secretary to the viceroy. Colley, who had received the distinctions of Companion of the Order of the Bath and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in recognition of his official services in India. Second Anglo-Afghan War Sir George Colley during the Second Anglo-Afghan War Colley served nearly all of his military and administrative career in British South Africa, but he played a significant part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War as military secretary and then private secretary to the governor-general of India, Lord Lytton. The war began in November 1878 and ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak. After the war Colley returned to South Africa, became high commissioner for South Eastern Africa in 1880, and died a year later at the Battle of Majuba Hill during the First Boer War.Sir George Colley WDL11447.png caption, Library of Congress First Boer War Sir George Pomeroy Colley at the Battle of Majuba Hill Gladstone, the incoming Liberal Prime Minister was convinced that Beaconfieldism had alienated the Boers. To soften the blow of annexation by the British Empire, he resolved to decentralise a form of local government to the Transvaal Boers. This would be administered to them by the Governor- General of the Cape, Sir Bartle Frere, and the new Governor of the Natal, Major-General Sir George Colley. On 24 April 1880, he was appointed to the Natal command, with the rank of major-general, succeeding Sir Garnet Wolseley as governor and commander-in-chief in Natal, and high commissioner for South- eastern Africa.Shannon, Gladstone, p. 256. The close of that year found affairs in the Transvaal, which had been annexed since 1877, in a very critical state. 'Dingan's Day', 16 December 1880, a Boer republic was proclaimed at Heidelberg, Transvaal. Colley telegraphed London to express doubt that a Boer revolt was unlikely. The Liberal Government was in disarray: while left-leaning MPs called on the cabinet and colonial office to withdraw from the Transvaal and 'end the war' the Queen's Speech indicated that Her Majesty required imperial authority be restored. Yet within the new year Colley found himself compelled to take immediate measures for the relief of the small garrisons of British troops scattered throughout that territory, and those already besieged.Shannon, ibid, p. 271. With the small force available about fifteen hundred men he at once proceeded to the extreme northern border of Natal, and in the course of January had several conflicts with the Boer forces, the principal being at Battle of Laing's Nek and Ingogo Heights, the former of which was unsuccessful. On 17 February 1881, Sir Evelyn Wood, who had been appointed second in command, arrived at Newcastle with some additional troops, afterwards returning to Pietermaritzburg, and on 26 February, by a night march, Colley, with part of the troops, occupied, after an arduous climb of eight hours, a height known as Majuba, with a commanding view overlooking the Boer camp. Next morning, after a comparatively harmless fusillade, the hill was suddenly and quite unexpectedly carried by a rush of the Boers, Colley being shot dead by a rifle bullet through the forehead. As Edward Mahon, Surgeon, later explained to Sir George’s brother Henry: 'I saw him [the General] near the centre of the plateau on the top of the hill. They [the Boers] asked me to identify him, and this I did. He was only wounded once, and that through the top of the skull. Death must have been instantaneous. From the direction of the wound, he must have been facing the Boers when hit.' On the same day, London received a cable that Colley had been killed. The Prime Minister was ill in bed when he received the news which he referred to as \\"The Hand of Judgment?\\" and interpreted as a punishment for his Africa policy.Shannon, op cit., p. 273 He is buried at Mount Prospect Cemetery, Natal. Colley's death persuaded the Imperial government to act, to reassert its authority. The Queen urged the negotiating convention to avoid \\"troubles\\" in South Africa. In August the Pretoria session opened, and a British Resident was proposed as a permanent Crown representative in which was described as \\"an illusionists trick\\". The Volksraad would have to ratify the Convention's proceedings if the Boer republic was to accept its own freedom reinforcing their own volkisch, nationhood and identity. \\"The government\\", said Gladstone, sought to \\"signalise itself by walking in the plain and simple ways of right and justice, and which desires never to build up an empire except in the happiness of the governed.\\"Shannon, ibid, p. 280. Lord Salisbury was disgusted by the convention, demanding that the empire's suzerainty was immediately enforced. Colley's defeat and death highlighted the strains and tensions between empire and the governed, local governance and an Imperial Parliament. Family Colley married, in 1878, Edith, daughter of Major General H. Meade Hamilton, CB. They had no children but, by his marriage to Elizabeth Wingfield, Sir George's brother Henry FitzGeorge Colley was the father of ten children, including George Colley (whose descendants include historian Turtle Bunbury and designer Sasha Sykes), Edward Colley (who went down with the Titanic), Florence Bowen (the mother of Elizabeth Bowen), Gertrude Fiennes (great-grandmother to the actors Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes) and Bessie (who married Frederick Coplestone, the first Chief Justice of Burma).

The team is owned by Jimmy Creten, and includes Creten, his wife Dawn Creten, Trent Montgomery, and Todd Morey as drivers. Each truck features an old west theme with a character based on the truck's name. All three vehicles have competed in the Monster Jam World Finals, and Bounty Hunter was the 2005 World Finals Freestyle Champion and the 2019 World Finals Racing Champion. Jimmy Creten and Trent Montgomery currently drive the two Bounty Hunter trucks, Dawn Creten drives the Scarlet Bandit truck, and Todd Morey drives Iron Outlaw. History After attending a show in the Kingdome in 1995, Creten bought the \\"Shark Attack\\" monster truck and renamed it Bounty Hunter without knowing a truck with the same name, owned by Brian Bellini, already existed. After several years with the truck, he added a second truck named \\"2Xtreme\\", which would be driven by his wife, Dawn. While Bounty Hunter had a Chevy S-10 body on a custom chassis, 2Xtreme was a Dodge Dakota on a Dan Patrick built chassis. Iron Outlaw racing in Arizona Through a series of displays for the company, CSK became an official sponsor of the team in 2000. It was then that 2Xtreme was renamed Scarlet Bandit. The sponsorship lead to a significant increase in performance for the team, and they began to be shown on the Monster Jam television show, notably with a final-round appearance by Jimmy in Bounty Hunter against Tom Meents in the Pontiac Silverdome. For the 2002 season, both trucks were rebodied to Ford Expeditions, and were given new paint schemes with comic book character mascots. This was also the first year in which Bounty Hunter was invited to the World Finals, and was runner up in the racing segment. He also had runner-up finishes in the 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2011 events. Scarlet Bandit racing in Arizona For 2005, the new \\"Iron Outlaw\\" identity, driven by former Jurassic Attack driver Linsey Weenk, was added to the team as a replacement body for when Dawn could not attend events. This new look saw only limited action that season, but went full-time in 2006 when Dawn was expecting a child. After an unprecedented 7 event winning streak, the truck became a permanent team member. Also in 2005, Jimmy Creten won the World Freestyle Championship in Las Vegas, bolstering the team's reputation for freestyle as well as racing. In 2007, all three trucks competed on the circuit and all earned a slot at the World Finals. In July, Weenk announced he was moving to the Blue Thunder truck at the end of the season. On October 23, former Dragon Slayer driver Kreg Christensen was named as the replacement. During the prerace for the Samsung 500 NASCAR race at Texas in 2008, NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer and FOX analyst Jeff Hammond drove the Bounty Hunter truck (which was actually the Scarlet Bandit truck with a different body) for a feature segment of the show. In 2010, at World Finals 11, Dawn Creten and Scarlet Bandit competed in the 10 truck freestyle encore. In 2011, at World Finals 12, Creten lost to Tom Meents in Maximum Destruction in the final racing round, by about a truck length. Chris Kyle Bounty Hunter in Glendale, AZ Also, in 2011, the team took a hard hit, when Iron Outlaw driver Nick Owens died on August 13. His death was confirmed as a drowning. He was 30 years old and had just finished his rookie year and got rookie of the year in the seat of Iron Outlaw. In 2012, at World Finals 13, Creten brought a special half blue and half transparent paint scheme. This was the first time Jimmy Creten changes the paint job for Bounty Hunter, which has since become a tradition at every World Finals to date, similar to Avenger, as well as completing his first backflip at the same show. In 2013, at World Finals 14, Creten brought a special grey paint scheme. This version did not compete in freestyle due to a blown engine in Racing. In 2015, Bounty Hunter celebrated its 20th Anniversary. Creten brought a special half blue and half yellow paint scheme in the World Finals. In 2016, at World Finals 17, Creten brought a special paint scheme, to pay homage to Chris Kyle. This paint scheme ran for the rest of the year. In 2017, Scarlet Bandit and Bounty Hunter debuted a new paint scheme. In 2018, Austin Minton brought a second Bounty Hunter. He and the truck competed in the Double Down Showdown. Creten also debuted a new Ramer chassis in the same year. In 2019, Creten won the World Finals Racing Championship at World Finals 20 in Orlando, Florida. It's teammate truck, Scarlet Bandit, debuted a new paint scheme in the pit party at the same show.

Then, Jimmy Creten has driven it to second place in 2009 and 2012. The truck has broken a back wheel off in 2006, 2008 and 2015, ending his run. He has broken down early in the run in 2003, 2007, 2016 and 2018. The truck did not compete for freestyle in 2013, due to a blown engine during Racing. He flipped the truck in the middle of the run in 2002, but had a spectacular finish on the trailer jump in 2004. He also did a 360-degree flip during bonus time in 2009, but landed on the roof, and going back to all 4 wheels, making it the WOW Factor of the night. Scarlet Bandit: Scarlet Bandit usually comes out early or in the middle of the freestyle. In 2005, she got big air and scored a 25. In 2007, she got more big air and scored a 24. In 2008, she went for the triple bus jump and did the rollover of a lifetime and finished runner-up with a 36. Iron Outlaw: The truck scored a 14, after losing a wheel in 2006. In 2007, the truck put on an awesome run coming out second in a field of 22 trucks in freestyle and scored a 29, finishing 3rd. in 2008, the truck broke the right- front spindle after the first hit and scored a 4, ending him up in The Doghouse.

However, because the waves propagate through positively charged ions, ion acoustic waves can interact with their electromagnetic fields, as well as simple collisions. In plasmas, ion acoustic waves are frequently referred to as acoustic waves or even just sound waves. They commonly govern the evolution of mass density, for instance due to pressure gradients, on time scales longer than the frequency corresponding to the relevant length scale. Ion acoustic waves can occur in an unmagnetized plasma or in a magnetized plasma parallel to the magnetic field. For a single ion species plasma and in the long wavelength limit, the waves are dispersionless (\\\\omega=v_sk) with a speed given by (see derivation below) :v_s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_{e}ZK_{B}T_e+\\\\gamma_{i}K_{B}T_i}{M}} where K_{B} is Boltzmann's constant, M is the mass of the ion, Z is its charge, T_e is the temperature of the electrons and T_i is the temperature of the ions. Normally γe is taken to be unity, on the grounds that the thermal conductivity of electrons is large enough to keep them isothermal on the time scale of ion acoustic waves, and γi is taken to be 3, corresponding to one-dimensional motion. In collisionless plasmas, the electrons are often much hotter than the ions, in which case the second term in the numerator can be ignored.  Derivation  We derive the ion acoustic wave dispersion relation for a linearized fluid description of a plasma with electrons and N ion species. We write each quantity as X=X_0+\\\\delta\\\\cdot X_1where subscript 0 denotes the \\"zero-order\\" constant equilibrium value, and 1 denotes the first-order perturbation. \\\\delta is an ordering parameter for linearization, and has the physical value 1. To linearize, we balance all terms in each equation of the same order in \\\\delta. The terms involving only subscript-0 quantities are all order \\\\delta^0and must balance, and terms with one subscript-1 quantity are all order \\\\delta^1and balance. We treat the electric field as order-1 (\\\\vec E_0=0) and neglect magnetic fields, Each species s is described by mass m_s, charge q_s=Z_se, number density n_s, flow velocity \\\\vec u_s, and pressure p_s. We assume the pressure perturbations for each species are a Polytropic process, namely p_{s1} = \\\\gamma_s T_{s0} n_{s1} for species s. To justify this assumption and determine the value of \\\\gamma_s, one must use a kinetic treatment that solves for the species distribution functions in velocity space. The polytropic assumption essentially replaces the energy equation. Each species satisfies the continuity equation\\\\partial_t n_s + abla\\\\cdot(n_s\\\\vec u_s) = 0 and the momentum equation \\\\partial_t \\\\vec u_s + \\\\vec u_s \\\\cdot abla\\\\vec u_s = {Z_s e \\\\over m_s}\\\\vec E - { abla p_s \\\\over n_s}. We now linearize, and work with order-1 equations. Since we do not work with T_{s1} due to the polytropic assumption (but we do not assume it is zero), to alleviate notation we use T_s for T_{s0} . Using the ion continuity equation, the ion momentum equation becomes :(-m_i\\\\partial_{tt}+\\\\gamma_iT_{i} abla^2)n_{i1} = Z_ien_{i0} abla\\\\cdot\\\\vec E_1 We relate the electric field \\\\vec E_1 to the electron density by the electron momentum equation: :n_{e0}m_e\\\\partial_t\\\\vec v_{e1} = -n_{e0}e\\\\vec E_1 - \\\\gamma_eT_{e} abla n_{e1} We now neglect the left-hand side, which is due to electron inertia. This is valid for waves with frequencies much less than the electron plasma frequency (n_{e0}e^2/\\\\epsilon_0m_e)^{1/2} . This is a good approximation for m_i\\\\gg m_e , such as ionized matter, but not for situations like electron-hole plasmas in semiconductors, or electron-positron plasmas. The resulting electric field is :\\\\vec E_1 = - {\\\\gamma_eT_{e} \\\\over n_{e0}e} abla n_{e1} Since we have already solved for the electric field, we cannot also find it from Poisson's equation. The ion momentum equation now relates n_{i1} for each species to n_{e1}: :(-m_i\\\\partial_{tt}+\\\\gamma_iT_{i} abla^2)n_{i1} = -\\\\gamma_e T_{e} abla^2 n_{e1} We arrive at a dispersion relation via Poisson's equation: : {\\\\epsilon_0 \\\\over e} abla\\\\cdot\\\\vec E_1 = \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^N n_{i0}Z_i - n_{ne0} \\\\right] + \\\\left[ \\\\sum_{i=1}^N n_{i1}Z_i - n_{e1} \\\\right] The first bracketed term on the right is zero by assumption (charge-neutral equilibrium). We substitute for the electric field and rearrange to find : (1-\\\\gamma_e \\\\lambda_{De}^2 abla^2)n_{e1} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N Z_in_{i1} . \\\\lambda_{De}^2 \\\\equiv \\\\epsilon_0T_{e}/(n_{e0}e^2) defines the electron Debye length. The second term on the left arises from the abla\\\\cdot\\\\vec E term, and reflects the degree to which the perturbation is not charge-neutral. If k\\\\lambda_{De} is small we may drop this term. This approximation is sometimes called the plasma approximation. We now work in Fourier space, and write each order-1 field as X_1 = \\\\tilde X_1 \\\\exp i(\\\\vec k\\\\cdot\\\\vec x-\\\\omega t) + c.c. We drop the tilde since all equations now apply to the Fourier amplitudes, and find : n_{i1} = \\\\gamma_eT_{e}Z_i {n_{i0} \\\\over n_{e0}} [m_iv_s^2-\\\\gamma_iT_{i}]^{-1} n_{e1} v_s=\\\\omega/k is the wave phase velocity. Substituting this into Poisson's equation gives us an expression where each term is proportional to n_{e1}. To find the dispersion relation for natural modes, we look for solutions for n_{e1} nonzero and find: n_{i1}=f_in_{I1} where n_{I1}=\\\\Sigma_i n_{i1}, so the ion fractions satisfy \\\\Sigma_if_i=1, and \\\\langle X_i \\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\Sigma_i f_iX_i is the average over ion species. A unitless version of this equation is : {\\\\gamma_e \\\\over \\\\langle Z_i \\\\rangle} \\\\left\\\\langle {Z_i^2/A_i \\\\over u^2 - \\\\tau_i} \\\\right\\\\rangle = 1+\\\\gamma_e k^2\\\\lambda_{De}^2 with A_i=m_i/m_u, m_u is the atomic mass unit, u^2=m_uv_s^2/T_e, and : \\\\tau_i = {\\\\gamma_i T_i \\\\over A_i T_e} If k\\\\lambda_{De} is small (the plasma approximation), we can neglect the second term on the right-hand side, and the wave is dispersionless \\\\omega = v_sk with v_s independent of k.  Dispersion relation  The general dispersion relation given above for ion acoustic waves can be put in the form of an order-N polynomial (for N ion species) in u^2 . All of the roots should be real-positive, since we have neglected damping. The two signs of u correspond to right- and left-moving waves. For a single ion species, :v_s^2 = {\\\\gamma_eZ_iT_e \\\\over m_i}{1 \\\\over 1+\\\\gamma_e(k\\\\lambda_{De})^2} + {\\\\gamma_iT_{i}\\\\over m_i} = {\\\\gamma_eZ_iT_e \\\\over m_i} \\\\left[ {1 \\\\over 1+\\\\gamma_e(k\\\\lambda_{De})^2} + {\\\\gamma_iT_{i}\\\\over Z_i\\\\gamma_eT_e} \\\\right] We now consider multiple ion species, for the common case T_i \\\\ll T_e. For T_i=0, the dispersion relation has N-1 degenerate roots u^2=0, and one non- zero root :v_s^2(T_i=0) \\\\equiv {\\\\gamma_eT_e/m_u \\\\over 1+\\\\gamma_e(k\\\\lambda_{De})^2} { \\\\langle Z_i^2/A_i\\\\rangle \\\\over \\\\langle Z_i \\\\rangle } This non-zero root is called the \\"fast mode\\", since v_s is typically greater than all the ion thermal speeds. The approximate fast-mode solution for T_i\\\\ll T_e is :v_s^2 \\\\approx v_s^2(T_i=0) \\\\+ { \\\\langle Z_i^2 \\\\gamma_i T_i / A_i^2 \\\\rangle \\\\over m_u\\\\langle Z_i^2 / A_i \\\\rangle } The N-1 roots that are zero for T_i=0 are called \\"slow modes\\", since v_s can be comparable to or less than the thermal speed of one or more of the ion species. A case of interest to nuclear fusion is an equimolar mixture of deuterium and tritium ions (f_D=f_T=1/2). Let us specialize to full ionization (Z_D=Z_T=1), equal temperatures (T_e=T_i), polytrope exponents \\\\gamma_e=1, \\\\gamma_i=3, and neglect the (k\\\\lambda_{De})^2 contribution. The dispersion relation becomes a quadratic in v_s^2, namely: :2A_DA_Tu^4 - 7(A_D+A_T)u^2 + 24=0 Using (A_D,A_T)=(2.01,3.02) we find the two roots are u^2=(1.10,1.81). Another case of interest is one with two ion species of very different masses. An example is a mixture of gold (A=197) and boron (A=10.8), which is currently of interest in hohlraums for laser-driven inertial fusion research. For a concrete example, consider \\\\gamma_e=1 and \\\\gamma_i=3, T_i=T_e/2 for both ion species, and charge states Z=5 for boron and Z=50 for gold. We leave the boron atomic fraction f_B unspecified (note f_{Au}=1-f_B). Thus, \\\\bar Z=50-45 f_B, \\\\tau_B=0.139, \\\\tau_{Au}=0.00761, F_B=2.31 f_B/\\\\bar Z, and F_{Au}=12.69(1-f_B)/\\\\bar Z.  Damping  Ion acoustic waves are damped both by Coulomb collisions and collisionless Landau damping. The Landau damping occurs on both electrons and ions, with the relative importance depending on parameters.

It is common to the members of a particular social group and the corresponding society. The concept of the imaginary has attracted attention in anthropology, sociology, philosophy, and media studies. Definitions The roots of the modern concept of the imaginary can be traced back to Jean-Paul Sartre's 1940 book The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination in which Sartre discusses his concept of the imagination and the nature of human consciousness. Subsequent thinkers have extended Sartre's ideas into the realms of philosophy and sociology. For John Thompson, the social imaginary is \\"the creative and symbolic dimension of the social world, the dimension through which human beings create their ways of living together and their ways of representing their collective life\\".John B. Thompson, Studies in the Theory of Ideology (1984) p. 6 For Manfred Steger and Paul James \\"imaginaries are patterned convocations of the social whole. These deep-seated modes of understanding provide largely pre-reflexive parameters within which people imagine their social existence—expressed, for example, in conceptions of 'the global,' 'the national,' 'the moral order of our time.'\\" John R. Searle uses the expression \\"social reality\\" rather than \\"social imaginary\\".John R. Searle, The Construction of Social Reality (Penguin 1996) p. 4 =Castoriadis= In 1975, Cornelius Castoriadis used the term in his book The Imaginary Institution of Society, maintaining that 'the imaginary of the society ... creates for each historical period its singular way of living, seeing and making its own existence'.Quoted in Thompson, p. 23 For Castoriadis, 'the central imaginary significations of a society ... are the laces which tie a society together and the forms which define what, for a given society, is \\"real\\"'.Thompson, p. 24 In similar fashion, Habermas wrote of 'the massive background of an intersubjectively shared lifeworld ... lifeworld contexts that provided the backing of a massive background consensus'.Jürgen Habermas, Between Facts and Norms (1996)p. 322 and p. 22 =Lacan= \\"The imaginary is presented by Lacan as one of the three intersecting orders that structure all human existence, the others being the symbolic and the real\\".David Macey, \\"Introduction\\", Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho- Analysis (London 1994) p. xxi Lacan was responding to \\"L'Imaginaire, which was the title of the 'phenomenological psychology of the imagination' published by Sartre in 1940, where it refers to the image as a form of consciousness\\".Macey, p. xxi Lacan also drew on the way \\"Melanie Klein pushes back the limits within which we can see the subjective function of identification operate\\",Jacques Lacan, Écrits: A Selection (London 1997) p. 21 in her work on phantasy—something extended by her followers to the analysis of how \\"we are all prone to be drawn into social phantasy systems...the experience of being in a particular set of human collectivities\\".R. D. Laing, Self and Others (Penguin 1969) p. 38-40 \\"While it is only in the early years of childhood that human beings live entirely in the Imaginary, it remains distinctly present throughout the life of the individual\\".J. Childers/G. Hentz eds., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 152 The imaginary as a Lacanian term refers to an illusion and fascination with an image of the body as coherent unity, deriving from the dual relationship between the ego and the specular or mirror image. This illusion of coherence, control and totality is by no means unnecessary or inconsequential. \\"The term 'imaginary' is obviously cognate with 'fictive' but in its Lacanian sense it is not simply synonymous with fictional or unreal; on the contrary, imaginary identifications can have very real effects\\".Macey, p. xxi =Taylor= Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor uses the concept of modern social imaginaries to explore the Western transition from the hierarchical norms of pre-modern social imaginaries to the egalitarian, horizontal, direct access social imaginary of modernity.Charles Taylor, A Secular Age (2007) p. 164-5 and p. 209 He sees the Renaissance ideal of civility and self-fashioning as a sort of halfway houseCharles Taylor, A Secular Age (2007) p. 112 on the road to modernity and modern morality. The modern social imaginary he considers comprises a system of interlocking spheres, including reflexivity and the social contract,Michael McKeon, The Secret History of Domesticity (2005) p. 107 public opinion and Habermas' public sphere, the political/market economy as an independent force, and the self-government of citizens within a society as a normative ideal.Charles Taylor, A Secular Age (2007) p. 176-207 Taylor has acknowledged the influence of Benedict Anderson in his formulation of the concept of the social imaginary.Poovey, M. \\"The Liberal Civil Subject and the Social in Eighteenth- Century British Moral Philosophy.\\" Public Culture 14.1 (2002): 125-45, p. 132 Anderson treated the nation as 'an imagined political community...nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artifacts of a particular kind'.Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities (London 1991) p. 6 and p. 4 Ontology While not constituting an established reality, the social imaginary is nevertheless an institution in as much as it represents the system of meanings that govern a given social structure. These imaginaries are to be understood as historical constructs defined by the interactions of subjects in society. In that sense, the imaginary is not necessarily \\"real\\" as it is an imagined concept contingent on the imagination of a particular social subject. Nevertheless, there remains some debate among those who use the term (or its associated terms, such as imaginaire) as to the ontological status of the imaginary. Some, such as Henry Corbin, understand the imaginary to be quite real indeed, while others ascribe to it only a social or imagined reality. John R. Searle considered the ontology of the social imaginary to be complex, but that in practice 'the complex structure of social reality is, so to speak, weightless and invisible. The child is brought up in a culture where he or she simply takes social reality for granted....The complex ontology seems simple'.John R. Searle, The Construction of Social Reality (Penguin 1996) p. 4 He added the subtle distinction that social reality was observer-relative, and so would 'inherit that ontological subjectivity. But this ontological subjectivity does not prevent claims about observer-relative features from being epistemically objective'.Searle, p. 12-3 Technology In 1995 George E. Marcus edited a book with the title Technoscientific Imaginaries which ethnographically explored contemporary science and technology. A collection of encounters in the technosciences by a collective of anthropologists and others, the volume aimed to find strategic sites of change in contemporary worlds that no longer fit traditional ideas and pedagogies and that are best explored through a collaborative effort between technoscientists and social scientists. While the Lacanian imaginary is only indirectly invoked, the interplay between emotion and reason, desire, the symbolic order, and the real are repeatedly probed. Crucial to the technical side of these imaginaries are the visual, statistical, and other representational modes of imaging that have both facilitated scientific developments and sometimes misdirected a sense of objectivity and certitude. Such work accepts that 'technological meaning is historically grounded and, as a result, becomes located within a larger social imaginary'. R. T. A. Lysioff et al, Music and Technoculture (2003) p. 10 Media imaginary Several media scholars and historians have analyzed the imaginary of technologies as they emerge, such as electricity, mobile phones, and the Internet. Serial imaginary A recent research led by a team from the Université Grenoble Alpes offer to develop the concept of imaginary and understand how it functions when faced with serial works of art. This research, published in Imaginaire sériel: Les mécanismes sériels à l'oeuvre dans l'acte créatif, (Jonathan Fruoco and Andréa Rando Martin (Ed.), Grenoble, UGA Edition, 2017), subscribes to Gilbert Durand's Grenoble school of thought and both questions the impact of seriality on our imaginary and defines the imaginary of seriality.Jonathan Fruoco, Andréa Rando Martin, Arnaud Laimé, Imaginaire sériel: Les mécanismes sériels à l'œuvre dans l'acte créatif, Grenoble, UGA Editions, 2017, 174 p. (), p. 10-15 The development of this concept allows a better understanding of the close link between the ability to condition and organize exchanges between an experience and its representation, and a procedure based on the rhythmical repetition of one, or several, paradigms in a determined and coherent body, which allows their reproduction and inflection 6. Serial works of art thus form a privileged field of studies since they turn this recursion and redundancy into structuring principles. This research tries to illustrate this serial conceptualization of the imaginary by analyzing serial literature, television series, comic books, serial music and dance, etc. Architectural imaginary Peter Olshavsky has analyzed the imaginary in the field of architecture. Based on the work of Taylor, the imaginary is understood as a category of understanding social praxis and the reasons designers give to make sense of these practices.

History The Russian Team was formed in December 1984 in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions. It consisted of NWA World Tag Team Champions Don Kernodle and Ivan Koloff plus Ivan's nephew Nikita Koloff whom they were training. After they lost the title, Kernodle was fired and replaced with Krusher Khruschev. The Koloffs and Kernodle had been named the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Champions and after his firing, Kernodle was replaced with Kruschev mid reign. The new line-up won the NWA World Tag Team Titles twice (the second time without Kruschev as a championship team member). They feuded with Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and the Rock 'N Roll Express. Nikita, mentored by Ivan, challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but was defeated by Flair in the main event of the 1985 Great American Bash. After his firing, former team member Kernodle teamed with his brother Rocky to feud with the Koloffs and helped the Express to win the Tag Team Title from them at Starrcade '85: The Gathering. They also had many hard-fought matches against The Road Warriors, who could match up in strength and size. During their feud with Magnum T.A., Nikita won the United States Title in a best of seven series. Then in October 1986, Magnum was injured in a car wreck and his career was over. Nikita left the Russian Team and joined Rhodes forcing Ivan and Krusher to feud with them. Krusher left in December 1986 and Ivan replaced him with Vladimir Petrov to get Nikita. Ivan and Petrov continued to call themselves the Russian Team until they added Dick Murdoch a few months later. In 1988, Ivan Koloff and his manager Paul Jones recruited two masked Russian Assassins to feud with Nikita. However, the Assassins and Jones turned on Koloff after he lost a Russian Chain match to Ricky Morton at Clash of the Champions III: Fall Brawl. Now a babyface, Ivan reunited with Nikita to feud with the Assassins.

(born September 11, 1935), is a Canadian diplomat, trial and appellate lawyer, arbitrator and corporate director. He served as the Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations from August 1988 to December 1991. In August 2013, he became a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee and the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. He also served as the national president of the Canadian Bar Association in 1982-1983. Early life and family Fortier was born in Quebec City in 1935. His father was a regional service agent for passengers on the Canadian Pacific Railway. After Fortier earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the Université de Montréal in 1955 and was considering a legal career, his father encouraged him to apply to the law school at McGill University in Montreal to improve his English. At that time, McGill taught in English only. When Fortier said he was worried about learning law in English, his father said: \\"Yves, les anglophones assis à côté de toi, ils n'ont jamais fait de droit en anglais non plus\\". (\\"Yves, the anglophones sitting beside you will have never learned law in English either.\\") Fortier applied to McGill and was accepted, and then successfully persuaded the McGill faculty that he should be able to sit his examinations in French. He graduated with a Bachelor of Civil Law degree from McGill in 1958.Jean-Benoît Nadeau, \\"Arbitre en chef\\", McGill News Alumni Magazine, Fall- Winter 2014. While at McGill, Fortier met his future wife, Carol Eaton, who was studying for her Bachelor of Arts degree. Her father encouraged Fortier to apply for a Rhodes scholarship following his graduation from McGill, although Fortier jokes that \\"Je pense qu'il voulait m'éloigner de sa fille\\" (\\"I think he wanted to get me away from his daughter.\\") Rhodes House, Oxford Fortier was awarded a Rhodes scholarship in 1958, for two years. At that time, Rhodes scholars were required to be single and to live in a college at Oxford. He and Carol deferred their marriage for a year, with his commitment to her that he would try to get the regulation changed. In his first major advocacy, he and some other Rhodes scholars in similar situations were able to persuade the Prefect of Rhodes House to change the rule. He and Carol married in 1959. The next year he received his Bachelor of Letters degree from the University of Oxford. Fortier insisted with his wife that their children be educated in French. He believes that it is extremely important to protect the French language in Quebec. Fortier keeps fit with tennis, skiing, and especially cross-country skiing. He and his wife travel extensively.Marc-André Séguin, \\"The Diplomat,\\", CBA-ABC National, January-February 2014. Personal reputation Brian Mulroney, Fortier's friend, former law partner, and former Prime Minister of Canada, has said that Fortier was consistently considered one of the top three courtroom lawyers in Canada. Fortier has said that he does not like being called an \\"avocat\\" or advocate, and prefers the terms \\"plaideur\\", meaning one who seeks to persuade. One of his other colleagues has described him: \\"Bien des plaideurs oublient que leur objectif est de convaincre. Ils parlent fort, ils sont agressifs, mais ça ne marche pas. Yves, lui, est persuasif : il a de l'humour, des idées, du charme, il est rigoureux\\" (\\"A lot of lawyers forget that their objective is to convince. They speak loudly, they are aggressive, but that doesn't work. But Yves, he is persuasive: he is humorous, he has ideas and charm, and he is rigorous\\"). Fortier was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1976. In 2007, he was appointed \\"Avocat émérite\\" (\\"Ad.E.\\") by the Barreau du Québec, one of the first recipients of the award. In 2002 while serving on the board of Nortel Fortier was the subject of a conflict of interest controversy as he both sat on the board and provided billed legal services to the company. He stepped down from the board in 2005 during an accounting scandal. Since becoming an international arbitrator, Fortier has developed an impressive reputation. One of his former colleagues from Ogilvy Renault, Pierre Bienvenu, has stated that he is one of the four or five international arbitrators who are most in demand in the world. He has been described as humble, treating junior lawyers with respect, and always willing to share credit on major files with other people who have worked on them with him. Political views Fortier has described himself as both a Quebec nationalist and a committed federalist. Growing up, he saw the domination of the anglophone minority in Quebec. For instance, his father could not rise above a certain position in his career because he was francophone. At the same time, he rejected the sovereigntist approach of René Lévesque. Mulroney has joked that Fortier has only one defect: being a Liberal. Legal career =Fifty years at Ogilvy Renault= Place Ville- Marie, Montreal, where Fortier has his office. In 1961, he was called to the Quebec bar. He joined the well-known firm of Ogilvy Renault, where he practised for half a century. While at Ogilvy Renault, he developed a friendship with another young lawyer, Brian Mulroney, who went on to be Prime Minister of Canada. Fortier served as Chairman of Ogilvy Renault from 1992 to 2009. He left the firm on good terms in 2011 to establish a solo international arbitration practice. Fortier developed an active civil litigation practice, both within Canada and internationally. He acted in a wide range of litigation matters: commercial law, bankruptcy cases, tax law, competition law, and divorces all came within his practice. He appeared before the Supreme Court of Canada on twenty-five cases, including lead counsel for the Government of Canada on one of the most important Supreme Court cases, the Reference re Secession of Quebec. He also argued before international arbitration panels, including the International Court of Justice. He has represented Canada in boundary disputes with the United States over the boundary with Maine, and with France in relation to St Pierre and Miquelon, as well as fisheries disputes with the United States. He has been counsel to several royal commissions and public inquiries, as well as counsel to the Government of Quebec in relations with the Cree Nation in Quebec. On November 15, 2010, Ogilvy Renault LLP joined with London-based law firm Norton Rose.Hasselback, Drew. \\"Ogilvy Renault to join with Norton Rose.\\" Financial Post, November 15, 2010. Last accessed August 31, 2016. In 2011, citing potential conflicts of interest posed by the expansion of the firm's clientele, Fortier left Norton Rose and established his own firm in order to continue his career as an international arbitrator independently.Gray, Jeff. \\"Norton Rose loses 'great leader' over merger.\\" Globe and Mail Blog, Friday, October 21, 2011. Last accessed August 31, 2016.\\"Norton Rose loses star Montreal lawyer L. Yves Fortier\\", Montreal Gazette, October 21, 2011.\\"Fortier leaves Norton Rose with ‘heavy heart’ \\", Law Times, October 31, 2011. =Declined appointment to Supreme Court of Canada= In 1988, Fortier was contacted by his old law partner, now Prime Minister Mulroney, who offered him an appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada. Fortier turned it down, explaining later: \\"Juge à la Cour suprême, ça n'était pas dans mon ADN. Vivre comme un moine. Fréquenter les mêmes huit personnes. Sans pouvoir lâcher son fou. Non merci.\\" (\\"Judge on the Supreme Court, that wasn't in my DNA. Living like a monk. Hanging out with the same eight people. Not being able to let loose. No thanks.\\") Although the fact that he declined an appointment is now public knowledge, he has said that he would have preferred that the story never have leaked out. Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations United Nations Security Council Chamber After Fortier turned down the appointment to the Supreme Court, Mulroney instead offered to appoint him Canada's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Fortier accepted the position, serving for four years, from 1988 to 1992. From 1989 until 1990, he was also Canada's representative to the UN Security Council and in October 1989 was the President of the Security Council. Fortier was Canada's principal delegate to four sessions of the General Assembly, including serving as Vice-President at one of those sessions. The role of ambassador at the United Nations was much more to his taste than a judicial appointment would have been. He was constantly using his skills as an advocate and mediator, advancing Canada's position while responding to initiatives from the ambassadors of other countries. He also acknowledged that his personal connection to the Prime Minister was of great assistance. He summed up his term as being at the right place at the right time: \\"During my term in New York, the Berlin Wall came down, the Soviet Union broke up, we went through the first Gulf War, Nelson Mandela was released — how wonderful it was to meet him! Let's say that all this gave me exposure to some outstanding matters.\\" Five years after his term as ambassador ended, Fortier was invited to give the annual O.D. Skelton Lecture organized by the federal Department of Foreign Affairs (now Global Affairs Canada). In his address, he gave a retrospective on his time at the United Nations and his opinion on the value of the organization. He concluded that the United Nations served an increasingly important role in the international community. In his opinion, international issues are too large and too complex for any one nation to solve. Multilateral solutions are necessary, and the United Nations provides the avenue for such solutions to be found. Fortier also emphasized that Canada has an important role to play at the United Nations: Canada's views are solicited and do count. Fortier rejected the popular myth that the United Nations is mainly dominated by dictators and petty tyrants. He also suggested that Canada's participation in the United Nations helps to free Canada from dominance by the United States. Overall, Fortier said that he had become almost a missionary in speaking for the good played by the United Nations. Arbitration career =Becomes international arbitrator= After his term as Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations, Fortier decided he would concentrate on acting as an arbitrator in international commercial matters, rather than returning to his civil litigation practice. Through his firm he made contacts with some of the leading arbitrators in the United Kingdom, which led to him being appointed the chair of a panel on a major arbitration concerning the Channel Tunnel. From that point on, he focused on international arbitrations. =Positions held with arbitration organisations= Permanent Court of Arbitration courtroom. From 1984 to 1989, Fortier was a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration located at The Hague, Netherlands. From 1998 to 2001, he served as President of the London Court of International Arbitration. After leaving Ogilvy Renault, in 2012 Fortier joined Arbitration Place in Toronto and is currently a Member Arbitrator.Arbitration Place: \\"L. Yves Fortier, C.C., O.Q., Q.C., L.L.D.\\". He is also a member of 20 Essex Street in London, a commercial barristers and arbitrators chambers. In June 2012, Fortier was appointed chair of the World Bank Group's Sanctions Board in order to help combat corruption and fraud in projects financed by the World Bank. =Hockey Hall of Fame inquiry= In 1993, Fortier was asked to investigate a controversy at the Hockey Hall of Fame. The outgoing president of the National Hockey League, Gil Stein, had been elected to the Hall, but rumours arose that he had put undue pressure to ensure his induction. Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, retained Fortier and an American lawyer, Arnold Burns, former Deputy Attorney General of the United States, to review the issue. In their report, they concluded that Stein had \\"improperly manipulated the process\\" and \\"created the false appearance and illusion\\" that the owner of the Los Angeles Kings, Bruce McNall had put Stein's name forward. Stein denied this suggestion and argued that it had been McNall's idea. Nonetheless, the upshot was that Stein withdrew his nomination.\\"Stein Is Scratched as N.H.L. Immortal,\\" New York Times, August 18, 1993. =Yukos arbitration= Fortier was the presiding member of the arbitration panel in the Yukos arbitration, which resulted in the largest award ever made by an international arbitration panel. (The other two members of the panel were Arbitrators Charles Poncet and Stephen M. Schwebel.) The arbitration involved a major dispute between the shareholders of Yukos, a Russian energy company, and the government of Russia. The shareholders argued that the Russian government had improperly expropriated the company, allegedly to satisfy unpaid back-taxes.Andrew E. Kramer, New York Times, December 1, 2009: \\"A Victory for Holders of Yukos.\\" The arbitration was argued under the Energy Charter Treaty. In 2009, the panel held that it had jurisdiction to hear the complaint.PCA Case No. Aa 227: In The Matter Of An Arbitration Before A Tribunal Constituted In Accordance With Article 26 Of The Energy Charter Treaty And The Uncitral Arbitration Rules 1976 - Between - Yukos Universal Limited (Isle Of Man) - And - The Russian Federation: Interim Award On Jurisdiction And Admissibility, 30 November 2009.Dr. Chiara Giorgetti, \\"The Yukos Interim Awards on Jurisdiction and Admissibility Confirms Provisional Application of Energy Charter Treaty\\", American Society of International Law: Insights (2010), Volume: 14, Issue: 23. In 2014, the panel ruled on the merits of the claim and ruled in favour of the shareholders. The panel awarded more than US$50 billion to the shareholders, the largest award ever made by an international arbitration panel. However, Russia then applied to the District Court of The Hague to have the awards set aside. In 2016, the District Court ruled that the panel did not have jurisdiction under the Energy Charter Treaty, and set aside the award. It is now under appeal to The Hague Court of Appeal for a full de novo hearing, which could take several years. Security Intelligence Review Committee On August 8, 2013, Fortier was appointed to a five-year term on the Security Intelligence Review Committee, the federal watchdog over the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. For this reason, he was sworn in as a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on the same day. In 2014, the Committee announced that Fortier would chair a panel conducting an inquiry into a complaint that CSIS had spied on citizens conducting peaceful protests over the proposed Keystone oil pipeline. That in turn triggered a request from the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, one of the parties to the complaint, that Fortier recuse himself because he had formerly sat on the board of Trans Canada Pipelines, which was now one of the proponents of the project, and also held a large number of shares in that company. However, Fortier declined to recuse himself and the hearing went ahead as scheduled in Vancouver in 2015.\\"Observer spy exposé triggers federal hearings\\", National Observer, August 12, 2015. Canadian Bar Association =Leadership positions= Fortier has been active in the Canadian Bar Association throughout his career, at both the provincial and national levels. From 1975 to 1976, he was the president of the Quebec Branch of the CBA.Canadian Bar Association - Quebec Branch: Anciens presidents. Then, from 1982 to 1983, he was the national president of the CBA. =The CBA and the constitutional debate= The mid-1970s were a turbulent time in Canadian and Quebec politics. Fortier and the CBA played a part in the constitutional debate triggered by the election of the separatist Parti québécois government of René Lévesque in the provincial election of 1976. At the national meeting of the CBA in 1977, following the election of the PQ the previous year, the outgoing national president, Boyd Ferris, proposed that the CBA should declare itself in support of national unity and a strong federal government. A resolution to that effect was introduced by Paul Fraser, the president of the British Columbia Branch of the CBA and seconded by Robert Lesage, the president of the Quebec Branch.\\"Canadian Unity: Presidential Address of A. Boyd Ferris, Q.C.\\", The Advocate (1977), Vol 35, pp 413-417. The resolution was controversial, because some members did not think the CBA should take a position on a political issue, while members from Quebec objected that the resolution was attempting to impose a particular view of the sovereignty issue as a condition of membership in the CBA. There were considerable debates and negotiations on the proposed resolution, which resulted in an amendment being moved by Fortier and Bryan Williams, the incoming president of the BC Branch. The amendments removed the language calling for the CBA to support national unity and to reject provincial separatism. Instead, the resolution called on the CBA to create a Committee on the Constitution which would consider the constitutional issues facing the country and prepare a detailed report on possible amendments to the Constitution of Canada. The CBA passed the amended version of the resolution as proposed by Fortier and Williams.CBA Resolution 77-01-A: Constitution of Canada - Special Committee; reproduced in Canadian Bar Association: Towards a new Canada - Committee on the Constitution, p. xv. The resolution called for the Constitution to be re-written \\"so as better to meet the aspriations and present-day needs of all the people of Canada and to guarantee the preservation of the historical rights of our two founding cultures.\\"CBA Resolution 77-01-A, para (ii).Canadian Bar Association: Towards a new Canada - Committee on the Constitution, p. ix. The resolution also set out the mandate for the Committee, which was to undertake \\"the search for a definition of the essential constitutional attributes of a Canadian federalism\\", with a final report to be presented at the next Annual Meeting of the CBA in 1978.CBA Resolution 77-01-A, para (iii). Following the passage of the resolution, the new president of the CBA, Jacques Viau, set up the Committee. The members were drawn from each province of Canada, and included two future provincial premiers, a future Supreme Court justice, two future provincial chief justices. Fortier was the member from Quebec. The Committee released its report at the next annual meeting of the CBA at Halifax in 1978. The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations for constitutional change, including a completely new constitution, abolishing the monarchy, changing the Senate, entrenching language rights and a bill of rights, and changing the balance of powers between the federal government and the provinces. =Dispute between the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of Canada= In 2014, Fortier was one of eleven past-presidents of the CBA who intervened in a dispute between the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, and the Chief Justice of Canada, Beverley McLachlin, over the appointment of Justice Marc Nadon to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Prime Minister criticised the Chief Justice, alleging that she had acted improperly. The CBA past-presidents defended her actions, as did the then-President, Fred Headon.\\"Canadian Bar Association Presidents: Harper’s disrespect for the Supreme Court harms the workings of government\\", The Globe and Mail, May 6, 2014.\\"Lawyers’ association calls on Stephen Harper to acknowledge chief justice did nothing wrong,\\" Toronto Star, May 4, 2014. In the fall of 2013, the federal government appointed Justice Nadon of the Federal Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. Although he was sworn in, an issue arose whether he was eligible to be appointed under the terms of the Supreme Court Act. In the spring of 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that Justice Nadon was not eligible to be appointed, because he was on the Federal Court of Appeal rather than on a Quebec superior court, as required by the Supreme Court Act.Supreme Court Act, RSC 1985, c S-26, ss 5, 6. After the Supreme Court's decision, the Prime Minister publicly criticised the Chief Justice, saying that she had behaved improperly in speaking of the qualification issue during a consultation about the appointment some nine months earlier, with the Minister of Justice, Peter McKay.\\"Stephen Harper lashes out at top judge on Supreme Court\\", Toronto Star, May 2, 2014. Fortier and ten other past-presidents of the CBA then wrote an open letter to The Globe and Mail, criticising the Prime Minister's conduct. They stated: \\"... these circumstances leave us concerned that the Prime Minister's statements may intimidate or harm the ability of the Supreme Court of Canada to render justice objectively and fairly – even when the government of Canada chooses to be a litigant before it.\\" In addition to Fortier, the letter was signed by Paul D.K. Fraser, Q.C. of Vancouver; Thomas G. Heintzman, Q.C. of Toronto; Daphne Dumont, Q.C. of Charlottetown; Simon V. Potter of Montreal; William Johnson, Q.C. of Regina; Susan McGrath of Iroquois Falls; Bernard Amyot of Montreal; Guy Joubert of Winnipeg; D. Kevin Carroll, Q.C. of Barrie; and Rod Snow of Whitehorse. =Criticism of the location of Victims of Communism memorial= In 2015, Fortier was one of seventeen past-presidents of the Canadian Bar Association wrote an open letter to the Globe and Mail, criticising plans to locate a proposed Memorial to the Victims of Communism immediately adjacent to the Supreme Court of Canada.\\"Bar Association Presidents: Proposed communism monument would put justice under a shadow\\", The Globe and Mail, March 26, 2015. While not opposing the idea of the monument itself, the group of past-presidents argued that it was inappropriate for an overtly political memorial to be placed adjacent to the Supreme Court, which is politically neutral: \\"It is ill conceived, however, to add an imposing sculpture signalling a strong political message, controversial or not, literally in the face of the very institution which is the final arbiter in Canada of disputes involving Canadians, the federal and provincial governments, and foreign litigants.\\" In addition to Fortier, the letter was signed by Paul D.K. Fraser, Q.C. of Vancouver; Wayne Chapman, Q.C. of Saint John; J.J. Camp, Q.C. of Vancouver; Thomas G. Heintzman, Q.C. of Toronto; Gordon F. Proudfoot, Q.C. of Dartmouth; Russell Lusk, Q.C. of Vancouver; Daphne Dumont, Q.C. of Charlottetown; Simon V. Potter of Montreal; Susan T. McGrath of Iroquois Falls; Brian A. Tabor, Q.C. of Halifax; Bernard Amyot of Montreal; J. Guy Joubert of Winnipeg; D. Kevin Carroll, Q.C, of Barrie; Rod Snow of Whitehorse; Trinda L. Ernst, Q.C. of Kentville; and Robert Brun, Q.C. of Vancouver. Late in 2015, the federal government announced that it would move the proposed memorial to a different location.\\"Feds will move, redesign proposed Victims of Communism Memorial\\", Ottawa Sun, December 17, 2015. Corporate career Fortier was also active in business affairs, and was involved with several major corporations. From 1997 to 2006, he was Governor (Company Chairman) of the Hudson's Bay Company, North America's oldest company (established by English royal charter in 1670). Fortier was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of the aluminum company Alcan Inc. from 2002 to 2007, prior to its acquisition by Rio Tinto, becoming Rio Tinto Alcan. He also served as a director on several other publicly traded corporations, including Royal Bank of Canada, Trans Canada Pipelines Limited, Dupont Canada Inc., Westinghouse Canada Inc., Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and Nortel. Charitable donations In 2009, Fortier set up an entrance scholarship and made a substantial donation to fund a lecturer series at McGill Law School. The L. Yves Fortier Entrance Scholarship is an annual $10,000 scholarship for a first year law student who displays a commitment to bilingualism, as Fortier himself did as a law student. The scholarship is funded by a donation of $200,000 which Fortier gave to the law school.McGill Channels: \\"Yves Fortier creates Faculty of Law’s largest entrance scholarship\\", January 7, 2009. In addition, Fortier gave a donation of $50,000 to fund the John E.C. Brierley Memorial Lectures. In 2003, Fortier had been the first speaker in the lecture series, which was named after a former dean of McGill Law School who worked in the area of arbitration. These donations came just two months after the aluminium company, Rio Tinto Alcan, had made a donation of $3 million to endow in honour of Fortier, the former chairman of Alcan. The L. Yves Fortier Chair in International Arbitration and International Commercial Law commemorated Fortier's leadership in the field of arbitration. Also in 2009, the firm and partners at Ogilvy Renault gave a combined gift of $1 million to the McGill Law School, to support Ogilvy Renault Faculty Scholars in Arbitration in Commercial Law. Fortier's personal share of the donation was $250,000.Robert Todd, \\"Ogilvy injects $1 million into McGill law’s coffers\\", Canadian Lawyer, June 1, 2009.

Early life  Lynn was born Laura Lynn Allen in Orange, California, the youngest daughter of a retired Air Force officer. She has four brothers and an older sister who died at the age of two from an undetected heart defect. When Lynn was three, her parents divorced after it was discovered her father had a family with another woman. Shortly after, Lynn's mother suffered a nervous breakdown, and Lynn was placed in foster care, where she was physically abused. She was reunited with her mother when she was seven. Shortly after, the two of them were involved in a car accident on the interstate; Lynn was thrown clear of the car and her mother died at the scene. Lynn and her brothers were placed with her father and his new family; in total there were eight boys and Lynn in the house. When Lynn was eleven, her father died of alcoholism and heart failure. As a teenager, Lynn self-described her change as going from \\"pudgy kind of bucktoothed\\" tomboy to a \\"rocking little body\\". She started doing fitness modeling, bikini modeling, and hot body contests. She relocated to Hollywood and became a regular at the clubs on Sunset Strip.  Career  Lynn was a bikini and figure model in Los Angeles in the early 1980s; following this she was featured in nude magazine photo spreads for Penthouse, Hustler, Chic, High Society and Club magazines. Lynn made the transition from nude modeling to pornographic films with an appearance in Bobby Hollander's 1983 feature Personal Touch 3 in a scene with Craig Roberts, and in the video \\"Vixens In Heat\\" release date= December 1983 In 1983, shortly after her photo spread appeared in Penthouse magazine, she went to an audition for a movie where the director was a well-known porn veteran. There, in an effort to calm her nervousness, the director offered Lynn a pipe with some freebase cocaine. It was her first encounter with the drug; she later described the feeling of being as \\"It's as if the birds are singing. The light is brighter. All of a sudden I'm no longer this gangly nervous teenager. I'm sitting there going 'Oh wow!. Lynn was the first female performer to open the door for adult film stars to be featured in dance touring, being recognized for this accomplishment throughout the United States and Canada. Lynn was the highest paid female performer on the strip club circuit, making $32,000 a week.Stripper Magazine Volume 10, Issue 1. Jan/Feb 1998 Lynn has had roles in non-adult films such as Evils of the Night (1985) and 52 Pick-Up (1986), and in the television program The Man Show and guest starred as herself in Lionsgate's Who's Jenna...? (2018). For her 28th birthday in 1992, Lynn hosted a benefit birthday party at the Bel Age hotel in Beverly Hills. The benefit was in honor of The Youth AIDS Foundation of Los Angeles, an organization providing housing and assistance for helping runaways get off the streets and for teenagers with HIV, which was about to go under. An August 1992 issue of the Los Angeles Times quoted her statement on page two: \\"Let's give them food, clothing and shelter and we'll worry about role models later\\", alongside a shot of her dressed in a formal gown, holding an infant girl. This was a breakthrough moment for how the adult industry was viewed by the mainstream concerning its crossover involvement in children's organizations, as never before had a children's organization knowingly accepted support from the adult entertainment industry. Lynn has opposed the Los Angeles \\"Safer Sex in the Adult-Film Industry\\" initiative, which mandates that actors in adult films shot in Los Angeles County use condoms. She has been involved in the first charity to accept contributions from the adult film industry, Youth AIDS Foundation of Los Angeles, since 1992. She also helps other charities such as Childhood Cancer Awareness, The Southern California Toy Run and Janie's Fund, Steven Tyler's new organization. Lynn hosts a weekly talk show called Rock’N'SeXXXy UnCensored on LATalkRadio.com and Stitcher.com. She is a member of the Adult Video News (AVN) Hall of Fame and was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Free Speech Coalition. She continues to perform as an adult actress.  Personal life  Amber Lynn is the sister of porn actor Buck Adams. Lynn met porn actor Jamie Gillis on the set of her second-ever pornographic film, and the two began a long-term relationship. Lynn had her first experience with cocaine on a porn set very early in her career. She eventually became addicted to cocaine, a drug addiction that lasted for nearly two decades. She once said, \\"I started out drinking Ketel One and slicing off crystals of Peruvian rock. I wound up broken down, drinking Kamchatka Vodka out of a half-pint stashed in the bottom of my purse, with my crack pipe stuffed in the lining of my jacket\\". She has been clean and sober since 2000, and occasionally works as a personal recovery assistant, helping addicts to detox. She also works in mainstream acting roles, as a webcam model on one of the largest cam sites online, and as a real estate agent specializing in luxury homes.

The series began in 1992, and is sanctioned under the umbrella of the United States Hot Rod Association. Events are primarily held in North America, with some additional events in other countries. Although individual event formats can vary greatly based on the \\"intermission\\" entertainment, the main attraction is always the racing, two-wheel skills competition, and freestyle competitions by monster trucks. Live events Grave Digger, one of the most popular monster trucks on the Monster Jam tours Monster Jam events are held throughout the year in various venues around the U.S. and Canada. Events are generally held in the winter and early spring when professional football and southern baseball stadiums are generally dormant for their main purpose. Events have also been held in other locations around the world, including Europe, Australia, Mexico, Costa Rica, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Singapore. At Monster Jam events, monster trucks face off in three forms of competition: racing, two-wheel skills, and freestyle. Racing is traditional heads-up tournament racing, where the first truck to cross the finish line moves onto the next round; the final race of the night is for that particular event's championship. The two-wheel skills competition was introduced in late 2017. This competition consists of trucks performing their best moves on two wheels for two attempts. They can also choose to perform donuts or cyclones as an alternative. The two-wheel skills winner is determined by attendees voting via a score tracking website. The truck with the highest score at the end of the event wins that particular competition. The freestyle competition allows drivers two minutes (one-and-a-half minutes for arena shows) on an open floor to show off their skills as they drive the trucks over ramps and junked cars, performing stunts and tricks with their trucks. In 2020, Monster Jam introduced a rule in which a truck must complete 30 seconds to qualify for an eligible score. If they fail to do so, they will receive a score of 0. The freestyle winner is determined by attendees voting via a score tracking website. The truck with the highest score at the end of the event wins the competition. Each event produces its own winner. This winner is determined by the truck that has the most points gained in that particular event at the end of that event. If the same driver wins all three events in the same night, they are considered as \\"Doubling Down\\" in the event. Between the main competitions, other events are held. In the Triple Threat Series and Arena Series, the \\"donut\\" competition is featured, in which a driver tries to spin their truck until the driver or truck is unable to continue, or until the driver thinks they have a high enough score to win. Also presented at Triple Threat Series events are ATV racing, speedster racing, and speedster obstacle course competitions.

From 2019 and beyond the tour will still begin in January but will now end in May with the World Finals at a rotating venue each year, with shows continuing until the end of the year. The tours visit many major cities in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Central America, South Africa, and Australia. In 2015, an arena tour called \\"#MoreMonsterJam\\" debuted. This tour featured 8 drivers driving 3 different vehicles in a points series. The top two finishers received an invitation to the Monster Jam World Finals 16. Also in 2015, Monster Jam started its first stadium tour called the Fox Sports 1 Championship Series. This tour followed 16 drivers each weekend on Fox Sports 1 competing for points in qualifying, racing, obstacle course racing and freestyle. The top four in the series received invitations to the Monster Jam World Finals 16. In 2016, the #MoreMonsterJam series was split into two series, east and west, with the winner of each tour getting an invitation to Monster Jam World Finals 17. Since then the number of regional tours has increased, both for stadium and arena tours. In 2019, the Monster Jam calendar featured four arena tours with 8 drivers each; each tour's winner receives a spot at the Monster Jam World Finals XX in Orlando. The schedule also includes three stadium tours, each with 14 drivers competing for one spot in Monster Jam World Finals XX. There will be also an international tour consisting of 10 drivers competing in Europe and South Africa, but that tour will not offer a spot into World Finals XX. Following the World Finals, additional exhibition tours are held through much of the rest of the year (called the Path Of Destruction Tour). These include stadiums tours in northern cities where it is too cold during the main competition season to hold outdoor events. Monster Jam World Finals The Monster Jam World Finals are the culmination of the Monster Jam winter season, featuring top drivers from the year. It is often referred to as the \\"Super Bowl of monster trucks\\" and features drivers competing for the racing and freestyle championships. For the first 19 World Finals, the event was held annually at Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada. On February 15, 2018, a new format was announced where the World Finals would rotate venues annually, beginning with World Finals XX. The original location for World Finals XX was set to be MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but it was later changed to Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida due to scheduling issues. World Finals XXI was scheduled for May 2–3, 2020, at Camping World Stadium. The event was later cancelled due to public health concerns regarding the international coronavirus pandemic. This is the first time that a Monster Jam World Finals event has been cancelled. Also, uncoincidentally, the years will now match with the World Finals number (WF21 taking place in 2021). Monster Jam Hall of Fame On January 8, 2020, Monster Jam announced that they would be establishing a Hall of Fame, dedicated to honor those who, \\"have made immeasurable contributions to the sport\\". Dennis Anderson, creator and former driver of Grave Digger, and Scott Douglass, longtime announcer of Monster Jam events, were announced as the inaugural class of the new Hall of Fame at a live event at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on January 11, 2020. They were set to be officially inducted at an awards ceremony during the weekend of World Finals XXI prior to the event's cancellation.  Licensing  Mattel's Hot Wheels brand produced officially licensed toy versions of monster trucks under the Monster Jam name. They also sponsored a monster truck which competed in the series in previous years. Monster Jam and Mattel's contract ended in 2018. Monster Jam toys are now produced by Spin Master, starting in January 2019. Five officially licensed Monster Jam video games have been produced. The first two, Monster Jam: Maximum Destruction, a vehicular combat game, and Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal, an arcade racing game, were published by Ubisoft. The third, titled simply Monster Jam, was released by Activision on November 13, 2007, and a sequel to it called Monster Jam: Urban Assault was released on October 28, 2008. A fifth game, Monster Jam: Path of Destruction, was released on November 9, 2010. On June 17, 2015 Monster Jam Battlegrounds was released as a download on Xbox Live and Steam. Monster Jam: Crush It! was released on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on October 25, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on October 31, 2017. On June 25, 2019, Monster Jam Steel Titans was released on the PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Traxxas released a series of radio controlled former and current Monster Jam monster trucks, including Bigfoot, Grave Digger or Monster Mutt. Media coverage In the US, Monster Jam originally aired on TNN and Speed, with season preview and World Finals recap packages occasionally airing on CBS as part of the CBS Sports Spectacular from 2007 to 2012. From 2014 to 2018, FS1 and FS2 aired events form the series. Beginning in 2019, NBC Sports started airing the show on NBCSN. Recaps from each event are posted on Monster Jam's official YouTube account the following week. In 2020, during the international coronavirus pandemic, Monster Jam began posting recaps (called \\"Rewinds\\")/televised recordings of previous events recorded in 2019 and 2020, such as the 2019 All-Star Challenge. These \\"Rewinds\\" lasted mostly an hour long. In 2020, Monster Jam introduced their membership program for YouTube. This membership provided events that take place in years such as 1999, 2002, 2007, and more. The membership fee is $5. New membership videos are posted each week. In Australia, Monster Jam airs on One.

Animation that premiered on Kids' WB on September 7, 1996, and ended after one season on February 22, 1997. It was later shown on Cartoon Network from February 7, 1998 until 2000. The show follows the adventures of the Road Rovers, a team of five super-powered crime-fighting anthropomorphic dogs, known as \\"cano-sapiens\\". The characters all live with world leaders, including the President of the United States, the British Prime Minister, the Chancellor of Germany and the Swiss President, with one dog living in the Kremlin. Plot In the town of Socorro, New Mexico, Professor Shepherd was forced to relinquish an experimental transdogmafier technology to General Parvo in exchange for his lost dog, but instead Parvo gives him a bomb that destroys his laboratory. One year later, as normal dogs begin to mutate into monsters, Shephard, who miraculously survived the attack, takes measures to stop Parvo who is behind this. Shepherd selects five different dogs and in his new, secret underground lab, he uses his new transdogmifier on the five, turning them into \\"Cano-sapiens\\". These dogs are the pets of world leaders and when called to action they are a team of crime fighters known as The Road Rovers. Characters *Hunter (Jess Harnell): A Golden Retriever mix breed from the United States and the leader of the team. While an effective, optimistic, and loyal leader, Hunter also can get overly cocky. Hunter's power is super speed; this allows him to run faster than the speed of sound. Hunter lives with President Bill Clinton in the White House. *Colleen (Tress MacNeille): A no-nonsense Rough Collie from the United Kingdom, and the only female in the group. Colleen is the coordinator of the team, always checking to make sure everything goes well without any problems or issues. She is also a skilled martial artist, using her skills to help the team. She currently resides with the prime minister of the United Kingdom, John Major and his wife. *Blitz (Jeff Bennett): A Doberman from Germany. Unlike Hunter, Blitz is shown to have arrogant, selfish, and cowardly tendencies. Blitz has a short temper, and is quick to anger. His super powers are his sharp claws and strong jaws, which allow him to bite and claw through most things. Blitz formerly was a guard dog for thieves, but now lives with the chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl. His personality is a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger. *Exile (Kevin Michael Richardson): A Siberian Husky from Siberia. His full name is Exilo Michalovitch Sanhusky. Exile speaks English with a thick Russian accent, sometimes mixing up words in the process (ex: \\"Aprilday\\" instead of \\"Mayday\\", \\"Jingle balls\\" instead of \\"Jingle bells\\"). Exile is kind and friendly, but also has a bit of a temper. He's super strong and has heat, ice, and night vision. Exile used to work with other huskies as a sled dog, but now lives with the president of Russia Boris Yeltsin. *Shag (Frank Welker): A cowardly Old English Sheepdog from Switzerland. Shag only transformed halfway into a Cano-sapien. He walks like a human, but speaks in a half-dog, half-human dialect. In addition to this, he does not wear a uniform, instead remaining in his natural state. He's super strong and his hair can store a lot of things like weapons and random items He lived in a valley with a flock of sheep, but now lives with Arnold Koller, the president of the Swiss Confederation. *Muzzle (Welker): A Rottweiler. Muzzle was once \\"Scout\\", Professor Sheperd's dog that was kidnapped. He was never transformed into a Cano-sapien, but instead became aggressive due to Parvo's failed experiment on him. Due to this aggression, he is often restrained on a cart while wearing a straitjacket and mask. *Persia (Sheena Easton): An Afghan Hound and commander of the Space Rovers. *Professor Hubert (David Doyle): A Bloodhound scientist. *Professor William F. Shepherd \\"The Master\\" (Joseph Campanella): The geneticist behind the transdogmafier and the Road Rovers. He's the master of the Road Rovers, and the one who selected each of them. Without him, the world would have been ruled by the cano-mutants led by Parvo. *General Parvo (Jim Cummings): The Road Rovers' main antagonist who is out to destroy Professor Shepherd and conquer the world. He has a permanent cough. It was revealed later in the series that General Parvo was at one time a Cat before being transformed into a \\"Feline Sapien\\", which resemble humans a great deal more than Shepherd's Cano-sapiens. He shares a very similar appearance to wrestler Hulk Hogan. The name Parvo derives from a canine disease which often kills puppies. *The Groomer (Sheena Easton): The Groomer is the mostly loyal assistant to General Parvo. She's generally armed with a portable hair clipper, though she uses other equipment when it's appropriate. *Cano-mutants: Dogs turned into humanoid monsters and led by Parvo. Episodes Home media releases A multi-region DVD of the entire series was announced on February 4, 2015 by Warner Archive and was released on February 10, 2015.

Several more teams were later founded in Berlin and the rest of Germany, as well as a national federation. Cricket lingered on over the following century, with occasional visits of German players to England and British and other foreign teams touring in Germany, but only when it got a foothold in the German universities in the 1980s did the number of German cricket clubs and players start to grow again.History of cricket in Germany , at the German Cricket Federation website Until recently, much of the cricket was played by British soldiers stationed in Germany. However, in recent years the popularity of the game has increased due to an influx of migrants and refugees from cricket-playing countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The national organisation for the game is currently the German Cricket Federation (Deutscher Cricket Bund, DCB), founded in 1988. In 2016 there are about 220 cricket teams in the country, up from 70 in 2012. By 2019, the number of teams had increased to 350. International team Germany has a national team that takes part in the European Championship and has also taken part in the ICC Trophy. Regional associations German Cricket is organized in several regions, which all have their own leagues. The winner of those will play for the national championship.

Clubs which cannot join a league (mostly due to lack of available members) may still take part in independently arranged friendly matches. The club's wicket can vary from a grass pitch (grown on the natural soil) to coconut fibre wickets on concrete, flicx® pitches, and do-it-yourself constructions. The size of the field also varies, from a good club size (English standard) to double hockey pitches which the club hires, and unusual fields such as that at Göttingen, which is large, but has a bank that rises up to 4 metres above the level of the square. Indoor cricket is played in various tournaments throughout the winter, mostly in German 3 field gyms, or in indoor tennis halls, in Twenty20 format. =Leagues= The majority of cricket clubs are organised into six regional leagues. Each region hosts one or two leagues of 6 or 7 clubs. Matches are over 50 overs. In two of the leagues the first and second placed teams meet in play-offs, and the winner of the play-off is the regional champion. At the end of the regional season, national play-offs are held: the northern league champions (NDCV (North), NRCU (North Rhine Westphalia), BCV (Berlin)) play against each other, and the southern teams (HCV (Hesse), BWCV (Baden Württemberg), BYCV (Bavaria)) do likewise. The overall northern and southern winners then play off for the German Championship. Independent of the regional leagues are 20/20 tournaments which are mostly invitational tournaments initiated by one team. References Further reading * P.G.G. Labouchere, T.A.J.

The song's lyrics were written in 1905 by Charles E. Tourison 1905, W. L. Umstad 1906, and Bill Forbes 1906, a trio of roommates at Beta Theta Pi, and set to the tune of George M. Cohan's \\"Give My Regards to Broadway\\".Songs of Cornell, compiled and edited by Thomas A. Sokol; Cornell University Glee Club, Ithaca, New York, 1988 The song refers to a fictional encounter between an anonymous student and David Fletcher \\"Davy\\" Hoy (for whom Hoy Field is named), the registrar and secretary for the committee on student conduct, and Thomas Frederick \\"Tee Fee\\" Crane, the Professor of Languages and the first Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences revolving around the student's expulsion on account of binge drinking. David Hoy was known for his ferocity as a strict disciplinarian. Professor Crane, on the other hand, was generally well liked among students. \\"Piker\\" is said to be a historical slang term for a freshman, perhaps from the more general term \\"piker\\" meaning tightwad or cheapskate. \\"Theodore Zinck's\\" was a bar in downtown Ithaca that has since closed. Its legend still lives on in the weekly event for seniors \\"Zinck's Night\\", which is celebrated worldwide in October by Cornellians.

Sometime in the 1950s, another unofficial version appeared, referring to President Deane Malott's \\"Social Events Standards\\" that attempted to ban fraternity parties, to ban women from visiting men's off- campus apartments, and to maintain the strict curfews and sign-in/out times for women. This verse is only a modest form of outrage as compared to the protests that were staged (at one, students burned an effigy of Malott) and the mobs that formed (one marched to President Malott's house demanding his resignation and throwing eggs, rocks, and smoke bombs).Rossiter, Caleb.

They specialise in humppa and jenkka music and have been successful in Germany, Finland and elsewhere. Current members of the band are Onni Waris (keyboard, vocals), Petteri Halonen (keyboard, guitar, vocals), Lassi Kinnunen (accordion, vocals), Martti Waris (bass, vocals) and Tapio Santaharju (drums, vocals). Ilmari Koivuluhta (sound technique, logistics) and Pekka Jokinen (graphics, merchandise) complete the \\"humppa family\\". According to the band's statements, they play between 80 and 100 concerts per year, of which only 20 in Finland and 40 to 50 in Germany, due to their popularity there. Rarely performing in big venues, they have visited several big international music festivals, and surprisingly to many, even large heavy metal festivals e.g. Wacken Open Air and Tuska Open Air. They travel mostly on a private lorry and no bus. Eläkeläiset mainly play cover versions of famous pop and rock hits in a fast humppa or slow jenkka style (both sound somewhat similar to polka music the way \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic plays it) with Finnish lyrics — the original songs are barely recognizable. They also publish bootleg recordings of their own concerts. Eläkeläiset are very popular among some OpenBSD developers and frequently played at their hackathons, where they claim they are \\"thwarting evil with humppa and math.\\"OpenBSD 3.4 lyrics Eläkeläiset was one of the nominees to represent Finland in Eurovision Song Contest 2010.Amadeus ja Eläkeläiset pyrkivät euroviisuedustajiksi.

The 1st XV play in Southern Counties North. The club is located in the village of Sonning, on the outskirts of Reading. The 1st XV is coached by Ben Wills, assisted by defence coach Gareth Williams, 2nd XV coach Jack Lynch and 3rd XV coach Gareth Tully. The coaching team is headed up by Director of Rugby Andrew Arter  History  Reading was originally formed as 'Berkshire Wanderers' in July 1898 when RFU President Roger Walker, RFU Secretary George Rowland Hill and Cambridge Blue G R Joyce held a meeting in Pangbourne. Their aim was to set up a rugby club in Reading and the first game was played at the County Cricket Ground, Kensington Road, in September 1898. The club led a nomadic existence until, shortly before World War II, they moved to their present headquarters at Holme Park, Sonning. The club's name was changed to Reading in 1956 and the first trophy was won in 1970 when Marlow were beaten 16–3 at Maidenhead in the inaugural Berkshire Cup Final. In the 1970s, Reading went into decline as Maidenhead and then Abbey became predominant in Berkshire. However, a successful colts side, organised by the late John Silverthorne, formed the basis of a revival following a disastrous 1982–83 season in which only one game was won. Coach Jeff Owen and skipper Ian Turrell joined forces in the early 1980s and through their emphasis on forward power, Reading became known as \\"The Green Machine\\". The Berkshire Cup was won for the second time in 1986 and then regularly until the Wanderers – the 2nd XV – won it for a record tenth time, beating Bracknell in the final. The Southern Merit Table was also won six times in less than a decade. In the 1986–87 season, the team won 30 out of 34 matches and also reached the third round of the John Player Cup, running Coventry, then amongst the country's elite, very close before going down 26–12. When the leagues started in 1987, Reading were placed in South West Division Two and lost their first-ever league game at home to Berry Hill. Nevertheless, they finished second in the league and were promoted. Three successive promotions under Mike Tewkesbury's guidance from 1992–93 took Reading into the country's top thirty teams. Reading played five seasons at this level, peaking at a final position of 6th, but by the time Tewkesbury left in 1999 problems were already apparent, as successive financial cuts had depleted the squad. Successive relegations took the side back into South West Division One. However, with Alastair McHarg and Dick Michael at the helm, steady progress was made over the next three seasons, culminating in promotion to National Division 3 South in 2004. The 2004–05 season started badly, with defeat in the hot sunshine at Hertford, but it ended entertainingly with a 50–28 win against old rivals Lydney and a creditable sixth place. The 2005–06 season started in much the same way with early defeats and many team changes due to injuries. However, there was no revival after Christmas as opportunities were missed in consecutive weeks for wins over Rosslyn Park and Southend which saw Reading return to South West Division 1. The worst moments for the team and supporters were the defeats at relegation rivals Bracknell and Old Patesians. The 2006–07 season saw an end of season upsurge in form with Reading finishing safely fifth in the table. McHarg said that \\"We've been playing with a lot of passion and commitment. The players have lifted themselves – they've stuck together and done exceptionally well.\\" The 2007–08 season saw them relegated to South West Division Two where they were originally placed when leagues started in 1987. The 2008–09 season saw them promoted again but this was short lived as they were relegated once more in season 2009–10. The 2009–10 season has the team finishing 5th in the South West 1 East Division. The 2010–11 season saw another mid table finish of 6th place.

The club have an over-35s squad (4th team), the \\"Rhinos\\". Current squad 2019-20 Women's rugby \\"Reading Ladies\\" are now a well-established team, playing regular Sunday fixtures against teams throughout the region. On 2 January 2008, a combined Berkshire and Buckinghamshire side played Canada U19s at RRFC. The half-time score was 19–5 to the visitors with the Canadian women's under-19 side eventually winning 41–5. Reading under-15s girls and under-18s girls make up most of the Berkshire County sides and recently have had two England International girls and one Scotland International girl making the squads from Reading RFC. In 2014–15 the under-18 Berkshire Barbarians girls side (combined Newbury RFC & Reading RFC) won the National 15's title as well as the Wasp's 10's Worthing 10's and National 7's titles In 2016 The Berkshire Barbarians became just Reading & Newbury girls and then in Sep 2017 the cluster fully split leaving Reading RFC as a standalone girls club. In 2018-19 the U18 Team won the Area2 Cup by beating London Scottish U18 Girls making it the national Semi finals where they lost to Pulborough the eventual winners. The U15 team were beaten at the Area Semi Final stage. At the 2019 Worthing 10's the U15's were runners up to OA's and the U18's won the cup narrowly beating Dorchester. 2 U18 players represented England U18 Girls vs Emerging Wales during 2019 and past players played for several Tyrell's Premiership teams. Youth rugby Reading have seen a resurgence in youth rugby in recent years and now have representative teams in all age categories. Youth rugby is played on Sunday mornings. Reading also have two very successful girls teams at under-15s and under-18s and a very successful senior ladies side. Reading Rugby Club also has the highest level of RFU accreditation with the RFU Whole Club Seal of Approval award on top of its Mini/Midi Seal of Approval Level 3, along with Club Mark and Sport England.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 27, 2000. In the episode, after getting his face censored out on the Duff Beer calendar for not being photogenic, Moe Szyslak gets plastic surgery and becomes the star of a popular soap opera. Plot After being tricked into evacuating the house by Homer, who had set off the fire alarm early in the morning, the family goes to a festival sponsored by Duff Beer. While there, they see Moe Szyslak enter a \\"Beer-tender\\" competition. Moe wins the contest during the \\"Toss Your Drunk\\" challenge and gets his photo taken for a calendar, only to have it censored out with stickers. Realizing this is because of how ugly he is, Lenny and Carl suggest that Moe gets plastic surgery. He agrees, but is reluctant while there. After his surgery, Moe has a very handsome face. Vindicated, he confronts old adversaries, including the producers of a soap opera, It Never Ends, complaining that he never got the part of Dr. Tad Winslow because of his ugliness. When the actor portraying the role is fired after demanding a salary increase, the producers hire Moe to replace him. Meanwhile, while Moe is acting, Bart and Lisa discover that Maggie's Duff Days elephant balloon has blown away in the wind. They go after it until it ends up in a gay Republican coalition's office where the members are discussing what their mascot should be, one member dismisses the pink elephant as being too \\"on the nose\\". They then give Lisa a bumper sticker telling her to vote for \\"A Gay President in 2084\\", to which they say \\"we're realistic\\" when Lisa appears puzzled. Taping of It Never Ends goes well until Moe reads in a top-secret book of future plot lines that his character is to be killed off. Infuriated, he gets revenge by revealing all the plots on the air, with help from Homer. The producer angrily interrupts to tell Moe that his character's death was meant to be part of a dream sequence, as indicated by the book's color-coding of pages that Moe had remembered incorrectly, and fires him. Moe confidently states that he can get a role on any other soap opera he wants, but as he is leaving, a set piece falls on his face and crushes it back to its original appearance. His life returns to normal at the bar, but his musings about why the accident left him with his original face instead of an entirely new one are quickly cut off by the ending credits. Production and themes \\"Pygmoelian\\" was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Mark Kirkland as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). In a 2007 article, Slant critic Ed Gonzales noted that in relation to the episode's primary story of Moe's plastic surgery, the subplot of Bart and Lisa chasing Maggie's pink elephant balloon into a meeting for gay Republicans serves as \\"a seemingly arbitrary bit of nonsense that connects succinctly with the theme of identity in which a person changes their face only to realize the efficiency of their old one.\\" Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 27, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Larry Doyle, Matt Selman, Carolyn Omine, and Mark Kirkland participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. Reception Reception of the episode from critics has been generally positive. Brendan Dando & Guy Davis of the Four Finger Discount podcast describe this as one of the strongest episodes of the season. Davis explains, \\"No line goes wasted, even the simple moments like Lenny, Carl and Homer walking into Moe's have laugh-out-loud one liners.\\" Dando credits Duffman as one of the episode's highlights, along with the spot-on spoof of daytime soap opera intros. Ed Gonzales of Slant called it a \\"great episode.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode \\"peaks early, as the scenes at 'Duff Days' provide the most amusement.\\" He added that \\"It’s nice to see a focus on Moe for once, but the tale itself fails to really ignite. Though not a poor episode, it’s pretty flat after the opening.\\" In 2009, writers for IGN listed a line by Moe from this episode among their top eight favorite Moe quotes. The line was \\"Yeah, hey, I've got a gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching and I... the feeling is indescribable.\\" Homer responds to this by saying \\"I know what you mean. Our dog had that.\\" The IGN writers commented that \\"We've never heard anyone describe their life's passion as a parasitic infestation, and we hope we never have to. The cherry on top of this little nugget of Moe goodness is Homer's nonchalant reaction. He's probably used to Moe's strange, gross remarks by now.\\" In his review of the eleventh season of The Simpsons, Den of Geek critic Mark Oakley wrote that the \\"cobbled-together feel to the series stops it from reaching the heights of a few years before.\\" Oakley blamed this on lazy writing, and added that \\"Proof of this comes when, on more than once occasion, the scripts include get-out clauses for the ridiculous storylines being churned out.\\" He gave \\"Pygmoelian\\" as an example, commenting: \\"Moe has cosmetic surgery. However, at the show’s end his more familiar face is suddenly returned to him following an accident and the fact that this happens without horrendously disfiguring him is pondered upon by Moe himself as the credits roll. Playing this card once might be funny, but after three or four times it’s just plain lazy.\\" References External links *\\"Pygmoelian\\" at The Simpsons.com Category:The Simpsons (season 11) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Body image in popular culture Category:Television shows about plastic surgery ","title":"Pygmoelian"},{"id":"1901727","text":"The Battle of Nanchang () was a military campaign fought around Nanchang, Jiangxi between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Japanese Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War. It was the first major conflict to occur following the Battle of Wuhan.  Background  Following the Fall of Nanjing, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force launched long- distance pre-emptive strikes from newly captured airbases in Nanjing against targets in Nanchang, including the primary Chinese Air Force base at Qingyunpu. Despite heavy losses of many of the Chinese Air Force's top veteran fighter pilots and most of the equipment over the course of the Battle of Shanghai, Battle of Taiyuan, and Battle of Nanjing, the Chinese Air Force was revitalized through the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and the Chinese pilots along with the Soviet Volunteer Group of pilots continued to put up resistance in their the air over Nanchang as the Japanese continued to bomb and soften the defenses there.https://www.ncnews.com.cn/xwzx/ncxw/lnc/201912/t20191218_1514702.htmlhttp://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_chi- sheng.htmhttp://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/soviet_gubenko.htm After the capture of Wuhan by the Japanese, Wuhan became the base of the Eleventh Army of the Imperial Japanese Army, in the former location of the Fifth and Ninth War Zones of the National Revolutionary Army. Nanchang was a railway hub and the western terminus of the Chekiang-Hunan Railway, being a major supply line between the Third and Ninth War Zones. In addition, it was the location of airfields that threatens shipping routes along the Yangtze River.Hsu Long- hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), 2nd Ed., 1971. Translated by Wen Ha-hsiung, Chung Wu Publishing; 33, 140th Lane, Tung-hwa Street, Taipei, Taiwan Republic of China. pp. 293–300 Map. 14–15 The Nationalist government reorganized the chain of command in the Ninth War Zone, with Chen Cheng remaining in the nominal post while Xue Yue was assigned to conduct the actual operations. Shortly before the beginning of the campaign, the Chinese forces amassed 200,000 troops from 52 divisions near Nanchang, but due to logistics the reorganization were largely ineffective.  Prelude  = Battle of Xiushui River = Early model of Type 89 I-Go. Back in July 1938, Japanese troops had attempted to approach Nanchang during their assault on Wuhan, but their advance were stopped by the Chinese defenders at the Xiushui River. The Chinese positions were well entrenched, blocking the path to Nanchang for the Japanese troops. For the rest of the year, the stalemate continued as both sides remained standstill on each side of the river. In the spring of 1939, the Japanese troops with their new reinforcements began their new offensive toward Nanchang. On 20 March, the Japanese troops under the direct command of Yasuji Okamura launched heavy artillery shelling over Chinese fortifications on the other side of the Xiushui River. The Japanese sappers under the cover of artillery fire were able to set up bridges quickly which allowed the Japanese tanks to be deployed across the river, decimating the Chinese forces in the process. Two days later, the strategic location of Wucheng, located at where Xiushui River enters Poyang Lake, sustained heavy naval bombardment and airstrikes by the Japanese navy and fell shortly after to the Special Naval Landing Forces on 23 March. In addition to conventional artillery fire, the Japanese bombardment also utilized toxic gas produced by Unit 731, which had been deployed occasionally in the China field of operations.Yoshimi and Matsuno, Dokugasusen kankei shiryô II, Kaisetsu 1997  Order of battle at the battle of Xiushui River  The Japanese Army used the \\"6th Field Heavy Artillery Brigade\\" artillery unit under the command of Major Gen. Sumita. This force consisted of the following artillery sections: *13th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment (Lt. Col. Okoshi, 24 Type 4 15 cm Howitzers) *14th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment (Lt. Col. Maruyama, 24 Type 4 15 cm Howitzers) *10th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment (Lt. Col. Nagaya, 24 Type 4 15 cm Howitzers) *15th Independent Field Heavy Artillery Regiment (Col. Horikawa, 16 Type 14 10 cm Cannons) *2nd Independent Heavy Artillery Battalion (Lt. Col. Manba, 4 Type 89 15 cm Cannons) *101st Field Artillery Regiment (Lt. Col. Yamada, 34 Type 38-improved 75mm Field Guns) *3rd Independent Mountain Gun Regiment (Lt. Col. Morikawa, 24 Type 41 75 mm Mountain Guns) *106th Field Artillery Regiment (Lt. Col. Uga, 32 Type 38-improved 75mm Field Guns) *2nd Battalion/2nd Independent Mountain Gun Regiment (Major Matsumoto, 12 Type 41 75 mm Mountain Guns) Battle = Japanese attack = By 26 March, the Japanese troops supported by tanks had broken out of their Xiushui River bridgehead and reached the west gate of Nanchang, defeating Chinese reinforcements from the Third War Zone. Yasuji Okamura's troops were joined by another Japanese regiment striking south from the north of Nanchang, and the converged Japanese forces began surrounding and laying siege to the city. The city of Nanchang fell the next day, with the Chinese defenders suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese Army continued to clear out the rural area throughout March and April, marking the end of the first phase of the campaign. = Chinese counterattack and retreat = Despite of losing the city of Nanchang to the Japanese, Chinese forces in Jiangxi continues to make a stand. During a period lasting until the end of April some Japanese forces were moved to support operations in other areas (see Battle of Suizao). The Chinese Nationalists saw an opportunity in this weakening of available Japanese manpower, and planned a counterattack to retake the city. Their directive was to cut off the Japanese contact and disrupt the enemy from the rear. On 21 April, a surprise attack by the forces of the Third and Ninth War Zones began from the north, west, and south of Nanchang.Peattie, M., Drea, E. & Ven, H. (2011). The Battle for China: Essays on the Military History of the Sino- Japanese War of 1937–1945. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press. It began with the 1st Army Group in the 60th Army Division as well as the 58th Army Division attacking from the North. They were later joined by the 74th and 49th Army Groups as they pushed in through Japanese defenses. In the south, this sudden offensive quickly broke through the Japanese positions as they advanced towards Nanchang proper. After five days of relentless advancement, the 32nd Army Group at the front of the Southern Chinese spearhead reached the outer area of Nanchang. Throughout the Chinese attack, the Japanese still retained control over the Xiushui River and continually received supplies and reinforcements throughout the five-day advance of Chinese troops. Beginning on 27 April, the Japanese began a counteroffensive against the Chinese push by attacking the southern troops. Supported by heavy artillery fire, and air support the Japanese retook several of their strongholds around the city and forced the Chinese divisions to fall back. For the following week, progress was at a standstill on both sides as they held their defensive positions. Hoping to end the conflict quickly, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Chinese divisions surrounding Nanchang on 2 May to retake the city by 5 May. Following this order, the Chinese launched a new offensive to try to end the conflict over the city, but the continued reinforcements of the Japanese were unable to be pushed back. After several days of intense fighting, and heavy casualties for the Chinese army, the Chinese were exhausted and forced to retreat on 9 May. Also exhausted from the battle, the Japanese did not pursue the retreating Chinese army.  Aftermath  Casualties for the fighting around Nanchang have been reported as 51,328 killed or wounded for the Chinese, and 24,000 for the Japanese. After the fall of Nanchang, the Japanese consolidated their control of Jiangxi and Hunan region. The Nationalists however continued to maintain their presence in the area. The Japanese momentum were further interrupted by the border clashes with the Soviet Union, which broke out shortly after in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.

Camps Connecticut Yankee Council operates five camps: Camp Sequassen in New Hartford, Deer Lake Scout Reservation in Killingworth, Hoyt Scout Reservation in Redding, Camp Pomperaug in Union, and Wah Wah Taysee in North Haven. =Camp Sequassen= Camp Sequassen is located in New Hartford, Connecticut. It is a Boy Scout camp operated by the Connecticut Yankee Council and is mainly used for summer camp. During the summer, it becomes a Scouts BSA resident camp for over 2,000 youth from across New England. The camp was moved to this new site in 1927 with the purchase of 125 acres. Today the camp consists of 540 acres of forest and over 2500' of shoreline on West Hill Pond. Troops from around Connecticut and neighboring states stay at Camp Sequassen for a week. While staying there, Scouts are able to work on rank requirements and take merit badge classes while being instructed by well-trained staff members. One of these places is the Trading Post. This is a small Scouting store operated by Sequassen staff. It is well known for the slushies and candy sold there, but also offers other merchandise such as Sequassen frisbees, shirts, hats, belts, walking sticks, joke books, cookbooks, songbooks, knives, playing cards, bumper stickers, mugs, water bottles, carabiners and patches as well as official Boy Scout Merit Badge books and socks. At the waterfront, Scouts can go swimming or take boats such as canoes, kayaks and row boats out into West Hill Pond. Also, Platt Field, located in North Sequassen, is where Scouts can participate in rifle shooting, paintball, and archery (both trap shooting and regular). Very close to Platt Field, shotgun shooting is available for older Scouts near Scout Craft. There is also a handicrafts center near the waterfront where woodcarving, photography and metalwork is possible. At the Nature Center called \\"Eco\\" (located on the right side of Cohen Lodge), Scouts can enjoy creative, fun and educational programs such as catching insects at the \\"Bug Wall,\\" testing their knowledge in \\"Eco Jeopardy\\", and going on an astronomy hike up to Platt Field. Scouts can also play exciting games such as quidditch, gaga ball, and disc golf in the nearby Clark Field. At the end of the week all Scouts can participate in the camp-wide \\"Land and Sea Games.\\" Ferrarotti, Adam. \\"An In-Depth Discussion on Camp Sequassen Life.\\" Personal interview. 13 July 2016. No one is allowed to cross over West Hill Road to get from one half of the camp to the other. Instead, all Scouts, staff and adult leaders use the Godfrey-Morris tunnel that goes under West Hill Road. =John Sherman Hoyt Scout Reservation and Training Center= John Sherman Hoyt Scout Reservation and Training Center is located in Redding, Connecticut. The reservation was donated to the Alfred W. Dater Council by Alice B. Sanford in 1966. The of wooded property is located in a rural area of Connecticut on the western end of the Connecticut Yankee Council. The camp consists of 173 acres. When the Hoyt training center is mentioned in the presence of Connecticut Yankee Council members, it is often repeated by members of the audience who reply \\"HOYT!\\". The reservation is named after John Sherman Hoyt of Darien, Connecticut. Hoyt was a wealthy industrialist and dedicated Scouter. Hoyt was involved with the Scouting movement since 1910 as one of its founders and later served as National Council Vice President for Finance, a member of the National Council Executive Board and Advisory Board. Hoyt donated of land in 1947 to the Alfred W. Dater Council, which became the Five Mile River Camp. The first building built at the new camp was a training cabin, which was dedicated to Major General Arthur Carter. The reservation has been operated by three different councils. Alfred W. Dater Council merged to form Fairfield County Council in 1972 and merged again in 1998 to form the present Connecticut Yankee Council. =Camp Pomperaug= This is a Scout camp located in Union, Connecticut. The CT Burn Foundation uses the facility as a summer camp for children with severe burns. This camp has had a long history, first, as Boy Scout camp located on Lake Zoar as part of the Housatonic River system. =Deer Lake Scout Reservation= Deer Lake Scout Reservation is located on Deer Lake in Killingworth, Connecticut, and covers 253 acres. It was originally owned by Central Connecticut Council until the merger with Quinnipiac Council. It is home to the Connecticut Yankee Council's Cub Scout Summer Resident Camp and Family Camp programs. =Wah Wah Taysee= Wah Wah Taysee is located partly in North Haven and partly in Hamden. The land was donated to the Quinnipiac Council in 1971 by the late Ned Greist. According to the attorney who drafted the deed, Mr. Greist chose the name 'Wah Wah Taysee' for the campsite, which he said was the name of the firefly in the poem Hiawatha. The property is situated near the base of Sleeping Giant, a.k.a. Mt. Carmel. Mr. Greist's family was one of several families instrumental in earlier successful efforts to save the area from aggressive quarrying, and devoting it to what is now the Sleeping Giant Park. Mr. Greist was an avid hiker and an active volunteer in the Scout movement. He was also the President of the Sleeping Giant Park Association for several years. Order of the Arrow Owaneco Lodge is the Order of the Arrow (OA) lodge for the Connecticut Yankee Council. The Order of the Arrow is Scouting's National Honor Society. The lodge's name comes from a chief’s name of the Mohegan Tribe and its totem is Owaneco. The council was formed in 1998 by the merger of the Quinnipiac Council, which hosted the Arcoon Lodge; and the Fairfield County Council, which hosted the Tankiteke Lodge. When it was announced in 1998 that Arcoon and Tankiteke would merge to form a new lodge in 1999, a steering committee was set up to discuss the merger between the two lodges. After five meetings between February and September 1998, all details regarding basic structure, committee responsibilities, name of the lodge, bylaws and first lodge event were discussed and finalized. On October 4, 1998, the first meeting of the memberships of Owaneco Lodge occurred. The lodge membership approved the lodge name, number, bylaws and the first group of lodge officers was elected. During the lodge’s first year, the executive committee worked to mold the new lodge program. Several changes were made to combine the traditions of Tankiteke and Arcoon and adapt a new lodge program. In 1998 the Ockenuck Chapter renamed itself to the Arcoon Chapter. During 1999, Owaneco lodge achieved honor lodge status for the first time in its short history. Owaneco repeated this achievement in 2007. The 2003 Section NE-2A Conclave was held at Camp Sequassen and hosted by Owaneco Lodge. The Quinnipiac Dancers, which started out as the Wulihan Chapter Dance Team in the Arcoon Lodge, celebrated their 40th anniversary in 2014. The dance team has garnered dozens of awards.

Rahner; July 23, 1919 – January 21, 2004) was an American television presenter, actor and author, he was the staple of Chicago children's television in the 1960s and 1970s on WGN-TV. Early life Rayner (the name was initially spelled \\"Rahner\\" but pronounced \\"Rayner\\") grew up in Queens, New York. He attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts; his first media job was working for WGBB radio in Freeport on Long Island while he was attending night school at Fordham University. World War II service He enlisted in the Army Air Corps, serving as the navigator of a B-17 during World War II, when he was shot down over France April 3, 1943. During years as a POW in Stalag Luft III, he helped prepare the escape depicted in the film The Great Escape—though he was transferred to another camp before the escape took place. It was during his time as a POW that he discovered his talent for entertaining, namely through his fellow prisoners and his German captors. He was interviewed in a documentary titled \\"Stalag Luft III\\", produced by RDR Productions of Glenview, Illinois. Chicago Rayner circa 1960 After briefly working in radio at WOOD in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as well as in New York and Dayton, Ohio following the war, Rayner joined what was then WBKB, later to become WBBM-TV in Chicago as a staff announcer; he also worked on a local morning program called Rayner Shine in 1953. This was Rayner's first work with puppets, who were provided for the show by the Mulqueens. He got a noontime program called The Ray Rayner Show in 1953, he and his co-host Mina Kolb hosted a somewhat free-form show that featured music, comedy skits, dance and pantomime. The show, geared towards teens, ran for five years. WBBM asked Rayner to switch to a children's program in 1958, though reluctant at first, he did so with The Little Show, which was very much like Ray Rayner and His Friends; on this version, the duck he worked with had the name of Havelock. It ran two years; he also hosted Popeye's Firehouse (as Chief Abernathy) for another two. He moved to WGN-TV in 1961. WGN-TV Channel 9 Rayner as Sergeant Pettibone, with Tracer puppet, circa 1961–1967 Bozo's Circus in 1966 His first role on WGN was as Sergeant Pettibone, the host of the Dick Tracy show. He joined the cast of Bozo's Circus as country bumpkin clown Oliver O. Oliver. By 1965, Rayner's clown character, along with \\"Sandy\\", played by Don Sandburg, were added to Larry Harmon's Bozo coloring books. Rayner left the show in 1971 because he wanted more time for other projects. After that, he occasionally appeared on the show as Oliver and filled in for Ned Locke as \\"Mr. Ray\\" when needed. Following the cancellation of Dick Tracy, a new afternoon program called Rocket to Adventure ran until 1968; this featured early appearances by Gigantor and Tobor the Eighth Man. Rayner hosted the show appearing as an astronaut. In 1968, he also appeared in television commercials for McDonald's as Ronald McDonald. At one point, WGN-TV had enough hope in being able to syndicate Rayner's Dick Tracy show to produce a pilot for that purpose. =Ray Rayner and His Friends= Starting in 1962, Rayner began hosting his own long-running Ray Rayner and His Friends, which had the title Breakfast With Bugs Bunny when he became its host; it was renamed in 1964. The show featured old cartoons such as various Warner Brothers character cartoons, arts-and-crafts, which often ended up as a gluey mess, and animals such as Chelveston the Duck who was named after RAF Chelveston where Rayner was stationed during World War II. Chelveston occasionally bit and Rayner was notably wary. During these segments, Chelveston walked around the set, eat, or bathe while a then-current top 40 song was played. Rayner later said he put duck feed in the cuffs of his coveralls so Chelveston nipped at them, then save himself from the duck by giving him a head of lettuce to pick apart. What was not known to the public until after the program was no longer on the air was that Chelveston was actually played by four different ducks over the years. Rayner also had a talking dog puppet, Cuddly Dudley, created and voiced by Roy Brown, a.k.a. \\"Cooky the Cook\\" from Bozo's Circus and The Bozo Show. The segment highlighted viewer mail which included many hand-drawn pictures submitted by children. The segment was often humorous as it was a chance for Rayner and Brown to interact and use comedic ad-libs. He always wore a jumpsuit, covered with small pieces of paper that held reminders of what to do next on the program (a cartoon, a commercial, a visit from Chelveston, etc.). He would also simulcast traffic reports from sister station WGN Radio over stock footage of traffic moving along the Chicago-area Interstates. During baseball season, he showed and narrated highlights of the Cubs and White Sox games from the previous day, wearing a custom-sewn ball cap that had the front half of each team's cap, resulting in a two-billed cap which he spun around, depending on which team's highlights were being shown. The arts-and-crafts was a regular segment that always began with a finished version prepared in advance by someone \\"behind the scenes\\" (who quite often was the wife of Producer Dick Flanders) that was displayed to the audience, followed by Rayner's attempts to demonstrate the process in an amusing, all-thumbs effort, also set to music, that resulted in a comically sub-par facsimile that more resembled a random collection of felt, construction paper and glue. Rayner's version would then be displayed alongside the original further emphasizing his comical ineptitude regarding crafts. Rayner contended that his failure at crafts made the show successful as the work of his young viewers was much better than the crafts he did on- air. He held an annual jellybean contest where viewers were to submit guesses of the quantity in a large jar displayed for a period of time on the show. Every Christmas he had an Advent calendar and would reveal a date each day until the Christmas holiday. Another bit was a lip-synching sketch Rayner usually did to an older novelty song such as \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\" by Allan Sherman. However he also performed serious songs while actually singing. Another feature on the show was Ark in the Park, a taped segment of a trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo featuring the then-director of the zoo, Dr. Lester Fisher. The introductory music for this segment was \\"The Unicorn\\" by The Irish Rovers. Rayner also featured a \\"How and Why\\" segment on his shows with J. Bruce Mitchell of Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, as did Garfield Goose and Friends. Along with Bozo's Circus, a video game was added to Rayner's show that viewers could play by phone called TV Powww. Rayner hosted this show until his 1980 retirement from WGN. During his time at Channel 9, starting in 1974, Rayner also hosted a Thursday night broadcast of the Illinois State Lottery's then-weekly drawings, which featured a top prize of $300,000 (\\"Weekly Bonanza\\") and a second prize of $50,000 to a field of about a dozen contestants who had won a special lottery game over the preceding seven-day period. The show aired at 7:00 PM CT. Actor and author During his years in Chicago, he also frequently appeared in live theater, including plays at the Forum Dinner Theater in suburban Summit; receiving a Jefferson award nomination for one of his roles. Rayner also did directing for student productions at Loyola University Chicago. He received an M. A. in Humanities from the University of Chicago in 1970, writing his thesis about children's television's first goal being to entertain. He was a member of the Silver Circle of the Chicago chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and received many local Emmys for his television work.(PDF)(PDF)(PDF) Rayner also wrote a book titled The Story of Television published in 1972. It is basically an industry guide to how a television show is made featuring many photos of Rayner from his Ray Rayner and Friends show. The book is quite rare and commands a high price, when available, from on-line auction sites. (out of print) One copy was donated to the Museum of Broadcast Communications about seven months after Rayner's passing. Later years and legacy He moved to KGGM-TV, the CBS affiliate in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1981, before retiring from television in 1989. He cited the harsh Chicago winters as the motivating factor. Rayner was the station's weatherman, complete with notes pinned to his jacket as they were to his coveralls in Chicago; he also hosted the local PM Magazine in Albuquerque. He returned to Chicago for the 25th and 30th anniversary shows for Bozo's Circus. Rayner continued to accept some Chicago theater roles and took some time to patiently answer children's questions about his work even after moving to Albuquerque. He did a week-long stint filling in at weather and other duties at Chicago's Fox Thing in the Morning on WFLD in May 1995. Rayner took some courses at the University of New Mexico, did some teaching and wrote a column for a local newspaper there. Rayner moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after his wife, Jeanne, a former nurse, died of lung cancer in 1995. \\"Jeanne Rahner, 67, the wife of former WGN-TV performer Ray Rayner, died Tuesday in Presbyterian Hospital, Albuquerque, N.M. She was working as a nurse in Brooklyn when she met and married her husband. In 1953, they came to the Chicago area.Mrs. Rahner resumed her nursing career in the late 1960s at Highland Park Hospital. She left there in the mid-1970s. In 1981, fed up with Chicago winters, the couple left Northbrook to move to New Mexico, where her husband worked as a weather reporter for Albuquerque television station KRQE-Channel 13. Mrs. Rahner was born in Brooklyn. She was a graduate of Long Island...\\" (pay-per-view) His activities there included reading to the blind, Grant A Wish (for terminally ill children), and delivering Meals on Wheels. He died on 21 January 2004, of complications from pneumonia in Fort Myers, Florida, at the age of 84. He is survived by his second wife, Marie, a daughter and a son, and four grandchildren. Clips from Rayner's shows are featured in the WGN Christmas special, Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics. In 2005, the Museum of Broadcast Communications awarded WGN-TV's Studio 1 a plaque to commemorate the forty years of children's television broadcast from the studio. Ray Rayner and Friends with a likeness of Rayner and Chelveston, is on the plaque along with Frazier Thomas and Garfield Goose and Friends and Bob Bell and Bozo's Circus. Rayner's coveralls, complete with notes, is part of the museum's collection. Cuddly Dudley and his doghouse from The Bozo Show are also part of the museum's collection. A photo of Rayner on the set of his television show with two guests was chosen as the cover photo for Chicago Television, published for the Museum of Broadcast Communications in 2010.

The author is in the Dean's chair receiving the thanks of Ireland. The motto reads, \\"I have made a monument more lasting than bronze.\\" The word \\"Ære\\" means \\"bronze\\" or \\"metal\\" or \\"honor\\" or \\"air\\" in Latin and may be a pun on the Irish word for Ireland Éire so that a parallel meaning could mean \\"I have made a monument to Ireland Forever.\\" Swift was familiar with the Irish language, and translated at least one poem by Carolan, \\"O'Rorke's Feast.\\" The phrase comes from Horace's Carmina. Drapier's Letters is the collective name for a series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, Jonathan Swift, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against the imposition of a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of inferior quality. William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier,A drapier or draper is a merchant of cloth. to hide from retaliation.Letter 1 Intro Note Although the letters were condemned by the Irish government, with prompting from the British government,Coxe 396–399 they were still able to inspire popular sentiment against Wood and his patent. The popular sentiment turned into a nationwide boycott, which forced the patent to be withdrawn; Swift was later honoured for this service to the people of Ireland.The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Volume IX, VI. 19. \\"Pamphlets on Irish affairs: Drapier’s Letters.\\" Many Irish people recognised Swift as a hero for his defiance of British control over the Irish nation.Smith p. 271 Beyond being a hero, many critics have seen Swift, through the persona of the Drapier, as the first to organise a \\"more universal Irish community\\", although it is disputed as to who constitutes that community.Moore p. 84 Regardless of to whom Swift is actually appealing what he may or may not have done, the nickname provided by Archbishop King, \\"Our Irish Copper-Farthen Dean\\", and his connection to ending the controversy stuck.Moore p. 87 The first complete collection of the Drapier's Letters appeared in the 1734 George Faulkner edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift along with an allegorical frontispiece offering praise and thanks from the Irish people.Weedon p. 44–48 Today, the Drapier's Letters are an important part of Swift's political writings, along with Gulliver's Travels (1726), A Tale of a Tub (1704), and A Modest Proposal (1729). Background In 1722, hardware manufacturer William Wood was granted letters patent to produce copper coinage of up to £108,000 (around £ as of ) for use in Ireland.Goodwin p. 649 The patent was secured by a bribe of £10,000 (around £ as of ) to the Duchess of Kendal,Hachey p.34 mistress to King George I. Although Wood's copper coins were subsequently alleged to be underweight, undersized, and made from inferior materials,Drapier's Letters p. 142 assays had found they were not so, prior to their approval by the British Parliament for use in Ireland.Martin, pp. 1–14 The Irish complaint against Wood was not that they had enough copper coins, but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into the Irish economy. These coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in the Irish economy, and since the new copper coins would not be minted under Irish authority, no way existed for the Irish to control the quality and amount.Moore p. 66 Also, Wood's coin was only one example of allegedly unfavourable economic practices that hurt Ireland; the Irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage, and Wood's coin became a way to express their economic-nationalist desires.Moore p. 73 The patent issue soon became a struggle between Prime Minister Robert Walpole (with the authority of the British Parliament) and the leaders of Ireland. All attempts by the Irish Privy Council and the Church of Ireland to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless.Goodwin p. 661 It was soon thought by many that William Conolly’s Commissioners of the Revenue might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with the coin, then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept the coin from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of the coin. Swift was asked by Archbishop King and Lord Chancellor Midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.Ferguson p. 96 During this time, Lord Carteret, the British Secretary of State whose remit included Ireland, publicly pushed Walpole into defending Wood's patent. However, Carteret privately attempted to destroy the patent to damage Walpole's reputation. Thus, Carteret appeared to the British as a defender of the patent because he seemingly tried to prevent an Irish uprising against British rule (especially by finding the \\"Drapier\\"), but he was really furthering his anti-Walpole agenda and aiding the Irish cause.Ehrenpreis p.198 =Pamphleteering= Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, was already known for his concern for the Irish people and for writing several political pamphlets. One of these, Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England.Smith p. 266–267 Also, the Irish authorities knew that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the Tory government of Queen Anne, and that he would use his abilities to undermine the Whig government of Walpole. Charles Jervas's portrait of Jonathan Swift (1718) Swift analysed the forensic and economic disadvantages of Wood's inferior coinage and the effects it would have over Ireland in the first of the pamphlets, A Letter to the Shop-keepers (1724). In the pamphlet, Swift adopted the persona of the \\"Drapier\\": a common Irishman, a talented and skilled draper, a religiously devout individual who believes in scripture, and a man loyal to both the Church of Ireland and to the King of Ireland.Beaumont p. 44 Swift's pseudonymous choice served two essential purposes: it provided him with an alternate persona which he could use to hide from potential political reprisals, and it allowed him to create an identity that was closely aligned with the common people of Ireland. According to 20th-century Swift scholar Irvin Ehrenpreis, debate arose in the academic community over how much Swift may have wished his audience to identify him as the Drapier, especially since the Drapier constantly includes religious imagery that was common to Swift's sermons. However, the religious rhetoric probably used to justify an Irish rebellion against the coinage is merely meant as an important aspect of the Drapier's identity without it being meant as evidence that Swift was the author.Ehrenpreis p. 208 Regardless of how secret Swift may have wanted his identity to be, most people in Ireland, including members of the Irish Privy Council, certainly knew that Swift was the author of the letters. Unfortunately for the Walpole administration, little legal proof was available of a relationship between the two that would justify them trying Swift as the \\"Drapier\\". Over the course of a year, four more pamphlets, filled with invective and complaints against both Wood and his patent, followed the first. The pamphlet was successful, and public opinion became so hostile against Wood's coinage that the patent was withdrawn by 1725. At one point, Lord Carteret and the Irish Privy Council offered a significant reward of £300 for information that would verify the identity of the pamphlet's author, but Swift was neither arrested nor charged for the works. The lack of an arrest and the unity of the Irish people behind the \\"Drapier\\" was an important motivating factor behind Walpole's withdrawal of the patent. =Irish Independence= Although Swift knew that the Duchess of Kendal was responsible for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the Letters. Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent. Although the Drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to the King, his words did not prevent accusations of treason from being levelled against him in response to the third and fourth letters. In the third and fourth letters, Swift argues that the Irish deserve independence from England, but not from the king. This, of all of the Drapier's arguments, is what agitated Walpole, as the head of the British Parliament, the most. Thus, the Drapier was condemned like William Molyneux, whose Case of Ireland (1698) pleaded for Irish independence using the same arguments.Ferguson p. 110 The claims of treason levelled against the Drapier were of \\"treason to the English Parliament\\", which only caused more resentment among the Irish people, who sided with Swift's constitutional argument that the Irish people owed their allegiance only to the king. Pamphlets The first three pamphlets were written as a set intended to conclude the matter. However, when Lord Carteret was sent to control Ireland and placed a bounty on the Drapier's head, Swift felt that a fourth pamphlet was necessary. The fifth (in this list) was written at the height of the controversy over Wood's coin, and constitutes the final public writing of \\"the Drapier\\".Prose Works Letter 6 Intro Note The letter To the Lord Chancellor Middleton was signed with Swift's nameProse Works Letter 5 and not collected until Faulkner's 1735 edition. The last letter, An Humble Address, was also published after the conflict had ended.Prose Works Letter 7 Intro Note =To the Shop-keepers= Title page from the 1724 pamphlet To the Shop-keepers The Drapier's first letter, To the Shop-keepers, Tradesmen, Farmers, and Common- People of Ireland, was printed in March 1724. Shortly afterwards, a copy of the first letter was forwarded by Swift to Lord Carteret on 28 April 1724, and knowledge of the letter's contents had spread all the way to London. By April 1724, the letter was popular and Swift claimed that over 2,000 copies had been sold in Dublin.Letters p. 106 The letter was retitled \\"Fraud Detected: or, The Hibernian Patriot\\" by Faulkner's Dublin Journal, which published the piece in 1725.Prose Works Letter 1 \\"Fraud Detected\\" was later used by Faulkner as the title of the collection of the first five letters, published after the patent controversy ended.Ehrenpreis p. 317-318 The Drapier introduces his subject by invoking the duty of his readers as \\"Christians, as parents, and as lovers of your country\\". His purpose is to introduce the background of Wood's coin and then he suggests a boycott similar to the one in his Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture. Throughout his monetary arguments, the Drapier constantly acknowledges how humble his station in life is, and incorporates theological and classical allusions to mock Wood. The Drapier places the blame for the coin upon Wood, stating: \\"It is no treason to rebel against Mr Wood.\\" There are many religious overtones similar to Swift's sermons, such as the Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a Hebrew prophet or to an evangelical preacher who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul.Ehrenpreis p. 210 However, the final judgment had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and the souls of the citizenry.Ferguson p. 99 One of the concerns of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law:Moore p. 81 debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would no longer be able to pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy. Although some critics and historians view the language and examples employed by the Drapier to describe the possible economic harms as over the top, others consider that Swift's imagery was grounded in truth.Ferguson p. 101 Even Swift's satire of Wood's character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what Wood provided the public through his words and actions.Treadwell p. 76–91 Although the Drapier emphasises Wood's involvement and not the king's, glosses of the first letter reveal allusions to Wood bribing the Duchess of Kendal that obscure the distinction to the careful reader. However, the Drapier always respects the king as leader of the Irish nation and the Irish church, although some critics see his bold language and free use of the king's name and title as undermining those positions. The Drapier makes sure that Wood appears to be the primary target, which, when combined with only an indirect attack upon people at the top of the British political system, reassured the people of Ireland that they could rebel against an \\"insignificant hardware man\\".Ferguson p. 98 =To Mr Harding= Title page from the 1724 pamphlet To Mr. Harding The Drapier's second letter, A Letter to Mr. Harding the Printer, upon Occasion of a Paragraph in his News- Paper of 1 August, relating to Mr. Wood's Half-Pence, was printed on 4 August 1724, in response to the British Privy Council's testing of Wood's coin.Prose Works Letter 2 Intro Note The Drapier alludes to the involvement of the Duchess of Kendall in his first letter; in the second, the Drapier de- emphasises her involvement and shifts his focus to blame the Whig party. According to the Drapier, the Whigs are the ones who Wood bribed in securing his patent.Treadwell p. 86 The central target for this letter is the Privy Council's report produced under the authority of Walpole. It was necessary for the Drapier to attack the report to ensure that the people would be willing to resist the coin and deny the \\"truth\\" that Wood's supporters issued.Ferguson p. 104 Therefore, the Drapier describes them as \\"only a few Betrayers of their Country, Confederates with Woods\\".Prose Works Letter 2 The Drapier does not directly attack Isaac Newton's assay of Wood's coin, but instead attacks the process behind the assay and the witnesses who testified before the Privy Council. In his criticism of the Privy Council's report, the Drapier claims that the report is part of Wood's propaganda and lies, because Wood released three proposals concurrent with the report: lowering the patent production quota from £100,800 to £40,000 worth; that no one is obliged to accept more than five pence halfpenny per transaction; and to sell the coin at 2s 1d a pound or his raw copper at 1s 8d a pound.Ehrenpreis p 226;229–230;249–250. Wood's choice of wording, that the Irish would be \\"obliged\\" to accept the coin, was criticised by the Drapier who then accused Wood of \\"perfect High Treason\\" for obliging the people to take any copper coin when the king lacked the constitutional authority to do such a thing.Ferguson p. 105 In the second letter, the Drapier walks a careful line between openly indicting the king and merely hinting at his relationship with Wood's patent; while the Drapier accuses Wood, he constantly refers to the king's authority and power to issue legal tender (this is called \\"the King's Prerogative\\"). In particular, the Drapier claims that the king is unable to force his people to accept any copper based currency.Ferguson p. 106-107 As the Drapier points out, the constitution establishing Ireland as a kingdom limits the authority of the monarch because it forces the people of Ireland to use only gold or silver coins as official currency. Throughout this argument, the Drapier compares the king's ability to print money with the petty amount of political power held by Wood, which undermines the image of the king as the supreme authority in Ireland while hinting that the king is not protecting the rights of the Irish people. The Drapier stops himself before he commits treason, and he instead argues that the king would never accept a patent that could harm Ireland; to the Drapier, the king would never act in such a way as to help Wood harm the people of Ireland.Ferguson p. 107 In response to calls for action from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing that they would not accept the coin produced under Wood's patent.Ehrenpreis p. 324 Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy.Ehrenpreis p. 235 Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed. =To the Nobility and Gentry= Title page from the 1724 pamphlet Some Observations The Drapier's third letter, To the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom of Ireland: Some Observations Upon a Paper, Call'd, The Report of the Committee of the Most Honourable the Privy-Council in England relating to Wood's Half-pence, was printed on 25 August 1724.Prose Works Letter 3 Intro Note The subject matter of the third letter is similar to that of the second letter, and some scholars have explained this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report.Ehrenpreis p. 238 The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of his audience, the nobility. The Drapier spends most of his letter responding to the \\"Report of the Committee of the Most Honourable the Privy-Councill in England\\". This document released by Walpole served as a defence of Wood's coin; the report argued that the coin was important to the people of Ireland. However, the report was not officially released by Walpole in the Parliament's Gazette, but published without Parliament's authority in the London Journal in August 1724. Some scholars have speculated that Walpole had the report published in a non- Parliamentary magazine so that he would not be connected directly to Wood's coin. However, the lack of Parliamentary authority behind the report allowed the Drapier to undermine the credibility of the report's content.Mason p. 336 The Drapier claims, \\"Mr. Wood in publishing this paper would insinuate to the world, as if the Committee had a greater concern for his credit and private emolument, than for the honour of the Privy-council and both Houses of Parliament here ... For it seems intended as a vindication of Mr. Wood, not without several severe remarks on the Houses of Lords and Commons of Ireland.\\"Prose Works Letter 3 To the Drapier, Wood has utter contempt for the political authority of Ireland, and would use his coin and the report to mock them. However, the attack extends beyond Wood to encompass a dispute about the authority of England to rule over the kingdom of Ireland.Ferguson p. 109 The central argument in the letter is that the British have negated the rights of the Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the Irish Parliament a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for Massachusetts. Wood, the Drapier claims, \\"hath already tried his Faculty in New-England, and I hope he will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; what That was I leave to the Publick Intelligence.\\" The response to Wood's coin was a complete boycott of the coin. The Drapier does not blame the production of the coining on Walpole's policies, in regard to England's colonies, but on Wood's (and his accomplice's) actions This criticism of Wood's actions allows the Drapier to attack the patent process in such a way that could not be used directly against the British Parliament.Ehrenpreis p. 240 In referring to this point, the Drapier asks, \\"Were not the People of Ireland born as Free as those of England?\\" The final image of this letter is that of the small but brave David versus the giant Goliath.Beaumont p. 42 Wood is the giant invader who wears his brass coin as armour and the Drapier is just the small merchant who is not big enough to fill the king's armour.Beaumont p. 43 This image resonated with the people, and a sign was displayed by people of Dublin which read: :And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid : as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground ; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.Smith p. 274 The third letter openly incorporates Swift's argument that political authority stems from the consent of a population. As such, the third letter has been seen as a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British.Ehrenpreis p. 243 The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.Fabricant p. 481 However, such an attack on the Declaratory Act was common in Swift's works, and he constantly argued against the act by promoting Irish autonomy.Mahony p. 508 This does not mean that the Irish independence is to be taken lightly, because Swift viewed the self-reliance as \\"the only means of halting their [the Irish/Irish Protestant] self-destructive complicity – of which they were inadequately aware – in England's ongoing consumption of Ireland.\\" =To the Whole People of Ireland= Title page from the 1724 pamphlet To the Whole People of Ireland The Drapier's fourth letter, To the Whole People of Ireland, A Word or Two to the People of Ireland, A Short Defense of the People of Ireland, was written on 13 October 1724 and was either published on 21 October 1724 or on 22 October 1724, the day Lord Carteret arrived in Dublin. Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge to the contrary.Ferguson p. 114 The fourth letter was written in response to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people.Prose Works Letter 4 The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.Ehrenpreis p. 255 The majority of the fourth letter is devoted to an argument revolving around the political liberty of the Irish people. It is for this argument that the Drapier was persecuted, because his words were seen as a call to challenge British authority and possibly to declare independence from the king. The Drapier walks a fine line between loyalty and disloyalty, because he charges that the Irish are loyal only to their king, who had the title \\"King of Ireland\\", but not to England. To this the Drapier states: In defence of his nation, the Drapier turns around claims of treason and papal loyalty against Wood and his defenders (especially Walpole), calling them as treasonous as the Jacobite rebels and the Parliamentary rebels.Craik p. 74 The Drapier believed that God's providence supported the people of Ireland, but his will required the people of Ireland to stand up against the treasonous British.Johnson p. 76 The most famous and controversial statement of the Drapier's Letters follows claims of loyalty to the Irish king: :I have digressed a little to refresh and continue that spirit so seasonably raised amongst you, and to let you see that by the laws of GOD, of NATURE, of NATIONS, and of your own COUNTRY, you ARE and OUGHT to be as FREE a people as your brethren in England. This line of argument follows the political philosophy of John Locke in the Two Treatises on Government (1689). Locke wrote that the people had the right to resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights even when they have been conquered by another. A secondary rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish in regard to Wood's patent; the rest of the constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720).Moore p. 75 Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy. Lord Carteret read passages from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable.Coxe p. 396–397 It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for the identity of the Drapier.Ferguson p. 115 Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an \\"unfortunate accident\\" and he did not want to respond in such a way.Drapier's Letters p. xliii Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, \\"to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured to do, is not the true way to keep them out\\".Henry Downes, 25 October 1724. Letters on Various Subjects p. 588 Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were \\"ludicrous and satyrically writ\\".Goodwin p. 671 However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.Ferguson p. 121 Regardless of the proclamation against the Drapier and the words issued by important Irish officials, the people of Ireland had stood by the writer, and it was their support that protected Swift.Drapier's Letters pp. xlii–xliii Some critics have viewed this support as resulting from the letter's appeal to the \\"mob\\", or common people, of Ireland. =To Viscount Molesworth= Title page of To Viscount Molesworth from the 1735 Faulkner edition and reproduced by the 1903 Temple Scott edition The Drapier's fifth letter, A Letter To the Honourable the Lord Viscount Molesworth, at his House at Brackdenstown, near Swords was published on 31 December 1724. The letter includes the most pseudo- biographical information on the Drapier.Ferguson p. 128 This letter is seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a possible agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent.Ehrenpreis p. 286 It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters. The Drapier begins his letter with three quotations: Psalm 109, Ecclesiasticus/Sirach 7, and Virgil's Aeneid Book Five.Prose Works Letter 6 With these passages, he sets the tone for his own defence by appealing to both the reason and the religious sentiments of his audience to prove his innocence: Some critics argue that Swift did not need to defend himself, and To Viscount Molesworth was written to gloat.Ferguson p. 130 However, the essence of the letter encourages the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument. Other critics emphasise that the letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was targeted to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and the opposite of Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause.Ehrenpreis p. 289 Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.Ehrenpreis p. 291 The letter serves one other purpose: to delight in the Drapier's lack of being captured and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, was the one who actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials.Ehrenpreis p. 289-290 A letter written anonymously by Swift, \\"Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury\\", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer.Ehrenpreis p. 293 The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he could just be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is \\"in some ways the best written of all the Letters\\".Drapier's Letters p. lvii =To the Lord Chancellor Middleton= The sixth letter during the Drapier's campaign, To the Lord Chancellor Middleton, is dated 26 October 1724, and was written as a private letter from Jonathan Swift to Alan Brodrick, Lord Midleton (with the misspelling of his title).Prose Works Letter 5 Intro Note It is not a true \\"Drapier\\" letter, because the author professes to be different from the Drapier, although he was known to be one and the same by Lord Midleton. Sir Walter Scott includes this letter as number five, although Faulkner, Sheridan, Deane Swift, Hawkesworth and Nichols label it as number six. The purpose of the sixth letter was to ensure that Midleton would stay true to his opposition of Wood's patent. Although the extent to which Midleton was influenced by the letter cannot be known, it is certain that Midleton believed that the patent would harm Ireland and that he would resist it at all costs.Coxe p. 395–399 Regardless, Swift wrote the letter to express himself in a way that the Drapier could not: as the dean of a great, Irish cathedral.Ehrenpreis p. 271 He asserts his status to verify that the Drapier's intentions must be good. In essence, the letter rehashes many of the previous letters' arguments to draw Midleton into openly supporting the Drapier's actions.Ehrenpreis p. 274 Swift also admits to actively working against the patent, and mentions how his \\"On Doing Good\\" sermon is similar to the ideas expressed by the Drapier.Prose Works IV. \\"On Doing Good\\" Sermon intro note =An Humble Address= The Drapier's last letter, An Humble Address to Both Houses of Parliament, was completed in June 1725. It was written before Wood's patent was defeated, and it was stopped from being printed when word reached Swift that the patent had been withdrawn. This letter remained unpublished for 10 years. The letter challenges the Ireland's parliament to investigate how Wood originally attained the patent, even though most in power knew that the patent was the result of bribery.Ehrenpreis p. 303 Although nothing new would be discovered in an investigation, the letter served the purpose of trying to unite the people of Ireland to fight for further economic freedom. The Drapier refers to Ireland's lack of economic freedom when he claims, the Irish \\"are altogether Losers, and England a Gainer\\".Prose Works Letter 7 Swift's intentions behind the letter are uncertain, and some critics believe that Swift did not desire such an investigation into Wood's supporters while others contend that Swift was serious about promoting a public inquiry into the matter.Ehrenpreis p. 305 Ehrenpreis challenges Ferguson's characterization of Swift as not actually caring about an investigation The topics the Drapier addresses span from absentee land owners to importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy.Ferguson p. 133 However, these individual issues were not as important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule.Ehrenpreis p. 308 Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.Ferguson p. 135 Publication John Harding published the first four letters before he was arrested and the fifth after his release. After Harding's death, George Faulkner became Swift's primary publisher in Ireland, and A Letter to the Lord Chancellor Middleton and An Humble Address were copied from manuscript copies provided by the author to Faulkner and then printed with the other letters.Ehrenpreis p. 780-781 The Drapier's Letters were first collected and published in their entirety by Faulkner in 1735.Ferguson p. 134 On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised his future publication of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the Drapier's Letters, in the Dublin Journal.Drapier's Letters XIV p. 42 However, this edition led to the Motte v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under British copyright legislation, to many of the works included in Faulkner's edition.Ehrenpreis p. 787 Although the Drapier's Letters were not under copyright, the complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735.Cornu p. 120-121 It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works. Instead, Swift admonished Motte for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow Faulkner to reprint the copyrighted material.Correspondence p. 493-494 Reception Although the original printing of the Drapier's Letters resulted in the arrest of Harding and a bounty placed upon the Drapier's head, Swift's actions in defending Ireland were deemed heroic among the Irish citizenry.Ferguson p. 138 He was titled the \\"Hibernian patriot\\" for his actions.Mahony p. 518 Some residents of Dublin placed banners and signs in the city to recognise Swift's deeds, and images from the letters, such as the Drapier comparing his campaign to David fighting Goliath, became themes in popular literature. Scholar Herbert Davis claims that by the end of 1725, Swift was \\"the Darling of the populace; His Image and Superscription on a great many Sign-Posts\\" in Ireland.Drapier's Letters p. lxvi Swift did not fully embrace his popularity, but he enjoyed it. On his birthday, 30 November 1727, a large group of men came to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray and afterwards celebrate throughout the city. This gathering commemorated Swift and his letters and also protested against the harsh British treatment of Ireland.Ehrenpreis p. 514 According to Robert Mahony, the Drapier's Letters, especially the fourth, were later praised by Irish nationalists.Mahony p. 517 However, as he continued, many recent critics have re-examined this nationalistic claim and asserted a counterclaim that Swift is speaking more for the Protestants of Ireland than for the entire nation. Many critics, including Carol Fabricant, have asked who \\"the Whole People of Ireland\\" are, \\"who\\" the Drapier's Letters are speaking \\"to\\", and if Swift has the right, as a Protestant Englishman, to speak for the entire nation.Fabricant p. 465 R. F. Foster believes that Swift represented \\"Ascendancy attitudes,\\"Foster p. 175 but this view is not held by all. Some critics, like Joep Leerssen, believe that Swift's work contributed greatly to a common Irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation, and that Swift was able to relate to all of Ireland through a unified suffering under the British rule.Leerssen p. 311 In overall effect, Fabricant argued that Swift's ability to speak for the whole populace is further suggested by the wide consensus opposed to the coinage plan. Along with this, Swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights, in the Drapier's Letters, to all people of Ireland without any regard to restriction.Fabricant p. 482-483 Notes References         External links * (plain text) * The Drapier's Letters at Internet Archive (scanned books) Category:Essays by Jonathan Swift Category:1724 books Category:1725 books Category:British non-fiction literature Category:Irish non-fiction literature Category:Independence movements Category:Numismatics Category:Pamphlets Category:Irish constitutional law ","title":"Drapier's Letters"},{"id":"1901776","text":"\\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\" is the eighteenth episode of the eleventh season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 2000. In the episode, Barney realizes how much of a pathetic drunk he is after watching his birthday party video and decides to give up alcohol forever, which upsets his friend Homer. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa work together to take a memorable photo for a new phone book cover contest. The episode was written by cast member Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta. They originally pitched the story during the production of the series' fourth season, but the concept was rejected on the basis of being too similar to the episode \\"Duffless\\"; it was later revived by showrunner Mike Scully. Several staff members opposed the idea of Barney becoming sober because they did not think his character change would be funny. Several critics, including Chris Turner, were also not fond of Barney's change.  Plot  After watching his embarrassing birthday party video and being mocked by his friends with gag gifts, Barney realizes he is a hideous drunk, and promises to get sober. At first, he finds sustaining sobriety tough, but he finds his way to an AA meeting with Homer's help, and soon goes to The Springfield Flight School where he takes helicopter-flying lessons. At Moe's Tavern, Homer is treated as the new Barney and is forced by Moe, Lenny, and Carl to perform drunken antics. Barney gives Homer a ride in the helicopter a few lessons later with the two fighting about Barney's new sobriety and Homer's unhappiness that they no longer have ridiculous adventures. Meanwhile, to get their picture on the cover of the new phone book and win the prize of a new bicycle, Bart and Lisa enter an amateur photo contest. They find an old camera with an old roll of film and start to take snapshots with it. One day, they are taking pictures atop Mt. Springfield when Bart inadvertently starts a forest fire by carelessly discarding a hot flashbulb, putting them in imminent danger. At Moe's, Barney arrives to make amends for his drunken behavior; when he and Homer see the news report of the fire, they band together to save Bart and Lisa. They hop in the helicopter, but land in the middle of a bridge when Barney panics over flying the helicopter, having not yet finished the lessons. When a Duff beer truck on the bridge spills its contents in front of Barney, Homer refuses to let him give up on sobriety and drinks an entire six-pack in his place, leaving Barney touched at his gesture. Together, Barney and a drunken Homer save the kids, and Bart commemorates the moment by taking a photo of the fire on Mt. Springfield, submitting it as his and Lisa's entry to the photo contest. The next day, at the Simpson house, Marge tells the children that the new phone books are here, and they have Bart and Lisa's picture on the front cover. Bart and Lisa realize that the picture on one of the phone books is not the one of the fire on Mt. Springfield; it is actually a photo of baby Bart and Lisa naked on the toilet, causing them to scream in horror. Marge says that the shot was in the film on the camera and that since she had taken it, she won the bike for them. Bart and Lisa, after accepting that they will be the laughingstock of the entire town, happily hug their mother, because they got the bike. Meanwhile, Barney's confidence and his friendship with Homer are restored, and he looks forward to an alcohol-free future, although he is now addicted to double-tall mocha lattes. It transpires that the coffees Barney drink are really supplied by Moe's coffee cart, who delights in the fact that Barney, having swapped his addiction from alcohol to coffee, is still a customer to him.  Production  Cast member Dan Castellaneta and his wife wrote the episode. \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\", the eighteenth episode of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000), was written by Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta, and directed by Neil Affleck. In the early 1990s, Castellaneta, the voice of Homer, Barney, and many other characters on the show, conceived the idea to write an episode in which Barney sobers up. He told Lacusta of the idea, who wrote a draft that they then revised together. They presented their script to Al Jean when he and Mike Reiss were show runners on The Simpsons. Though Jean liked the story, he turned it down because the staff was already working on a similar episode where Homer gives up beer—\\"Duffless\\" (1993). Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and presented their script, which they had updated, to then- showrunner Mike Scully (1997–2001), who liked it but had them make some changes.Affleck, Neil; Castellaneta, Dan; Lacusta, Deb; Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike (2008). Commentary for \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Several members of the staff, including The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, have stated that they were against the episode as they felt Barney being sober was not funny. After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer/producer David Mirkin, who had friends that had stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee. For the episode, the animators gave Barney back-slicked hair to indicate his sobriety, a look which Barney maintained in subsequent episodes until he relapsed in \\"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\\" (2003). Castellaneta altered his voice for the sober Barney by no longer slurring.  Release and reception  The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 2000. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.3 and was the second highest-rated show on Fox network that week, following Malcolm in the Middle. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Dan Castellaneta, Deb Lacusta and Neil Affleck participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the episode \\"manages some good bits but not enough to make it a quality program.\\" He also wrote that \\"If you thought that 'Alone Again, Natura-Diddly' would be Season 11's sole episode that features a big change for a secondary character, you thought wrong. No, Barney's sobriety isn't as major an event as Maude's demise, but it actually has a bigger impact on the series. After all, Maude was a tertiary role; her disappearance affects secondary personality Ned, but she didn't appear all that much, so she didn't really go missed. Making Barney sober affects the series on a much more consistent basis – though probably not in a good way. After all, most of Barney's appeal came from his drunken idiocy, so he loses his natural kick when he goes on the wagon.\\" Several other writers have commented on Barney becoming sober. IGN staff members stated in 2006 that Barney has \\"been a dependable source of humor through his many drunken asides, burps included...Occasionally he's sobered up...But let's face it, for comedy's sake, The Simpsons is better off with a drunken Barney mouthing off at Moe's.\\" Author Chris Turner wrote in his book Planet Simpson that \\"Barney is a good example of what happens when [the staff members] tinker too much. Barney was great as just the town drunk. Making him sober falls into the trap of all the stuff The Simpsons satirizes, all those simple sitcom narratives where everything is wrapped up in half an hour and everyone learns a lesson in the end.\\" In 2001, \\"Days of Wine and D'oh'ses\\" received a commendation from the Prism Awards, which honors accurate portrayals of substance abuse, addiction and mental health in entertainment programming.

He was identified by Whittaker Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley as a Soviet spy and resigned from the Treasury Department in 1950. After several years teaching at Cambridge University in England, he returned to China, where he resided from the 1960s to his death, working as a translator and economic advisor. From the early 1960s, Adler was also affiliated with the International Liaison Department, an important organ of the Chinese Communist Party organ whose functions include foreign intelligence.  Early life  Solomon Adler was born on 6 August 1909 in Leeds, England. The Adler family was of Jewish ancestry and originally from Karelitz, Belarus, moving to Leeds in 1900. Solomon Adler was the fifth of ten children; the oldest was Saul Adler, who became a well-known Israeli parasitologist.Gavron 12. Adler studied economics at Oxford and University College, London. He came to the United States in 1935 to do research.  Career  In 1936, he was hired at the Works Progress Administration's National Research Project but soon moved to the Treasury Department's Division of Monetary Research and Statistics, where he worked with Harry Dexter White for the next several years.Craig 87. Adler became a naturalized US citizen in 1940. In 1941, he was posted to China, where he remained as Treasury representative until 1948. His reports from China to Treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., during the war years were widely circulated and played an important role in shaping American wartime economic policy toward China.Craig 87. In 1949, Adler became the subject of a Loyalty of Government Employees investigation. He resigned before the case was resolved and returned to Britain, where he taught for several years at Cambridge University. When his US passport expired, he was denaturalized and lost his citizenship.Craig 87. Adler moved to China in the early 1960s,Gavron 167; Rittenberg and Bennet 251. working in the lead group of the team translating Mao Zedong's works into English.Rittenberg and Bennett 251-256.  Later life  When the United States re-established diplomatic contacts with China in 1971, Adler renewed his US citizenship. He died in Beijing on August 4, 1994, two days before it would have been his 85th birthday. Espionage In 1939, Whittaker Chambers identified Adler to then-Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle as a member of an underground Communist group in Washington, DC, the Ware group. Chambers correctly identified Adler as serving in the General Counsel's Office at the Treasury Department, from which, Chambers said, Adler supplied weekly reports to the Communist Party of the United States.Weinstein 238. In 1945, Elizabeth Bentley identified Adler as a member of the Silvermaster group.Olmstead 99-100. A 1948 memo written by Anatoly Gorsky, a former NKVD rezident in Washington DC, identified Adler as a Soviet agent designated \\"Sax.\\"Haynes \\"Archival Identification\\" That agent, transliterated \\"Sachs (Saks)\\" appears in the Venona decrypts supplying information about the Chinese Communists by both Gorsky and the head of the US Communist Party, Earl Browder. In addition to his contacts with US espionage groups, while he was serving as Treasury attache in China in 1944, Adler shared a house with Chinese Communist secret agent Chi Ch'ao-tingKlehr and Radosh 21. and State Department officer John Stewart Service, who was arrested the next year in the Amerasia case. Together with Harry Dexter White, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and V. Frank Coe, Director of the Treasury's Division of Monetary Research, Adler strongly opposed a gold loan program of $200 million to help the Chinese Nationalists control the inflation that took hold in unoccupied China during World War II. Between 1943 and 1945, prices rose more than 1,000% per year, weakening the Nationalist government. The inflation helped the Communists eventually come to power in China, and in later years White, Coe, and Adler were accused of having deliberately fostered inflation by obstructing the stabilization loan.Haynes and Klehr 142-143. A Chinese work published in 1983 stated that from 1963 on Adler worked for China's International Liaison Department, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party whose functions include foreign intelligence.Haynes and Klehr 144 According to historian R. Bruce Craig, Adler's apartment in Beijing was provided by the Liaison Department, indicating that the department was Adler's work unit.Craig 88  References   Sources  *Solomon Adler: The Chinese Economy (London, Routledge & Paul 1957) *Joan Robinson, Sol Adler: China: an economic perspective, foreword by Harold Wilson (London, Fabian International Bureau 1958) *Sol Adler: A Talk to Comrades of the English Section for the Translation of Volume V of Chairman Mao's Selected Works (Guānyú \\"Máo xuǎn\\" dì-wǔ juǎn fānyì wèntí de bàogào 关于《毛选》第五卷翻译问题的报告; Beijing, Foreign Languages Press 1978).

It is a 1954 re-creation of the artist's famous 1931 work The Persistence of Memory, and measures a diminutive 25.4 × 33 cm. It was originally known as The Chromosome of a Highly-coloured Fish's Eye Starting the Harmonious Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory, and first exhibited at the Carstairs Gallery in New York in 1954. Description In this version, the landscape from the original work has been flooded with water. Disintegration depicts what is occurring both above and below the water's surface. The landscape of Cadaqués is now hovering above the water. The plane and block from the original is now divided into brick-like shapes that float in relation to each other, with nothing binding them. These represent the breakdown of matter into atoms, a revelation in the age of quantum mechanics. Behind the bricks, the horns receding into the distance symbolise atomic missiles, highlighting that despite cosmic order, humanity could bring about its own destruction. The dead olive tree from which the soft watch hangs has also begun to break apart. The hands of the watches float above their dials, with several conical objects floating in parallel formations encircling the watches. A fourth melting watch has been added. The distorted human visage from the original painting is beginning to morph into another of the strange fish floating above it. To Dalí, however, the fish was a symbol of life. Background Dalí had been greatly interested in nuclear physics since the first atomic bomb explosions of August 1945, and described the atom as his \\"favourite food for thought\\". Recognising that matter was made up of atoms which did not touch each other, he sought to replicate this in his art at the time, with items suspended and not interacting with each other, such as in The Madonna of Port Lligat. To Dalí, this image was symbolic of the new physics—the quantum world which exists as both particles and waves. The imagery of the original Persistence of Memory can be read as a representation of Einstein's theory of relativity (although Dalí himself denied the connection to the theory), symbolizing the relativity of time and space. In this new work, quantum mechanics is symbolized by \\"digitizing\\" the old image. Dalí symbolised and marked the loss of his interest in surrealism with The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory as his interest in nuclear physics and religion led him elsewhere. The painting is currently owned by the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was transported to and exhibited at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne in 2009, along with many other Dalí paintings in the Liquid Desire exhibition.

He had two children with Sylvie de la Rochefoucauld, a son named Théophile and a daughter named Céleste. Early life and career Bauby was born in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. He began his journalism career at Combat and then Le Quotidien de Paris. He received his first byline the day Georges Pompidou died in 1974. At age 28, he was promoted to editor-in-chief of the daily Le Matin de Paris, before becoming editor of the cultural section of Paris Match. He then joined the editorial staff of Elle. Memoir On 8 December 1995, at the age of 43, Bauby suffered a major stroke. When he woke up in hospital twenty days later, he found he was entirely speechless; he could only blink his left eyelid. Called locked-in syndrome, this is a condition wherein the mental faculties remain intact but most of the body is paralyzed. In Bauby's case, his mouth, arms, and legs were paralyzed, and he lost in the first 20 weeks after his stroke. Despite his condition, he wrote the book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by blinking when the correct letter was reached by a person slowly reciting the alphabet over and over again using a system called partner- assisted scanning. Bauby composed and edited the book entirely in his head, and dictated it one letter at a time. To make dictation more efficient, Bauby's amanuensis, Claude Mendibil, listed the letters in accordance with their frequency in the French language. The book was published in France on 7 March 1997. Bauby died suddenly from pneumonia, aged 44, two days after the publication of his book, and he is buried in a family grave at the Père- Lachaise cemetery in Paris, France. Legacy =Films= Jean-Jacques Beineix directed a short documentary film entitled Assigné à résidence about Bauby's time at Berck-sur-Mer, which was released in 1997. The film features Bauby himself, as well as appearances by his interlocutor, Claude Mendibil, and his partner, Florence Ben Sadoun. In 2007, painter-director Julian Schnabel released a film version of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly adapted for the screen by Ronald Harwood. It starred actor Mathieu Amalric as Bauby. Critically acclaimed, the film received many awards and nominations including the Best Director Prize at Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film & Best Director, as well as 4 Academy Award nominations. The script written for the film has been criticized by Bauby's closest circle of friends as not faithful to events and biased in favor of his ex-partner. His late-life partner Florence Ben Sadoun claims to have been a faithful companion, visiting him frequently at Berck-sur-Mer, the hospital where he lived during his final days. Bauby notes her visits in his memoir. Sylvie de la Rochefoucauld also claims to have visited him frequently at the hospital.

The concept of a public path first appeared in 1949, but the necessary construction work was not begun until after 1973. Nowadays, it provides access to many interesting sights, like the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Dean Gallery.  Walking and cycling the path  The path starts next to Balerno High School and runs 12.25 miles (19.6 kilometres) to Leith. The path runs downhill, but the incline is so slight that it is barely perceptible. Approximately half a mile of the route is on roads, for the remainder the path runs alongside the Water of Leith, and away from traffic. The section from Balerno to Slateford utilises the dismantled Balerno railway line The path surface is a mixture of tarmac, compressed grit and compressed earth. The surface is uniformly good with very few muddy patches or potholes. The route is well used by both pedestrians and cyclists. The path is fairly well signposted, but there are one or two places in Edinburgh where the path meets a road and it is necessary to hunt around for its continuation. Some signposts have been vandalised or pointed in the wrong direction. The path passes through the attractive Dean Village area of Edinburgh and ends in the docks at Leith. Walkers can return to Balerno by catching a bus to the centre of Edinburgh from Ocean Terminal, and then the 44 bus to Balerno. For cyclists the easiest way to return to Balerno is to cycle back. The Water of Leith is also a good fishing spot due to the concerted effort to clean up the water. You can expect to catch wild brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario) and grayling (Thymallus thymallus) with the odd pike (Esox lucius) lurking nearby. Grayling only swim in clean water so this is a good advertisement for the Water of Leith itself.

It is long and divided into five sublakes, called Pangong Tso, Tso Nyak, Rum Tso (twin lakes) and Nyak Tso. Approximately 50% of the length of the overall lake lies within Tibet, 40% in Ladakh and the rest is disputed but controlled by China. The lake is wide at its broadest point. All together it covers 604 km2. During winter the lake freezes completely, despite being saline water. It has a land-locked basin separated from the Indus River basin by a small elevated ridge, but is believed to have been part of the latter in prehistoric times. The lake is in the process of being identified under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance. This will be the first trans-boundary wetland in South Asia under the convention.  Names  Historically, the lake is viewed as being made up five sublakes, which are connected through narrow water channels. The name Pangong Tso only applied to the western most lake that is mostly in Ladakh. The main lake on the Tibetan side is called Tso Nyak (the \\"middle lake\\"). It is followed by two small lakes called Rum Tso. The last lake near Rutog is called Nyak Tso again. The whole lake group was and is still often referred to as Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo () in Tibetan. There are different interpretations on the meanings of both Pangong Tso and Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo. The Ladakh government website indicates \\"Pangong Tso\\" is Tibetan meaning \\"high grassland lake\\", however travel books from decades back say Pangong means \\"hollow\\". Tsomo Nganglha Ringpo is Tibetan that is interpreted to mean various different but similar meanings -- \\"long, narrow, enchanted lake\\" by Chinese media sources, \\"female narrow very long lake\\" by early European explorers, and \\"long-necked swan lake\\" by other modern sources. The lake has also been referred to as Pan-kung Hu.  Flora and fauna  The eastern part of the lake is fresh, with the content of total dissolved solids at 0.68 g/L, while the western part of the lake is saline, with the salinity at 11.02 g/L. The brackish water of the lake has very low micro-vegetation. Guides report that there are no fish or other aquatic life on the Indian side of the lake, except for some small crustaceans. On the other hand, visitors see numerous ducks and gulls over and on the lake surface. There are some species of scrub and perennial herbs that grow in the marshes around the lake. The lake acts as an important breeding ground for a variety of birds including a number of migratory birds. During summer, the Bar-headed goose and Brahmini ducks are commonly seen here. The region around the lake supports a number of species of wildlife including the kiang and the marmot. The lake hosts large quantities of fish, especially Schizopygopsis stoliczkai and Racoma labiata. Formerly, Pangong Tso had an outlet to Shyok River, a tributary of the Indus River, but it was closed off due to natural damming. Two streams feed the lake from the Indian side, forming marshes and wetlands at the edges. Strand lines above current lake level reveal a thick layer of mud and laminated sand, suggesting the lake has shrunken recently in geological scale. On the Indian side, no fish have been observed, however in the stream coming from South- eastern side (Cheshul nalla), three fish species (Schizopygopsis stoliczkae, Tibetan stone loach and Triplophysa gracilis) have been reported (Bhat et al., 2011). The low biodiversity has been reported as being due to high salinity and harsh environmental conditions (Bhat et al., 2011). Bird Islet is the most famous island in Pangong Tso. Climate Access Frozen, Pangong Tso An Inner Line Permit is required to visit the lake as it lies on the Sino-Indian Line of Actual Control. While Indian nationals can obtain individual permits, others must have group permits (with a minimum of three persons) accompanied by an accredited guide; the tourist office in Leh issues the permits for a small fee. For security reasons, India does not permit boating. China National Highway 219 passes by the eastern end of Pangong Tso. The lake can be accessed by driving 12 km from Rutog or 130 km from Shiquanhe. Tourists can rent a boat on the lake, but landing on islands is not allowed for protecting the breeding ground of the birds. There are several restaurants along the shore. Sino- Indian border dispute Pangong Tso is in disputed territory. The Line of Actual Control passes through the lake. A section of the lake approximately 20 km east from the Line of Actual Control is controlled by China but claimed by India. The eastern end of the lake is in Tibet. After the mid-19th century, Pangong Tso was at the southern end of Johnson Line, an early attempt at demarcation between India and China in the Aksai Chin region. The Khurnak Fort lies on the northern bank of the lake, halfway of Pangong Tso. The Chinese has controlled the Khurnak Fort area since 1952. To the south is the smaller Spanggur Tso lake. On 20 October 1962, Pangong Tso saw military action during the Sino-Indian War, successful for the Communist People's Liberation Army. Pangong Tso is still a delicate border point along the Line of Actual Control. Incursions from the Chinese side are common. In August 2017, Indian and Chinese forces near Pangong Tso threw rocks at each other.

The traditional foods consist of a mix of Native American cuisine from the indigenous groups Lenca, Pipil, Xinca, Poqomam, Maya Chʼortiʼ, Alaguilac, Mixe, Mangue, and Cacaopera; with later influences from Spanish cuisine after the Conquest of El Salvador. Many of the dishes are made with maize (corn). There is also heavy use of pork and seafood. El Salvador's most notable dish is the pupusa, a thick handmade corn flour or rice flour flatbread stuffed with cheese, chicharrón (cooked pork meat ground to a paste consistency), refried beans or loroco (a vine flower bud native to Central America). There are also vegetarian options, often with ayote (a type of squash) or garlic. Some restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach which are served with salsa roja, a cooked tomato sauce, often served with curtido. Pollo encebollado is another popular Salvadoran dish that contains chicken simmered with onions. Salvadoran cheeses, queso duro (hard cheese), queso fresco (fresh cheese), and cuajada, are eaten with meals. Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are yuca frita and panes rellenos. Yuca frita is deep-fried cassava root served with curtido (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and chicharron with pepesca (fried baby sardines). The yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. Panes rellenos (\\"stuffed bread\\") are warm submarine sandwiches. The turkey or chicken is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with turkey or chicken, tomato, and watercress along with cucumber, cabbage, and traditional stuffed panes do not include mayonnaise. Other well-known Salvadoran dishes include carne guisada (saucy beef with potatoes and carrots), lomo entomatado (beef with tomatoes), carne asada (grilled steak, usually served with a type of Salvadoran salsa called chimol), pasteles de carne (meat pies), pollo guisado con hongos (chicken with mushrooms), pacaya planta (palm flowers breaded in cornmeal, fried and served with tomato sauce), pavo salvadoreño (roast turkey with sauce, often eaten for Christmas), ceviche de camarones (lime-cooked shrimp), and pescado empanizado (breaded, fried fish fillets). Salvadorean chorizo is short, fresh (not dried) and tied into twin sausages. File:Salvadoran Chorizo.jpgSalvadoran chorizo with lime and a dip File:Pupusas olocuilta el salvador 2012.jpgThe pupusa is a Mesoamerican dish of Pipil origin. The oldest direct evidence of pupusa preparations in the world comes from a 1,400-year-old Maya site, Joya de Cerén, in El Salvador. File:Manihot esculenta - cross section 2.jpgYuca is eaten fried or boiled with salads, as a side dish or in the yuca frita dish. As with pupusa, the oldest direct evidence of cassava cultivation comes from Joya de Cerén.

These are thicker (5 mm) than Mexican tortillas, about 10 cm in diameter. File:Salvadorean style chorizo.JPGSalvadorean style chorizo Types of tamales El Salvador is known for different types of tamales, which are usually wrapped in plantain leaves. These tamales include: * Tamales de elote (Fresh corn cakes) * Tamales pisques (Tamales stuffed with black beans) * Tamales de pollo (Tamales stuffed with chicken and potatoes) * Ticucos (\\"Travelers\\" tamales ) Soups Sopa de pata Soups are popular among Salvadorans of every social level. Sopa de pata is a soup made from the tripe of a cow, plantain, corn, tomatoes, cabbage and spices, locally a delicacy. Sopa de res is a soup made from beef shank, beef bone with meat, carrots, plantain, corn, potatoes, zucchini, and many other ingredients. Gallo en chicha is a soup made with rooster, corn, dulce de tapa, and sometimes other things. Sopa de pescado is a soup made out of fish or seafood with corn flour, tomatoes, green peppers, cumin, achiote and other ingredients, commonly eaten for the Christian holiday of Good Friday. Sopa de pollo is a chicken stew with tomatoes, green peppers, guisquil, carrots, potatoes, consommé, and other ingredients. Sopa de gallina india is a chicken broth with vegetables. Some people add lorocos and cream. Sopa de frijoles (bean soup) is a red bean soup. Salpicón de res Salpicón or Picadillo Salpicón is a dish made with minced beef, mint and onions. Some people add rice. Panes rellenos Panes rellenos (stuffed bread) are warm sandwiches, often made with chicken, carne asada, or turkey. The chicken or turkey is marinated and then roasted with Pipil spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and watercress. Desserts Güisquil filled with melted cheese Alguashte is a seasoning typical of Salvadoran cuisine made from ground pepitas (pumpkin seeds). Alguashte likely has Mayan origins, as pepitas have been consumed in Mesoamerica for several centuries Salvadoran desserts include pan dulce, semita, Salvadoran quesadilla (a type of cheese-based pastry, similar to the Honduran rosquillo and unrelated to the Mexican quesadilla), torta de yema, marquezote, salpores, poleada (vanilla custard), arroz con leche (rice pudding), atol de elote, atol de piña, empanadas de platano (plantain patties), and many others. The dulce de leche of El Salvador has a soft, crumbly texture, with an almost crystallized form. Fruits are widely consumed, the most popular being mangoes, coconuts, papayas, and bananas. Sometimes fruit with ice cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top is served. Beverages Teenagers usually drink cokas (soft drinks) like Coca-Cola, while young and old alike drink coffee, El Salvador's top export. Viejitas, \\"little old ladies\\", are biscuits dipped in morning coffee. A very popular soda that originated in El Salvador is Kolachampan, which is a soda with sugar cane flavor. Minutas, shaved ice flavored with fruit flavored syrup, and horchata, a beverage made from rice milk and a mix of spices such as cinnamon, peanut beverage, ajonjolí (sesame seeds) and morro, are popular throughout the country and enjoyed on a hot day. Licuados are like the minutas with added fresh fruit and (sometimes) milk. Refrescos refer to lemonades or other sweetened fruit drinks. Other drinks include Arrayán, Chuco and Chilate. Another popular beverage is ensalada (\\"salad\\"), made of pineapple juice with finely chopped fruits, usually apples, marañón, mamey, and watercress. Tamarindo juice is consumed in all of El Salvador. Coconuts are sold at roadside estansas throughout the country. Typically, they are chopped with machetes and a straw is inserted so that the coconut water can be consumed. Adults drink coconut milk, mixed with vodka, as an aperitif. Vinagre de piña is a drink of trimmed pineapples mixed with Panela and water and set aside to ferment for a few weeks or even months. =Alcoholic beverages= The most common alcoholic beverage in El Salvador is beer (cerveza). The most popular brand name is Pilsener (brand). Suprema is considered the premier local brew. Both of these and other popular beers are made by Industrias La Constancia. More recently, Cerveza Cadejo has become increasingly popular in El Salvador. Cadejo is a microbrewery based in San Salvador that was inspired by US microbreweries. The national liquor of El Salvador is Tic Tack, a sugar cane distillate. Tick Tack has similar flavors to cachaça. Seafood Salvadorans eat a large variety of seafood. Salvadoran ceviches are made with clams, oysters, fish, shrimp, snails, octopus, squid, and a type of black clam called conchas by locals. Cocktails and ceviches are prepared with a type of tomato and chopped onion sauce or a dark sauce called Salsa Perring, which is a local way of pronouncing Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce, and both are sprinkled with lemon juice. Salvadorans also eat fried crabs and lobsters or fried fish with garlic and lemon. Shrimps are also eaten roasted, al ajillo, or in butter. There is also a type of seafood soup called mariscada, which contains fish, clams, octopus, squid, shrimp, and crab.

The term is usually used within the law enforcement world, where they are officially known as confidential human source (CHS), or criminal informants (CI). It can also refer pejoratively to someone who supplies information without the consent of the involved parties.

Whatever the nature of a group, it is likely to feel strong hostility toward any known informers, regard them as threats and inflict punishments ranging from social ostracism through physical abuse and/or death. Informers are therefore generally protected, either by being segregated while in prison or, if they are not incarcerated, relocated under a new identity. =Informant motivation= FBI Anchorage aid for assessing confidential human sources Informants, and especially criminal informants, can be motivated by many reasons. Many informants are not themselves aware of all of their reasons for providing information, but nonetheless do so. Many informants provide information while under stress, duress, emotion and other life factors that can affect the accuracy or veracity of information provided. Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, judges and others should be aware of possible motivations so that they can properly approach, assess and verify informants' information. Generally, informants' motivations can be broken down into self- interest, self-preservation and conscience. A list of possible motivations includes: Self-Interest: * Financial rewardLyman, D., Micheal. Criminal Investigation: The Art and the Science. 6th ed. Columbia College of Missouri. Pearson, 2010. p264 * Pre-trial release from custody * Withdrawal or dismissal of criminal charges * Reduction of sentence * Choice of location to serve sentence * Elimination of rivals or unwanted criminal associates. * Elimination of competitors engaged in criminal activities. * Diversion of suspicion from their own criminal activities. * Revenge Self-Preservation: * Fear of harm from others. * Threat of arrest or charges. * Threat of incarceration. * Desire for witness protection program.

The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of the city under a guard, lest the populace should have stoned him... The Jew was ordered to the torture till he should speak as he had been instructed... The innocent were condemned to die.... Nor was the promise of pardon made good to the feigned adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and then he disclosed the whole secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all the beholders that the women died innocent.\\" Criminal informant schemes have been used as cover for politically motivated intelligence offensives.\\"CIA Assets and the Rise of the Guadalajara Connection\\" J.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 7, 2000. In the episode, Lisa decides to sign up for tap dancing lessons after being inspired by a film about a girl who enters a tango contest and wins. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse hide out at the mall to escape going to summer camp. \\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\\" was written by Julie Thacker, who based it on her own experiences with dance classes. The episode has received mixed reviews from critics. Plot On a trip to the mall, Homer sees an optometrist to get his eyes examined and gets laser surgery after rejecting a number of eyeglasses. After the surgery, Homer rejects the optometrist's advice to take eye drops to keep his eyes from crusting over—and ends up blind from his eyes scabbing over and kidnapped tricked into driving to the liquor store to buy Jack Daniel's and \\"a carton of smokes\\" for Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney (the latter of whom fools Homer into thinking he's Marge). However, he does get his vision back for the unknown. At the same time, Marge and Lisa find items for Bart's school camping trip. Marge sees a poster for the film Tango de La Muerte at the mall's cineplex and she and Lisa decide to see it. Lisa identifies with the main female character, a bookworm named \\"Lisabella\\" whom the tango champion asks to be his partner and with whom he then falls in love. This inspires Lisa to enroll at a dance school, where she wants to take tango classes. She is pushed into tap lessons by an obnoxious former child star named Vicki Valentine. Lisa's hopes of being a dancer are crushed when she finds that she is the worst dancer there, even being out-performed by Ralph Wiggum. She continues to attend the tap classes because she does not want to upset Homer and Marge. When the school organizes a dance recital, Lisa finds that she will not be dancing and has been relegated to pulling the curtain to open the show (Vicki eventually decides that the curtain-pulling is too important for Lisa and instead does it herself). Professor Frink, overhearing, devises a plan to attach a device to Lisa's shoes that will make them automatically tap at any percussive sound. This allows her to mimic the other dancers and take part in the recital. She becomes a star at the show, even upstaging an enraged Vicki Valentine, but when the audience applauds her, her shoes go out of control. Homer stops the shoes from going haywire by tripping Lisa. Vicki finally seems to empathize with Lisa's desperation to be a star (though she notes, to the bemusement of Homer and Marge, that this involved Vicki's destroying the credit rating of Buddy Ebsen). Lisa walks off with her parents, having decided that tap dancing is not for her. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse sneak out of their camping trip after discovering that Nelson Muntz will be there with them with plans to beat them both up on the reg. They decide to hide in the mall and spend the night there, having shoe fights and causing havoc once the mall has closed. The next morning, the mall manager and Chief Wiggum see the mess that Bart and Milhouse have created and blindly jumps to the conclusion that it was caused by a giant rat, closing the mall as a result. He releases a puma inside the mall to catch the rat, but Bart and Milhouse use a ball of yarn to distract the puma and escape. Chief Wiggum later sees a piece of red yarn hanging from the mountain lion's mouth and thinks it is the rat's tail, which prompts him to declare that the case is closed and to not focus on putting the puma back in its cage. Production and analysis Lisa's dance teacher is based on American former child actress Shirley Temple, who was originally offered the role \\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\\" was written by Julie Thacker and directed by Nancy Kruse as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). Thacker came up with the story when she started enrolling her five daughters into dance classes during the summer. In a DVD audio commentary for the episode, she noted that she did not particularly like the teachers' methods and the other children's rude parents.Thacker, Julie (2008). Commentary for \\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Vicki Valentine, Lisa's tap dance teacher in the episode, is based on the American former child actress Shirley Temple. The character is voiced by regular cast member Tress MacNeille, although the part was originally offered to Temple herself, but she was unable to record the role.Scully, Mike (2008). Commentary for \\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. According to Pamela Klaffke, author of the 2003 book Spree: A Cultural History of Shopping, the idea of \\"being trapped inside the walls of a store or mall\\" had become a \\"cinematic cliché\\" by the time this episode aired. She believes this cliché is what prompted the writers to do the story featuring Bart and Milhouse. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 7, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Julie Thacker, Yeardley Smith, and Nancy Kruse participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. \\"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\\" has received mixed reception from critics. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that neither the plot involving Lisa nor the subplot featuring Bart and Milhouse \\"excels\\", but that the latter is \\"the superior of the two plots\\". He added that \\"We get some decent laughs from both of them and that’s about it.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com, on the other hand, listed the episode as one of the episodes she felt \\"shined in season eleven\\".

Nicknamed The Swamp, it is the home field of Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns athletics. Cajun Field is primarily used for its American football team. Cajun Field has an official capacity of 41,426 with 2,577 chairback seats. It is currently the largest facility and football stadium in the Sun Belt Conference and the second largest college football stadium in Louisiana. History In planning since at least 1967 (when a rendition was featured on the football media guide), it was built in 1970 as a replacement for McNaspy Stadium, opening on September 25, 1971 with a shutout of Santa Clara University. The stadium consists of a bowl with seating on the sidelines, with a second deck on the west sideline. In one of the biggest games at the stadium, on September 14, 1996, 38,783 spectators saw the Cajuns upset 25th-ranked Texas A&M;, 29–22, the first victory for the Cajuns over a ranked opponent.2006 Ragin' Cajuns Football Media Guide, p. 111. The largest crowd at The Swamp was 41,357 fans on September 5, 2009, when the Cajuns beat Southern University 42–19 at the 9th annual Herbert Heymann Football Classic. The stadium won the Sun Belt Conference Attendance Championship in 2004, 2008, and 2011. Because of Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 New Orleans Bowl was played here instead of in New Orleans, with Southern Miss defeating Arkansas State, 31–19. Also the Tulane Green Wave football team used it for a home game in 2005 after being displaced by the hurricane. In addition, Cajun Field hosted the final pre-season game of the New Orleans Breakers of the United States Football League on February 18, 1984, a 20–0 victory over the Memphis Showboats. Facility upgrades =Updated seating= In 1992, Cajun Field saw the attendance rise from 26,000 to 31,000 due to an upgrade to the ends of the stadium seating. =Synthetic surface and banners= In the summer of 2008 Cajun Field replaced its long- standing natural grass with ProGrass, an artificial turf. The stadium was pressure-washed and repainted. Advertisements and banners reading \\"University of Louisiana at Lafayette,\\" \\"Ragin' Cajuns,\\" and \\"www.ragincajuns.com\\" also were installed around the black retaining wall that surrounds the field. =Athletics Master Plan= In spring 2014, construction of the south endzone seating began. This first phase project included bowling in the south endzone with new bleacher seating as well as concession and restroom facilities. This change has increased capacity to 41,426 and was completed for the 2014 season kickoff.http://ragincajuns.com/custompages/MediaGuidepdfs/Football/2014/2014_FootballGuide_Final.pdf Daktronics also installed a HD screen in the north endzone, replacing the previous scoreboardhttp://www.daktronics.com/news/Pages/University-of- Louisiana-Partners-with-Daktronics-for-Video-Display.aspx \\"The Swamp\\" Cajun Field on gameday Cajun Field's surface is two feet below sea level in a natural bowl. With the below-sea level playing surface, a total of four pumps and a sophisticated drainage system help keep the field in good playing condition even during the frequent south Louisiana rainstorms. The subsurface stadium requires many fans to walk down to their seats. Ragin' Cajuns football players and their opponents enter Cajun Field through a tunnel from the Louisiana athletics complex. In 1988 the stadium was nicknamed \\"The Swamp,\\" as then noted on stadium signage, in the school yearbook and, a year later, in the 1989 official Southwestern Louisiana sports media guide. The nickname is tied to the field's early 1970s construction, and even refers to the original football field for what was then the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute in the early 1900s. The university's first football field was on the main campus adjacent to a small cypress pond, which later became Cypress Lake, also nicknamed The Swamp. The \\"Swamp\\" nickname also fits with the area's geography, with many bayous and wetlands, including the Atchafalaya Basin and the nearby Gulf of Mexico marshlands. The National Wetlands Research Center, a United States Geological Survey research facility at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, is less than half a mile from Cajun Field. Division I FBS Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at the University of Florida was later also nicknamed \\"The Swamp\\" by then-Gators head coach Steve Spurrier in 1991.

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Kent State Golden Flashes football team. In addition, since 2016 the stadium is also home to the Kent State women's soccer team and since 2019 to the women's lacrosse team. Previously, it was home to the Kent State field hockey team from 1997 to 2004 and served as a secondary home for the KSU men's soccer team in the 1970s. It opened on September 13, 1969 and was named in 1973 after Robert C. Dix, former publisher of the Record-Courier and a member of Kent State's Board of Trustees for more than three decades. It was built as an expansion and relocation of Memorial Stadium, with all of Memorial Stadium's main seating areas used at the current stadium in a new configuration. Dix Stadium is located at the far eastern end of the KSU campus along Summit Street, just east of State Route 261 and is the center of an athletic complex, adjacent to the Kent State Field House, Murphy–Mellis Field, the Diamond at Dix, and Zoeller Field. The stadium hosts high school football games on a regular basis and served as the host of the 2001 NCAA Division I Field Hockey Championship, the 1998 and 2003 Mid-American Conference Field Hockey Tournaments, and the 2016 Mid-American Conference Women's Soccer Tournament. The stadium consists of three separate grandstands on each side of the field except the south side, and has a seating capacity of 25,319. The west side grandstand, which includes the press box, is the largest section of seating, and the east side student seating is the smallest. On either side of the east grandstands are spaces for party tents, and the south end zone features the scoreboard and an open plaza. Although the first night game was held in 1990, permanent lights were not added until 1996. Artificial turf was installed in 1997 and replaced in 2005 with the latest version of FieldTurf. Prior to the 2002 season, the old east side stands, remnants of the Memorial Stadium, were demolished. The current east side bleachers were constructed after the 2002 season and were completed in time for the 2003 season opener. In early 2008, the south end zone bleachers, another remnant of the old stadium, were razed as part of a two- phase renovation of the facility. At its dedication, the stadium was listed as having a seating capacity of 30,520, reduced to 29,287 in 2003 after the east side seating was replaced. History Prior to the opening of Dix Stadium, the Golden Flashes football team played home games at Memorial Stadium, which was located adjacent to what is now known as the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center. Memorial Stadium opened in 1950, though the team had been playing on the site since 1941. By 1965, Memorial Stadium had been expanded to seat 20,000 people from its original 5,600. Enrollment growth and construction of new academic buildings in the 1950s and early 1960s meant that the Memorial Stadium site, which had previously been the edge of campus, was instead becoming its physical center. In 1964, continued and forecasted enrollment growth at Kent State led to discussion on building a new University Center in the area partially occupied by the stadium, to include a new student center and library along with additional parking and new classroom buildings for science. Early plans for the stadium called for it to seat 55,000 and be located in the southwest corner of the campus, adjacent to the site of what is now Schoonover Stadium. By 1966, the university had purchased land near the corner of Horning Road and Summit Road in Franklin Township. Preliminary plans call for an athletic complex centered on a new stadium seating between 40,000 and 55,000 people to be opened in 1969, with parking for 9,000 cars. Later plans called for the complex to include a 15,000-seat arena and a field house with an indoor track. Dix Stadium, known as Memorial Stadium until 1973, was regarded as an \\"expansion and relocation\\" of Memorial Stadium rather than an entirely new stadium. A new grandstand on the west side of the stadium, with seating for over 12,000 people and locker room and press facilities, was constructed on the new site, along Summit Road just over east of campus. Approximately 17,000 seats from Memorial Stadium were dismantled and moved to the new site. Memorial Stadium's sideline grandstands became the end zone seats in the new stadium, while the auxiliary bleacher sections were used for the east stands. The first game at Dix Stadium was on September 13, 1969, a 24–14 win over the Dayton Flyers in front of 8,172 fans. Because of delays, the new west stands, including the home and visitor locker rooms, press box, and most of the seating, were not completed until after the 1969 football season, limiting the seating capacity to 18,200. For the first season, the teams dressed in the locker rooms at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center and were bused to the stadium. At halftime, the teams met in separate public restroom facilities. The \\"new\\" Memorial Stadium was dedicated in 1970 and renamed Dix Stadium in honor of longtime Kent State trustee and Record- Courier publisher Robert C. Dix in 1973. Its initial seating capacity was listed at 28,748 before later being revised to 30,520, which stood through the 2001 season. The first major changes to Dix Stadium began in 1992 when an elevator was added to reach the press box and suites, and in 1996 when permanent lighting was added. Night games had been played since 1990, but with temporary lighting. A new scoreboard and artificial turf were installed in 1997, which allowed the field hockey team to begin play at the stadium. The field hockey team played home games at Dix Stadium through the 2004 season before moving to the adjacent Murphy-Mellis Field in 2005. After the east side bleachers were condemned and demolished in 2001, the area remained open for the entire 2002 season. Prior to the start of the 2003 season, a new section of bleacher seating was built as the student section, bringing the total seating capacity to 29,287. In 2007, a two-phase renovation of the stadium started. Phase one included construction of a large canopy over the press box, new entrance gates, and a ticket office, all completed prior to the 2007 season opener. Phase two included the demolition of the south end zone seats and the former press box atop the seats in the north end zone, and construction of a new HD scoreboard, concession area, and plaza in the sound end zone area. The removal of the approximately 5,000 seats in the south end zone reduced the stadium's seating capacity to 25,319. =Layout= Dix Stadium is laid out with the football field running north–south, with separate seating areas on the west, north, and east sides. The west stands, often referred to as the \\"home stands\\", are the largest and include the locker rooms and player facilities beneath them, the press box and suites, and both bleacher and chair back seating for over 12,000 fans. The east stands, built in 2003 to replace the original wooden bleachers, are the smallest section and are the primary student section, with bleacher seating for over 4,000 fans. The north end zone, which is the original grandstand of old Memorial Stadium, is also entirely made up of bleacher seats. A large plaza, concession area, and the scoreboard are located in the south end zone. When it first opened, the stadium had four major seating areas, with the new west stands and the seating moved from old Memorial Stadium on the other three sides of the field. Initial long-range plans for the stadium called for it to eventually be expanded to seat 50,000 people. The original east stands, which were wooden bleachers considered temporary, were to be removed by 1973 and replaced with permanent seating. This section was to have been 18 rows initially, and would have eventually been expanded to duplicate the west stands, increasing capacity to approximately 35,000. The final phase would have been to add a second deck on both sides. Changes to the seating capacity, however, would not come for 31 years when the east side bleachers were condemned and demolished following the 2001 season. The first official game listed as a sell-out occurred on October 9, 2010 when 24,221 fans were on hand for the Flashes' 28–17 win over arch-rival Akron in the Battle for the Wagon Wheel. The crowd ranks as the third-largest crowd to see a game at Dix Stadium, surpassed by two games in 1973: 25,137 against Bowling Green on October 13, and 27,363 against Miami on November 10. Location View from the top of Dix Stadium looking west towards the center of campus. The 12-story main library is visible in center, approximately 1.6 miles (2.5 km) away Dix Stadium is located along Summit Street in Kent, just east of the intersection of Summit Street and Ohio State Route 261, on the eastern edge of the Kent State University main campus. The stadium was annexed into the city of Kent in 2002 after having previously been part of Franklin Township. Adjacent to the stadium are facilities and practice fields for several other Kent State athletic teams. When the stadium was built, a cinder track was included on the site, northeast of the stadium. While the track is no longer used for competitions, it surrounds Zoeller Field, the home of the Kent State women's soccer team. Zoeller Field was constructed in 1990 as the home of the field hockey team, becoming the home of the women's soccer team in 1997. It was upgraded in 2010. Immediately east of Dix Stadium and south of Zoeller Field is the Kent State Field House, built in 1990 and expanded in 2014. It includes a full-sized football field, track, weight training facilities, and locker rooms. It is primarily used by the football team for training and practice and the indoor track and field teams for practice and meets. Other KSU sports such as baseball and softball use the field house for practice during winter months. South of Dix Stadium is the Diamond at Dix, the home of the Kent State softball team, with Murphy-Mellis Field, the home of the KSU field hockey team, adjacent on the north along with two natural grass practice fields for football. The Diamond at Dix opened in 1999 and Murphy-Mellis Field opened in 2005. =Future plans= In 2013, the university began the $60 million \\"Building Champions\\" campaign to upgrade facilities for all of Kent State's athletic teams as well as raise additional scholarship money. The first project was expansion of the Field House with new locker rooms for indoor track and field, women's soccer, field hockey, and softball, as well as concession areas and restrooms for fans. The plans include additional changes to both Dix Stadium and the surrounding athletic complex. Among the changes planned are a new Zoeller Field south of the Field House and east of Dix Stadium with seating for 2,150 and a new all-weather track surrounding a soccer field. Additionally, a new parking lot would be built north of the Field House where the current Zoeller Field stands. In front of Dix Stadium, the Diamond at Dix would be removed and a new parking area for alumni would be built in its place, with a new softball stadium being built adjacent to Olga Mural Field at Schoonover Stadium. Improvements planned for Dix Stadium include expanded chairback seating and suite upgrades on the west stands, a new building for the coaches' offices on the north of the stadium, and improvements to the locker room and other player facilities, including a new players' lounge. On the east side, two covered seating areas for students would be built adjacent to the existing student seating. Other uses Ohio Bobcats In addition to being the home venue for the Kent State football team since 1969 and for the Kent State field hockey team from 1997 through the 2004 season, Dix Stadium has also been used for a number of other events. It is a regular host for high school football games, usually Ohio High School Athletic Association playoff games. From 1997–1999, the stadium was the site of the annual rivalry game between Theodore Roosevelt High School and Ravenna High School. In 1998, the OHSAA Division I state semifinal between Canton McKinley High School and Cleveland Saint Ignatius High School was played at the stadium in front of a near sellout crowd. The stadium hosted two state playoff games in 2012, an opening round game between Theodore Roosevelt High School and Ellet High School in Division II and a Division I second-round game between Canton McKinley High School and Massillon Washington High School that drew an estimated 20,000 fans. From 1975 to 1981, the Cleveland Browns held their training camp on the campus of Kent State University and used the stadium and practice fields. In 1980, a controlled scrimmage with the Buffalo Bills held in the stadium drew 26,758 fans. During the field hockey team's tenure at Dix Stadium, it was the site of the Mid-American Conference Field Hockey Tournament in 1998 and 2003, and of the semifinal and championship rounds of the 2001 NCAA Division I Field Hockey Championship, held November 16 through 18. It was the first time Kent State had hosted a national championship event since the 1967 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships were held at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, and the first national championship hosted by a MAC school since 1992. The 2016 Mid-American Women's Soccer Tournament was held at Dix Stadium, with the semifinals played November 4 and the championship match played November 6, won by the Flashes. It marked the first time Kent State hosted the MAC tournament and was the first time Kent State won the tournament. In preparation for hosting the MAC Tournament, the KSU women's soccer team most of their home games in the 2016 season at the stadium, which is adjacent to their home venue, Zoeller Field. The previous season, the team hosted its opening round match in the MAC tournament at Dix Stadium. In the 1970s, Dix Stadium was used by the KSU men's soccer team for occasional matches until the team disbanded in 1980. From 1970 through 1973, the university's May commencement ceremony was held there, but was moved back to the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center in 1974, where it has remained since. The stadium again hosted commencement in July 1991 because of renovations at the MAC Center. Shortly after the inauguration of university president Lester Lefton in 2006, he announced plans to have one large commencement ceremony at Dix Stadium to begin in 2008, but the plans were later canceled. The stadium was used again for commencement in May 2017 for Kent State's first \\"One University Commencement Ceremony\\", which included students from all eight KSU campuses. The 2017 program was highlighted by keynote speaker Octavia Spencer. The facility has also been used as a concert venue, most recently in 2012 as part of the university's Centennial Campaign when Sheryl Crow and Los Lonely Boys played there. It was the first concert held at the stadium in 25 years. =In film= During the filming for the movie Draft Day, the stadium was used as a stand-in for Ohio Stadium in a scene that depicts a football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Wisconsin Badgers. Dix Stadium was chosen because of its proximity to Cleveland, where most of the filming for the movie was taking place. Filming took place May 18, 2013 primarily in the north end zone and included a number of local extras as fans, the addition of the Ohio State \\"Block O\\" on the center of the football field, and the placing of Ohio State padding on the south end goal post.

Perry Stadium is a stadium on the campus of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, United States. It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Bowling Green Falcons football team. It opened in 1966 and originally held 23,232 people. History On October 1, 1966, the stadium opened with a 13–0 win over Dayton. The stadium was named for Doyt Perry, a highly successful coach and athletic director at the school.Center for Archival Collections, Bowling Green State University. Doyt L. Perry Stadium page on the BGSU Historic Campus Tour. Retrieved 6 February 2007. It was meant to replace University Stadium, a WPA stadium in the heart of campus which lasted 43 seasons. In 1975 the stadium hosted the Poe Ditch Music Festival. On October 8, 1983, the annual Toledo-Bowling Green football game established a school and MAC attendance record of 33,527. =Renovations= For the 2007 football season the stadium received an upgrade. The Sebo Center was built and enclosed the north endzone. It houses band seating, luxury suites, offices, training facilities and new box offices. The grass field was also replaced with a Fieldturf artificial surface. Nevertheless, Doyt Perry Stadium has the second smallest capacity of any stadium among schools in the MAC - ahead of only Ball State University's Scheumann Stadium. Additionally in 2007, the stadium underwent further renovations, complying with new NCAA seating regulations which increased the listed capacity from 23,272 to 24,000. Features The stadium consists of two bowed sideline grandstands. The stadium also featured steel grandstands at the north and south ends. The south grandstands were removed to make way for a merchandise tent and a pavilion for the Falcon Club boosters. The north grandstand was removed to facilitate the construction of the Sebo Athletic Center. Through the 2019 season, the Falcons have a 172-103-6 record at Doyt Perry Stadium.

Background The building where Smith and her fiancé Minnoch each had apartments. L'Angelier's rooming house. Smith was the first child (of five) of an upper-middle-class family in Glasgow; her father, James Smith (1808–1863) was a wealthy architect http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200188, and her mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of leading neo-classical architect David Hamilton. The family lived at No 7, Blythswood Square, Glasgow, at the crown of the new developments by William Harley on Blythswood Hill, and also had a country property, \\"Rowaleyn\\", near Helensburgh.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: James Smith . Smith broke the strict Victorian conventions of the time when, as a young woman in early 1855, she began a secret love affair with Pierre Emile L'Angelier, some ten years her senior, an apprentice nurseryman who originally came from the Channel Islands. He worked as a packing clerk in a warehouse at 10 Bothwell Street nearby. The pair would meet late at night, at Smith's bedroom window and also engaged in voluminous correspondence. During one of their infrequent meetings alone, she lost her virginity to L'Angelier. Smith's parents, unaware of the affair with L'Angelier (whom Smith had promised to marry) found a suitable fiancé for her within the Glasgow upper-middle class, William Harper Minnoch. Smith attempted to break her connection with L'Angelier and, in February 1857, asked him to return the letters she had written to him. Instead, L'Angelier threatened to use the letters to expose her and force her to marry him. She was soon observed in a druggist's office, ordering arsenic, which she signed for as M.H. Smith. Early on the morning of 23 March 1857, L'Angelier died from arsenic poisoning. He is buried in the Ramshorn Cemetery on Ingram Street in Glasgow. After his death, Madeleine Smith's numerous letters were found in the house where he lodged, and she was arrested and charged with his murder. Trial A sketch of the trial proceedings against Smith. At trial, Smith was defended by advocate John Inglis (later known as Lord Glencorse).James Crabb Watt, John Inglis, Lord Justice-General of Scotland: A Memoir (1893), p. 333. Toxicological evidence, confirming that the victim had died of arsenic poisoning, was given by Andrew Douglas Maclagan.Andrew Douglas Maclagan Although the circumstantial evidence pointed towards her guilt (Smith had made purchases of arsenic in the weeks leading up to L'Angelier's death, and had a clear motive) the jury returned a verdict of \\"not proven\\". Crucial to the case was the chronology of certain letters from Smith to l'Angelier, and as the letters themselves were undated, the case hinged to some extent on the envelopes. One letter in particular depended on the correct interpretation of the date of the postmark which was unfortunately illegible, and attracted some caustic comments from the judge; but the vast majority of these postmarks were quite clearly struck. It transpired that when the police searched L'Angelier's room, many of Smith's letters were found without their envelopes and were then hurriedly collected and stuck into whichever envelopes came to hand. Later life 6-7 Blythswood Square. Madeleine Smith's house. 2020. On 4 July 1861, she married an artist named George Wardle, William Morris's business manager.Richard Davenport- Hines, \\"Smith , Madeleine Hamilton (1835/6–1928)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 11 April 2008. They had one son (Thomas, born 1864) and one daughter (Mary, called \\"Kitten\\", born 1863). For a time, she became involved with the Fabian Society in London, and sometimes made the coffee at meetings. As she was known by her new married name, not everyone knew who she was, but a few did.Jack House, Square Mile of Murder After many years of marriage, she and her husband separated in 1889 and Madeleine moved to New York City. Around 1916, she married a second time to William A. Sheehy and this marriage lasted until his death in 1926. She died in 1928 and was buried under the name of Lena Wardle Sheehy.Find a grave memorial Later theories As in the case of Lizzie Borden, scholars and amateur criminologists have spent decades going over the minutiae of the case. Most modern scholars believe that Smith committed the crime and the only thing that saved her from a guilty verdict and a death sentence was that no eyewitness could prove that Smith and l'Angellier had met in the weeks before his death. After the trial, The Scotsman ran a small article stating that a witness had come forward claiming that a young male and female were seen outside Smith's house on the night of l'Angellier's death. However, the trial was already in progress, and the witness could not be questioned during it. Dramatisations Smith's story was the basis for several plays and the David Lean film Madeleine (1950). Jack House's book Square Mile of Murder (1961), which contains a section on Smith, formed the basis for a BBC television version in 1980. A television play based upon the case, Killer in Close-Up: The Trial Of Madeleine Smith, written by George F. Kerr, was also produced by Sydney television station ABN-2, broadcast on 13 August 1958. The case was an inspiration for Wilkie Collins' novel The Law and the Lady (1875), though the only main similar features were the problem of the Scottish \\"Not Proven\\" verdict and arsenic poisoning as a means for murder.Dougald B. Maceachen, 'Wilkie Collins and British Law', Nineteenth-Century Fiction, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Sep. 1950), pp. 135–138 (University of California Press) In the early 1930s, MGM starred Joan Crawford, Nils Asther and Robert Montgomery in a film called \\"Letty Lynton\\", which was based on a 1931 novel of the same title by Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes. This film closely follows Madeleine's story, except that Crawford's character is never charged and, in an example of pre-code Hollywood, gets away with murder. The film is not presently available due to a copyright suit filed shortly after the film's release in 1932. The case was again dramatized in 1952 for Mutual Radio in an episode of The Black Museum titled \\"The Small White Boxes\\".https://archive.org/details/OTRR_Black_Museum_Singles Other novels based on the case include The House in Queen Anne's Square (1920) by William Darling Lyell, Lovers All Untrue (1970) by Norah Lofts, and Alas, for Her That Met Me! (1976) by Mary Ann Ashe (pseudonym of Christianna Brand).

Eisner uses large, monochromatic images in dramatic perspective, and emphasizes the caricatured characters' facial expressions; few panels or captions have traditional borders around them. Eisner began his comic book career in 1936 and had long held artistic ambitions for what was perceived as a lowbrow medium. He found no support for his ideas, and left the world of commercial comics after ending his signature work The Spirit in 1952. The growth of comics fandom convinced him to return in the 1970s, and he worked to realize his aspirations of creating comics with literary content. He wanted a mainstream publisher for the book and to have it sold in traditional bookstores, rather than in comic book shops; the small press Baronet Books released A Contract with God in 1978 and marketed it as a \\"graphic novel\\", which thereafter became the common term for book-length comics. It sold slowly at first, but gained respect from Eisner's peers, and since has been reprinted by larger publishers. A Contract with God cemented Eisner's reputation as an elder statesman of comics, and he continued to produce graphic novels and theoretical works on comics until his death in 2005. Content and plot summaries A Contract with God mixes melodrama with social realism. Following an author's introduction, \\"A Tenement in the Bronx\\", the book contains four stories set in a tenement building; they derive in part from Eisner's personal memories growing up in a tenement in the Bronx. With A Contract with God he aimed to explore an area of Jewish-American history that he felt was underdocumented, while showing that capable of mature literary expression, at a time when it received little such regard as an artistic medium. In the preface he stated his aim to keep the exaggeration in his cartooning within realistic limits. Stories derive from Will Eisner's memories of his childhood in tenement buildings in the Bronx. The story \\"A Contract with God\\" drew from Eisner's feelings over the death at sixteen of his daughter Alice. In his introduction to the 2006 edition of the book, Eisner first wrote about it and the feelings he felt toward God that were reflected in the story. \\"The Street Singer\\" and \\"The Super\\" are fiction, but sprang from Eisner's memories of people he had met in the tenements of his youth. \\"Cookalein\\" was the most autobiographical—the main character \\"Willie\\" even carries Eisner's own boyhood nickname. Eisner remarked that \\"it took a lot of determination, a kind of courage, to write that story\\". The stories' sexual content is prominent, though not in the gratuitous manner of ' celebration of hedonism, which contrasted with the conservative lifestyle of Eisner the middle-aged businessman. Eisner used no profanity in the book, and according to critic Josh Lambert the sex in Contract is not so much erotic as disturbing, the characters frustrated or filled with guilt. =\\"A Contract with God\\"= In Russia, the young, deeply religious Hasidic Jew Frimme Hersh carves a contract with God on a stone tablet to live a life of good deeds; he attributes to it his later success in life. He moves to New York, into a tenement building at 55 Dropsie Avenue, and lives a simple life devoted to God. He adopts an infant girl, Rachele, who is abandoned on his doorstep. When she dies of a sudden illness, Hersh is infuriated, and accuses God of violating their contract. He abandons his faith, shaves his beard, and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a gentile mistress. He illicitly uses a synagogue's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the tenement building in which he had lived when poor. He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life, and decides that he needs a new contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels. He has a group of rabbis draw up a new contract, but when he returns home with it, his heart fails and he dies. A boy, Shloime, finds Hersh's old contract, and signs his own name to it. Eisner appended a page to the 2006 edition, depicting Shloime ascending the stairs to the tenement. Eisner called the story's creation \\"an exercise in personal anguish\\" as he was still grieved and angered over his daughter Alice's death from leukemia at 16. In early sketches of the story, Eisner used her name for Hersh's adopted daughter, and expressed his own anguish through Hersh. He stated, \\" argument with God was mine. I exorcised my rage at a deity that I believed violated my faith and deprived my lovely 16-year-old child of her life at the very flowering of it.\\" =\\"The Street Singer\\"= Marta Maria, an aging opera singer, tries to seduce a young man, Eddie, whom she finds singing in the alleys between tenement buildings. She had given up her own singing career for an alcoholic husband; she hopes to get back into show business as mentor to Eddie, and gives him money for clothes. He buys whiskey instead and returns to his pregnant wife, who herself had given up on show business for him and whom he abuses. He hopes to take advantage of Maria and build an actual singing career, but is unable to find the aging diva again—he does not know her address, and the tenement buildings appear all the same to him. Eisner based the story on memories of an unemployed man who made the rounds of tenements singing \\"popular songs or off-key operatic operas\\" for spare change. Eisner remembered throwing the street singer coins on occasion, and considered he \\"was able to immortalize his story\\" in \\"The Street Singer\\". =\\"The Super\\"= Those who live in the tenement at 55 Dropsie Avenue fear and mistrust their antisemitic superintendent, Mr. Scuggs. The tenant Mrs. Farfell's young niece Rosie goes down to his apartment and offers him a peek at her panties for a nickel. After receiving the nickel she poisons Scuggs' dog and only companion, Hugo, and steals Scuggs's money. He corners her in an alley, where the tenants spot him and call the police, accusing him of trying to molest a minor. Before the police can break into his apartment to arrest him, he shoots himself, embracing Hugo's body. Eisner wrote that he based the superintendent on the \\"mysterious but threatening custodian\\" of his boyhood tenement. Eisner added a page to the 2006 edition in which a \\"Super Wanted\\" sign is posted on the tenement building, following the original conclusion of Rosie counting her stolen money. =\\"Cookalein\\"= Silver Lake, Woodridge, New York, a lake in the Catskill Mountains \\"Cookalein\\" is a story of tenants of 55 Dropsie Avenue vacationing in the country. To be alone with his mistress, a man named Sam sends his wife and children away to the Catskill Mountains, where they stay at a \\"cookalein\\" (Yiddish: , \\"cook alone\\", a place for boarders with access to a kitchen). A clothing cutter named Benny and a secretary named Goldie are staying at an expensive hotel near the cookalein, both hoping to find someone rich to marry; they mistake each other for a wealthy target, and when they discover this, Benny rapes Goldie. Herbie, an intern Goldie had earlier turned down, takes her into his care, and Benny goes on to court an heiress. An older woman seduces Sam's fifteen-year-old son Willie at the cookalein; they are discovered by her husband who, after beating her, makes love to her in front of the boy. At the end of the summer, the vacationers return to Dropsie Avenue. Goldie and Herbie are engaged, and Benny believes he will be marrying into the diamond business. Willie is affected by his experiences, but does not express them, and his family plan to leave the tenement. For the 2006 edition Eisner added an extra page of Willie from a rear-view perspective, looking out from his balcony. \\"Cookalein\\" was the most overtly autobiographical of the stories—Eisner used the real names of his family members: his parents Sam and Fannie, his brother Petey, and himself, \\"Willie\\". Eisner called \\"Cookalein\\" \\"an honest account of coming of age\\" that was \\"a combination of invention and recall\\". Background Frans Masereel, 25 Images of a Man's Passion, 1918. Eisner was inspired by wordless novels of the 1920s and 1930s. Will Eisner was born in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish immigrants. He has said he wanted a career in the arts, but that poor Jews at the time were restricted from upper-class universities where he could study it. Like others of his generation, he turned to comics as an artistic outlet, a career he began in 1936. In the late 1930s he co-owned a studio which produced content for comic books; he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best-known creation, the formally inventive The Spirit, which ran as a newspaper insert from 1940 to 1952. After its end, Eisner withdrew from the comic book world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation, which he had founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and related media. With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s, Eisner found there was still interest in his decades-old Spirit comics, and that the fans wanted more work from him. After American Visuals went out of business in 1972, Eisner entered a deal with underground comix publisher to reprint old Spirit stories. Other reprints followed, but Eisner was unwilling to do new Spirit stories—instead, he wanted to do something more serious, inspired in part by the wordless novels of Lynd Ward he first read in 1938, and similar work by the Flemish Frans Masereel and the German Otto Nückel. Eisner had had greater artistic ambitions for comics since his time doing The Spirit. Since the 1950s, he had been developing ideas for a book, but was unable to gain support for them, as was seen by both the public and its practitioners as low-status entertainment; at a meeting of the National Cartoonists Society in 1960, Rube Goldberg rebuked Eisner's ambitions, saying, \\"You are a vaudevillian like the rest of us ... don't ever forget that!\\" With the critical acceptance of underground comix in the 1970s, Eisner saw a potential market for his ideas. In 1978, he produced his first book-length, adult-oriented work, A Contract with God. He marketed it as a \\"graphic novel\\"—a term which had been in use since the 1960s, but was little known until Eisner popularized it with Contract. Though it was a modest commercial success, Eisner was financially independent, and soon set to work on another graphic novel Life on Another Planet, and completed eighteen further graphic novels before his 2005 death; two featured the autobiographical Willie from the story \\"Cookalein\\": The Dreamer (1986) and To the Heart of the Storm (1991). Eisner was brought up in a religious household, but himself was a reluctant disbeliever. In 1970, his sixteen-year-old daughter Alice died after an eighteen-month battle with leukemia. Eisner was enraged, and questioned how a God could let such a thing happen; he dealt with his grief by immersing himself in his work. When working on \\"A Contract with God\\", he tried to capture these emotions by acting out Frimme Hersh's character in his head. Style The narration is lettered as part of the artwork, rather than being set apart in caption boxes, and Eisner makes little use of conventional box-style panels, often avoiding panel borders entirely, delimiting spaces with buildings or window frames instead. Pages are uncrowded and have large drawings which focus on facial expression. He allowed the length of the stories to develop based on their content, rather than a set page count as was traditional in comics before that time. Eisner emphasizes the urban setting with dramatic, vertical perspective, and dark artwork with much chiaroscuro, and uses visual motifs to tie the stories together. The dark, vertical rain surrounding Hersh when he buries his daughter in the first story is echoed by the revised final image of the last story, in which Willie stares out into a city sky in a similar hatched rainy \\"Eisenshpritz\\" style. The monochromatic artwork was printed in sepia tones, rather than conventional black-and-white. In contrast to comics in the superhero genre, in which Eisner did prominent work early in his career, the characters in A Contract with God are not heroic; they often feel frustrated and powerless, even when performing seemingly heroic deeds to help their neighbors. The characters are rendered in a caricatured manner that contrasts with the realistic backgrounds, though the backgrounds are rendered in less detail than in Eisner's work in The Spirit; according to writer Dennis O'Neil, this style mimics the impressionistic sense of memory. Eisner explored these sorts of characters and situations further in his other Dropsie Avenue books, such as A Life Force. Analysis The stories share themes of disillusionment and frustration over thwarted desires. Frimme Hersh grieves over the death of his daughter, which he perceives as a breach of his contract with God; street singer Eddie returns to insignificance when he finds himself unable to find his would-be benefactor; Goldie's and Willie's romantic ideals are disillusioned after her near-rape and his seduction. Violence also ties the stories together; Eddie's wife-beating is mirrored by the beating Willie's seductress receives from her husband. Rosie steals the superintendent's money box in \\"The Super\\". Panels lack traditional frames and characters are neither simply good nor evil. The characters are depicted neither as purely good or evil: for example, Rosie in \\"The Super\\" triumphs over the racist, abusive superintendent by stealing his money, having him framed for pedophilia, and driving him to suicide. Confinement is a prominent theme; Eisner chooses perspectives through which the reader views the characters framed by doorways, window frames, or sheets of rain. Frimme Hersh seeks freedom from oppressive Eastern European antisemitism; there is a feeling of elation for characters in the final story as they find their way out of the tenement's, and the city's, confinement. According to academic Derek Royal, Jewish ethnicity is prominent throughout the stories; in \\"A Contract with God\\" and \\"Cookalein\\", religious and cultural Jewish symbolry are prominent, though in the middle two stories, there is little outward evidence of the characters' Jewishness. The two outer stories further emphasize Jewish identity with the extra-urban portions of their settings—the rural Russian origin of the religious Hersh in \\"Contract\\", and the Catskill mountains in \\"Cookalein\\", a retreat commonly associated with Jews in the 20th century. Eisner deals with representing Jewish identity through community. He juxtaposes individual stories and individual characters, who have different experiences which may be incompatible with one another; this confounds any single definition of \\"Jewishness\\", though there is a communal sense that binds these characters and their Jewishness together. Royal argues that Eisner shows the unresolved nature of American identity, in which ethnicities are conflicted between cultural assimilation and their ethnic associations. As the book progresses, the characters move from overt Jewishness to greater levels of assimilation, presented as an ambivalent change that has costs of its own. Royal argued that the book was not only important to comics studies, but also to the study of Jewish and ethnic American literature. Much like short story cycles common to contemporary Jewish prose, in which stories can stand alone, but complement each other when read as a loosely integrated package, Royal wrote that Contract could be better described as a \\"graphic cycle\\" rather than a \\"graphic novel\\". He wrote that such cycles, as well as Eisner's, emphasized a heterogeneous multiplicity of perspectives, as \\"o American ethnic literature can ever be defined monolithically\\". Art critic Peter Schjeldahl saw the \\"over-the-topness\\" endemic to American comics, and Eisner's work, as \\"ill suited to serious subjects, especially those that incorporate authentic social history\\". The work has been criticized for its use of stereotypical imagery; writer Jeremy Dauber countered that these images reflect Eisner's own memories of his youth and the strictures that Jewish people felt in the tenements. Others said caricaturized character designs conflicted with the otherwise realism of the stories; the appropriateness of the style was defended by others, such as Dennis O'Neil, who said that they better reflect the impressionistic way a child remembers the past. Holocaust writer Elie Wiesel made God's duty to uphold the first commandment the subject of the play The Trial of God (1979). The concept of a contract or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion. The idea that God must uphold his end of the first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel's play The Trial of God (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz. To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder's quoted in the Pirkei Avot: \\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?\\" Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. She wrote that \\"the suffering of the righteous\\" is \\"one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought\\", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching. Publication history The book took two years to finish. Eisner worked through a variety of approaches and styles, and toyed with using color, overlays, or washes, before settling on a hard-lined style printed in sepia. As he had no deadline, he reworked and resequenced the stories until he was satisfied. Eisner intended A Contract with God to have an adult audience, and wanted it to be sold in bookstores rather than comic shops; as such, he turned down an offer from Denis Kitchen to publish it. Though he had contacts at Bantam Books, he knew they would be uninterested in publishing comics. To secure a meeting with editor Oscar Dystel there, he called the book a \\"graphic novel\\". When Dystel discovered that the book was actually comics, he told Eisner Bantam would not publish it, but a smaller publisher might. Baronet Press, a small New York publishing house, agreed to publish A Contract with God, which bears the credit \\"Produced by Poorhouse Press\\" of \\"White Plains, N.Y.\\" on its indicia page. Eisner had originally intended to call the book Tenement Stories, Tales from the Bronx, or A Tenement in the Bronx but Baronet titled it A Contract with God, after the lead story, as the term \\"tenement\\" was not widely known outside the eastern US. The trade paperback carried the term \\"graphic novel\\", though it is a collection of stories rather than a novel. As Baronet was not financially sound, Eisner loaned it money to ensure the book was published. Sales were initially poor, but demand increased over the years. Kitchen Sink Press reissued the book in 1985, as did DC Comics in 2001 as part of its Will Eisner Library; and W. W. Norton collected it in 2005 as The Contract with God Trilogy in a single volume with its sequels, A Life Force (1988) and Dropsie Avenue (1995). The Norton edition, and subsequent stand-alone editions of Contract, included extra final pages to the stories. , at least eleven translations have been published, including in Yiddish (Lambiek, 1984), a language which would have been common with many of the characters in the book. Dark Horse Books published Will Eisner’s A Contract with God Curator’s Collection in 2018. This two-volume edition reprints the entire graphic novel at 1:1 size from the original pencil art in one volume and from the original ink art in the second volume. It was nominated for two Eisner Awards in 2019, with editor/designer John Lind winning one award for “Best Presentation.” =Editions= *1978 Baronet Books, (hardcover), (trade paperback) *1985 Kitchen Sink Press, (softcover), (hardcover limited to 600 copies with a tipped-in plate by Eisner) *2001 DC Comics, (Will Eisner Library) *2005 W.

A number of book-length comics preceded Contract, at least as far back as Milt Gross's He Done Her Wrong (1930). A Contract with God attracted greater attention than these previous efforts partly due to Eisner's greater status in the comics community. It is considered a milestone in American comics history not only for its format, but also for its literary aspirations and for having dispensed with typical comic-book genre tropes. Eisner continued to produce graphic novels in a third phase to his cartooning career that ultimately lasted longer than either his periods in comic books or in educational comics. According to comics historian R. Fiore, Eisner's work as a graphic novelist also maintained his reputation as \\"a contemporary figure rather than a relic of the dim past\\". A Contract with God brought greater status within the comics community to Will Eisner. Editor N. C. Christopher Couch considered the book's physical format to be Eisner's major contribution to the graphic novel form—few in comic book publishing had experience in bookmaking, whereas Eisner gained intimate familiarity with the process during his time at American Visuals. The book succeeded in getting into bookstores, though initial sales amounted to a few thousand copies in its first year; stores had difficulty finding an appropriate section in which to shelve it. It was put on display at the Brentano's bookstore in Manhattan, and reportedly sold well. Eisner visited the store to find out how the book was faring after being taking down from display. The manager told him it had been placed in the religious section, and then in humor, but customers had raised concerns that the book did not belong in those sections. The manager gave up and put the book in storage in the cellar. Early reviews were positive. The book's marketing consisted initially of word-of-mouth and in fanzines and trade periodicals, as mainstream newspapers and magazines did not normally review comics at the time. Comic book writer Dennis O'Neil called Contract \\"a masterpiece\\" that exceeded his expectations. O'Neil wrote that the combination of words and images mimicked the experience of remembering more accurately than was possible with pure prose. O'Neil's review originally appeared in The Comics Journal, and was used to preface later editions of Eisner's book. Critic Dale Luciano called the book a \\"perfectly and exquisitely balanced ... masterpiece\\", and praised Kitchen Sink Press for reprinting such a \\"risky project\\" in 1985. Eisner's status as a cartoonist grew after A Contract with God appeared, and his influence was augmented by his time as a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in New York, where he expounded his theories of the medium. He later turned his lectures into the books Comics and Sequential Art (1985)—the first book in English on the formalities and of the comics medium—and Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative (1995). As Eisner's social esteem grew, a distinction developed among publishers between Eisner's pre– and post-graphic novel work; highbrow publishers such as W. W. Norton have reissued his graphic novel work, while his superhero Spirit work has been reprinted by publishers with less social esteem such as DC Comics. The Comics Journal placed the book in 57th place on its \\"Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century\\" list, which called it \\"the masterpiece of one of the medium's first true artists\\". Cartoonist Dave Sim praised the book and wrote that he reread it frequently, but called it \\"a bit illegitimate\\" to use the term \\"graphic novel\\" for works of such brevity; he stated he could read the book in \\"twenty to thirty minutes\\", which he argued amounted to \\"the equivalent of a twenty-page short story\\". Adaptations On July 24, 2010, at the San Diego Comic-Con International, producers Darren Dean, Tommy Oliver, Bob Schreck, Mike Ruggerio, and Mark Rabinowitz announced plans for a film adaptation of A Contract with God from a script by Darren Dean, with a different director for each of the four stories.

Environmental issues are in some cases quantitatively measurable, but other properties are qualitative e.g.: environmentally friendly manufacturing, responsibility for the entire life of a product (from the raw-material till scrap), attitudes towards safety, efficiency, and minimum waste production. Ethical issues are closely related to environmental and human issues, and may be covered in corporate governance. Child labour and illegal dumping of waste are examples of ethical issues.

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the American football team of the University of Toledo Rockets. It is located on the school's Bancroft campus, just south of the banks of the Ottawa River. Known for its blend of old and new, it retains the traditional stonework around the field throughout all its expansions. History Originally known as University Stadium, it was completed in 1937 at a cost of only $313,558 as a Works Progress Administration project. Originally the natural seating bowl held 8,000 in two sideline grandstands. There was a grass hill at the south end of the stadium, and at the open (north) end of the bowl were two stone towers (still standing), that served as makeshift housing for the football team in its early years. Following World War II, the stadium was renovated, with many glass elements. Because of this, and the city's concentration on the industry, the stadium was renamed the Glass Bowl in 1946. South end zone stands were added in 1966, and further expansion came following Toledo's 35-game win streak from 1969 to 1971, bringing capacity up to 18,500. In 1999, the Toledo-based Ohio Cannon of the Regional Football League played at various stadiums, including the Glass Bowl, but did not finish the season.http://www.bcsn.tv/news_article/show/372539 The stadium hosted the 2001 MAC Championship Game. =Renovations= In 1990, the stadium had its largest expansion take place, adding a second level of seats to both sidelines. As part of the $18.5 million renovations, a three-story press box, 45 luxury suites, a 400-seat Stadium Club, sports information offices, and the Larimer Athletic Complex were built. The three-story press box, the second largest in the nation, was the greatest improvement in terms of upgrades, as the former press box was barely long and could only hold approximately 50 people. Further improvements include a video scoreboard in the north end zone in 1999, and the upgrade to a Field Turf playing surface in 2008. A new video board was installed in 2010. In 2016, a $3.5 million renovation took place, including replacement of the field turf, changes to the facade, updating concessions, restrooms, locker rooms, and ticket booths, as well as other minor cosmetic changes to the stadium. Attendance The largest crowd in Glass Bowl history for a University of Toledo football game was 36,852 for a game against the United States Naval Academy on October 27, 2001. =Attendance records= # 36,852 vs. Navy (2001) # 36,502 vs. Northern Illinois (2001) # 34,950 vs. Minnesota (2001) # 34,900 vs. Marshall (2000) # 33,040 vs. Indiana State (1994) # 32,726 vs. Weber State (2000) # 31,981 vs. Bowling Green (2004) # 31,711 vs. Pittsburgh (2003) # 31,458 vs. Bowling Green (1994) # 31,369 vs. Bowling Green (1982) Features In 1961, the University of Toledo procured a genuine rocket from the U.S. Army missile program. The one-ton rocket, which sits outside the Glass Bowl — aimed to hit the 50-yard line of arch-rival Bowling Green's Doyt Perry Stadium — carries two sets of fins and a propellant booster capable of guiding the missile to supersonic velocity.

The music was composed by Arkady Ostrovsky and the lyrics written by Lev Oshanin. Korney Chukovsky, a writer and immensely popular children's poet, later wrote that the inspiration for the song had been the four lines of the refrain, which were composed in 1928 by the four-year-old boy Kostya Barannikov. The song was first performed in the Good Morning! () radio show in July 1962 by Maya Kristalinskaya. Performed in 1963 at the Sopot International Song Festival by Tamara Miansarova, the song earned her first prize there and immediately became popular throughout the USSR and in other countries too. It was frequently sung by Young Pioneers at their camps and school meetings, as well as by Little Octobrists in primary schools, and even by pre-school children. The song was widely regarded in the Soviet Union as expressing the people's desire for peace.  Lyrics  The song expresses the yearning for lasting peace by millions of people, young and old. In war, the lyrics say, there are no winners. For our sake, and especially for our children's sake, we must achieve peace and remove the dark clouds that now cover the sun.  International versions  The song was translated into English by Tom Botting. The song (or at least its chorus) has been sung in English by Pete Seeger, and is featured on the live album Together in Concert recorded in 1975 with Arlo Guthrie.Together in Concert Rising Son Records ASIN B00075JYCS The song was translated into German by Ilse and Hans Naumilkat and Manfred Streubel (as \\"Immer lebe die Sonne\\") and was popular among Ernst Thälmann Pioneers. The song was also very popular among Finnish Pioneers as \\"Paistaa aurinko aina\\". Hebrew lyrics were written for the song by composer Gidi Koren. It was recorded (Hebrew title: אלוהים שמור על אמא) and made popular by his Israeli folk group, The Brothers and the Sisters.האחים והאחיות  In popular culture  The tune was used for the song \\"Gabrielle\\" by the Hootenanny Singers, led by Björn Ulvaeus. When this version became a hit song in 1964, the lyrics were translated and performed by the group in Swedish, German, Finnish, Italian, Dutch, and English. Raffi sang the original chorus and translations into English, Spanish and French on his album Let's Play. There is also an instrumental outro of the other song's title after this song. This song was included in a medley during the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.

This is one geometry for which the bond angles surrounding the central atom are not identical (see also pentagonal bipyramid), because there is no geometrical arrangement with five terminal atoms in equivalent positions. Examples of this molecular geometry are phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5), and phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) in the gas phase. Axial (or apical) and equatorial positions Trigonal bipyramidal molecular shape ax = axial ligand (on unique axis) eq = equatorial ligand (in plane perpendicular to unique axis) The five atoms bonded to the central atom are not all equivalent, and two different types of position are defined. For phosphorus pentachloride as an example, the phosphorus atom shares a plane with three chlorine atoms at 120° angles to each other in equatorial positions, and two more chlorine atoms above and below the plane (axial or apical positions). According to the VSEPR theory of molecular geometry, an axial position is more crowded because an axial atom has three neighboring equatorial atoms (on the same central atom) at a 90° bond angle, whereas an equatorial atom has only two neighboring axial atoms at a 90° bond angle. For molecules with five identical ligands, the axial bond lengths tend to be longer because the ligand atom cannot approach the central atom as closely. As examples, in PF5 the axial P−F bond length is 158 pm and the equatorial is 152 pm, and in PCl5 the axial and equatorial are 214 and 202 pm respectively. In the mixed halide PF3Cl2 the chlorines occupy two of the equatorial positions, indicating that fluorine has a greater apicophilicity or tendency to occupy an axial position. In general ligand apicophilicity increases with electronegativity and also with pi-electron withdrawing ability, as in the sequence Cl < F < CN. Both factors decrease electron density in the bonding region near the central atom so that crowding in the axial position is less important. Related geometries with lone pairs The VSEPR theory also predicts that substitution of a ligand at a central atom by a lone pair of valence electrons leaves the general form of the electron arrangement unchanged with the lone pair now occupying one position. For molecules with five pairs of valence electrons including both bonding pairs and lone pairs, the electron pairs are still arranged in a trigonal bipyramid but one or more equatorial positions is not attached to a ligand atom so that the molecular geometry (for the nuclei only) is different. The seesaw molecular geometry is found in sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4) with a central sulfur atom surrounded by four fluorine atoms occupying two axial and two equatorial positions, as well as one equatorial lone pair, corresponding to an AX4E molecule in the AXE notation. A T-shaped molecular geometry is found in chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), an AX3E2 molecule with fluorine atoms in two axial and one equatorial position, as well as two equatorial lone pairs. Finally, the triiodide ion () is also based upon a trigonal bipyramid, but the actual molecular geometry is linear with terminal iodine atoms in the two axial positions only and the three equatorial positions occupied by lone pairs of electrons (AX2E3); another example of this geometry is provided by xenon difluoride, XeF2. Berry pseudorotation Isomers with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry are able to interconvert through a process known as Berry pseudorotation. Pseudorotation is similar in concept to the movement of a conformational diastereomer, though no full revolutions are completed. In the process of pseudorotation, two equatorial ligands (both of which have a shorter bond length than the third) \\"shift\\" toward the molecule's axis, while the axial ligands simultaneously \\"shift\\" toward the equator, creating a constant cyclical movement. Pseudorotation is particularly notable in simple molecules such as phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5).

Biography Medary attended the University of Pennsylvania for one year before joining the Philadelphia architecture firm of Frank Miles Day in 1891. While at the university, he entered a student competition and designed, (with Frank Miles Day and William C. Hays), the 1894 student union, Houston Hall. Credit for this design, however, was given to a faculty member, Frank Miles Day with Medary listed as an associate architect. Medary remained with Frank Miles Day until 1894, when he founded his own firm in Philadelphia, Field & Medary. That firm would become Zantzinger, Borie & Medary in 1910. He was employed in 1904 to rehabilitate Solitude Farm in West Whiteland Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Note: This includes Medary began design work in 1908 on the Washington Memorial Chapel in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Its exterior was completed in 1917 and its interior in 1921, under Zantzinger, Borie & Medary. He designed the Fiske Portal (1922–23), a new doorway for St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Philadelphia. Sculptor and cabinetmaker Edward Maene, metalworker Samuel Yellin, and stained glass designer Nicola D'Ascenzo collaborated on the doors and the polychromed \\"Christ in Majesty\\" tableau above them. His firm designed the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company Building (1926–28) in Philadelphia (now an annex of the Philadelphia Museum of Art), and the Bok Singing Tower (1927–29), in Lake Wales, Florida. Medary was a design consultant to several universities, the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association, and Mount Vernon. His buildings include the Pennsylvania Athletic Club, Bryn Mawr Hospital, and, with Paul Cret, the Detroit Institute of Arts. Medary served as chairman of the Department of Labor's Housing Corporation during World War I and was selected in 1927 by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon to serve on the Board of Architectural Consultants, which advised the department on the design of the Federal Triangle development. Medary served on the National Capital Park and Planning Commission and on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C.; he was president of both the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and its Philadelphia chapter, a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and was affiliated with the Foundation for Architecture and Landscape Architecture and with the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Medary was honored by the AIA with a gold medal in 1929 and by the Philadelphia Art Club with a gold medal in 1927, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania in 1927.Thomas E.

Duties The Commissioner is in charge of regulating MPs' conduct and propriety.Parliaments in Paris and London \\"have strongly focused on the 'reputational sanction' as a way for the discovery of the violation of the ethical-deontological standards of conduct of the parliamentarian. The institution of authorities outside the Parliament has become the way in which those systems have tried to prevent judicial enforcement: both the English Commissioner and the French déontologue (for some years, starting in 2011, appointed by the Bureau de l'Assemblée nationale) refer to the internal bodies of the respective Parliaments, which are responsible for evaluating any sanctions\\": Giampiero Buonomo, Su due sentenze della sesta sezione penale della Cassazione in tema di corruzione e parlamentari, Diritto pubblico europeo rassegna online, aprile 2019, p. 14. One of the Commissioner's main tasks is overseeing the Register of Members' Financial Interests, which is intended to ensure disclosure of financial interests that may be of relevance to MPs' work. He or she is appointed by a Resolution of the House of Commons, and works a four-day week. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is appointed by a Resolution of the House of Commons for a fixed term of 5 years and is an independent officer of the House. The remit of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards does not extend to the House of Lords: the post of Lords Commissioner for Standards was created in 2010. The current Commissioner is Kathryn Stone OBE.  History  The post was established in 1995 with Sir Gordon Downey as the first Commissioner, serving the newly formed Committee for Standards and Privileges. He investigated the Cash-for-questions affair. The second Commissioner was Elizabeth Filkin (1999–2002), whose first case involved Peter Mandelson and a large loan which he had failed to declare in the Register of Members' Interests. Her departure was controversial, with some people, notably Peter Oborne, claiming that high-profile MPs had effectively forced her out because they did not like her investigating them, although her job required it. The next Commissioner was Sir Philip Mawer. MPs he investigated include George Galloway and Derek Conway. He avoided investigating high-level MPs such as cabinet ministers. Unlike his predecessor he was appointed to a second term, but he did not complete it; he took up a new post at the beginning of 2008 as an independent adviser on Ministerial Standards to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. John Lyon, CB, was Commissioner from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012. In an article about Lyon's questioning by the parliamentary enquiry into MPs' expenses, Private Eye described him as \\"feeble\\" and an \\"establishment stooge\\". Kathryn Hudson served as Commissioner from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2017. The current Commissioner, Kathryn Stone OBE, began her tenure on 1 January 2018.

During a career that spanned more than 60 years, he performed not only in feature films but also in scores of television series, as well as appearing on various country music programs and talk shows. Television audiences, however, perhaps most closely associate Best with his role as the bumbling Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane in the action-comedy series The Dukes of Hazzard, which originally aired on CBS between 1979 and 1985. He reprised the role in 1997 and 2000 for the made-for-television movies The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! and The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood (2000). Early years Best was born on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, to Lark and Lena Guy. His mother was the sister of Ike Everly, the father of the pop duo The Everly Brothers. After his mother died of tuberculosis in 1929, then three-year-old James was sent to live in an orphanage. He was later adopted by Armen Best (1897–1984) and his wife, Essa Myrtle ( Knowland; 1896–1988) and went to live with them in Corydon, Indiana. Best served in the United States Army in World War II, training in 1944 in Biloxi, Mississippi, as a gunner on a B-17 bomber; but by the time he completed his training the war had almost ended, so he was assigned to the army's law enforcement section. In the military police, as an \\"MP\\", Best served in war-torn Germany immediately after the Nazi government's surrender in May 1945. While stationed in Germany, Best soon transferred from the military police to an army unit of actors, who traveled around Europe performing plays for troops. Those experiences formed the beginning of his acting career.Best, James and Jim Clark (2009). Best in Hollywood: The Good, The Bad, And The Beautiful, chapter three. Albany, New York: BearManor Media, 2009. . Film career Best began his contract career in 1949 at Universal Studios, where he met fellow actors Julie Adams, Piper Laurie, Tony Curtis, Mamie Van Doren and Rock Hudson. Initially, he performed in several uncredited roles for Universal, such as in the 1950 film One Way Street, but credited performances soon followed that same year in the Westerns Comanche Territory, Winchester '73, and Kansas Raiders. Work in that genre continued to be an important part of his ongoing film career, including roles in The Cimarron Kid (1952), Seven Angry Men (1955) in which he portrays one of the sons of abolitionist John Brown, Last of the Badmen (1957), Cole Younger Gunfighter (1958), Ride Lonesome (1959), The Quick Gun (1964), and Firecreek (1968). Yet Best's film roles are not limited to Westerns. He also stars in the 1959 science fiction cult movie The Killer Shrews and in its 2012 sequel Return of the Killer Shrews, as Rhidges in the 1958 film adaptation of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead, as Carter in the James Stewart classic Shenandoah, as Dr. Ben Mizer in the 1966 comedy Three on a Couch, and as the cross-dressing Dewey Barksdale in the 1976 drama Ode to Billy Joe. Television Best with Andy Griffith on CBS's The Andy Griffith Show (1961) Best guest-starred more than 280 times in various television series. In 1954, he played the outlaw Dave Ridley, opposite Gloria Winters as the female bandit \\"Little Britches\\" in an episode of Stories of the Century. In 1954, Best appeared twice on the syndicated Annie Oakley series, starring Gail Davis and Brad Johnson. In 1955, he played Jim Blake on The Lone Ranger, Season 4, Episode 47, along with Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels. He was cast in the religion anthology series Crossroads, in its 1956 episode \\"The White Carnation.\\" He was also cast on an episode of Jackie Cooper's early NBC sitcom The People's Choice and in the David Janssen crime drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective. Best with Laura Devon (center) and Anne Francis in The Twilight Zone episode \\"Jess-Belle\\" (1963) Best made four appearances on the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days. His first role was as miner \\"Tiny\\" Stoker in the 1955 episode, \\"Million Dollar Wedding\\". In the story line, Stoker, in a bet with two of his cohorts, proposes marriage to a presumably plain woman in their community, Aggie Filene (played by Virginia Lee, an actress who lived from 1924 to 2008). Soon, though, the couple falls madly in love with each other and go on a world-wide honeymoon tour with proceeds from a gold strike that they had nearly forfeited. And Aggie returns to the mining camp as a beautiful woman. In 1960, Best appeared in the episode \\"Love on Credit\\" of CBS's anthology series, The DuPont Show with June Allyson. The same year, he guest-starred on The Andy Griffith Show as \\"The Guitar Player\\" (Season 1, Episode 3 and 31). He starred in three episodes of The Twilight Zone including \\"The Grave\\" (Season 3, Episode 7), \\"The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank,\\" (Season 3, Episode 23) and \\"Jess-Belle\\" (Season 4, Episode 7). In 1961 he guest-starred in the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \\"Make My Death Bed\\". In 1963, he was cast as the courageous Wisconsin game warden, Ernie Swift, in the episode \\"Open Season\\" of another CBS anthology series, GE True, hosted by Jack Webb. In the storyline, Swift faces the reprisal of organized crime after he tickets gangster Frank MacErlane (David McLean) for illegal fishing. In 1962, he played the part of Art Fuller in the episode \\"Incident of El Toro\\" on CBS's Rawhide; and in 1963, he returned to play Willie Cain in the episode \\"Incident at Spider Rock.\\" Best made two guest appearances on Perry Mason. In 1963 he played title character Martin Potter in \\"The Case of the Surplus Suitor,\\" and in 1966 he played defendant and oilman Allan Winford in \\"The Case of the Unwelcome Well.\\" He appeared on a long list of other television series in the 1950s and 1960s, including Wagon Train (three times), Laramie (three times), The Adventures of Kit Carson (twice as Henry Jordan), the western anthology series Frontier (twice), The Rebel, Bonanza, Sheriff of Cochise, Pony Express, Rescue 8, The Texan, Gunsmoke, Have Gun – Will Travel, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Tombstone Territory, Whispering Smith, Trackdown, The Rifleman, Cheyenne, Stagecoach West, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Overland Trail, Bat Masterson, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Combat!, The Green Hornet (\\"Deadline For Death\\"), The Mod Squad, I Spy, and The Fugitive. 1964-65 Flipper - the dolphin communication researcher episode =The Dukes of Hazzard= Best played Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on CBS's The Dukes of Hazzard from the debut of the program in 1979 until the end of the series in 1985. That role was Best's most visible success. He later revealed that the caricature-like persona of Sheriff Coltrane was developed from a voice he used when playing with his young children.James Best Interview  Part 7: How James Got Started on The Dukes of Hazzard, youtube.com; accessed September 2, 2015. On set, Best was particularly close to Sorrell Booke, who played the character of Boss Hogg, who was both the boss and the brother-in- law of Rosco. The two actors became close friends; and according to interviews by the series' creators, the two often improvised their scenes together, making up their own dialogue as they went along. Until his death, he also remained close to Catherine Bach, who played the character of Daisy Duke; and long after the show's cancellation, she was a regular visitor to the website dedicated to Best's painting.Catherine Bach profile, mtv.com; accessed April 7, 2015. =Later television career= In 1991, in contrast to the comical Rosco Coltrane of The Dukes of Hazzard, Best appeared in an episode of the NBC crime drama In the Heat of the Night. He won a Florida Crystal Reel Award for Best Actor, for his portrayal of Nathan Bedford in the episode \\"Sweet, Sweet Blues,\\" playing a retired sheriff and repentant killer. In August 2008, Best was presented the Florida Motion Picture and Television Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. Artist, teacher, writer, and other activities Best later moved to Florida and taught at the University of Central Florida (Orlando). After semi-retiring, he administered a production company and accepted occasional acting roles. He also developed a reputation as an artist for his paintings of landscapes, scenes from The Dukes of Hazzard, and other subjects. Later, after residing for a while on Lake Murray near Columbia, South Carolina, he moved once again, this time to Hickory, North Carolina. An acting coach too, Best taught drama and acting techniques for more than 25 years in Los Angeles. He also served as artist-in-residence and taught drama at the University of Mississippi (Oxford) for two years prior to his stint on The Dukes of Hazzard. In 2009, he completed his autobiography Best in Hollywood: The Good, The Bad and The Beautiful. The book, published in 2009 through BearManor Media, premiered at the Mid Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Aberdeen, Maryland. On November 9, 2014, Best and fellow actor Robert Fuller (along with their wives) attended the 100th birthday celebration of lifelong friend and fellow actor Norman Lloyd. Best said, \\"I had the honor to have been directed by Norman in a Hitchcock episode called \\"The Jar.\\" Having worked with hundreds of directors in my career, I found very few that had Norman's qualities. He was most kind, gracious and patient with his actors. He is in all respects a complete gentleman in his personal life and I found it a genuine pleasure just to be in the presence of such a talented man. I am also doubly honored to consider him my friend. We are so blessed to have such a man among us for so long.\\"Best comments on Norman Lloyd , yesweekly.com; accessed April 7, 2015. Personal life Best had a son, Gary, with his first wife. In 1959, Best married his second wife, Jobee Ayers. The couple had two daughters, Janeen and Jojami, before divorcing in 1977. Janeen is an actress, screenwriter and producer, first as Janeen Best then as Janeen Damian, after her 1998 marriage to actor and producer Michael Damian. Best married his third wife, Dorothy Collier, in 1986. He had 3 grandchildren. He enjoyed a wide range of hobbies and interests. He was an accomplished painter, a guitarist, a black belt in karate, enjoyed writing, and ran his own acting school. His students included Lindsay Wagner, Roger Miller, Glen Campbell, Quentin Tarantino, and Regis Philbin. He was also an animal rights advocate. Death Best died on April 6, 2015, in Hickory, North Carolina, from complications of pneumonia at the age of 88. Prior to his death, Best's former Dukes of Hazzard co-star and long-time friend, John Schneider, said; \\"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year.\\" He also added that, when asked to cry for the camera, \\"(Best) would say, 'sure thing, which eye?' I'm forever thankful to have cut my teeth in the company of such a fine man.\\" Nearly one year after Best's death, Schneider said about his working relationship with Best: \\"He was amazing in everything he did; he was not just a funny guy. In fact, I think the comedic timing came to him later on in life because before that he was a very serious actor. I was very fortunate to have grown up working with people like Jimmie Best and Denver Pyle and Sorrell Booke. Incredibly talented men, incredibly talented actors.\\" Filmography *One Way Street (1950) as Driver (uncredited) *Comanche Territory (1950) as Sam *I Was a Shoplifter (1950) as Police Broadcaster in Surveillance Plane (uncredited) *Winchester '73 (1950) as Crater *Peggy (1950) as Frank Addison *Kansas Raiders (1950) as Cole Younger *Target Unknown (1951) as Sgt.

History and seating On the north end of campus, the stadium opened in 1964 as Cougar Stadium, replacing a much smaller 5,000-seat venue of the same name. The first game on Friday night, October 2, was attended by 33,610, a state record. The original stadium, corresponding to the lower half of the current facility's grandstand seats, had a seating capacity was just over 28,800. Seating was soon added to make room for 35,000, and temporary bleachers in the end zones raised the capacity to 45,000. The stadium was expanded in 1982 to accommodate more than 65,000; permanent concrete stands in the end zones, separated by entryways from the east and west grandstands, were put in place of the temporary bleachers. The playing field was lowered , and the running track was removed to make room for six additional rows. LaVell Edwards (1930–2016) was the head coach at BYU for 29 seasons, preceded by ten years as an assistant. He retired after the 2000 season and the stadium was soon renamed in his honor. During the 2002 Olympics, the stadium's parking lot was used as a park and ride lot for guests attending events at the Peaks Ice Arena and Soldier Hollow. \\"BYU\\" seats of east grandstand and Y Mountain Looking southeast in 2004 West exterior in 2007 Lavell Edwards Stadium BYU =Renovations= The stadium was renovated in 2003 to provide additional luxury seating, which reduced the capacity to 64,045. The luxury seating was a noticeable addition because the arrangement of blue and white seats in this section spells out BYU in block letters. In 2008, BYU unveiled a new video board on the north end zone on August 30, allowing fans seated in the south end zone to see the instant replays and graphics which previously were shown only on the south board. In addition, a brand-new addition to the stadium was the Cougar Marching Band Hall, which included a large rehearsal room, uniform storage space, band offices, instrument lockers, and video screens that assist in rehearsals.https://news.byu.edu/news/byu-trumpets-100th-anniversary-cougar- marching-band-new-band-hall During the summer of 2010, the stadium's capacity was further reduced due to some renovations that allowed for more wheelchair accessibility. As of 2016, 63,470 is considered a sellout. The stadium underwent some upgrades before the 2012 season: new HD LED videoboards face the north and south end zones, replacing the outdated and smaller video screens, and they are flanked by video ribbons that stretch along the top of the north and south stands. The elevator shafts have been freshly coated to reflect the new BYU \\"blue\\" color scheme, each has the oval Y painted on it, and in 2013 the student section was unified into one area to seat the BYU student section instead of being scattered throughout the stadium. Track and field Prior to the 1982 expansion, it was the home venue for BYU's outdoor track and field teams and hosted the NCAA championships in 1967 and 1975.BYUCougars.com - LaVell Edwards Stadium A new track facility was built just south of the stadium and later named for Clarence F. Robison, the Cougars' legendary track coach. Jurassic fossils under the stadium Part of the largest collection of Jurassic period fossils in North America, housed at BYU, was stored underneath the east bleachers of the stadium until 2005. The fossils have since been prepared and are on display in the BYU Museum of Paleontology's collection room. Security Due to installation of new features in the stadium, the grounds crew and BYU Police have installed a number of security features to prevent students from entering the stadium after hours, including infrared security cameras and motion detectors. Anyone found entering the stadium after hours may be charged with trespassing and receive a fine up to $500.

Scheindlin (pronounced SHEND-lin; born 1946) is a retired United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Education Scheindlin was born in Washington, D.C. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Far Eastern Studies from the University of Michigan (1967), her Master of Arts in History from Columbia University (1969), and her Juris Doctor from Cornell Law School (1975). Pre- judicial career Before taking her seat on the Southern District, Scheindlin worked as a prosecutor, commercial lawyer, and judge. She was a clerk for federal district court judge Charles L. Brieant from 1976 to 1977 and, from 1977 to 1981, was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. From 1981 to 1982, she was General Counsel for the New York City Department of Investigation. Starting in 1982, and continuing through 1984, she served as special master in the Agent Orange mass tort litigation. She was an adjunct professor at Brooklyn Law School from 1983 to 1994. From 1992 to 1994, she was special master for another mass torts case involving property damaged by asbestos. As a commercial lawyer, Scheindlin worked for Stroock & Stroock & Lavan (1975–76), Budd, Larner, Gross, Rosenbaum, Greenberg & Sade (1986–90), and Herzfeld & Rubin, P.C. (1990–94). Federal judicial service She was nominated by President Bill Clinton on July 28, 1994, to a seat vacated by Louis J. Freeh (who went on to be the director of the FBI). The United States Senate confirmed her on September 28, 1994, and she was commissioned on September 29, 1994. On December 12, 2012, her judicial seat was filled by Lorna G. Schofield after Scheindlin took senior status. On March 23, 2016, she announced her intention to retire. She retired from the bench on April 29, 2016. Post-judicial career On May 2, 2016, Scheindlin returned to Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP, joining the Litigation Practice Group there as of counsel to the firm. She also offers her services as an arbitrator and mediator through JAMS. Tenure on federal bench Scheindlin's greatest influence has been in the field of electronic discovery. Scheindlin's decisions in Zubulake v. UBS Warburg were \\"so influential [the rulings were] partially absorbed into the recent civil procedure amendments [in 2006].\\"\\"Jason Krause, Rockin' Out the E-Law, A few federal judges are becoming stars as they create new e-discovery rules,\\" http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/rockin_out_the_e_law/ Notable rulings During her tenure, Scheindlin presided over a number of high-profile cases, many of which advanced important new positions in the interpretation of the United States Constitution or federal law. *In December 1997, New York magazine ran advertisements on 75 New York City buses along with a picture of Mayor Rudy Giuliani that said: \\"Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for.\\" Mayor Giuliani had a deputy call the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to complain that he had not given the magazine permission to use his name in its ad, and the ads were removed. The magazine sued the City, alleging that it was violating the magazine's First Amendment rights. The City's lawyers contended that the advertisements \\"irreparably harm[ed]' Mayor Giuliani's right to control how his name is used in advertising.\\" Judge Scheindlin held that the ads were \\"clearly a hybrid of commercial speech and political satire.\\" \\"Salting her opinion with mild sarcasm amid a methodical analysis of the constitutional protections afforded to commercial speech, the judge ordered the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to restore the advertisements immediately to the buses.\\" *In April 2002, in the case United States v. Osama Awadallah,See 202 F. Supp. 2d 55 (2002). after Awadallah testified before a grand jury that he had met with two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers, but could not remember their names, Scheindlin dismissed a perjury charge against him and found that Awadallah's prolonged detention without actual criminal charges was based on misrepresentations and omissions by the government and could not be justified under existing law. Her decision was reversed on appeal. *In February 2004, in the case Maurice Clarett v. National Football League,See 306 F. Supp. 2d 379 (2004). Scheindlin, accepting the antitrust-law arguments raised by counsel, ruled that the NFL could not bar Clarett from participating in the 2004 NFL Draft. This decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the case was not heard by the Supreme Court. *In April 2004, in the case Zubulake v. UBS Warburg,See 382 F. Supp. 2d 536 (2005); 231 F.R.D. 159 (2005). Scheindlin sanctioned UBS for not being able to complete their electronic discovery of potentially informative documents, and not complying with their litigation hold on the destruction of documents. This case has been seen as revolutionary in the legal realms of human resources and computer forensics, as the burden of proof was effectively shifted to the defendant for its inability to produce documents in a timely manner, and the presentation to the jury of an adverse inference. *Judge Scheindlin presided over three trials of John Gotti Jr. (\\"Junior\\"), each of which ended in a mistrial due to a deadlocked jury. The principal charge against Gotti in the trials was racketeering conspiracy stemming from Gotti's alleged management of the Gambino crime family following the incarceration and death of his father, John Gotti Sr. (the \\"Dapper Don\\"). \\"On September 20, 2005, a jury acquitted him of securities fraud and hung 11-1 for conviction on racketeering charges that included an assault on Curtis Sliwa. His re-trial on the remaining charges the following March also ended in a mistrial, with the jury hung 8-4 for acquittal. At the third trial involving the Sliwa assault, prosecutors convinced 12 jurors that Junior had ordered the kidnapping but failed to convince them that he had engaged in criminal activity after 1999 and the jury again deadlocked on the racketeering charges, this time voting 8-4 for conviction.\\" *In September 2006, Scheindlin ruled that Judith Clark, a Weather Underground radical serving 75 years to life for the murder of a Brinks guard and two police officers during a robbery, was entitled to a new trial because her Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. Scheindlin found Clark's right to counsel was violated even though the then-self-proclaimed revolutionary insisted on representing herself at trial, turned down legal counsel, boycotted much of the trial, and refused to recognize the court's authority. In January 2008, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously reversed Scheindlin's ruling and held that Clark was not denied her right to counsel because Clark \\"knowingly and intelligently exercised her constitutional right to make those choices.\\" *In January 2009, Judge Scheindlin ruled in SEC v Collins & Aikman, a case which addressed discovery obligations of the Government in civil litigation. The case opines that the government was obliged to search its own electronic data to produce responsive documents (versus providing a 10-million page data dump), submit materials allegedly covered by the deliberative process privilege to the Court for in camera review, and search its e-mail and attachments after cooperating with the plaintiff in the negotiation of an appropriate search protocol \\"designed to retrieve responsive information without incurring an unduly burdensome expense disproportionate to the size and needs of the case.\\" Notably, Judge Scheindlin held in this case that the burden rested with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to provide to the defendant the compilation of documents that supported the allegations in the Complaint, rather than passing the burden to the defendant to come up with \\"appropriate\\" search terms, especially since \\"the inaccuracy of such searches is by now relatively well known.\\" (In Footnote 39, she referenced TREC Legal Track and other studies that research and report on different search methodologies.) She concluded in this case that a government agency is subject to the \\"same discovery rules that govern private parties (albeit with the benefit of additional privileges such as deliberative process and state secrets)\\", thus ordering the SEC to produce documents as requested by the plaintiff. *On September 2, 2009, Judge Scheindlin ruled on whether credit rating agencies are protected by the First Amendment where the rating agencies have disseminated their ratings to a select group of investors rather than to the general public. \\"Judge Shira Scheindlin denied the rating agencies' motions to dismiss. Most significantly, Judge Scheindlin rejected the rating agencies' argument that their rating opinions were entitled to immunity under the First Amendment, and she also rejected their argument that their rating represented non-actionable opinion.\\" *In 2011, Judge Scheindlin presided over the trial and conviction of arms trafficker Viktor Bout. *In August 2013, Judge Scheindlin ruled that the New York City stop-and-frisk program was being applied in an unconstitutional manner, ordered immediate changes to the program, and called for a monitor to supervise related reforms. The case was Floyd v. City of New York. In October 2013, the Second Circuit stayed Scheindlin's decision, and removed her from the case for violating the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. On November 13, 2013, in response to a Motion filed by Judge Scheindlin seeking reconsideration of her removal from the case on remand, the motion panel of the Second Circuit that issued the Order of removal declined to permit Scheindlin to dispute her removal, but issued an opinion purporting to disavow its previous conclusion that she had \\"run afoul\\" of the Code of Conduct. Rather, the panel stated, \\"[w]e conclude only that, based on her conduct at the December 21, 2007 hearing and in giving the interviews to the news media in May 2013, Judge Scheindlin's appearance of impartiality may reasonably be questioned... and that 'reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice.'\\" *In December 2013, in Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 989 F. Supp. 2d 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), applying New York's faithless servant doctrine, she held that a hedge fund's employee engaging in insider trading in violation of his company's code of conduct, which also required him to report his misconduct, must repay his employer the full $31 million his employer paid him as compensation during his period of faithlessness. Judge Scheindlin called the insider trading the \\"ultimate abuse of a portfolio manager's position.\\" The judge also wrote: \\"\\"In addition to exposing Morgan Stanley to government investigations and direct financial losses, Skowron's behavior damaged the firm's reputation, a valuable corporate asset.\\" *In March 2014, she presided over and dismissed charges against Devyani Khobragade, a consulate employee arrested in December 2013 and charged with lying to investigators on the visa application for her domestic employee, finding that India's action in making her a full diplomat after the crime but before indictment gave her diplomatic immunity. Her arrest had sparked tensions between the U.S. and India. In perhaps her most significant case involving civil rights, after her Stop and Frisk decision, Judge Scheindlin certified a stipulated agreement between Governor Andrew Cuomo and the class action litigants Leroy Peoples. et. al. Peoples v. Fischer S.D.N.Y., Index No. 11 CIV 2964 SAS (now titled Peoples v. Annucci because the case lead to DOCCS Superintendent Fischer's resignation - (Mr. Anthony Annucci is \\"acting\\" commissioner)). This 80 million dollar settlement involves the misuse of solitary confinement by the New York Prison system, the Special Housing Unit (SHU), aka the Box.

They are similar in texture, but they are produced with different methods, making Oaxaca cheese more moist. It is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made. The string cheese process (pasta filata), originally from Italy, which is used to produce mozzarella, was brought to Mexico by the Dominican friars that settled in Oaxaca. As water buffalo milk was unavailable, they used cow's milk, instead. The cheese is available in several different shapes. The production process is complicated and involves stretching the cheese into long ribbons and rolling it up like a ball of yarn. Italian mozzarella is another cheese which is processed by stretching (the pasta filata process).

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Eastern Michigan University Eagles. Currently, the stadium has seating for 30,200 people. Standing room is available in the south end zone, allowing for crowds larger than the listed capacity. The stadium is located on the school's west campus, just south of the Huron River. History The stadium held its first game on September 27, 1969, when EMU upset the University of Akron, 10–3. It originally consisted of two opposite sideline stands around the field and running track. It is one of only two stadiums in the MAC which shares its football field with a running track (UB Stadium being the other). The stadium was named for the late Elton J. Rynearson, Sr., who coached football at Eastern Michigan for 26 seasons. His teams compiled a record of 114–58–15. In one six-year period, from 1925–30, Rynearson’s teams won 40 games, tied two, and lost just four. The largest attendance for an EMU game at Rynearson Stadium was 26,188 (87% of capacity), on November 28, 2008, for a 56–52 win over Central Michigan. =Renovations= In 1992, the seats were expanded south from each grandstand but not connected, giving the stadium the look of an unfinished horseshoe. This was done to conform to the new Division I-A rules for minimum stadium size. Originally a grass field, the field has been artificial since 1991 and was upgraded to FieldTurf in 2005. More recently, the original FieldTurf was replaced prior to the 2014 season by a new gray FieldTurf surface. This made Rynearson Stadium only the second Division I FBS stadium with a non-traditional field color (after Albertsons Stadium at Boise State) and the sixth college football stadium overall with this feature. Lighting was added in 1974, partially due to the Detroit Wheels of the World Football League using the stadium as their home field. The stadium has also hosted high school football games. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Olds/Marshall Track in Rynearson Stadium, with the Convocation Center in the background  The \\"home\\" (west) side of the stadium  The \\"away\\" (east) side of the stadium } See also * List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums References External links * Rynearson Stadium - EMUEagles.com * Official Eastern Michigan University school website Category:World Football League venues Category:American football venues in Michigan Category:College football venues Category:Eastern Michigan Eagles football Category:Buildings at Eastern Michigan University Category:Eastern Michigan Eagles Category:Sports venues completed in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in Michigan Category:College track and field venues in the United States Category:Sports venues in Washtenaw County, Michigan Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in Michigan ","title":"Rynearson Stadium"},{"id":"1901970","text":"UB Stadium is a stadium in Amherst, New York on the campus of the University at Buffalo. It is primarily used for football, soccer, and track and field events, and is the home field of the Buffalo Bulls. It opened on September 4, 1993, with a game against the University of Maine. The stadium was built from 1991 to 1993 as the final piece of the school's \\"Run to Division I\\" drive, meant to bring UB football back to Division I status and as the feature athletics venue for the 1993 Summer Universiade. The program had been dropped for seven years in the 1970s, but returned at a lower level. The team had played at a much smaller, 4,000-seat UB Stadium (now known as Walter Kunz Stadium) from the time of its move to the Town of Amherst north of Buffalo in 1985 until 1992. The current stadium opened in the summer of 1993, hosting the World University Games. The Bulls played their first six years in the stadium as a member of Division I-AA, finally making their return to Division I-A in 1999. The stadium consists of a north-south field surrounded by an eight-lane track. There are the original double-decked grandstands on either sideline spanning the entire length of the football field, a large bleacher grandstand around the south end of the track, and two shorter bleacher sections on the north side with the free-standing scoreboard located between them. The stadium is lit by the four large light towers near the corners of the stadium. Jim Kelly hosted his third-annual StarGaze charity event at the venue in 1994. The stadium was the primary venue for the 1995 World Masters Athletics Championships. The stadium hosted the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Empire State Games on July 21, 2010. Location and configuration The stadium is located at the east side of UB's North Campus. Students typically walk to the stadium from the Ellicott Complex, Greiner Hall, and the Governors Complex or take the UB Stampede buses directly to Alumni Arena, which is nearby. UB Stadium has a capacity of approximately 25,000. The sideline seating areas consist of two main grandstands which hold 15,000 (7,500 each). A large bleacher grandstand in the southern end of the stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 10,000. There is additional space on the north and south ends of the field level that is utilized as a standing room only space which accommodates approximately 3,000, though this is not factored into the capacity of the stadium. In 1999, the school added two rounded bleacher sections to UB stadium, raising the capacity to above 29,000. The southern section holds 10,000. Two half-sections were constructed in the north endzone, both with a capacity of 3,000 each (6,000 total). In October 2017, demolition work commenced on the northern endzones of the stadium in preparation for the program's new , $18 million field house.https://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/stories/2017/09/fieldhouse.html The demolition of the bleachers brought the stadium's capacity down to about 25,000.

He was best known as the eldest son of former Prime Minister and President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Since December 2001, he held the official position of Roving Ambassador and High Commissioner, representing Fiji's interests in Pacific Island nations. It was reported on 13 March 2006 that he had been chosen to succeed his late father as Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, but in 2009 the succession was still unclear, with Mara reportedly refusing to discuss the issue with the village elders.  Education and career  Mara graduated from New Zealand's University of Otago with an LLB (Law) degree in 1983. This was followed by an LLM (Master's degree in Law) from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom in 1986. Meanwhile, he had served as a Legal Officer in the Attorney General's Chamber from 1984, rising to Principal Legal Officer in 1986. In 1987, he was appointed Fiji's Chief Administrative Officer for Foreign Affairs, and in 1991 he became Chargé d'affaires at the Fijian Embassy in Washington, D.C.. Upon returning to Fiji, Mara was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 and served for a single term. During this time, he held Cabinet office as Minister for Fijian Affairs from 1997 to 1999, during which time he also served as Chairman of the Native Land Trust Board. He also led the Fijian Association Party from 1996 to 1998. In 1999 he was appointed to a diplomatic post, but returned to Fiji in the wake of the coup d'état that deposed his father from the Presidency in 2000. The following year, however, he took up his post as Roving Ambassador and High Commissioner. On 13 August 2005, Foreign Minister Kaliopate Tavola said that Mara was being considered as a possible successor to Ratu Tevita Momoedonu as Ambassador to Japan. Momoedonu's term was due to expire in September, and he had indicated that he wished to return to Fiji. In the end, Mara was not appointed, however. In 2006 Mara was appointed ambassador to the United States but did not take up the position. He was again appointed to the position in 2008. His departure from Fiji to take up the post was reportedly delayed by \\"internal processes\\" in the Ministry of foreign Affairs. The offer was eventually withdrawn with the government citing Mara's inability to meet a deadline due to protracted personal affairs. The Fijian ambassador to the United States as of December 2010 was Winston Thompson.  Tui Nayau candidate  On 18 March 2005, it was announced that five elders from his home island of Lakeba had visited him in Suva to invite him to succeed his late father as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands. Although not strictly hereditary, the title is traditionally held by a male in the chiefly Vuanirewa Clan, a tradition his father reportedly wanted upheld. One village elder, who chose not to be named, said that Mara had both the blood ties and the modern education expected of a Paramount Chief. \\"He is a high chief, whose parents are both paramount chiefs and have strong blood ties with all the chiefly households in Fiji and Tonga, is young and can look after his people,\\" the elder said. Others expressed disappointment, however, that the elders had gone public before Ratu Finau had made a final decision on accepting the invitation, saying that the publicity was an insult to him and the other children of the late Ratu Mara. As of July 2005, there was still no public announcement as to whether Mara had accepted the invitation to become the Tui Nayau, but his elder sister, Adi Ateca Ganilau, said that discussions between the family and the mataqali (clan) were ongoing. She said there was no time limit; her father had been installed only after three years of discussions. On 13 March 2006, the Fiji Village news service quoted Lau Provincial Council Chairman Ratu Josefa Basulu as saying that Mara had accepted an invitation from the chiefly Vuanirewa clan to succeed his late father as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of Lau. A date for installation had yet to be finalized, he said.  Personal life  Mara had two children (Ratu Salesi Kinikinilau Mara and Adi Lawedua Rokolubatilakeba Mara) with Vitinia Tualau Buadromo.

This genus was one of the earliest dinosaurs from the fossil record. Its name means \\"Herrera's lizard\\", after the rancher who discovered the first specimen in 1958 in South America. All known fossils of this carnivore have been discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation of Carnian age (late Triassic according to the ICS, dated to 231.4 million years ago) in northwestern Argentina. The type species, Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, was described by Osvaldo Reig in 1963 and is the only species assigned to the genus. Ischisaurus and Frenguellisaurus are synonyms. For many years, the classification of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, with the discovery of an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. It is a member of the Herrerasauridae, a family of similar genera that were among the earliest of the dinosaurian evolutionary radiation..  Description  Scale diagram showing the holotype specimen (red) and the largest-known specimen (gray), compared in size with a human Herrerasaurus was a lightly built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. Adults had skulls up to long and were up to in total length and in weight. Smaller specimens were half the size, with skulls only about long. Herrerasaurus was fully bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, indicating that it was likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were less than half the length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws. Herrerasaurus displays traits that are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most of the characteristics of dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main hip bone, is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus. Artist's impression Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked nearly all the specializations that characterized later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae and a pair of tiny, slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae. Herrerasaurus had a flexible joint in the lower jaw that could slide back and forth to deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible. Skeletal reconstruction According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be distinguished based on the following features: the presence of a premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% of the size of the humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium. According to Sereno (1993), Herrerasaurus can be distinguished based on the following features, all of which are unknown in other herrerasaurids: a circular pit is present on the humeral ectepicondyle, a feature also present in Saturnalia; a saddle-shaped ulnar condyle of the humerus, and the articular surface for the ulnare on the ulna is convex; the articular surface of the ulnare is smaller than that of the ulna, a feature unknown in Staurikosaurus and Sanjuansaurus; the centrale is placed distal to the radiale; a broad subnarial process of the premaxilla, and a broad supratemporal depression (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993); the basal tuber and the occipital condyle are subequal in width (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993).  History  Mounted cast, Senckenberg Museum of Natural History Herrerasaurus was named by paleontologist Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean goatherd who first noticed its fossils in outcrops near the city of San Juan, Argentina in 1959. These rocks, which later yielded Eoraptor, are part of the Ischigualasto Formation and date from the late Ladinian to early Carnian stages of the Late Triassic period. Reig named a second dinosaur from these rocks in the same publication as Herrerasaurus; this dinosaur, Ischisaurus cattoi, is now considered a junior synonym and a juvenile of Herrerasaurus. Reig believed Herrerasaurus was an early example of a carnosaur, but this was the subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified Herrerasaurus as a prosauropod. In 1972, Peter Galton classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond Saurischia. Later, using cladistic analysis, some researchers put Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus at the base of the dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian. Two other partial skeletons, with skull material, were named Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis by Fernando Novas in 1986, but this species too is now thought to be a synonym. Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis was discovered in 1975, and was described by Novas (1986) who considered it a primitive saurischian, and possibly a theropod. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) examined the Frenguellisaurus remains and found them referable to Herrerasaurus. Ischisaurus cattoi was discovered in 1960 and described by Reig in 1963. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) reviewed its remains and found them to be referable to Herrerasaurus. First known skull, specimen PVSJ 407, and left maxilla PVSJ 053 A complete Herrerasaurus skull was found in 1988, by a team of paleontologists led by Paul Sereno. Based on the new fossils, authors such as Thomas Holtz and José Bonaparte classified Herrerasaurus at the base of the saurischian tree before the divergence between prosauropods and theropods. However, Sereno favored classifying Herrerasaurus (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. These two classifications have become the most persistent, with Rauhut (2003) and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004) favoring the early theropod hypothesis, and Max Langer (2004), Langer and Benton (2006), and Randall Irmis and his coauthors (2007) favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis. If Herrerasaurus were indeed a theropod, it would indicate that theropods, sauropodomorphs, and ornithischians diverged even earlier than herrerasaurids, before the middle Carnian, and that \\"all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features, such as a more advanced ankle joint or an open acetabulum\\". This view is further supported by ichnological records showing large tridactyl (three-toed) footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur. These footprints date from the Ladinian (Middle Triassic) of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and predate Herrerasaurus by 3 to 5 million years. The study of early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor therefore has important implications for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.  Classification  Skull shown from above, showing temporal fenestrae Herrerasaurus was originally considered to be a genus within Carnosauria, which then included forms similar to Megalosaurus and Antrodemus (the latter is equivalent to Allosaurus), even though Herrerasaurus lived many millions of years before them and retained multiple primitive features. This carnosaurian classification was amended upon by Rozhdestvensky and Tatarinov in 1964, who classified Herrerasaurus within the family Gryponichidae inside Carnosauria. The same year, Walker published a differing opinion that Herrerasaurus instead was allied with Plateosauridae, although it differed in possessing a pubic boot. Walker also proposed that Herrerasaurus may instead be close to Poposaurus (now considered a pseudosuchian) and the unnamed theropod from the Dockum Group of Texas (now assigned to the rauisuchian Postosuchus). In 1985, Charig noted that Herrerasaurus was of uncertain classification, showing similarities to both \\"prosauropods\\" and \\"carnosaurians\\". Romer (1966), simply noted that Herrerasaurus was a prosauropod possibly within Plateosauridae. In the description of Staurikosaurus, Colbert noted that there were many similarities between his taxon and Herrerasaurus, but classified them in separate families, with Herrerasaurus in Teratosauridae. In 1970, Bonaparte also proposed similarities between Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus, and while classifying them both clearly as in Saurischia, he stated that they appeared as though they could not be placed in a current family. This was further supported by Benedetto in 1973, who named for the taxa the new family Herrerasauridae, which he classified as saurischians, possibly within Theropoda but not in Sauropodomorpha. However, in 1977 Galton proposed that Herrerasauridae only included Herrerasaurus, and found it to be Saurischian incertae sedis. Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, Herrerasaurus has at times been considered basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered it to be inside Dinosauria. They supported this on the basis that Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the plesiomorphies state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus and all its descendants. A differing definition of Herrerasaurus but not Passer domesticus first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, Herrerasauria was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as Herrerasaurus but not Liliensternus or Plateosaurus by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae. Life restoration In a revision of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed the definition of the clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria. A later 1994 study by Novas instead classified Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas found that the primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, and found that it was much more likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia. In 2010, Alcocer and Martinez described a new taxon of herrerasaurid, Sanjuansaurus. It could be distinguished from Herrerasaurus based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, Herrerasaurus, Sanjuansaurus and Staurikosaurus all were in a polytomy, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, Eoraptor and Guaibasaurus. In 2011, Martinez et al. described Eodromaeus, a basal theropod from the same formation as Herrerasaurus. In a phylogenetic analysis, Eoraptor was placed within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae was placed as the most basal theropods, and Eodromaeus was placed as the next most basal. A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt et al. (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with Eoraptor also being in an unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below. Herrerasaurus (large), Eoraptor (small), and Plateosaurus (skull), three early saurischians Other members of the clade may include Eoraptor from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as Herrerasaurus, Chindesaurus from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and possibly Caseosaurus from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, Alwalkeria from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of India, and Teyuwasu, known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted that it had been incorrectly suggested that Staurikosaurus pricei was a juvenile Herrerasaurus. This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile Herrerasaurus were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of Staurikosaurus.  Paleobiology  Natural History Museum in Milan The teeth of Herrerasaurus indicate that it was a carnivore; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized plant eaters. These might have included other dinosaurs, such as Pisanosaurus, as well as the more plentiful rhynchosaurs and synapsids. Herrerasaurus itself may have been preyed upon by giant rauisuchids like Saurosuchus; puncture wounds were found in one skull. Coprolites (fossilized dung) containing small bones but no trace of plant fragments, discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation, have been assigned to Herrerasaurus based on fossil abundance. Mineralogical and chemical analysis of these coprolites indicates that if the referral to Herrerasaurus was correct, this carnivore could digest bone. An artist's impression; feeding on a small synapsid Comparisons between the scleral rings of Herrerasaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 12 hand bones and 20 foot bones referred to Herrerasaurus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, pp. 331-336. PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone attributed by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits occurred on the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, it is likely that they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, pp. 337-363.  Paleoecology  Model depicted with prey The holotype of Herrerasaurus (PVL 2566) was discovered in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in San Juan, Argentina. It was collected in 1961 by Victorino Herrera, in sediments that were deposited in the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 235 to 231 million years ago. Over the years, the Ischigualasto Formation produced other fossils ultimately referred to Herrerasaurus. In 1958, A.S. Romer discovered specimen MCZ 7063, originally referred to Staurikosaurus in Carnian sediments. Herrerasaurus specimens PVL 2045 and MLP(4)61, were collected in 1959 and 1960, respectively, in sediments that were deposited in the Norian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. In 1960, Scaglia collected specimen MACN 18.060, originally the holotype of Ischisaurus cattoi, in sediments deposited in the Carnian stage. In 1961, Scaglia collected Herrerasaurus specimen PVL 2558, in the Carnian beds of this formation. In 1990, the Cancha de Bochas Member produced more Herrerasaurus specimens, also from its Carnian beds. Specimen PVSJ 53, originally the holotype of Frenguellisaurus, was collected by Gargiulo & Oñate in 1975 in sediments that were deposited in the Carnian stage. Although Herrerasaurus shared the body shape of the large carnivorous dinosaurs, it lived during a time when dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later Los Colorados Formation consisted mainly of a variety of crurotarsal archosaurs and synapsids. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% of the total number of fossils, but by the end of the Triassic Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number. Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. The climate was moist and warm, though subject to seasonal variations. Vegetation consisted of ferns (Cladophlebis), horsetails, and giant conifers (Protojuniperoxylon). These plants formed lowland forests along the banks of rivers. Herrerasaurus remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic South America alongside another early dinosaur, the one-meter-long Eoraptor, as well as Saurosuchus, a giant land-living rauisuchian (a quadrupedal meat eater with a theropod-like skull); the broadly similar but smaller Venaticosuchus, an ornithosuchid; and the predatory therapsid chiniquodontids. Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by rhynchosaurs such as Hyperodapedon (a beaked reptile); aetosaurs (spiny armored reptiles); and therapsids, including kannemeyeriid dicynodonts (stocky, front-heavy-beaked quadrupedal animals) such as Ischigualastia and traversodontid cynodonts (somewhat similar in overall form to dicynodonts, but lacking beaks) such as Exaeretodon.

The siege is now chiefly remembered for the introduction of the 'siege parallel' by French military engineer Vauban, a concept that remained in use until the middle of the twentieth century, the death of Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan, the hero of The Three Musketeers, and the English contingent including its commander the Duke of Monmouth and John Churchill (the future Duke of Marlborough).  Prelude  In the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured parts of the Spanish Netherlands and the entire Franche-Comté but was forced to relinquish the bulk of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle with the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. Before making another attempt to gain territory in the north, Louis XIV strengthened his diplomatic position by paying Sweden to remain neutral, while England agreed an alliance against the Dutch in the 1670 Treaty of Dover. When the French invaded the Dutch Republic in May 1672, they initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory, following a fast advance to the Rhine quickly capturing the major Dutch fortresses of Nijmegen and Fort Crèvecœur near 's-Hertogenbosch after having occupied Utrecht without a fight. However, by late July, the Dutch position stabilised behind the Holland Water Line and concern at French gains brought them support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and Charles II of Spain. This forced Louis to divide his forces; in August 1672, he sent his best general Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne with 50,000 troops to the Rhineland. Lynn 1999, p. 117. Maastricht is located on the extreme eastern edge of what contemporaries loosely referred to as Flanders, a compact area 160 kilometres wide, the highest point only 100 metres above sea level, and dominated by canals and rivers, most of which run east to west. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were primarily transported by water and campaigns fought over the control of rivers such as the Lys, Sambre and Meuse. Maastricht more precisely, is situated on high bedrock where the Maas has started running south to north. Historically, it is one of a series of strategic fortress cities, controlling the Meuse valley and the east to west roads crossing this river, such as Sedan, Namur and Liège. It was captured in 1632 from the Habsburgs by the Dutch stadtholder Frederick Henry of Orange, its fortifications afterwards being considerably expanded until 1645.L.J. Morreau, 1979, Bolwerk der Nederlanden. De vestingwerken van Maastricht sedert het begin van de 13e eeuw Assen. p 146 The town was especially important due to its location on both banks of the Meuse and one of the few garrisoned in peacetime. Dutch engineer Menno van Coehoorn began his career there in 1657, as a young Lieutenant in his father's company. In 1672, Maastricht was a key position in the Dutch defensive strategy. They had already noticed that the French were preparing forward supply bases in the Bishopric of Liège for a swift advance to the north. The Dutch concentrated a large part of the mercenary troops available to them in Maastricht, some eleven thousand men, hoping that a prolonged siege would gain them sufficient time to prepare the six Rhine fortresses defending the eastern border of the Republic. The French reached Maastricht on 17 May 1672 but, on advice of Turenne, avoided a direct assault, instead occupying the satellite forts of Tongeren, Maaseik and Valkenburg. They thus basically by-passed Maastricht to quickly overrun the Rhine fortresses, leading to a collapse of the Dutch defences. They maintained only a small observation force, a few thousand men, near the fortress. Not capturing Maastricht had its draw-backs because the fortress threatened the extended French supply lines. In November 1672, stadtholder William III of Orange advanced from Holland to Maastricht, taking part of its garrison with him, and he continued through the Spanish Netherlands to attack Charleroi, the French city at the start of the supply route. The capture of Maastricht was made the primary objective for the French 1673 campaign. Apart from logistical considerations, Louis XIV desired a conspicuous military victory to enhance his personal glory, in person accompanying the army. He also deeply enjoyed sieges. On the campaign, he took his wife with him, Maria Theresa of Spain, and two of his mistresses: Louise de La Vallière and Françoise-Athénaïs, Marquise de Montespan, although they were housed at Tournai, distanced from the actual fighting. While Louis assembled his forces around Kortrijk, another French army was concentrated in the west for a feint attack against Bruges, to prevent Spanish troops from further reinforcing Maastricht. Officially, the Spanish Netherlands were neutral in the conflict between France and the Dutch but it was generally understood that Louis intended to attack and conquer them in the near future. For this reason, the administration of the Spanish Netherlands closely cooperated with the Dutch, providing them diplomatic and military support to the extent their limited means allowed. Louis first moved to the east to threaten Brussels, the seat of their governor Juan Domingo de Zuñiga y Fonseca, but continued his advance, reaching Maastricht over Sint- Truiden. The siege is often indicated to have begun on 15 June, Lynn 1999, p. 113 when the first assault trenches were dug.  Advances in siege tactics  The 'Siege parallel:' three parallel trenches, linked by communication lines; the first is out of range of defensive fire, the third brings the attacking troops as close to the assault point as possible, while redoubts protect the ends of each. Maastricht was the first siege where the famous French engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban directed operations, rather than being a technical advisor. He was not a military commander and according to the custom of the time, subordinate to the senior officer present, in this case Louis XIV. Louis had forbidden his generals de Condé or Turenne to be present at the siege to prevent them from sharing in the glory. Louis regularly visited the trenches, exposing himself to enemy fire and was closely followed by painters and poets who had to immortalise his exploits for posterity, as well as the court historian Paul Pellisson. The circumvallation Although commonly remembered for the fortifications he built, Vauban's greatest innovations were in the field of offensive operations. Some years before the capture of Maastricht he had expressed his thoughts on siege warfare in a manuscript, that after his death, in 1740, was published under the title Mémoire pour servir d’instruction dans la conduite des sièges et dans la défense des places. This has provided modern researchers some insights about the general principles de Vauban probably applied. The 'siege parallel' had been in development since the mid-16th century but Maastricht saw him bring the idea to practical fulfilment. Duffy, Christopher p. 10 Three parallel trenches were dug in front of the walls, connecting the perpendicular assault trenches, the earth thus excavated being used to create embankments screening the attackers from defensive fire, while bringing them as close to the assault point as possible (see Diagram). The transverse parallels allowed a much larger number of troops to participate simultaneously in an assault to overwhelm the defenders, while avoiding choking points that often had led to costly failures. Artillery was moved into the trenches, allowing them to target the base of the walls at close range, with the defenders unable to depress their own guns enough to counter this; once a breach had been made, it was then stormed. This remained the standard for offensive operations until the early 20th century. Vauban was unusually sympathetic to the impact of war on the poor, on one occasion requesting compensation be paid a man with eight children whose land was taken to build one of his forts. However, his siege works required large numbers of unpaid workers, with severe punishments for those who tried to evade service; 20,000 local farmers were conscripted to dig his trenches at Maastricht.LePage, Jean- Denis p. 56 Troop strengths 1865 engraving of a ravelin at Maastricht, similar to that captured by French troops on 24 June 1673 The Treaty of Dover included an agreement by Charles II to supply a brigade of 6,000 English and Scottish troops for the French army. Lynn, John pp. 109-110 It also contained secret provisions, not revealed until 1771, one being the payment to Charles of £230,000 per year for these troops. While Charles was anxious to ensure Louis felt he was getting value for money, there were considerable doubts as to the brigade's reliability if asked to fight the Protestant Dutch on behalf of the Catholic French. As a result, it formed part of Turenne's force in the Rhineland but several officers, including the Duke of Monmouth and John Churchill, future Duke of Marlborough were present at Maastricht as volunteers and given prominent positions by Louis to gratify his English ally. The attacking forces numbered about forty thousand men.Sjaak Collijn, 2011, \\"Quod Traiectum ad Mosam XIII diebus cepit\\". Sebastien LePrestre de Vauban en het beleg van Maastricht in 1673, Master's Thesis, University of Amsterdam, 84 pp The garrison was commanded by Jacques de Fariaux, an experienced French Huguenot exile in Dutch service. Due to the serious situation of the Dutch, many regiments had been withdrawn from Maastricht after May 1672. In June 1673, eight regiments of States infantry, three regiments of States cavalry, an engineer company and a grenadier company remained. The Dutch troops had been reinforced by a Spanish Division containing a regiment of Italian infantry and two regiments of Spanish cavalry. The defenders totalled about five thousand men. This was about three thousand men below the strength that the city commanders had already in 1671 indicated as the minimum for a successful defence. Between 1645 and 1672, the fortifications had been completely neglected, falling into disrepair. They largely consisted of earthworks that were susceptible to erosion. Makeshift repairs in 1672 and 1673 had only partly improved the situation. Wooden palisades were constructed to reinforce weak spots. A lunette had been added in front of the vulnerable Tongeren Gate. Siege The fortifications in 1643; they had little changed in 1673. South is up and the Tongeren Gate is visible in the upper right corner of the map, just above the hornwork =Fortification by besiegers= On 5June, the first French troops reached Maastricht, advancing towards the west bank of the Maas. The next day, troops from Turenne appeared on the east bank, outside the Wijck suburb. On 7June, the construction of two ship bridges was started, to the north of the city, to connect both forces. Simultaneously, a host of at least seven thousand peasants began to dig the contravallation and circumvallation, even though no relief army was expected. The defenders that day made a sally, followed by a second sortie on 9June, killing a limited number of French. On 10 June, Louis XIV arrived. The following day, after the completion of the bridges during the night, he was joined by his brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans and camped at Wolder, a village to the southwest of the city, in an enormous tent able to accommodate four hundred courtiers. De Fariaux was demanded to surrender the city but refused. The Tongeren Gate engraved by Joan Blaeu, in the Atlas van Loon On 13 June, the French began to prepare large amounts of wood and digging materials on the west-side of the city. The north of the fortress was protected by a deep and wide moat, directly connected to the river Maas, while the south was covered by the Jeker rivulet, which would flood trenches. The obvious attack route therefore was from the west, over the high and rocky ridge leading to the ford that had in Roman times been the origin of the settlement. Frederick Henry in 1632 had attacked this side also. The drawback of the location was that deeper trenches of the type de Vauban preferred had to be dug through more or less solid rock; this was still feasible, however, because the layers consisted of relatively soft marlstone. In this sector two main gates were present, the Brussels Gate in the north and the Tongeren Gate (Tongersepoort, Porte Tongres) in the south. Around 14 June, the circumvallation was in principle finished. Due to difficult terrain large gaps remained, which was not seen as a problem as the structure served no real function. In 1632, Frederick Henry's circumvallation had been much more extensive. The same day a third bridge was completed to the south of the city. On 16 June, gun batteries were positioned, two in front of the Tongeren Gate and one on the north slope of the St Pietersberg which offers an ideal vantage point over the fortress. The guns, once in place, immediately opened fire, spending three thousand shot in the first six hours. It now became clear that the Tongeren Gate was the main object. It formed a weak point in the defences as it was protected by a small ravelin only and the city wall behind this was still mediaeval in form, without a full height backing earthwork, though a cavalier was present, the Tongerse Kat. Furthermore, there was only a dry moat to its north. In front of the ravelin a new lunette had been constructed but to obtain the necessary earth, to the south a nearby redoubt protecting the Jeker sluice inlet had been levelled. Vauban later criticised this, claiming that if the redoubt had still be present he had not dared to attack at this point because of its enfilading fire. Such fire was still provided by a large protruding hornwork to the north of the gate and the Groene Halve Maan, a demi-lune to its south. The Tongeren Gate in 1670, before the lunette was added At 21:00, 17 June, the two assault trenches towards the Tongeren Gate were opened. Work progressed at a steady pace under the cover of darkness and already in the late night a start could be made with the first parallel, their connecting trench, which was finished the next day. During 19 and 20 June, the second parallel was constructed. De Fariaux considered a sally to destroy the trenches but decided against it because they were too extensive and had been reinforced by artillery. The French gun batteries smashed the palisades, silenced the Dutch cannon on the Tongerse Kat, and created small breaches in the main wall. This caused much nervousness among the city population, as traditionally soldiers had the right to plunder a city once its wall had been breached. On 23 June, the left and right assault trenches reached their farthest point, about 160 metres from the forward defences, beyond effective musket range. During the night of 23/24 June, the third parallel was finished and about 2500 troops were assembled in it to storm the gate. =Assault= In the city a rumour circulated that Louis was in haste to end the siege in order to celebrate mass in its St Janskerk on the nativity of Saint John the Baptist, 24 June. At 17:00, five cannon shots were fired to mark the start of the assault. As a diversionary attack, first Wijck was assaulted, on the other side of the river, to draw away the defenders. The assault force at the Tongeren Gate was divided into three separate parts. The Marquis de Montbrun commanded the main effort against the lunette. There were two diversionary attacks. The one on the right was led by Charles de Montsaulnin, Comte de Montal, against the Groene Halve Maan. The Duke of Monmouth commanded that on the left, which included some fifty English volunteers and a company of Mousquetaires du roi under Captain-Lieutenant D'Artagnan, directed against the hornwork. Childs, John p. 16 Louis had tried to dissuade Monmouth from participating, fearing that his death might deteriorate relations with England, but ultimately the king felt obliged to give his permission. De Vauban had ordered that the secondary attacks had to be only feints, but to his disgust Monmouth attempted to scale the hornwork and was beaten off with heavy losses, over a hundred casualties. At the first contre-escarpe, an artificial escarpment offering the defenders a forward covered transverse communication line, and the Groene Halve Maen, the French too suffered many losses, especially among their officers. The lunette was taken, quickly recaptured by a counterattack and then taken again. In the late evening, French engineers connected the lunette to the third parallel via a provisional communication trench. D'Artagnan's statue in Maastricht; Dumas's The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later contains a romanticised account of his death Part of the defences of the city were permanent tunnels that had been dug under the marl plateau to the west. During the period of neglect after 1645, these had partly collapsed but prior to the siege some hasty repairs had been carried out. As the French troops were being relieved at daybreak on the early morning of 25 June, the Dutch let a mine explode under the lunette, killing about fifty attackers. Immediately the defenders made a sally and recaptured the lunette for a second time. In response the British and French attacked again, Monmouth circling the lunette from the left, D'Artagnan from the right, while the 2nd Musketeer Company assaulted the front. After a period of confused fighting, the defenders were driven back but several English officers were killed and others wounded, including Churchill. D'Artagnan was fatally hit in the head by a bullet, Childs, John p. 17 while passing through a breach in the first contre-escarpe palisade. Of the three hundred musketeers deployed, over eighty had been killed and over fifty severely wounded. In their honour, a later ravelin erected on this location was to be called the demilune des mousquetaires. In this critical phase of the battle, de Vauban lost his confidence. It had been assumed that the morale of the garrison was low but it now proved to be much more aggressive than expected. Also he worried about the possible extent of the tunnelling. He wrote to François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, the French minister of war, that if the Dutch managed to recapture the lunette for a third time, it was a distinct possibility that the siege would have to be lifted. At first the attackers had only a tenuous hold on the lunette and it would take them over five hours to bring up reinforcements. Another sortie would not materialise however, the population beginning to fill the gate with manure. During 26 and 27 June, the French reorganised, rebuilding their assault teams. It was decided that, before the ravelin in front of the gate could be stormed, first the hornwork and the Groene Halve Maan would have to be reduced to prevent enfilading fire. Gun batteries were placed between the lunette and the hornwork, to bombard it from a short distance. These gun emplacements also could interdict a possible sally from the gate. On 27 June, Louis was in a contemplative mood, silently observing for hours the bombardment of the city, standing on the north slope of the Sint Pietersberg. French engineers dug a tunnel under the hornwork and in the night of 27/28 June they a let a mine explode. The Italian defenders panicked and allowed the ramparts to be scaled. They then rallied, counterattacking with hand grenades, but ultimately were forced to leave possession of the earthwork to the French. The French captured several engineers who revealed the position of mined tunnels. Before the attackers could penetrate the tunnel network, the defenders blew five mines under the hornwork. Although the French readied themselves for a sally, none took place. The understrength garrison was now too weakened. On 28 June, a delegation of burghers requested de Fariaux to surrender. An additional gun battery was placed opposite the gate. In the night of 28/29 June French troops infiltrated to the ravelin which proved to have been abandoned. =Surrender= On 29 June, a trumpeter again demanded the surrender of the city and de Fariaux again refused. Subsequently, the French batteries intensified their bombardment of both the inner city and the defence works. The batteries on the north slope of the Sint Pietersberg concentrated their fire on the southwest corner of the city wall which collapsed into the moat behind the Groene Halve Maan. This demi-lune was abandoned by the Dutch during the night of 29/30 June. As the situation of the garrison was hopeless, strong moral pressure was applied by the population to de Fariaux not to continue the fight. They reminded him that during the Siege of Maastricht of 1579, on the 29th of June the Spanish troops of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma began to sack the city, in three days murdering a thousand of its inhabitants. They begged him to prevent a repeat of these tragic events. In the early morning of 30 June, de Fariaux send a message that he was ready to negotiate. After two hours of talks, he surrendered the city on relatively favourable terms. The garrison was given free passage, with drums beating and colours flying, to the nearest Dutch-held territory in 's-Hertogenbosch, 150 kilometres to the north- west; they included Van Coehoorn, who had been wounded during the siege. There would be no plundering. Maastricht was a condominium of the Duchy of Brabant, the rights of which had been subsumed by the Dutch Republic, and Liège and the bishop of Liège, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, was Louis's formal ally in the war. Also, the French king claimed to be the rightful Duke of Brabant already, as the title would be part of the dowry of his wife. In any case, he intended the city to be a permanent French possession. Immediately after the surrender two French regiments occupied the Duitse Poort in the east Wijck suburb and, in the west, the Brussels Gate through which Louis would make his triumphal entry. Losses on both sides had been heavy. The number of troops arriving in 's-Hertogenbosch is exactly known: 3118. If the number of defenders was indeed five thousand, their casualties must have numbered at about 1700. Estimates of the French losses vary considerably. They have been estimated at nine hundred dead and fourteen hundred wounded; at roughly about twice the number of Dutch casualties; or by contemporary Dutch accounts at six thousand killed and four thousand wounded. The Dutch at the time, for propaganda reasons, published long lists of French officers killed.  Aftermath  The relief by Anguier The quick fall of Maastricht meant that Louis had some time to spare. To keep the king occupied he attacked the Electorate of Trier, without a declaration of war, on the pretext the bishop had allowed the entry of some companies of imperial troops. The city of Trier was besieged and largely destroyed. William III had feared that 's-Hertogenbosch or Breda would be the next French target and had assembled an allied States-Spanish army of thirty thousand at Geertruidenberg to relieve any of these cities. The French had indeed considered an attack on 's-Hertogenbosch but decided against it because success could not be guaranteed in view of the marshy terrain. Although losing Maastricht was a blow to Dutch morale, the Trier siege it gave cause to would be very favourable to them. Public opinion in the German states was outraged by the French conduct. The emperor moved his army into the Rhineland and Louis in response withdrew most of his troops from the Holland Water Line, dangerously weakening his hold on Utrecht and Gelderland. Louis as a Roman triumphator by Pierre Mignard Shortly after the fall of Maastricht, the Dutch agreed the August 1673 Treaty of The Hague with Emperor Leopold and Spain, joined in October by Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, creating the Quadruple Alliance. At the Water Line William III of Orange recaptured the fortress town of Naarden on 13 September. With the war expanding into the Rhineland and Spain, French troops withdrew from the Dutch Republic, retaining only Grave and Maastricht. Grave was recaptured by the Dutch in 1674. The alliance between England and Catholic France had been unpopular from the start and although the real terms of the Treaty of Dover remained secret, many suspected them. In early 1674, Denmark joined the Alliance, while England and the Dutch made peace in the Treaty of Westminster. William III tried to recapture Maastricht in 1676 but failed, the French having greatly improved the fortifications according to a plan drawn by de Vauban. Immediately after the siege, de Vauban spent three weeks surveying the city and its surroundings to create detailed maps of the terrain. Then a large-scale maquette of the fortress was made.Jenniskens (2006), p 16 After much controversy among historians, the present consensus is that this model was discarded relatively early and is not identical to the extant Maastricht maquette in the Paris Musée de l'Armée which shows the situation in the middle of the eighteenth century.Jenniskens (2006), p 16-21 On 16 September 1673, de Louvois had written that Louis would sooner give up Paris or Versailles than ever return Maastricht,Jenniskens (2006), p 9 but the city was nevertheless returned to the Dutch when the Treaty of Nijmegen ended the war in 1678. The French used the city as a bargaining chip to seduce them to cease supporting the Spanish war aims. The Dutch had promised that after a victory, the city would be ceded to the Spanish Netherlands, but refused when peace had been signed, claiming that otherwise the treaty conditions would be violated. The siege was the subject of a set of paintings by Charles Le Brun on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. Adam Frans van der Meulen also dedicated a series of paintings to the event. Louis had the Porte Saint-Denis redesigned to commemorate this siege also, a plaque dedicating it LUDOVICO MAGNO, QUOD TRAJECTUM AD MOSAM - XIII. DIEBUS CEPIT, \\"to Louis the Great, for capturing Maastricht in thirteen days\\". The reliefs depicting the siege were made by Michel Anguier.

It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Middle Tennessee State University Blue Raiders. It also serves as the stadium for the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association's (TSSAA) State High School Football Championships. It previously served as the home stadium for Riverdale and Oakland high schools, for a long period when those schools did not have stadiums. It later was the home stadium for Siegel High School for a short period, when construction for a stadium was delayed. The stadium is named for Middle Tennessee State University football coach Johnny Floyd. History The stadium was officially named Johnny \\"Red\\" Floyd Stadium/Horace Jones Field in 1968. Set on the northwest end of campus, Floyd Stadium has undergone a multimillion-dollar renovation over the past few years to make it one of the premier facilities in the region and the Conference USA. The stadium opened its doors on October 14, 1933, with a scoreless tie against Jacksonville State. Originally built as two sideline grandstands on either side of an outdoor track, it was enlarged in 1940, 1960, 1968, and most recently in 1998 to bring it to its current configuration as an octagonal bowl. =Renovations= The move to NCAA Division I-A (FBS) football was the catalyst for the most recent renovation to Floyd Stadium. On August 24, 1995, the University announced plans for a renovation, which was approved by the State Building Commission. After a lengthy bid process, ground was officially broken for the stadium in January 1997 with Turner Construction handling the project. Upon completion, the stadium featured 30,788 seats with only the east side grandstands remaining from the original structure. The old press box gave way to a five-story tower including luxury suites on the third level, a large press area and a few suites on the fourth level, and a camera deck on the fifth level. The renovation also included the addition of more chair-back seats as well as a club level. The first game in the renovated stadium took place on September 5, 1998. The game, in which Middle Tennessee hosted local rival Tennessee State, drew a then-school record 27,568 fans. The attendance helped push Middle Tennessee over the top for its I-A qualifying attendance of 17,000 per game. The most recent upgrade came during the summer of 2007 when a new state-of-the-art video board was installed. The Daktronics display board enhances the overall atmosphere and bring fans even closer to the action. During the summer of 2006, a new synthetic surface was installed to replace the outdated artificial turf. The school decided to use the Sportexe PowerBlade, a special monofilament polyethylene infilled system designed to maximize player speed and performance and provide superior shock absorbency. Middle Tennessee was the first school in the country to use this top-of-the line surface. In 2012, a new stadium club was built from a $1 million donation from Jeff Hendrix. In mid-2014, the field surface was again renovated with the installation of Shaw Sports Turf's Legion 46 synthetic turf. Features In addition to the spectator facilities, the stadium complex includes a team meeting room, position meeting rooms, a weight room for all Middle Tennessee teams, an academic center for Blue Raider student-athletes, and access to Murphy Athletic Center from the stadium via a walkway. The stadium also allows for further expansion that would provide an increase of approximately 40,000 seats, putting capacity over the 70,000 mark.

Arma Christi (\\"Weapons of Christ\\"), or the Instruments of the Passion, are the objects associated with the Passion of Jesus Christ in Christian symbolism and art. They are seen as arms in the sense of heraldry, and also as the weapons Christ used to achieve his conquest over Satan. There is a group, at a maximum of about 20 items, which are frequently used in Christian art, especially in the Late Middle Ages. Typically they surround either a cross or a figure of Christ of the Man of Sorrows type, either placed around the composition, or held by angels. History The prime member, the Cross, had been introduced to Christian art in the 4th century as the crux invicta, a symbol of victory. As a group they have a long tradition in iconography, dating back to the 9th century; the Utrecht Psalter of 830 is an example, though the only one from the Early Middle Ages known to Gertrud Schiller. This reflected an increase in theological interest in the sufferings of Christ at the time.Schiller, 184-185 The Middle English poem Arma Christi, which appeared before the end of the 14th century, exists in fifteen manuscripts, attesting to its popularity, of which seven are engrossed in highly unusual scroll form, designed to be displayed in church as a pictorial aid to public devotion; manuscripts of Arma Christi are generally accompanied by illustrations of the instruments, viewing of which, according to the texts, granted indulgence of a certain number of days in Purgatory to come.Rossell Hope Robbins, \\"The 'Arma Christi' Rolls\\", The Modern Language Review 34.3 (July 1939:415-421) Relics of the most important items had a long history, dating back to the Empress Helena's discovery of the True Cross in the early 4th century. Relics claiming to be the Holy Lance, Holy Sponge, Holy Chalice and nails from the cross were all venerated well before 1000, and were to proliferate in later centuries. There was a wave of new relics in the West at the time of the Crusades, and a further wave as the Instruments became featured more prominently in devotional literature and practices in the 14th century.Schiller, 189-191 In art the Instruments either surrounded an image of Christ in andachtsbilder subjects such as the Man of Sorrows, or might appear by themselves - often the image of Christ's face on the Veil of Veronica was the focal point of the image. In both cases the purpose of the representations was to symbolize the sufferings of Christ during his Passion. They had the practical advantage for less accomplished artists of being much easier to represent than human figures, and were no doubt often treated as a subject an apprentice could be left to do. Possibly the earliest representation of the isolated instruments laid out across a space is in a drawing in a German manuscript of about 1175, where they are to one side of a Christ in Majesty.Schiller, 187 In devotional books they were sometimes, by the Late Middle Ages, shown one at a time, accompanying one of the many texts that devoted meditations in turn to the episodes in which each had been used, before culminating in a figure subject with Jesus.Schiller, 192-3 Miniature versions of the objects were attached to rosaries and crucifixes, and used as aids to contemplation of the suffering of Christ. The Instruments Depictions of the Instruments of the Passion may include many combinations of those following (though the cross of Jesus is almost always represented). A primary group of the most frequently used instruments can be distinguished: *The Cross on which Jesus was crucified (True Cross), either depicted alone or with the crosses of the two thieves *The Crown of Thorns *The pillar or column where Jesus was whipped in the Flagellation of Christ *The whip(s), in Germany often birches, used for the 39 lashes *The Holy Sponge set on a reed, with which gall and vinegar were offered to Jesus *The Holy Lance with which a Roman soldier inflicted the final of the Five Wounds in his side *The Nails, inflicting four wounds on the hands and feet *The Veil of Veronica Other common ones are: *The reed which was placed in Jesus' hand as a sceptre in mockery *The purple robe of mockery *The Titulus Crucis, attached to the Cross. It may be inscribed in Latin (INRI, Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum), Greek, Hebrew, or some other language. *The Holy Grail, the chalice used by Jesus at The Last Supper, and which some traditions say Joseph of Arimathea used to catch his blood at the crucifixion *The Seamless robe of Jesus *The dice with which the soldiers cast lots for Christ's seamless robe *The rooster (cock) that crowed after Peter's third denial of Jesus *The vessel used to hold the gall and vinegar *The ladder used for the Deposition, i.e. the removal of Christ's body from the cross for burial *The hammer used to drive the nails into Jesus' hands and feet *The pincers used to remove the nails *The vessel of myrrh, used to anoint the body of Jesus, either by Joseph of Arimathea or by the Myrrhbearers *The shroud used to wrap the body of Jesus before burial *The sun and moon, representing the eclipse which occurred during the Passion *Thirty pieces of silver (or a money bag), the price of Judas' betrayal *A spitting face, indicating the mockery of Jesus *The hand which slapped Jesus' face *The chains or cords which bound Jesus overnight in prison *The lantern or torches used by the arresting soldiers at the time of the betrayal, as well as their swords and staves *The sword used by Peter to cut off the ear of the High Priest's servant. Sometimes a human ear is also represented. *Sometimes the heads or hands of figures from the Passion are shown, including Judas, Caiaphas, or the man who mocked Christ spitting in Christ's face. The washing hands of Pontius Pilate may be shown. The Lorenzo Monaco painting below has several such images. * The trumpet played for mocking Christ on the Way to Calvary.Ballester, Jordi, \\"Trumpets, Heralds and Minstrels: Their Relation to the Image of Power and Representation in the Fourteenth- and Fifteenth-Century Catalano-Aragonese Painting\\", Music in Art: International Journal for Music Iconography (2018) 43/1–2, 5–19. Other contexts The principal group of the Instruments appear in other contexts as well. The lance and sponge on a stick are held as though they are standards or weapons by the archangels flanking the throne of Christ in a 6th-century mosaic from Ravenna (now Belin), and are often shown in this way thereafter, especially in scenes of the Last Judgement. In Eastern Orthodox art they are often on or around the Hetoimasia or \\"empty throne\\" of judgement.Schiller, 186-187 The Crown of Thorns sometimes hangs alone on the cross; it has been suggested that the Celtic cross originated from this motif. The minor Instruments generally did not developed a sufficient ability to be recognised and understood in this way, and appear only in groups.

It is sixty kilometres from the coast of the Ionian Sea, in the province of Enna. The closest modern town is Aidone, two kilometres southwest of the site. The site consists of a two-kilometre long ridge running southwest-northeast, known as Serra Orlando, and a neighboring hill at the northeast called Cittadella. Morgantina was inhabited in several periods. The earliest major settlement was made at Cittadella and lasted from about 1000/900 to about 450 BCE. The other major settlement was located on Serra Orlando, and existed from about 450 BCE to about 50 CE. Morgantina has been the subject of archaeological investigation since the early 20th century. Serra Orlando was identified as Morgantina by Kenan Erim following the discovery of a number of coins bearing the Latin word HISPANORUM. Erim used these coins and passages from Livy to argue that the city found at Serra Orlando was in fact the ancient city of Morgantina. History  The name appears in different forms among different authors: Morgantia, Murgantia and Morgantium in scholarship; in ancient sources Strabo used the name and Diodorus Siculus used . The name is variously written by Latin writers as Murgantia, Murgentia and Morgentia. The inhabitants were called Murgentini by Cicero and Pliny the Elder. According to Strabo Morgantina was founded by a pre-Roman Italian group known as the Morgetes of Rhegium. Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote that the Morgetes were led by a king named Morges. The earliest historical date associated with Morgantina is 459 BCE, when Ducetius, leader of the indigenous Sicel population of central Sicily, attacked the city and captured it. Morgantina was probably still under Ducetius' control when he was defeated at Nomai by Syracuse in 449 BCE. No later mention of Morgantina is made until Thucydides lists it as part of the terms of a truce in the war of 427–424 BCE between Syracuse and the Dorian cities of Sicily on one side, and Kamarina, the Khalkidian cities of Sicily, the Sikels, and Athens on the other side. Thucydides says that Syracuse agreed at the Congress of Gela to give Morgantina to Kamarina in return for payment of an indemnity. Kamarina was destroyed in 405 by the Carthaginians. Morgantina therefore must have been independent from at least this date, although it was soon recaptured by Dionysios of Syracuse in 396. Syracuse retained (occasionally more nominal than actual) control of Morgantina until the Second Punic War. In 317, Morgantina received the tyrant Agathocles, then in exile, and offered him help in returning to Syracuse. He was elected praetor at Morgantina, and later dux. As part of the Syracusan kingdom of Hiero II, Morgantina fell under the hegemony of Rome when Hieron became a Roman vassal in 263. In 214, Morgantina switched its allegiance from Rome to Carthage. Morgantina remained autonomous until 211, when it became the last Sicilian town to be captured by the Romans. It was given as payment by Rome to a group of Spanish mercenaries. In 133, Morgantina was the place where Eunus, the leader of the slave rebellion known as the First Servile War, died. In the Second Servile War, Morgantina was besieged and taken by slaves. The final mention of Morgantina comes again from Strabo, who notes that in his own time, the first century CE, the city had ceased to exist. A few literary sources describe Morgantina and its economy. Most famous of these are the references to the vitis murgentina, a strain of grape mentioned by Cato, Columella, and Pliny the Elder. These grapes were prized for their wine — Pliny called it \\"the very best among all those that come from Sicily\\" — and had been transplanted from Sicily to mainland Italy by the 2nd century BCE. Diodorus Siculus mentioned the Gorgus of Morgantina (), surnamed Cambalus () who was one of the chief men of wealth and authority in the city and his father who was also named Gorgus. Both were killed by thieves.Diodorus Siculus, Library, 35.11.1 Excavation history  = Early work on Serra Orlando = The earliest excavations at Morgantina were undertaken by Luigi Pappalardo in 1884. He uncovered part of a necropolis, a large terracotta drain and two houses. One of the houses he found, the Pappalardo house, was named for him by later American excavators. Paolo Orsi recorded stray finds from Morgantina and excavated trial trenches in 1912. He located a terrace of nine steps, walls, as well as what he called 'a Roman house'. = Princeton University = Morgantina has been the principal site of American research on classical Sicily. Currently there are two other sites on the island with significant American presences: the Soprintendenza BB.CC.AA. di Catania's excavations at Palike, and the work undertaken by Stanford University and Northern Illinois University as part of a consortium of primarily Scandinavian institutions at Monte Polizzo. In 1955, a major project was begun by Princeton University, under the supervision of Professors Erik Sjöqvist and Richard Stillwell. The excavations on the (then unidentified) town were intended to serve as training for graduate students in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology. Major figures who participated in work at Morgantina include Kenan Erim, Donald White, T. Leslie Shear, Jr., Ione Mylonas Shear, R. Ross Holloway, Stephen Miller, Paul Deussen, and Karl Erik Östenberg. Special mention should also be made of Sweden's King Gustaf VI Adolf, who came to Morgantina on several occasions in the 1950s at the invitation of Sjöqvist, his former secretary, to work at the site. = Hubert Allen and the University of Illinois = In the mid-1960s, Princeton graduate student Hubert L. Allen assumed a role in the administration of the excavations. Upon receiving his doctorate, Allen was hired by the University of Illinois, which then began to co-sponsor the Morgantina project. The death of Sjöqvist and retirement of Stillwell in the early 1970s led to Princeton's withdrawal from direct involvement in the excavations. Allen continued to lead the project until 1975, when he was denied tenure at Illinois and took a position with University of Illinois computer sciences. At that point, American work at Morgantina was put on hold. =University of Virginia and Wesleyan University = The excavations had produced vast amounts of artifacts and data, but as yet there was no final publication. In 1978, Malcolm Bell, III, professor of classical art and archaeology at the University of Virginia, took over the project with the goal of publishing the Morgantina material. Bell was a former Princeton graduate student (Sjöqvist had been Bell's advisor until his retirement) who had written his dissertation on terracotta figurines found at Morgantina. He has conducted investigations on Serra Orlando since 1982, each time with the intention of answering specific questions raised by earlier work. Bell used his dissertation as the basis for the first book in the Morgantina Studies series published in 1983. Six volumes have appeared in the series, which is the main vehicle for the definite publication of the excavation results. In 1990, Carla Antonaccio, then on the faculty of Wesleyan University but now at Duke University, herself a Princeton graduate, assumed responsibility for publishing the post-7th century BCE settlement on Cittadella. Since that time, both Virginia and Wesleyan, along with many other American and Italian institutions, have sent scholars and students to conduct research. Notable scholars currently working on the project include Barbara Tsakirgis of Vanderbilt University on the houses of Serra Orlando, Jenifer Neils of Case Western Reserve University on figured pottery, Barbara Barletta of the University of Florida on architectural moldings, Rosa Maria Albanese Procelli and Enrico Procelli, both of the University of Catania on the Bronze Age material, John Kenfield of Rutgers University on architectural terracottas, and Robert Leighton of the University of Edinburgh on the protohistoric settlement on Cittadella. The site's archives are currently housed at the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University, though some materials also exist at the University of Illinois. =North Baths= Since 2003 Sandra K. Lucore (formerly of the University of Tokyo, now an independent scholar) has led excavations of the 3rd century BC North Baths complex that have produced interesting results including evidence of one of the earliest examples of dome and barrel vault construction. =Bouleuterion= The bouleuterion in Morgantina is a rectangular building located west of the agora of the city. It was founded during the 3rd century BC, a period of great prosperity for Morgantina, which, from 5th century BC on had acquired a profoundly Hellenic character. The building had a bipartite plan. A walled forecourt led through a stoa to the main entrance, centrally located at the east wall of the auditorium. A rectangular substructure held wooden benches where the assembly sat to listen to the speakers. Stone buttressing, connected to this substructure, supported the south retaining wall. Today, only the foundation and parts of the south side of the auditorium are preserved. Archaeological Museum of Aidone Interior of the church of St. Francis Capuchin - Auditorium, home of the Archaeological Museum of Aidone A regional museum was opened in Aidone in 1980 to house finds from Morgantina. The building, dating from the 17th century, is a former Capuchin monastery. The museum is run by the Soprintendenza BB.CC.AA. di Enna. There are two floors of exhibits, covering the site's prehistoric, archaic, and classical periods, along with a thematic display that draws attention to aspects of ancient daily life.

Major reinforcing work was done in 1916. However, in 1941, the bridge failed monthly inspection and therefore was converted to one-way operation northbound on August 5, 1941 on the same day the Third Avenue Bridge was similarly converted to one-way southbound. Due to its poor condition, the bridge was replaced starting in 2007 and converted to pedestrian-only traffic for three years, and then was dismantled once a sidewalk was put in on the new bridge. =New bridge= Replacement bridge sails up East River, July 2010 In November 2005, New York City sought to replace the bridge. In an effort to preserve the structure, the city offered it for sale for $1, with free delivery within 15 miles. Due to the difficult logistics of moving the structure, there were no bids as of March 2007. On April 12, 2011, granite from the structure was given to a nearby park while the metal part was moved via tug to Jersey City. The steel was melted down and the concrete parts were made into fill. The Department of Transportation opted to construct a new structure to the south of the existing bridge at a projected cost of $417 million. On March 8, 2007, when bidding for construction was opened, of the two bids offered, the lowest came in at $612 million. Iris Weinshall, the department commissioner, said that the city had to go forward with the project because maintenance of the existing bridge was too expensive and the design of the ramps contributed to frequent accidents. This was the most costly bridge construction project by the New York City Department of Transportation. Weinshall expected the project to last five years with construction beginning around the end of 2007. Motor traffic shifted to new bridge on October 2, 2010 The replacement bridge was constructed at Port of Coeymans, 10 miles south of Albany. On July 13, 2010, the bridge was shipped down the Hudson on two barges that were welded together. The new bridge is 350 feet long, 65 feet high and 77 feet wide; it required three tugboats to propel it. The sight of the floating bridge caused a stir among onlookers all along the Hudson. After a stay at Port Jersey in Jersey City it was towed up the East River to its destination in the morning on July 26. Motor traffic was shifted to the new bridge on October 2, 2010, though the walkway of the old bridge continued to serve pedestrians and cyclists NY1 News New bridge opens to traffic for a few weeks. Just upstream, the Third Avenue Bridge carries southbound traffic across the Harlem River from the Bronx to Manhattan as the other side of a one-way pair. That bridge was replaced in 2004.

As of August 2019, there are 932,720 active PMP certified individuals and 300 chartered chapters across 218 countries and territories worldwide. The exam is based on the PMI Project Management Body of Knowledge. Exam syllabus The PMP exam is based on the PMP Examination Specification, which describes tasks out of five performance domains: # Initiating the project (13%) # Planning the project (24%) # Executing the project (31%) # Monitoring and controlling the project (25%) # Closing the project (7%) The exam consists of 200 multiple choice questions written against the PMBOK specification and the PMP Code of Ethics. The exam is closed book; no reference materials are allowed. Twenty- five of the 200 questions on the exam are \\"sample\\" questions used to fine-tune the degree of difficulty and precision of the exam and as such are not counted for or against a test taker. These questions are placed randomly throughout the exam. The test taker is only graded on their proficiency on 175 questions. The numbers in parentheses describe the percentage of questions for each domain. Announced in June 2019, the PMP Examination Content Outline will undergo significant re-categorization, effective January 2021, which prescribe 3 all new performance domains: # People (42%) # Process (50%) # Business Environment (8%) Item references Each exam item (a question with its possible answers) has at least two references to standard books or other sources of project management. Most of the questions reference the PMI A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (aka the PMBOK Guide). The PMBOK Guide is currently (2018) in its sixth edition, and the PMP exam changed in March 2018 to align with the updated guide. The Project Management Framework embodies a project life cycle and five major project management Process Groups: # Initiating # Planning # Executing # Monitoring and Controlling # Closing encompassing a total of 49 processes.PMBOK Guide 6th Edition Mapped to these five process groups are ten project management Knowledge Areas: # Project Integration Management # Project Scope Management # Project Schedule Management # Project Cost Management # Project Quality Management # Project Resource Management # Project Communications Management # Project Risk Management # Project Procurement Management # Project Stakeholder Management The processes of these knowledge areas are described by their inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. The PMBOK also emphasizes the interaction and interdependence between different process groups. For example, the outputs from one process may be used by one or more other processes as inputs. Purpose Government, commercial and other organizations employ PMP certified project managers in an attempt to improve the success rate of projects in all areas of knowledge, by applying a standardized and evolving set of project management principles as contained in PMI's PMBOK Guide. In December 2005, the PMP credential was number 7 of ZDNet's 10 best IT certifications. In 2012 the PMP credential was ranked as a top certification by CIO. In 2015, the PMP credential was ranked as the #4 certification by Global Knowledge, behind 3 Security certifications. Examination process An example of a PMP Certificate issued by the PMI to candidates who pass the Project Management Professional Exam. The global network of Pearson VUE testing centers provides the PMP exam as a computer-based test. They also offer a paper-based option for locations with no nearby Prometric testing centers. The exam consists of 200 questions (\\"items\\"). 25 are pre-release items, which are not included in exam scoring. Prometric calculates the score based on the other 175 items. Each multiple-choice item has one correct answer and three incorrect answers. Candidates who take the computer-based test receive their results (passed or not passed) immediately upon completion. PMI also evaluates proficiency levels in each project management process group in 4 levels. Above Target, Target, Below Target, and Needs Improvement. Examiners provide these results to the candidate on a score report after the examination. Candidates who take paper-based tests receive their test results and score reports typically within 4 weeks. PMI Audit PMI conducts application audits to confirm the experience and/or education documented on certification applications. The purpose of the audit is to enhance the credibility of the certification program and of the certification holders. For each certification, a specified percentage of applications are randomly selected for audit.https://www.pmi.org/certifications/faq Item writing Item writing is an ongoing process at PMI, and they periodically add new four- choice questions (items) and remove others. Item writers use the PMP Examination Specification to identify item contents and references (project management texts or standards) to verify correctness. Individuals who are active in the field of PMP exam preparation (trainers, courseware developers, book authors, etc..) may not participate in item writing. Prerequisites to become eligible Candidates must meet the prerequisites in one of the following groups to be eligible for PMP Certificationhttps://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp: =Group A= * A four-year degree * 36 months leading projects * 35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM Certification =Group B= * A high school diploma or an associate’s degree (or global equivalent) * 60 months leading projects * 35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM Certification Continuous credential requirements Continuous credential requirements are also called CCRs. To maintain the PMP qualification, 60 professional development units (PDUs) must be earned over a three-year cycle, from activities such as researching, authoring articles, speaking on project management-related topics, or being engaged full-time in project management. Credential holders may earn PDUs towards the maintenance of their credential through formal academic courses or courses offered by a provider (R.E.P. or Component). However, these are only two of the five categories of PDU earning opportunities in which a credential holder may participate. Effective 1 December 2015, CCRs will be updated to align with the employer-identified skills depicted in the PMI Talent Triangle, a combination of technical, leadership, and strategic and business management expertise, to ensure credential holders are equipped with skills relevant in a continually changing business environment. Credential value The US Department of Education and the National Science Foundation have deemed all United States professional certifications to be at level 50 in the Mapping The World of Education, Comparable Database System (Volume Two: Codes for Program Completion Awards by Country). The Level 50 code addresses \\"Postsecondary Programs and Awards of No More Than 2 Years. Programs and awards that are designed to represent no more than 2 years of study; constitute postsecondary education as operationally defined in CDS; and are not second (graduate-level) programs and awards.\\" Other PMI credentials PMP (Project Management Professional) is one of eight credentials offered by PMI: * Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) * Project Management Professional (PMP) * Program Management Professional (PgMP) * PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP) * PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) * PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) * Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP) * PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)  Difference from PRINCE2 Certifications  PRINCE2 certifications could be seen as a competitor of Project Management Professional (PMP). In general, the US and American countries prefer PMP, and UK, Australia and Europe prefer PRINCE2. Asia, Africa and the Middle East area have no strong preference for one or the other. The organizations behind these two certifications acknowledge each other's existence in their advertising material and attempt to position themselves as complementary products – PRINCE2 as a methodology, and the subject of the PMP certification (such as the PMBOK Guide) as a guide or standard – which can be used alongside each other. In practice, companies and practitioners choose one system or both due to the project environment, their geographical location and costs involved.

It is primarily used for NCAA and is the home field of the Clemson Tigers of the Division I Atlantic Coast Conference. Opened in 1970, it has a record single-game attendance of 6,524 (set on March 6, 2016, against South Carolina). Doug Kingsmore has ranked in the top 20 in attendance for 15 consecutive seasons. The Tigers have an .810 winning percentage in games played there all time and are in NCAA Tournament games there since the NCAA changed its post-season format in 1999 (with a record in NCAA Tournament games all time). History =Renaming= Former Clemson baseball player and Board of Trustees Emeritus Doug Kingsmore gave the Clemson athletic department a $1 million gift towards renovation of Clemson's baseball stadium, formerly known as Tiger Field. George Bennett, former executive director of IPTAY, made the announcement in 2000. Bennett also announced that the facility would be called Doug Kingsmore Stadium. =Postseason= The stadium has hosted three Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournaments (1976, 1977, 1978), 13 NCAA regionals (1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2018), and four NCAA super regionals (2000, 2002, 2006, 2010). Renovations Renovations to Doug Kingsmore Stadium began in the summer of 2002. The design was done by HOK Sport (now Populous) and construction by Yeargin Potter Shackelford Construction. The stadium has a brick facade that surrounds every entrance. A green roof that covers much more of the stands and a press box that is twice as large adds to the comfort of fans attending the game and the media covering it. The press box, which is accessible by elevator, includes four large booths for broadcasting and a separate media center that accommodates 13 writers. There is also a patio area outside the press box that is above the existing stands along the first and third-base lines. It is used for receptions and other events throughout the year. Two ticket booths, concession stands with an adjoining picnic area, and enlarged restrooms make the facility easily accessible and fan-friendly. Reserved seats were also added to the grandstand. A grand stairway leading from the McFadden parking lot to the main entrance is an added feature from a convenience and aesthetic aspect. The players also realize improvements, as four batting cages have been constructed beyond the right-field fence. The dugouts have been almost doubled in length and width. And the players have a newly renovated locker room and lounge. Prior to 2005, PawVision, the giant replay screen that was used in the football stadium (1997–2004), was moved to Doug Kingsmore Stadium. The facility is also equipped with a \\"Super-Sopper,\\" which cuts down on rainouts. Clemson is one of a few schools with this machine that removes water from the field.

He was the governor of Bengal and Odisha and had his capital at Dhaka, presently Bangladesh. Early life and family Shah Shuja in his childhood, 1650 Shah Shuja was born on 23 June 1616, in Ajmer. He was the second son and child of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan and his queen Mumtaz Mahal. Shuja's siblings were Jahanara Begum, Dara Shikoh, Roshanara Begum, Aurangzeb, Murad Baksh, Gauhara Begum and others. He had three sons - Sultan Zain-ul-Din (Bon Sultan or Sultan Bang), Buland Akhtar and Zainul Abidin and four daughters - Gulrukh Banu, Roshanara Begum and Amina Begum.Stanley Lane-Pool, 1971, Aurangzeb, vol.1. Personal life Shah Shuja married firstly Bilqis Banu Begum, the daughter of Rustam Mirza, on the night of Saturday, 5 March 1633. The marriage was arranged by Princess Jahanara Begum. Rupees 1,60,000 in cash and one lakh worth lakh of goods were sent as sachak to the mansion of Mirza Rustam. On 23 February 1633, the wedding presents worth Rupees 10 lakhs were displayed by Jahanara Begum and Sati-un-nissa Khanum. The following year she gave birth to a daughter, and died in childbirth. She was buried in a separate mausoleum named Kharbuza Mahal, at Burhanpur. Her daughter was named Dilpazir Banu Begum by Shah Jahan, and who died as an infant. thumbleft170px Shuja, Mughal prince On the death of his first wife, he married Piari Banu Begum, daughter of Azam Khan, second governor of Bengal during Shah Jahan's reign. She was the mother of two sons, and three daughters, namely, Prince Zain-ud-din Mirza born on 28 October 1639, Prince Zain-ul-Abidin Mirza born on 20 December 1645, Gulrukh Banu Begum (wife of Prince Muhammad Sultan), Raushan Ara Begum, and Amina Banu Begum. In 1660, she fled to Arakan with her husband, sons, and three daughters. Shuja was murdered in 1661. His sons were put to death. Piari Banu Begum, and her two daughters committed suicide. The remaining daughter, Amina Banu Begum, was brought into the palace, where from grief she died an early death. According to another source, one of Shuja's daughters was married to King Sanda Thudhamma. A year later he scented a plot and starved all of them to death, while his wife was in an advanced stage of pregnancy by himself. His third wife was the daughter of Raja Tamsen of Kishtwar. She was the mother of Shahzada Buland Akhtar who was born in August 1645. Governor of Bengal Shazada Muhammad Shah Shuja was appointed by Shah Jahan as the Subahdar of Bengal and Bihar from 1641 and of Orissa from 25 July 1648 until 1661. His father Shah Jahan appointed his deputy The Rajput Prince of Nagpur Kunwar Raghav Singh(1616-1671). During his governorship, he built the official residence Bara Katra in the capital Dhaka. After the illness of Shah Jahan in September 1657, a power crisis occurred among the brothers. Shah Shuja proclaimed himself as Emperor, but Aurangzeb ascended the throne of Dehli and sent Mir Jumla to subjugate Shuja. Shuja was defeated in the Battle of Khajwa on 5 January 1659. He retreated first to Tandah and then to Dhaka on 12 April 1660. He left Dhaka on 6 May and boarded ships near present-day Bhulua on 12 May heading Arakan. Mir Jumla reached Dhaka on 9 May 1660 and was then appointed by Aurangzeb as the next Subahdar of Bengal. =Construction projects in Dhaka= 1870 Photograph of Bara Katra.jpgBara Katra Mughol Eidgah.jpgDhanmondi Eidgah Old hussaini dalan.jpgHussaini Dalan The Great Kuttra, Dhaka (1823).jpgAn etching of Bara Katra by Sir Charles D'Oyly in 1823 Mughal war of succession Armored elite War elephant from the battalion of Shah Shuja. The Mughal armies of Aurangzeb and Shah Shuja confront each other. When Shah Jahan fell ill, a struggle for the throne started between his four sons - Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh. Shuja immediately crowned himself the emperor and took imperial titles, November 1657. He marched with a large army, backed by a good number of war- boats in the river Ganges. However, he was beaten by Dara's army in a hotly contested Battle of Bahadurpur near Banares (in modern Uttar Pradesh, India). Shuja turned back to Rajmahal to make further preparations. He signed a treaty with his elder brother Dara, which left him in control of Bengal, Orissa and a large part of Bihar, 17 May 1658. In the meantime, Aurangzeb defeated Dara twice (at Dharmat and Samugarh), caught him, executed him on a charge of heresy and ascended the throne. Shuja marched again to the capital, this time against Aurangzeb. A battle took place on 5 January 1659 at the Battle of Khajwa (Fatehpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India) where Shuja was defeated.Battle of Khajwa After his defeat, Shuja retreated towards Bengal. He was pursued by the imperial army under Mir Jumla. Shuja put up a good fight against them. However, he was finally defeated in the last battle in April 1660. After each defeat, he had to face desertions in his own army, but he did not lose heart. He, rather, reorganised the army with renewed vigor. But when he was going to be surrounded at Tandah, and when he found that reorganisation of the army was no longer possible, he decided to leave Bengal for good and take shelter in Arakan.

After remaining for a month, they departed the city and boarded Arakanese ships on 12 May at Bhulua (near present-day Noakhali, Bangladesh). The party first arrived at Chittagong and remained for some time. From here, they took the land route to Arakan, which is still called Shuja Road. Thousands of palanquins were used to carry Shuja's harem, and he himself performed Eid prayers at an Eidgah in Dulahzara.Sunīti Bhūshaṇa Kānunago, A History of Chittagong: From ancient times down to 1761 (1988), p. 305 =Death and aftermath= Shuja and his entourage arrived in Arakan on 26 August 1660,Niccolao Manucci, Storia do Mogor or History of Mughal India, translator William Irvine and were greeted at the capital, Mrauk U, with courtesy. The Arakanese king, the powerful Sanda Thudhamma, had previously agreed to provide ships for Shuja and his family to travel to Mecca, where the prince had planned to spend the remainder of his life. The half a dozen camel-loads of gold and jewels that the Mughal royals had brought with them was beyond anything that had previously been seen in Arakan.Edward James Rapson, Sir Wolseley Haig, Sir Richard Burn, The Cambridge History of India Vol. IV: The Mughal Period (1937), p. 480 After eight months and numerous excuses however, Sanda Thudhamma's promise of ships had not materialised. Finally, the latter demanded the hand of Shuja's daughter in marriage, which the prince refused. Sanda Thudhamma responded by ordering the Mughals to leave within three days. Unable to move and being refused provisions at the bazars, Shuja resolved to attempt to overthrow the king. The prince had two hundred soldiers with him, as well as the support of the local Muslims, giving him a good chance of success. However, Sanda Thudhamma was forewarned of the coup attempt. Shuja was therefore forced to set fire to the city in the hopes of cutting his way out in the confusion. Much of his entourage was captured, and though he himself initially escaped into the jungle, he was later captured and executed. Shuja's wealth was taken and melted down by Sanda Thudhamma, who took the Mughal princesses into his harem. He married the eldest, an event that was subsequently celebrated in song and poetry. The following year however, suspicious of another coup, Sanda Thudhamma had Shuja's sons decapitated and his daughters (including the pregnant eldest) starved to death. Aurangzeb, angered by the deaths, ordered a campaign against the kingdom. After an intensive siege, the Mughals captured Chittagong and thousands of Arakanese were taken into slavery. Arakan was unable to return to its previous dominance and Sanda Thudhamma's eventual death was followed by a century of chaos.

Common explanations of their sightings have been attributed to oarfish, elongated fish with red crests; however, these are exclusively marine and usually live at great depths. People in both Laos and Thailand attribute the naga fireballs phenomenon to these creatures. Folklore Thai folklore holds the Phaya Naga to be semi-divine, demi- creatures, which possess supernatural powers as has been described in Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. The \\"Kamchanod Forest\\" (ป่าคำชะโนด; ) Ban Dung District, Udon Thani province, which is held in high reverence and fear across Thailand, is believed to be the border between the human world and the netherworld, and is frequently depicted in Thai folklore as the site of many hauntings, but more frequently is considered to be the home of the Naga. In Shan folklore of Nanzhao Kingdom (now southern China and Southeast Asia during the 8th and 9th centuries, which was centered on present-day Yunnan in China.) believed Erhai lake is inhabited of Naga and is the creator of the Mekong. Appearance Many people, particularly in Isan (northeastern region of Thailand), believe that the Naga are responsible for unnatural wave phenomena occurring in the rivers or lakes in the vicinity. It is also frequently claimed that the serpent-like demigods are responsible for marks on common objects, such as car hoods or house walls. A police office has also claimed to be in contact with the Naga, although the implications of this contact is not thoroughly explained. In attempts to explain these phenomena scientists and researchers at the Faculty of Science of Chulalongkorn University have attributed these seemingly preternatural phenomena to standing waves in water, and posit that the existence of Phaya Naga is similar to belief in Loch Ness Monster in Scotland or Ogopogo in Canada, and further maintain that the serpent-like tracks of the Phaya Naga are very possibly forged by humans. History Lao mythology maintains that the Naga are the protectors of Vientiane, and by extension, the Lao state. The Naga association was most clearly articulated during and immediately after the reign of Anouvong. An important poem from this period San Lup Bo Sun (or San Leupphasun Lao: ສານລຶພສູນ) discusses relations between Laos and Siam in a veiled manner, using the Naga and the Garuda, to represent Laos and Siam, respectively. The Naga is incorporated extensively into Lao iconography, and features prominently in Lao culture throughout the length of the country, not only in Vientiane. Popular culture Many Lakorn (Thai television soap opera) are based on a Phaya Naga legend, such as Poot Mae Nam Khong (ภูติแม่น้ำโขง) in 2008, Manisawat (มณีสวาท) in 2013 or Nakee (นาคี) in 2016. A search for the Phya Naga was recently featured in a Destination Truth episode on the SyFy (formerly Sci-Fi Channel) series in Series 01 (episode 02).

It was the first signature model guitar released by Fender.https://reverb.com/news/the-origins-of-fender-signature- guitars Background Eric Clapton played a range of different Fender and Gibson models while playing in The Yardbirds and Cream. In 1970, for his landmark Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs with Derek and the Dominos, Clapton started using a sunburst 1956 Stratocaster which he later nicknamed Brownie that he had bought in May 1967 while in Cream. While on tour with the Dominos, Clapton visited Sho-Bud Music in Nashville where he bought a further six mid-50s Stratocasters for around $100 each. On his return to the UK he gave one to George Harrison, one to Pete Townshend and a third to Steve Winwood. The remaining three each had attractive qualities that Clapton combined in a single instrument. He took the body from a black 1956 Stratocaster he liked the look of, the neck from a 1957 Stratocaster he liked the feel of and the electronics loaded pickguard from another Stratocaster that sounded better than the others, constructing Blackie that was to be his main instrument from 1970 until its retirement from active service in 1985. Eric Clapton playing Blackie In 1985, Dan Smith approached Clapton to discuss a plan to create a signature guitar built to his own specifications. Clapton asked Fender to make a guitar with the distinctive V-shape neck of his Martin acoustic as well as a \\"compressed\\" pickup sound. Based on Clapton's brief, Fender made two early prototypes: one with a neck based on measurements taken from Blackie and one with a slightly softer V shape which Clapton ultimately deemed preferable. Both prototypes featured electronics based on the Elite Stratocaster including its 12 dB MDX mid-boost circuit intended to make the Stratocaster's single-coils sound more like a humbucker. Clapton liked the boost circuit but asked for more dynamic range, prompting Fender to replace the \\"Elite\\" pickups with Gold Lace Sensor pickups and an updated MDX circuit that had been tweaked up to deliver 25 dB of boost in the midrange at around 500 Hz. Clapton first used Gold Lace Sensors on three prototype signature models built by George Blanda and Michael Stevens – one was finished in Torino Red and the other two in Pewter Grey Metallic – in the \\"Prince's Trust Concert\\", in June 1986. Features The first early prototypes made around 1986–87 featured a 21-fret neck, a 21 dB mid-boost circuit, an active/passive toggle switch (which has been deleted on the final release) and Schaller locking strap buttons. The final product (released in 1988) is essentially a vintage 1957 reissue Stratocaster featuring a deeply contoured select alder body, a 1-piece soft \\"V\\"-shaped maple neck fitted with 22 vintage-style frets, flat 9,5\\" radius and BiFlex truss-rod system, a \\"blocked\\" original American Vintage synchronized tremolo, Gotoh/Kluson tuning machines, 1-ply white pickguard and three Fender Gold Lace Sensor pickups powered by an active MDX mid-boost circuit with 25 dB of gain and TBX tone controls, which helped augment the tone of the sound delivered, opening up a wider tonal range Clapton desired. One of the unique features of this guitar was the inclusion of an original vintage synchronized tremolo bridge blocked off to tremolo arms by a small piece of wood wedged into the bridge cavity. This idea came about as Clapton liked the tone and tuning stability of hardtail Stratocasters and had no use for the whammy bar. In 1991 Clapton agreed to have his signature model with a rosewood fretboard as well to suit the needs of players disliking the feel of maple-neck models. Only 94 of these short-lived guitars were made and their production finally came into a halt. The Lace Sensors in the Clapton Signature Stratocaster were replaced with Fender Vintage Noiseless pickups in 2001 (although Clapton began using the new pickups on his personal guitars in March 2000 and was occasionally seen playing Lace Sensor-equipped Stratocasters until 2010). The Vintage Noiseless pickups were previously available as a standard equipment material on the Fender American Deluxe Series guitars produced before 2004. The Custom Shop version (introduced in 2004) is available in Midnight Blue, Mercedes Blue, Black and Gold Leaf with gold-plated hardware (also available with a \\"Thinskin\\" nitrocellulose lacquer finish in Olympic White, Torino Red and Pewter, as well as a left-handed version). The Eric Clapton Custom Journeyman Relic Stratocaster, introduced in 2017, features a 2-piece select ash body, available in 2-Colour Sunburst and Aged White Blonde. Since their introduction in 2004, all Custom Shop Clapton Stratocasters (Team Built and Master Built) used a standard tone control instead of a TBX tone circuit. The TBX feature has been re-introduced in 2009 on \\"Team Built\\" versions; only the \\"Master Built\\" models had a normal tone control. Construction and design variations Several variations of Clapton's personal guitar were made by the Fender Custom Shop throughout the years, including fancy versions with ash bodies, quilted or maple tops, abalone dot position inlays, matching headstocks, gold hardware and white pearloid pickguards, made by Senior Master Builder J. W. Black. Many of these guitars were sold for charity auctions for the Crossroads Centre of Antigua, the drug and alcohol addiction rehabilitation facility founded on the small, idyllic Caribbean island in 1998. They include the Gold Leaf Stratocaster of 1996 (used during the Legends and Montserrat concerts in 1997) and the Crashocasters (signature model Stratocasters hand-painted by New York-based street artist John Matos, better known as Crash), used by Clapton from 2001 to 2004. The Gold Leaf Stratocaster The original Gold Leaf guitar was built by Fender Master Builders Mark Kendrick and John Luis Campo as a custom order for Eric Clapton at the time of the 50th Anniversary of the firm in 1996. Clapton used the guitar for his 1997 Far-Eastern tour, the European Legends jazz concerts with Marcus Miller, Joe Sample, Steve Gadd and David Sanborn and the Montserrat benefit concert at the Royal Albert Hall before selling it to Christies for US $455,000. The Fender Custom Shop reissued the Gold Leaf Stratocaster after 8 years of absence as a limited-edition run of 50 pieces. Each guitar was built to Eric's exacting specifications, with Fender's Vintage Noiseless pickups and a standard tone control instead of the Gold Lace Sensor pickups and TBX tone circuit (re-introduced in 2009) found on the original 1996 model. The John Matos \\"Crashocasters\\" In January 2007, visual artist John \\"Crash\\" Matos finished painting the 50th guitar body for a limited edition run of Stratocasters (50 total) from the Fender Custom Shop. The project, which Matos began in late 2004, was inspired by the graffiti-style Stratocaster bodies he had painted for Eric Clapton, one of which, known as Crash-3, was sold in the 2004 Christie's Eric Clapton Crossroads Auction for $321,000. Since the beginning of the Custom Shop project in 2004, Crash has chronicled his work on the 50 Fender Custom Shop guitars (referred to in this article as the Fender Custom Shop Crashocasters) in his online Modern Guitars journal titled \\"Crash Pad\\". Limited Edition Crossroads Signature Guitar and Amp Set Fender introduced a matching set of limited-edition Crossroads instruments, which consisted of an Eric Clapton Crossroads Signature Stratocaster (better known as the \\"Sun Strat\\" and produced in a limited run of 100 instruments globally) and a Crossroads '57 Twin-Amp (produced in a limited run of 50 pieces). Each guitar is crafted to Clapton's exacting specifications and bear a unique \\"Crossroads Antigua\\" smiling sun graphic designed and originally hand-drawn by Eric Clapton himself. The commemorative Crossroads '57 Twin-Amps are modeled after the original '57 Twin. This limited-edition amplifier features a custom engraved commemorative \\"Crossroads 2007\\" badge autographed by Eric and his \\"Crossroads Antigua\\" graphic is artistically embedded on the grill cloth. Bearing in mind the number of changes he makes with regards to neck dimensions, Clapton fans purchasing this will be getting an exact replica as used at the Crossroads Guitar Festivals 2007, 2010, 2013 & 2019\\\\. 2009 Limited Edition Daphne Blue & EC Grey Stratocasters In 2009, the Custom Shop released an exact representation of Clapton's Daphne Blue Stratocaster used during his recent Australasian tours held from February 12 to March 10, 2009, as well as a faithful replication of the EC Grey model he uses since his 2006/07 world tours.

Discontinued in 2011. 10th Anniversary Crossroads Antigua Stratocaster In 1978 Fender introduced the Antigua finish on a number of models from the flagship Stratocaster to the classic Coronado Bass. Described as a \\"rich antique-white finish with halo-mist shading\\", it became highly prized among collectors around the world. The first Antigua prototype model was awarded to its creator Martin DeCasas who worked on color schemes for Fender from July 1964 till its closing in Fullerton, California in February 1985. In 2008 Sam Ash Music incorporated the spirit of the Eric Clapton Stratocaster with the spirit of the Crossroads Centre, commissioning a limited run of only 100 pieces of the signature model in the classic Antigua finish along with a commitment to donate $100,000 to the Crossroads Centre. This exclusive instrument is currently being built by the Fender Custom Shop to Clapton's exacting specifications. Features include a select alder body, 1-piece maple neck with soft \\"V\\" shape, 22 vintage style frets, 3 Vintage Noiseless pickups, “blocked” American Vintage synchronized tremolo, active mid-boost circuit (with a TBX tone control as of 2009) and vintage black case. Each instrument is individually numbered from 1 through 100 and comes with an official certificate of authenticity.

Engraving by M A Rooker after a drawing by Thomas Sandby Example of Smythson's work at Hardwick Hall Robert Smythson (1535 – 15 October 1614) was an English architect. Smythson designed a number of notable houses during the Elizabethan era. Little is known about his birth and upbringing--his first mention in historical records comes in 1556, when he was stonemason for the house at Longleat, built by Sir John Thynne (ca. 1512-1580). He later designed Hardwick Hall, Wollaton Hall, Burton Agnes Hall, and other significant projects. Historically, a number of other Elizabethan houses, such as Gawthorpe Hall have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds. In Britain at this time, the profession of architect was in its most embryonic stage of development. Smythson was trained as a stonemason, and by the 1560s was travelling England as a master mason leading his own team of masons. In 1568 he moved from London to Wiltshire to commence work on the new house at Longleat for Sir John Thynne; he worked there for almost eighteen years, carving personally much of the external detail, and he is believed to have had a strong influence on the overall design of the building. In 1580 he moved to his next project--Wollaton Hall. At Wollaton he was clearly more a \\"surveyor\\" (the term at that time for an architect) than a stonemason, and was in charge of overall construction.Mark Girouard, Hardwick Hall, The National Trust, 2006. Smythson's style was more than a fusion of influences; although Renaissance, especially Sebastiano Serlio, Flemish and English Gothic notes can be seen in his work, he produced some ingenious adaptations, resulting in classically detailed, innovative domestic buildings. Hardwick in particular is noted for its use of glass. Smythson died at Wollaton in 1614 and is buried in the parish church there; his memorial includes these words \\"Architecter (sic) and Surveyor unto the most worthy house of Wollaton with divers others of great account.\\" Mark Girouard, Robert Smythson & the Elizabethan Country House 1983; pp. 82-83. His son John Smythson (Bolsover Castle) and grandson Huntingdon Smithson (as he spelt the family name) were also architects.

Ladd Memorial Stadium) is a stadium located in Mobile, Alabama. Opened in 1948, it has a seating capacity of 33,471. It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field for the Senior Bowl, the LendingTree Bowl, and, through the 2019 season, the University of South Alabama Jaguars. After the 2019 season, the Jaguars moved to the new on-campus Hancock Whitney Stadium. In addition to football, the stadium is also used for concerts (maximum capacity 50,000), boxing matches, high school graduations, trade shows, and festivals. Numerous entertainers have performed at Ladd–Peebles Stadium. History The stadium was constructed in 1948 with private funding from a local banker wishing to create a permanent honor to his mentor, Ernest F. Ladd, a local banking magnate who died in 1941, with the stadium initially carrying the name \\"Ernest F. Ladd Memorial Stadium\\". On May 4 and 5 of 1955, a tour headlining country and western stars Hank Snow, Faron Young, The Wilburn Brothers, Mother Maybel, The Carter Sisters (including June, the future Mrs Johnny Cash), Jimmy Rogers Snow, The Davis Sisters, Onie Wheeler and a still unknown Elvis Presley played two nightly shows there. More than 40 years later, in 1997, it was renamed \\"Ladd-Peebles Stadium\\", continuing to honor Ladd, but also honoring E. B. Peebles, a civic leader who was instrumental in the revitalization of the Senior Bowl. =Renovations= In 1997, Ladd–Peebles Stadium underwent a $8.1 million renovation that resulted in a new press box featuring a 120-seat club level and luxury suites, new scoreboards, new PA and lighting systems, new locker rooms, new restrooms, an expansion of the concourse areas, and new concession stands, as well as the stadium offices. In 2004, the stadium selected and installed FieldTurf as its new playing surface. On December 6, 2008, the Board of Trustees at the University of South Alabama approved adding football to its intercollegiate athletics program. The move came with the announcement that the team would call Ladd–Peebles Stadium home for at least seven years. In 2020, the Jaguars moved to their new on campus stadium.BOARD OF TRUSTEES VOTES TO ADD NCAA FOOTBALL The stadium underwent a $2.2 million facelift which also includes the construction of 11 luxury sky boxes on the stadium's west side. The project was finished at the beginning of the 2009 season. Events The stadium's first game was in 1948, between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Vanderbilt Commodores on October 2, with the Tide scoring on the final play for a From 1948 to 1968, with the exceptions of 1960 and 1962, the Crimson Tide played one game per year in Ladd Stadium. In 1958, legendary head coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant coached his first game as Alabama's head coach in Ladd Stadium when the Crimson Tide fell 13–3 to LSU. Notable Tigers that year were Billy Cannon and Johnny Robinson. The Senior Bowl played its inaugural edition at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville in January 1950, then moved to Mobile, where it was played in Ladd–Peebles until January 2020. The game will move to the University of South Alabama's on-campus Hancock Whitney Stadium in 2021. Ladd–Peebles Stadium also played host to numerous other major college games over the years. Auburn played eight games at Ladd from 1948 to 1955, playing the likes of Clemson, Florida, and Ole Miss. The University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg was also a consistent Ladd Stadium tenant, as the Golden Eagles played seventeen games there from 1950 through 1974; opponents included Texas A&M;, Florida State, and Alabama. Beginning in 1974, the stadium began hosting the Gulf Coast Classic, an Alabama State University homecoming game against a fellow Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) opponent. In 1988, the stadium hosted the first-ever Alabama-Mississippi All- Star Classic, an annual football event that features the best senior high school players and top collegiate prospects from Mississippi against the best from Alabama. The event has since been moved to Montgomery and is now played in December. In December 1999, the stadium hosted the inaugural Mobile Alabama Bowl. Held annually since then, the game has undergone several name changes due to sponsorship agreements; it is known as the LendingTree Bowl. Formerly matching teams from the Mid-American Conference and Conference USA, the bowl announced a new agreement in 2009 to annually feature teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Mid-American Conference beginning with the 2010 game. The agreement, however, was canceled after one year and the bowl's matchup now consists of the Mid-American Conference facing the Sun Belt Conference. On September 13, 2014, attendance at a game between the South Alabama Jaguars and the Mississippi State Bulldogs was 38,129; it was the first sell-out in the Jaguars' football history; however, the Bulldogs won, 35–3. On August 21, 2015, from 20,000 to 30,000 people gathered at the stadium for a rally for 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump.

It is located at the foot of the Galtee Mountains and at the western approach to the Glen of Aherlow. The Aherlow River, flowing down from the Galtee mountains, runs by the village, to meet the Suir at Kilmoyler a short distance north of Cahir. Galbally is in a valley overlooked by the Galtee Mountains. History Megalithic passage tomb at Duntryleague near Galbally Moor Abbey ruins, Galbally A number of archaeological sites and buildings in the Galbally area are included in the Record of Protected Structures. Among these is \\"Darby's Bed\\", a passage tomb which sits on a nearby hill in the townland of Duntryleague. It is cited in Irish legend as one of the places where Diarmuid and Grainne spent a night during their flight from the angry Fionn MacCumhaill. Also located just outside the village is Moor Abbey. This Franciscan friary was founded in the thirteenth century by Donach Cairbreach Ua'Briain. The only standing building from site is the friary's church, which was built in 1471. The site had a tumultuous history, matching the ebbs and flows of Irish politics and religious freedoms, and was inhabited until 1748, though with periods of desertion. Present in the church is the remains of a tomb, which is perhaps that of the founder. In the centre of Galbally's village square is a statue of a soldier, erected in memory of named local volunteers who lost their lives during the War of Independence in 1921. The south side of the square was the site of a poor house during famine times. Charles Bianconi's carriages used to drive through the village, and the stables they used still stand on the north side of the village square. The Barons Massy of Duntryleague had their original seat in the area and their Charnel house (burial place) is still extant. The Massy's, an English family of Norman descent, received land in county Limerick in the Cromwellian plantation, and settled in Duntryleague, in the parish of Galbally. The family played a prominent role in the Anglo-Irish ascendancy class up to the 20th century. Their Summer house, Massy Lodge, stands near the neighbouring village of Anglesborough. Also located at Duntryleague are the remains of a Protestant church tower and a graveyard. A number of the graves are occupied by the Bennett family, who had owned nearby Gleneffy House Estate (also known as Castle Creagh) from the 1680s until the 1920s. William H Massy Bennett, a Justice of the Peace, was the last Bennett to live there. He died in 1920 and it was sold by his son George Latham Massy Bennett in an auction in July 1920. In 1826 the Rev P Fitzgerald referred to Castle Creagh as \\"a very handsome seat of the Bennet family, now in ruins\\" in his History of Limerick. The current Gleneffy House was built for William's father, George Latham Bennett by the architect Charles Frederick Anderson in the 1850s, it stands on the site of the older castle, mentioned by the Rev Fitzgerald, and is located on the hillside of the Glen of Aherlow to the north of Galbally. It is now a private residence.  Amenities  Galbally hosts amenities and services include a number of pubs, a carpenters, undertakers, shops, a chipper, a number of B&Bs;, a village museum/gallery, and an equestrian centre. The village's sporting facilities include: pitches for field sports, a community field, and \\"all weather\\" astro-turf facilities. The village's Catholic church, the Church of Christ the King, is within the ecclesiastical parish of Galbally & Lisvernane which straddles the Limerick-Tipperary border. Its 'sister' village within this parish is the village of Lisvernane, which lies in the Glen of Aherlow in County Tipperary.  Community and clubs  Although the Gaelic Athletic Association usually has one club in each parish, there are two in this parish: Galbally, on the Limerick side, and Aherlow, across the border in Tipperary. While each club plays hurling to some extent, gaelic football is the primary sport, and both clubs have won their respective county senior football championships, Aherlow winning the Tipperary title for the first time in 2006. Galbally were first-time winners of the Limerick Senior Football Championship in 1994 and repeated the feat in 1997. Galbally also won the 1995 County Junior B Hurling title, captained by John Kiely, who went on to manage the Limerick county hurling team to victory in the 2018 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final. Galbally Camogie Club fields teams from under 12 to Senior. Galbally is also home to the Mooreabbey Milers AC running club. In 1994, Galbally was selected as the 'prettiest town in Ireland' in the annual Irish Tidy Towns Competition, and has won the Limerick competition nine times.  Popular culture  A folk ballad, The Galbally Farmer, tells of the trials suffered by a hired labourer working for the miserly farmer of the title, Darby O'Leary.

Adapted from the Toyota Production System,Yasuhiro Monden (1998), Toyota Production System, An Integrated Approach to Just-In-Time, Third edition, Norcross, GA: Engineering & Management Press, . it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the Agile community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support agile organizations.  Origin  The term lean software development originated in a book by the same name, written by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck in 2003. The book restates traditional lean principles, as well as a set of 22 tools and compares the tools to corresponding agile practices. The Poppendiecks' involvement in the agile software development community, including talks at several Agile conferences Mary Poppendieck: \\"The role of leadership in software development\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypEMdjslEOI has resulted in such concepts being more widely accepted within the agile community.  Lean principles  Lean development can be summarized by seven principles, very close in concept to lean manufacturing principles: #Eliminate waste #Amplify learning #Decide as late as possible #Deliver as fast as possible #Empower the team #Build integrity in #Optimize the whole = Eliminate waste = Lean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste (muda). Such waste may include: # Partially done work # Extra features # Relearning # Task switching # Waiting # Handoffs # Defects # Management activities Industry research revealed these software development wastes: # Building the wrong feature or product # Mismanaging the backlog # Rework # Unnecessarily complex solutions # Extraneous cognitive load # Psychological distress # Waiting/multitasking # Knowledge loss # Ineffective communication. In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste. Partially done coding eventually abandoned during the development process is waste. Extra features like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Switching people between tasks is waste. Waiting for other activities, teams, processes is waste. Relearning required to complete work is waste. Defects and lower quality are waste. Managerial overhead not producing real value is waste. A value stream mapping technique is used to identify waste. The second step is to point out sources of waste and to eliminate them. Waste- removal should take place iteratively until even seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated. = Amplify learning = Software development is a continuous learning process based on iterations when writing code. Software design is a problem-solving process involving the developers writing the code and what they have learned. Software value is measured in fitness for use and not in conformance to requirements. Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building. The process of user requirements gathering could be simplified by presenting screens to the end-users and getting their input. The accumulation of defects should be prevented by running tests as soon as the code is written. The learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles – each one coupled with refactoring and integration testing. Increasing feedback via short feedback sessions with customers helps when determining the current phase of development and adjusting efforts for future improvements. During those short sessions, both customer representatives and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solutions for further development. Thus the customers better understand their needs, based on the existing result of development efforts, and the developers learn how to better satisfy those needs. Another idea in the communication and learning process with a customer is set-based development – this concentrates on communicating the constraints of the future solution and not the possible solutions, thus promoting the birth of the solution via dialogue with the customer. = Decide as late as possible = As software development is always associated with some uncertainty, better results should be achieved with a set-based or options-based approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions. The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it, thus enabling the delay of important and crucial commitments. The iterative approach promotes this principle – the ability to adapt to changes and correct mistakes, which might be very costly if discovered after the release of the system. :With set-based development: If a new brake system is needed for a car, for example, three teams may design solutions to the same problem. Each team learns about the problem space and designs a potential solution. As a solution is deemed unreasonable, it is cut. At the end of a period, the surviving designs are compared and one is chosen, perhaps with some modifications based on learning from the others - a great example of deferring commitment until the last possible moment. Software decisions could also benefit from this practice to minimize the risk brought on by big up-front design. Additionally, there would then be multiple implementations that work correctly, yet are different (implementation-wise, internally). These could be used to implement fault-tolerant systems which check all inputs and outputs for correctness, across the multiple implementations, simultaneously. An agile software development approach can move the building of options earlier for customers, thus delaying certain crucial decisions until customers have realized their needs better. This also allows later adaptation to changes and the prevention of costly earlier technology-bounded decisions. This does not mean that no planning should be involved – on the contrary, planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation, as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action. Evaluating different options is effective as soon as it is realized that they are not free, but provide the needed flexibility for late decision making. = Deliver as fast as possible = In the era of rapid technology evolution, it is not the biggest that survives, but the fastest. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration. The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team. With speed, decisions can be delayed. Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday. This gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge. Customers value rapid delivery of a quality product. The just-in- time production ideology could be applied to software development, recognizing its specific requirements and environment. This is achieved by presenting the needed result and letting the team organize itself and divide the tasks for accomplishing the needed result for a specific iteration. At the beginning, the customer provides the needed input. This could be simply presented in small cards or stories – the developers estimate the time needed for the implementation of each card. Thus the work organization changes into self- pulling system – each morning during a stand-up meeting, each member of the team reviews what has been done yesterday, what is to be done today and tomorrow, and prompts for any inputs needed from colleagues or the customer. This requires transparency of the process, which is also beneficial for team communication. The myth underlying with this principle is haste makes waste. However, lean implementation has provided that it is a good practice to deliver fast in order to see and analyze the output at the earliest. = Empower the team = There has been a traditional belief in most businesses about the decision-making in the organization – the managers tell the workers how to do their own job. In a work-out technique, the roles are turned – the managers are taught how to listen to the developers, so they can explain better what actions might be taken, as well as provide suggestions for improvements. The lean approach follows the agile principle \\"build projects around motivated individuals [...] and trust them to get the job done\\", encouraging progress, catching errors, and removing impediments, but not micro-managing. Another mistaken belief has been the consideration of people as resources. People might be resources from the point of view of a statistical data sheet, but in software development, as well as any organizational business, people do need something more than just the list of tasks and the assurance that they will not be disturbed during the completion of the tasks. People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for – purpose within the reachable reality, with the assurance that the team might choose its own commitments. The developers should be given access to the customer; the team leader should provide support and help in difficult situations, as well as ensure that skepticism does not ruin the team’s spirit. Respecting people and acknowledging their work is one way to empower the team. = Build integrity in = The customer needs to have an overall experience of the system. This is the so-called perceived integrity: how it is being advertised, delivered, deployed, accessed, how intuitive its use is, its price and how well it solves problems. Conceptual integrity means that the system’s separate components work well together as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and responsiveness. This could be achieved by understanding the problem domain and solving it at the same time, not sequentially. The needed information is received in small batch pieces – not in one vast chunk - preferably by face-to-face communication and not any written documentation. The information flow should be constant in both directions – from customer to developers and back, thus avoiding the large stressful amount of information after long development in isolation. One of the healthy ways towards integral architecture is refactoring. As more features are added to the original code base, the harder it becomes to add further improvements. Refactoring is about keeping simplicity, clarity, minimum number of features in the code. Repetitions in the code are signs of bad code designs and should be avoided. The complete and automated building process should be accompanied by a complete and automated suite of developer and customer tests, having the same versioning, synchronization and semantics as the current state of the system. At the end the integrity should be verified with thorough testing, thus ensuring the System does what the customer expects it to. Automated tests are also considered part of the production process, and therefore if they do not add value they should be considered waste. Automated testing should not be a goal, but rather a means to an end, specifically the reduction of defects. = Optimize the Whole = Modern software systems are not simply the sum of their parts, but also the product of their interactions. Defects in software tend to accumulate during the development process – by decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks, and by standardizing different stages of development, the root causes of defects should be found and eliminated. The larger the system, the more organizations that are involved in its development and the more parts are developed by different teams, the greater the importance of having well defined relationships between different vendors, in order to produce a system with smoothly interacting components. During a longer period of development, a stronger subcontractor network is far more beneficial than short-term profit optimizing, which does not enable win-win relationships. Lean thinking has to be understood well by all members of a project, before implementing in a concrete, real-life situation. \\"Think big, act small, fail fast; learn rapidly\\" – these slogans summarize the importance of understanding the field and the suitability of implementing lean principles along the whole software development process. Only when all of the lean principles are implemented together, combined with strong \\"common sense\\" with respect to the working environment, is there a basis for success in software development.  Lean software practices  Lean software development practices, or what the Poppendiecks call \\"tools\\" are restated slightly from the original equivalents in agile software development. Examples of such practices include: * Seeing waste * Value stream mapping * Set-based development * Pull systems * Queuing theory * Motivation * Measurements * Test-driven development *Trunk-based development Since agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto, lean software development is considered an agile software development method.

Uniglory containers are similarly painted and marked, but those containers are bright orange. Evergreen's refrigerated \\"reefer\\" containers have a reverse color scheme (white containers with green lettering).  History  Evergreen Marine Building on Sec.2, Minsheng East Road, Taipei City, Taiwan. The \\"Thalassa Hellas\\" on its maiden voyage The company was founded 1 September 1968 by Yung-Fa Chang. Services began with a single cargo vessel named Central Trust, which operated a \\"go-anywhere\\" service. A second vessel was added in 1969, and used on Middle East services. Additional vessels were acquired through the 1970s, and routes to East Asia and Central America were added. Service to the U.S. began in 1974, with the establishment of Evergreen Marine Corporation (New York) Ltd. In 1981, the parent company changed its name to Evergreen International S.A. (EIS), as the company increased its global expansion efforts. Evergreen Marine began its first circumnavigation shipping services in 1984. This service is bi-directional, covering both westbound and eastbound routings. Since then, Evergreen Marine has expanded to include other shipping companies such as the Uniglory Marine Corp. (Taiwan) in 1984, the Hatsu Marine Ltd. (U.K.) in 2002, and the Italian shipping company Italia Marittima (previously Lloyd Triestino, and founded as \\"Österreichischer Lloyd\\" in 1835) in 1993. Uniglory was made a division of the company in 1999. Evergreen Marine has also become a partner of EVA Airways, founded in 1989, and Uni Air, founded in 1998. In 2002, Evergreen Marine operated 61 container vessels, with a total fleet size totaling 130 vessels with 400,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units). By 2008, Evergreen Marine operated 178 container vessels.Taiwan's Evergreen Marine to build 100 container ships In 2009, the company announced plans to build 100 additional vessels, in anticipation of a global economic recovery by 2012. Operations Evergreen's trademark green worldwide shipping containers. Evergreen Marine's operations primarily center around five general routings: *East Asia to North America/Central America *East Asia to Northern Europe/Mediterranean *Europe to North America (transatlantic) *East Asia to Southern Hemisphere (intercontinental) *Intra-Asia The shipping line's busiest routings are in the first category, East Asia to North America and Central America. Within this area, common traffic is between China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan with the U.S. West Coast, along with routings to the East Caribbean via Panama.  Fleet  Evergreen \\"Ever U\\" type vessel.

It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on May 14, 2000. After a failed marriage attempt with Otto, Becky (played by guest actress Parker Posey) stays with the Simpson family. However, Marge begins to get paranoid at her family's newfound love of Becky, and begins to think that she is seducing Homer. The episode was directed by Steven Dean Moore and written by Larry Doyle. Doyle was assigned to write the episode based on actress Drew Barrymore's desire to appear in a Simpsons episode; Barrymore instead appeared in a later episode and the guest role of this episode was given to Posey. Plot Each student in Bart's class is given a video camera for a school project to create a movie. Otto drives the school bus to a drive- through restaurant where his girlfriend Becky works. Otto proposes to her, and she accepts. On Bart's suggestion, they decide to have the wedding at the Simpson house and sends out flyers. Marge reluctantly agrees, since she still has everything from Apu's wedding. The wedding is a success up until the point when Otto gets a Poison tribute band (called Cyanide) to play \\"Nothin' but a Good Time\\". Becky admits to Marge that she hates heavy metal music. At the wedding, Marge suggests to Becky that she gives Otto an ultimatum: either her or heavy metal. Otto chooses heavy metal, and breaks up with Becky. Becky stays with the Simpson family, on Bart's suggestion. Marge consoles her, but when Becky begins to help out around the house and is praised for her contribution, Marge begins to worry that her family likes Becky more than her. Eventually, she becomes paranoid and suspects that Becky is trying to kill her, after her car will not stop on a steep road. Later, Becky and the rest of the family meet without Marge at an ice cream parlor, and Becky tells everyone that she has found a new apartment and is moving out. After she buys an unusually large bowl of ice cream, Homer freaks out upon the presence of so much ice cream and suddenly collapses. Becky gives him mouth-to-mouth but Marge comes in, thinking she is kissing him. She grabs a cone and smashes it like a glass bottle, to attack Becky. Marge is arrested and declared insane. When Marge escapes from the courtroom and goes to the library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find the family and Becky enacting an S&M; scene: Lisa is stuck to the wall, Maggie is stuck in a cage, and Becky about to sacrifice a tied-up Homer with a knife. Before she can kill him, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her, but the scene is revealed to be a sequence Bart is filming for his school project. Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, who admits that she did intend to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she could not get a shovel. Suddenly, the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which do not take effect; Marge tells them that she has too much work to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage, and tells Homer to scrub and mop the room, since he is dressed for the job. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep. Production American actress Parker Posey played the role of Becky. The writers of The Simpsons were told that actress Drew Barrymore wanted to guest star in the series and pitched several possible episodes for her. These included what became the plot of this episode, with Barrymore voicing Becky, as well as another which would see her voice Krusty the Clown's daughter. The latter idea was used for the season twelve episode \\"Insane Clown Poppy\\", with Barrymore appearing as Krusty's daughter. Parker Posey was selected to voice Becky instead. Larry Doyle wrote the episode's script and named Becky after his wife.Doyle, Larry (2008). Commentary for \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Posey came in for at least two or three sessions worth of recording.Scully, Mike (2008). Commentary for \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. For Cyanide, the Poison tribute band, the producers unsuccessfully attempted to get Poison lead vocalist Bret Michaels to play the singer. Marc Wilmore, a writer on the show, voices one of the psychologists, formally known in the script as \\"Extra Guy\\".Selman, Matt (2008). Commentary for \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.Meyer, George (2008). Commentary for \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Scully gave the guest role to him as a thanks for his practical joke he played on fellow writer Matt Selman regarding East St. Louis and the season ten episode \\"They Saved Lisa's Brain\\". The producers got a censor note for the scene where Chief Wiggum teachers Ralph how to hold a gun in order to achieve a \\"kill shot\\". Steven Dean Moore directed the episode. The episode's couch gag involves Korean animators coloring blank paint-by-numbers figures of The Simpsons; these caricatures are based on Korean animators who worked in the United States at Film Roman, the show's animation production company.Moore, Steven Dean (2008). Commentary for \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The jimmies that Marge throws at the busboys are all variations of the character design that was used for the Squeaky Voiced Teen since the series' inception. At the time, the Simpsons writers thought the word \\"usurper\\" was funny, hence its numerous appearances in the episode. Selman, in the episode's audio commentary, recalled that it was hard to write so many misunderstandings; Scully commented, \\"It gives us a new appreciation for Three's Company.\\" Cultural references \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\" features several references to popular culture. In the episode, Otto meets Becky at Woodstock 1999, where he is on fire and the fire itself is put out by the water in her water bottle. This was a reference to a controversy about the high cost of water at the festival, and Otto being on fire references the large number of fires that occurred. Otto holds up a boombox and blares Poison's \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" whilst proposing to Becky. When Otto plays air guitar, it is completely accurate fingering: John Achenbach, a storyboard artist on the show, is an accomplished guitarist and provided demonstrations for the animators. When Krusty interviews Marge, it is a television static image of her face with an impersonator's lips in place of hers; this was an homage to a recurring skit from the show Late Night with Conan O'Brien in which Robert Smigel's lips would be placed on those of Bill Clinton or other famous people.Graham, Ian Maxtone (2008). Commentary for \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", in The Simpsons: The Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The idea was created by Brent Forrester, a former writer for The Simpsons who - in the early days of Late Night - sent the joke to Conan O'Brien, also a former writer for The Simpsons. Patty and Selma's line \\"the bitterness is strong in this one,\\" is a reference to Darth Vader's line \\"the Force is strong in this one\\" from the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. At the beginning of the episode, when Principal Skinner assigns the students with film projects, he tells them in advance that he doesn't want to see 30 Blair Witch knock- offs, a reference to the 1999 found footage horror film The Blair Witch Project. The episode itself is a loose parody of The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, a film mentioned by Marge's sister Selma. Becky's name appears to be a reference to the star of the movie, Rebecca DeMornay. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 14, 2000. On October 7, 2008, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Mike Scully, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Matt Selman, Larry Doyle, and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \\"Unusually, 'Mad' provides a pretty concise focus on only one story. The lead bit with Otto directly leads to the Marge plot, and it doesn’t go off on the usual tangents [...] And it works pretty well. 'Mad' isn’t the most inspired tale, but it does fine for itself.\\" References  External links  *\\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\" at The Simpsons.com Category:The Simpsons (season 11) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about weddings ","title":"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge"},{"id":"1902178","text":"Korina may refer to: * Korina language, an Arauan language of Brazil and Peru ** An alternative name of several other languages: see Culina language (disambiguation) * Korina people, indigenous people of Brazil and Peru * Korina Legaki * Korina Perkovac * Korina Perkovic * Korina Sanchez (born 1964), Filipino journalist * Terminalia superba, a large tree native to tropical western Africa (known as Korina in the US) See also * Corina (disambiguation) * Korin (disambiguation) * Korine * Korinna ","title":"Korina"},{"id":"1902179","text":"Rams RFC is an English rugby union club based near the village of Sonning on the outskirts of Reading in the county of Berkshire.

It is the remote, computer- mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word \\"reference\\" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using reference works, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a \\"virtual\\" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations. The terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition. The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is \\"virtual reference\\", with the secondary non-preferred term \\"digital reference\\" having gone out of use. \\"Chat reference\\" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, \\"synchronous virtual reference\\" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer- mediated communication that is sent and received at different times. History The earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by e-mail. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology. With the advent of the graphical World Wide Web, libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email. In the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as \\"AskA\\" services. An example of an AskA services is at the Internet Public Library. Providing remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years. For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries. Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services. The rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services. Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current cyberculture and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the \\"Google Generation\\", of users who have grown up with the internet. For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded Web 2.0 (online social media such as Facebook, YouTube, blogs, del.icio.us, Flickr, etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services. As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users. The range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.Murfin, Marjorie E. \\"Cost Analysis of Library Reference Services,\\" Advances in Library Administration and Organization, 11, 1993, pp. 1–36.Eakin, Lorraine, & Pomerantz, Jeffrey. \\"Virtual Reference, Real Money: Modeling Costs in Virtual Reference Services,\\" portal: Libraries and the Academy, 9, 2009, pp. 133-164. Forms of digital reference =Webforms= Webforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question. This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for. Creation of webforms requires design consideration. Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function. Aspects commonly found within webforms: *A return email address to send the answer to the question *The question being asked *The type of question *What sources have been consulted by the patron *How the patron is planning to use the information *Location of the patron (are they a library patron?) *A name to personalize the interaction *A date by which the information is needed *The type of sources being requested (print or electronic)Janes, Joseph. \\"Introduction to Reference Work in the Digital Age\\", pages 64-65. Neal-Schuman Publishers Inc., 2005. =Chat using commercial applications= Several applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Examples include QuestionPoint inside the library field and Tutor.com outside the library field. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk software. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co- browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre- scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting. =Chat using instant messaging= Instant messaging (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free. Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet. This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian. On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron. IM reference services may be for the use of in- house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public. Successful IM reference services will:Anderson, Rick. \\"IM Me\\", Library Journal 130 (April 1, 2005): 34-35. *Create a profile to convey information about the library and increase online presence. *Accept imperfection in conversations without spending time to go back and make corrections. Most words are recognizable through context. *Become familiar with and use accepted IM abbreviations such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud). *Don't panic. While speed is important it is more important to not feel rushed. At times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.Desai, Christina M. & Graves, Stephanie J. \\"Instruction via Instant Messaging reference: what’s happening?\\", The Electronic Library 24 (2) ( 2006): 174-189. Software for providing digital reference Virtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs. However, each program may have several distinct features.See the entries in the Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section, including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference. A knowledge base is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of frequently asked questions (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure. Online chat, or instant messaging (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature. Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language. Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff. The use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years. Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat. In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response. With the increase in use of text messaging (SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. Librarians can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging. Co-browsing, or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images. In the UK Virtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services.Barry, E et al (2010) Virtual Reference in UK academic libraries: The virtual enquiry project 2008–2009, Library Review, Vol. 59 (1) pp.40-55 A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service. UK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995,Woodhouse, S. (1998) Delivering the New Public Library: the role of the EARL Consortium, INFOCUS 3(1) in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK- wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide),Berube, L. (2005) People's Network Enquire: virtual reference in England, World Library and Information Congress: 71st IFLA General Conference and Council, August 14th - 18th 2005, Oslo, Norway. and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council),SLIC homepage: http://www.slainte.org.uk/slic/slicindex.htm using QuestionPoint and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. American Library Association's digital reference guidelines The definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components: # \\"Virtual reference is reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet technology to communicate with reference staff, without being physically present.

In March 2003, he testified as a defense witness for Milomir Stakić at his trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Stakić was later convicted of extermination, murder and persecutions and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment.

Beara was later convicted of genocide, extermination, murder, persecutions and sentenced to life imprisonment. In August 2011, responding to the claim that his work inspired Norwegian murderer Anders Behring Breivik, Trifković rejected the idea that his work was a basis for the actions of this \\"mentally deranged narcissistic psychopath\\" any more than the \\"Beatles have inspired Charles Manson.\\" In 2013 he testified on behalf of Radovan Karadžić. Trifković denied being a former spokesman for Karadžić at a time he was a journalist and analyst reporting on Karadžić's activities. He is also professor in Faculty of Political Science of University of Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Writings on Islam Trifković is the author of Sword of the Prophet: The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam, a book about the history and tenets of Islam which identifies the rise of Islamic fundamentalism as the greatest danger to Western values since the end of the Cold War. According to James Bissett, former Canadian ambassador to Yugoslavia and a close associate of Trifković, Trifković sees the source of this threat in the absence of separation of church and state under Islam - because Islam is a way of life, Muslims are required to subordinate themselves to the teachings of Allah and live as members of the total Islamic community, calling into question their ability to give their political loyalty to a non-Muslim state. Trifković considers this to be a particularly important issue for the countries of Western Europe, with a population of over 50 million Muslims, and the United States (approx. 3.3 million). Refusal of admission to Canada In February 2011, Canadian authorities refused to allow Trifković entry into Canada to address a meeting at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver.\\"Canada Ejects Serbian-American Scholar, Stops Speech At University\\" by R. Cort Kirkwood, The New American, 1 March 2011, accessed 3 April 2013 Trifković reported in the journal Chronicles that he was refused entry to Canada on 24 February 2011 on the \\"transparently spurious\\" grounds that he was \\"inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for being a proscribed senior official in the service of a government that, in the opinion of the minister, engages or has engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations, or genocide, a war crime or a crime against humanity within the meaning of subsections 6 (3) to (5) of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act.\\"\\"Banned from Canadistan\\" , Chronicles Magazine, 25 February 2011], accessed 10 March 2011 He claimed his \\"inadmissibility\\" was due to contacts with the Bosnian Serb leaders in the early 1990s but claimed that the Canadian authorities' grounds for refusing him admission were \\"transparently spurious\\" and they had in fact yielded to a Bosniak-inspired campaign against him. The Canadian Institute for the Research of Genocide alleged that Trifković was promoting hatred, antisemitism and Islamophobia and accused him of publicly denying what New American termed the \\"alleged\\" massacre of Bosniaks at Srebrenica in July 1995, found by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to be a crime of genocide.

It is one of many Yearly Meetings (YM's) of Friends around the world. A notable aspect of the Ireland YM is that it encompasses meetings with widely divergent Christian viewpoints from theologically conservative (evangelical) to theologically liberal. All meetings under its care are in the unprogrammed tradition. It also includes meetings both in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland. Structure In Ireland there are 27 local (preparative) meetings. These are grouped into 7 regional Monthly meetings, which are in turn grouped together in 3 provincial (quarterly) meetings. The three quarterly meetings together constitute the Ireland YM. There are between 1000 and 2000 Friends in Ireland. The Friendly Word is a bimonthly magazine published by Quakers in Ireland. The Friends Burial Ground, Dublin is in Temple Hill, Blackrock, Co. Dublin. History The Religious Society of Friends was introduced to Ireland by William Edmundson. He was born in Westmorland, England in 1627 but moved to Ireland in 1652. On a return trip to England, Edmundson was convinced of the truth of Quakerism under the teaching of James Nayler He went back to Ireland and set up a business in Lurgan, County Armagh. The first Friends meeting in Ireland took place in Edmundson's home there in 1654. Irish Quakers were known for entrepreneurship, setting up many businesses in Ireland, with many families such as the Goodbodys, Bewleys, Pims, Lambs, Jacobs, Edmundsons, Perrys and Bells were involved in milling, textiles, shipping, imports and exports, food and tobacco production, brewing, iron production and railways industries.A Quaker take on Irish Business History by Colm Keena, Irish Times, March 2, 2012.

Although the club is named after, and historically connected with, the Berkshire town of Reading, it is now located between Reading and Peppard and just over the boundary into the county of Oxfordshire. Reading Abbey was born in the early 1950s as a youth side meeting the playing demand of boys who went to non-rugby playing schools. As a consequence when they wanted adult rugby they were uncomfortable with the established hierarchy at the two clubs in town. So in 1956 they formed Abbey RFC and played in the Town's public park moving from pub to pub for changing and post match refreshments. By 1971 life had become more heterogeneous and the club scraped together the wherewithal to buy 22 acres of ground and by their own efforts three pitches and a clubhouse were built. With all the energy released by the change of venue and an ever-growing membership, it rapidly established itself as a leading club in the area for adult and youth rugby, three of whom have represented England at various youth levels. League rugby saw Abbey start in South West 1 East with a declared policy of amateurism aiming to cultivate rugby within the community; membership has thrived and leading it to adopt the name Reading Abbey; the club is proud that its finances are sound and the 22 acres are owned outright without any borrowings. Its playing fortunes have been equally stable for, bar a couple of years in one level below and one level above, Abbey has remained a constant dynamic force at the same level at which it entered the leagues. Abbey currently play four senior teams as well as a colts and a vets team. The first team and second team train together as a squad on Tuesdays and Thursday nights and the third team and fourth team train together as a development squad on Thursdays. All the senior teams, apart from the colts, play their matches on Saturday with the colts playing on Sundays. The first team play in South West 1 East, second team play in Berks/Bucks & Oxon Premier A and the Berkshire Cup, the thirds play in the Thames Valley Invitational League Division A and the colts play in the English Colts Club Knockout Cup and the OBB Colts Division one. Every Sunday the club is taken over by the mini and junior rugby. Mini's rugby is from under-5s to under-12s. They play in their age groups, mainly working on their core rugby skills and playing in semi- competitive friendly matches against other clubs. The juniors, who are under-13s to under-17s, train on Wednesday evenings and play matches on Sundays. Women's and girls' rugby is a growing force at Abbey. Each Sunday Abbey hosts a girls only training session for girls from 8 to 11 with an open door policy where any age girl can come and not be turned away.

A monoscope Early Cinema Television (UK) monoscope advertisement A monoscope was a special form of video camera tube which displayed a single still video image. The image was built into the tube, hence the name. The tube resembled a small cathode ray tube (CRT). Monoscopes were used beginning in the 1950s to generate TV test patterns and station logos. This type of test card generation system was technologically obsolete by the 1980s.  Design  The monoscope was similar in construction to a CRT, with an electron gun at one end and at the other, a metal target screen with an image formed on it. This was in the position where a CRT would have its phosphor-coated display screen. As the electron beam scanned the target, varying numbers of electrons were reflected from the different areas of the image. The reflected electrons were picked up by an internal electrode ring, producing a varying electrical signal which was amplified to become the video output of the tube. This signal reproduced an accurate still image of the target, so the monoscope was used to produce still images such as test patterns and station logo cards. For example, the classic Indian Head test card used by NBC, shown on the right was often produced using a monoscope.  Usage  Test Card G in this example Monoscopes were available with a wide variety of standard patterns and messages, and could be ordered with a custom image such as a station logo. Monoscope \\"cameras\\" were widely used to produce test cards, station logos, special signals for test purposes and standard announcements like \\"Please stand by\\" and \\"normal service will be resumed....\\". They had many advantages over using a live camera pointed at a card; an expensive camera was not tied up, they were always ready, and were never misframed or out of focus. Indeed, monoscopes were often used to calibrate the live cameras, by comparing the monoscope image and the live camera image of the same test pattern. Part of a character generator target with numbers and symbols Pointing an electronic camera at the same stationary monochrome caption for a long period of time could result in the image becoming burnt onto the camera tube's target — and even onto the phosphor of a monitor displaying it in extreme cases. Monoscopes were used as character generators for text mode video rendering in computer displays for a short time in the 1960s. The monoscope declined in popularity during the 1960s due to its inability to generate a colour test card, and the development of solid state TV test pattern signal generators.

A wet grinder can refer to either a tool for abrasive cutting of hard materials, or a food preparation appliance used especially in Indian cuisine for grinding food grains to produce a paste or batter.

Wet grinders are used to make pastes from grains and lentils, such as those used in cooking dosas and idlis in South Indian cuisine. These grinders generally consists of a few granite stone plates that are rolled against another stone plate with the items to be ground between them. Wet grinders have two advantages over electric mixers or blenders. First, the stone grinder generates less heat than a mixer; heat affects the flavor of the food.

The Society upholds the values of the Commonwealth Charter, promoting conflict resolution, peace-making and democracy to improve the lives of citizens across the member states of the Commonwealth. History =1868-1958= What is now The Royal Commonwealth Society was founded in 1868, as a non-political, learned organisation; a royal charter was granted in 1869, and a clubhouse opened in 1885. The Society's name slowly evolved: from The Colonial Society (1868-1869), to The Royal Colonial Society (1869-1870), to The Royal Colonial Institute (1870-1928), to The Royal Empire Society (1928-1958); The Royal Commonwealth Society was adopted in 1958. The Society may be seen from early on to have been progressive in its time towards equality and diversity. A woman was first invited by The Royal Colonial Institute to read a research paper in 1894, and The Royal Colonial Institute was one of the first learned organisations to admit women as full Fellows, in 1922. The Society's first Asian member was Ji ju Sanjo, son of the Japanese prime minister (Sanjo Sanetomi), in 1872; the first African member was Samuel Bannerman, of the Gold Coast, in 1879. 25 Northumberland Avenue, London; headquarters, 1994-2013 The identity of the Society was for more than a hundred years inseparably bound up with its Library. At a meeting on 26 June 1868, Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue recommended \\"the formation of a colonial library, to which all interested in the welfare of the colonies should have access,\\" an aim affirmed by the Society's first elected chairman, Viscount Bury. The Society's first librarian was appointed in 1869, and the first salaried librarian, Australian-born Joseph Sylvester O'Halloran, in 1885. The person mainly responsible for the Library's remarkable development and international reputation was Evans Lewin, Master Librarian for thirty-six years, 1910–1946. The Society's first home was above a shirt shop at No. 15 The Strand, London, where it remained from 1870 until 1885. It was in this modest space that the organisation's Library collection began to be assembled. The Society's Library quickly increased in size and reputation, and the organisation moved in 1885 to 25 Northumberland Avenue in Central London, where it would remain until 2013. The site was completely rebuilt in 1936 to the design of architect Sir Herbert Baker, providing a greatly extended Library. The expanded and renovated premises was formally opened on 12 November 1936 by the Duke and Duchess of York, later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. London during the Blitz The Blitz had a devastating effect on the Society's Northumberland Avenue headquarters and Library. On the night of 16/17 April 1941 the building was struck by a two-ton bomb. Seventy-four people were present at the time; one member was killed and another injured, and two members of staff badly hurt. Fire ignited by the blast and the large quantity of water pumped in to extinguish it meant some unique collections were destroyed; examples, painstakingly assembled over more than seventy years, included: the Library of Overseas Law, the contents of the Newspaper Room, and sections covering the general British Empire, foreign colonies, the First World War, Malta and Gibraltar. The lost collections on the German colonial empire, the French colonial empire, the Dutch Empire, the Italian Empire, and Belgian overseas colonies - mainly in foreign languages and published overseas - were unique in the United Kingdom. Numerous early accounts of exploration, voyages and travel were likewise destroyed. Out of a collection of 260,000, total losses were estimated at approximately 35,000 books and 5,000 pamphlets. On the night of 10/11 May 1941, the hardest night of the Blitz, the Northumberland Avenue address was again severely damaged. The Society persevered, adopting the ‘Business as Usual’ motto characteristic of Britons targeted in the Blitz. The subsequent issue of the Society's journal United Empire, May–June 1941, reported the resumption of activities including its Saturday afternoon dances for members of the Overseas Armed Forces. Determined attempts were made to replace the Library's losses, drawing helpful donations from institutions and individuals and an award from the War Damage Commission, but many items proved irreplaceable. Full restoration of the Society's Northumberland Avenue headquarters was completed in 1957; the building was officially re-opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a grand Festival organised to celebrate the event. The Sunday Times of 14 April 1957 noted that the nose of the 16/17 April 1941 bomb was displayed in a prominent position, reflecting \\"the true spirit of British sportsmanship.\\" =1958 - present= The name The Royal Commonwealth Society was adopted in 1958. Enthusiasm may seem to have surrounded the Commonwealth in the 1950s, but political tides began to flow against the Society; for example, newsroom space was taken for the fledgling Voluntary Service Overseas (1961-3), which began life under the wing of the Royal Commonwealth Society. The Society's library, despite the damage caused by the German bombing offensive in World War II, grew to over half a million items; The Contemporary Review described the collection as \\"the most comprehensive single source for the history of the world's greatest empire from its 16th century beginnings to its present fifty-nation Commonwealth.\\" Cambridge University Library recognised the collection as a \\"treasure-trove\\" of information on the Commonwealth and Britain's former colonial territories, comprising over 300,000 printed items, about 800 archival collections (including manuscript diaries, correspondence, pictures, cine films, scrapbooks and newspaper cuttings) and over 120,000 photographs. From 1956 to 1987 the society's librarian was Donald Simpson (1920-2002), who had joined the staff in 1945. He was in advance of other librarians of his time in recognising the importance of photographs and ensured that photographic collections were identified and catalogued. He was the author of Dark Companions (1975), a book about the indigenous associates of explorers.The Guardian obituary; 28 Oct. 2002 Cambridge University Library's interior reading room From the late 1960s, however, increasing financial problems, combined with severe flood damage, led to the conclusion that it was no longer viable for the Society to maintain its Library. Cambridge University Library acquired the Library's collection in 1993. There had been a sign of things to come when a notable chairman of the Library, Sir Alan Burns (who in 1948 had published a study called Colour Prejudice, a groundbreaking contribution to the subject), resigned from his post in protest at the Society's attempt to sell off Library books in order to supplement its income. Cambridge Library's intervention enabled the Society to clear its debts and, in 1994, to redevelop the grand clubhouse in Northumberland Avenue to the design of architect Linda Morey Smith. This was sold and the RCS purchased a former bank next door, however with no accommodation. By 2012, unfortunately, financial pressures again presented a challenge. The Society found it necessary in 2013 to sell its headquarters at Northumberland Avenue, and it moved in 2014 to a new London office, at Pall Mall, London, with a view to focusing on its charitable work. The Royal Commonwealth Society is now the centre of an international network of more than 10,000 members, spread across 100 countries and territories, and linked by around seventy self-governing Society branches and Commonwealth societies, in forty-three countries and territories. Through its educational, youth and outreach programmes, the Society aims to encourage young people to develop skills and, with an increased understanding of their role as global citizens, to engage with challenges facing the international community. It aims to bring alive the principles of the modern Commonwealth - tolerance, diversity, freedom, justice, democracy, human rights, and sustainable development - to a generation living in an increasingly interconnected world. Society projects aim to enable young people to engage with their counterparts across the Commonwealth in youth leadership programmes, and creative writing and film- making projects. Through its charitable programmes and its international network, the Society's remit is to work towards the continued growth and resilience of Commonwealth civil society. The Society is one of three bodies supporting The Queen's Commonwealth Canopy, a project launched in 2015 to preserve and promote forested areas throughout the Commonwealth. The Society's Hong Kong office was opened in 1983 and has existed outside of the Commonwealth realm since 1997.

In these initial years, only a small number of post offices were established. Postal services expanded greatly from the mid-1850s, with the Local Posts Act of 1856Local Posts Act 1856 allowing Provincial Governments to establish post offices, and the Post Office Act of 1858,New Zealand Post Office Act 1858 which re-organized postal services under a Postmaster-General. The New Zealand Post Office continued to operate as a government department until 1987, when postal services were re-organized as New Zealand Post, a state-owned enterprise. Postage stamps have been issued in New Zealand since around 18 to 20 July 1855 with the \\"Chalon head\\" stamps figuring Queen Victoria. The design was based on a full face portrait of the Queen in her state robes at the time of her coronation in 1837, by Alfred Edward Chalon. The stamps were initially hand cut from sheets, but from 1862 on, these sheets started being fed through automatic perforating machines. The Chalon heads were used until 1874 when the lithographed sideface stamps in various designs replaced them.  Universal one penny postage  Stamp marking Universal postage, 1901 On 1 January 1901, New Zealand introduced one penny universal postage from New Zealand to any country in the world willing to deliver them. Australia, the United States, France and Germany would not accept such letters, fearful of having to reduce their own postal charges to match. This also halved the cost of mailing letters within New Zealand. While concern was expressed that Post Office revenues would fall, mail volumes increased sharply and by 1902 any losses had been recovered.

He was awarded the Avery Fisher Prize in 1994 and received the 1998 University Musical Society Distinguished Artist Award in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ohlsson has also been nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning one in 2008. Early life Ohlsson began his piano studies at the age of eight at the Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains and, at the age of 13, began studying at the Juilliard School. His musical development has been influenced in completely different ways by a succession of distinguished teachers, most notably Claudio Arrau, Olga Barabini, Tom Lishman, Sascha Gorodnitzki, Rosina Lhévinne and Irma Wolpe. Although Ohlsson is especially noted for his performances of the works of Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert, his range of repertoire is broad, extending from Bach and Busoni to Copland, Griffes, Debussy, Scriabin, Gershwin and contemporary composers who have written new works for him, such as Justin Dello Joio. Writing in The New York Times, music critic Allan Kozinn has characterized Ohlsson's repertory as \\"huge.\\" Career Ohlsson has performed in North America with symphony orchestras of Atlanta, Charlotte, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Houston, Detroit, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Seattle, Denver, Washington D.C. and Berkeley, among others, at the National Arts Center, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and with the London Philharmonic at Lincoln Center in New York.

It was ordered by the Polish Air Force, but did not manage to enter service before the outbreak of World War II. Design and development The aircraft was designed as the successor to the obsolete Lublin R-XIII army cooperation plane. First sketches were drawn in 1936 by Zbysław Ciołkosz, the chief designer of the LWS factory (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów). It was similar to the earlier light ambulance plane LWS-2, which itself was inspired by the STOL plane RWD-9 wing design. After Ciołkosz had left LWS in 1937, the project, named LWS-3 Mewa, was modified and further developed at the LWS bureau. In the same year, the Polish Air Force ordered three prototypes. The first prototype LWS-3/I was flown in November 1937. It revealed some handling deficiencies, but otherwise a good performance. Following tests, the design of the aircraft was improved. In 1938, the second prototype LWS-3/II was flown. It had a crank mechanism to lower tailfin and rudder in order to increase angle of the rear machine gun fire, but as it proved impractical, the next prototype LWS-3/III from autumn 1938 again had a classic tailfin design. The third prototype, with some further changes, among others to the engine cover and canopy, was the pattern for serial production. The first prototype was exhibited at the 16th International Paris Aviation Salon in November 1938 (as \\"PZL Mewa\\"), where it met with interest. Official tests were satisfactory, and in 1938 the Polish Air Force ordered 200 aircraft of the production variant LWS-3A Mewa (or \\"Mewa A\\"). The production started in early 1939, and first aircraft were to be ready in the summer. In August 1939, about 30 aircraft were almost completed (10 ready, but lacking propellers, 7 in painting and 10 in final assembly). LWS-3B Mewa variant powered with a Fiat R74 860 hp (640 kW) engine for Bulgaria was being developed as well as a floatplane LWS-3H (hydro) variant for the Polish naval aviation. None were produced due to the war outbreak. =LWS-7 Mewa II= In 1939, the LWS-7 Mewa II was being developed at the LWS as the development of Mewa. Before the war, only a model for aerodynamics tests was made. Drawings of LWS-7 were evacuated in September 1939 to the Polish embassy in Romania by the LWS director Aleksander Sipowicz. Many publications claim that they were handed over to Bulgarians, but it is not clear (possibly, it concerned the LWS-3B plans, in fact). The Bulgarian-built reconnaissance plane KB-11 Fazan bore some resemblance to Mewa. Operational history None of the aircraft entered service in the Polish Air Force before the outbreak of the World War II on September 1, 1939. The problem was with propellers, which had to be delivered from France. The first two aircraft were ready for delivery on September 2, but one of them was damaged on the factory airfield in Lublin by German bombers. The fate of the other one is not clear. Following that, some of the almost finished aircraft were hidden in Lublin park and in a forest nearby. A couple were modified to use wooden propellers with a fixed pitch. Two such aircraft were evacuated to an airfield near Lwów, and given over to the 26th Observation Escadre on September 12. One of them crashed during a night landing on Medyka airfield near Przemyśl on the same day, the other was burned on September 17, when it could not be evacuated. According to some sources, two other Mewas were assigned to the 23rd Observation Escadre on September 11, but this has not been confirmed. It is not clear whether any of these aircraft were armed. One of the aircraft was also seen during evacuation to Pinsk in mid-September. The rest of uncompleted aircraft were seized by Germans and scrapped. Contrary to its direct predecessor, RWD-14 Czapla, the Mewa was a modern close reconnaissance plane, comparable with leading foreign aircraft of that period, like Henschel Hs 126 or Westland Lysander. Its advantages were quite short take-off and landing, which enabled it to operate from short or unprepared remote fields. Technical description Mixed construction (steel and wood) monoplane, conventional in layout, with braced high wings, canvas and plywood covered. Wings folded rearwards. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a tailwheel. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in a closed cockpit, with large transparent canopy surfaces. The crew had dual controls. Prototypes were armed with two forward-firing 7.92 mm machine guns fixed on the undercarriage covers, but it appeared, that their accuracy was low due to vibration, and (according to J. Cynk) production aircraft were intended to have twin machine guns on fuselage sides. The observer had a 7.92 mm wz.37 machine gun in a rear station, covered by opening canopy. 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine Gnome-Rhône 14M01 (prototypes) or 14M05 (serial) with 660 hp (490 kW) nominal power and 730 hp (540 kW) maximum power. Three-blade metal propeller (planned) or two-blade wooden propeller (installed on some aircraft). Fuel capacity about 380 l in wings. The aircraft was fitted with radio and cameras.

Built in World War I to help deliver reinforcements and supplies to the German troops on the Western Front, it connected Remagen on the west bank and the village of Erpel on the eastern side between two hills flanking the river. Midway through Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, the troops of the 1st U.S. Army approached Remagen and were surprised to find that the bridge was still standing. Its capture, two weeks before Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's meticulously planned Operation Plunder, enabled the U.S. Army to establish a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine. After the U.S. forces captured the bridge, German forces tried to destroy it multiple times. It finally collapsed on 17 March 1945, ten days after it was captured, killing 33 U.S. Army Engineers and wounding 63. While it stood, the bridge and newly established pontoon bridges enabled the U.S. Army to establish a bridgehead of six divisions, about 125,000 troops, with accompanying tanks, artillery pieces, and trucks, across the Rhine. Capturing the bridge shortened the war,The Bridge. Beyreuth, Germany: 9th Armored Infantry Division. and V-E Day came After the war, the bridge was not rebuilt; the towers on the west bank were converted into a museum and the towers on the east bank are a performing arts space. History =Construction= American troops on the Ludendorff Bridge in 1918 Remagen is located close to and south of the city of Bonn. The town of Remagen had been founded by the Romans about 2,000 years earlier. The town had been destroyed multiple times and rebuilt each time. Under the Schlieffen Plan, a bridge was planned to be built there in 1912, as well as bridges in Engers and Rudesheim. German General Erich Ludendorff was a key advocate for building this bridge during World War I and it was named after him. It was designed by Karl Wiener to connect the Right Rhine Railway, the Left Rhine Railway and the Ahr Valley Railway (Ahrtalbahn) and carry troops and supplies to the Western Front. Constructed between 1916 and 1919, using Russian prisoners of war as labour, it carried two railway lines and a pedestrian catwalk on either side. Work on the bridge pillars and arches was done by leading construction companies Grün & Bilfinger with the steel bridge built by MAN-Werk Gustavsburg.MAN Maschinenfabrik Augsburg Nürnberg Bridges Historical advertisement, p. 7 It was one of three bridges built to improve railroad traffic between Germany and France during World War I; the others were the Hindenburg Bridge at Bingen am Rhein and the Urmitz Bridge on the Neuwied–Koblenz railway near Koblenz. =Design= The railway bridge had three spans: two on either side long and a central arch span of . It had dual tracks that could be covered with planks to allow vehicular traffic. The steel section was long, and it had an overall length of . On the eastern bank the railway passed through Erpeler Ley, a steeply rising hill over high. The tunnel was long. The arch at its highest measured above the water. It was normally about above the Rhine. The structure cost about 2.1 million marks when it was built during World War I. Since the bridge was a major military construction project, both abutments of the bridge were flanked by stone towers with fortified foundations that could shelter up to a full battalion of men. The towers were designed with fighting loopholes for troops. From the flat roof of the towers troops had a good view of the valley. To protect the bridge, both an engineering unit and a military police unit were assigned to the site. =Protection= The designers built cavities into the concrete piers where demolition charges could be placed. During the Occupation of the Rhineland after World War I, the French filled these cavities with concrete. It was one of the four bridges that were guarded by Americans during the occupation. In 1938, after the Germans reacquired the Rhineland and control of the bridge, they attached 60 zinc-lined boxes at key structural points to the bridge girders, each capable of containing of explosives. The system was designed to detonate all 60 charges at once. The engineers connected the charges in the piers and the zinc boxes by electrical cable protected by steel pipe to a control panel inside the rail tunnel under Erpeler Ley where engineers could safely detonate the charges. As a backup, engineers laid primer cord that could be manually ignited. They believed they could destroy the bridge when necessary with minimal preparation. On 14–15 October 1944, an American bomb had struck a chamber containing the demolition charges of the Mulheim Bridge in Cologne, destroying the bridge. German leader Adolf Hitler reacted by demanding that demolition charges on bridges could only be set when the enemy was within a specific distance, and only exploded by written order. He ordered those \\"responsible\\" for the destruction of the Mulheim Bridge court-martialed. This left officers responsible for destroying bridges, in the event that the enemy approached, nervous about both blowing it too soon and the consequences if they failed. In keeping with Hitler's orders, by 7 March 1945 the charges on the Ludendorff Bridge had been removed and were stored nearby. =Capture during World War II= Colour film from before and after the bridge collapse (March 14–17) In March 1945, about 5,100 people lived in Remagen. On the Western shore, the Allied bombing campaign had destroyed more than half of Erpel's buildings, including all the buildings between Erpel's market place and the bridge, which had been built during the 17th and 18th century. The Rhine near Remagen is about wide. During Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, troops of the U.S. Army's 9th Armored Division reached the bridge during the closing weeks of World War II and were surprised to see that the railroad bridge was still standing. It was one of the very few bridges remaining across the Rhine, because the Germans had systematically destroyed all of the others in advance of the Allies' attack. Although this bridge was wired with demolition charges, the weak civilian-grade \\"Donarite\\" explosives failed to bring the bridge down, and Allied engineers risked their lives manually removing the remaining charges before the bridge was captured. The ability to quickly establish a bridgehead on the eastern side of the Rhine and to get forces into Germany allowed the U.S. forces to envelop the German industrial area of the Ruhr. The Germans sent several bombing missions to destroy the bridge, though the Allies got six divisions across the damaged bridge before it collapsed due to cumulative bomb damage on 17 March 1945, ten days after it was captured. The collapse killed twenty-eight and injured ninety-three U.S. Army Engineers. However, a pontoon bridge had been built across the river by then. The main bridge was out of use for repairs at the time of its collapse. The unexpected availability of the first major crossing of the Rhine, Germany's last major natural barrier and line of defence, caused Allied high commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war. Hitler's Nero Decree of 19 March ordered the destruction of any infrastructure that could aid the Allied advance, but the order was not carried out due to opposition from German generals and the rapid Allied advance. Instead, U.S. forces advanced rapidly through Germany and, by 12 April the Ninth United States Army had crossed the Elbe. =Post World War II history= Former location of the Ludendorff Bridge in 1953 The piers supporting the Ludendorff Bridge were a navigation hazard and were removed in 1976 After the war, the railway crossing was not deemed important enough to justify rebuilding the bridge. Parts of the land used for the approaching railway lines are now used as an industrial estate on the western bank and a park on the eastern bank. Since 1980, the surviving towers on the western bank of the Rhine have housed a museum called \\"Peace Museum Bridge at Remagen\\" containing the bridge's history and 'themes of war and peace'.The Bridge at Remagen museum This museum was partly funded by selling rock from the two piers as paperweights, the two piers having been removed from the river in the summer of 1976 as they were an obstacle to navigation. In the middle of 2018, the two eastern towers of the bridge were announced to be for sale. Three bids were submitted, but due to the poor condition of the building and expected costs of approximately €1.4 million for its restoration, the sale was expected to be difficult.https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article179303428/Bruecke-von-Remagen- Wer-kauft-die-Tuerme-der-beruehmtesten-Bruecke-des-Zweiten-Weltkriegs.html Gallery File:Bundesarchiv Bild 173-0422, Remagen, beschädigte Brücke.jpgThe Ludendorff Bridge between 8 and 11 March 1945 File:Remagen Bridge after capture.jpgThe Ludendorff Bridge on 11 March 1945 File:Beschädigte Brücke.jpgThe Ludendorff Bridge in March 1945, showing structural damage File:WWII, Europe, Germany, \\"U.S. First Army at Remagen Bridge before four hours before it collapsed into the Rhine\\" - NARA - 195341.jpgThe Ludendorff Bridge on 17 March 1945 four hours before its collapse File:Bruecke von Remagen 1945 3.jpgThe Ludendorff Bridge on 17 March 1945 after its collapse File:Remagen Bridge Collapsed.jpgCollapsed Ludendorff Bridge with sign posted by the US Army: \\"CROSS THE RHINE WITH DRY FEET COURTESY OF 9TH ARM'D DIV\\" File:Bruecke von Remagen 1950.jpgThe remains of the Ludendorff Bridge in 1950 File:Bridge at Remagen 2006.jpgThe remains of the Ludendorff Bridge in 2006 File:Remagen Bridge Site from NW.jpgThe site of the Ludendorff Bridge, viewed from northwest References and notes In the film It's a Wonderful Life, during the World War II montage, the narrator, Joseph, says of the character Marty Hatch, \\"Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.\\" A popular video game \\"Call of Duty WW II\\" features a mission in the game to capture the bridge from the German Military Force.

Asian-Argentines settled in Argentina in large numbers during several waves of immigration in the twentieth century. Primarily living in their own neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires, many currently own their own businesses of varying sizes – largely textiles, grocery retailing and buffet-style restaurants. The small Asian- Argentine population has generally kept a low profile, and is accepted by greater Argentine society.  History  Asian Argentines primarily migrated in three waves. The first wave was composed of Japanese immigrants (largely from Okinawa Prefecture), that arrived in small numbers during the early twentieth century. The overthrow of Juan Perón in 1955 precipitated a long period of unrest and economic instability that stemmed Japanese immigration after 1960. The second wave consisted primarily of Korean entrepreneurs, settling in Buenos Aires during the 1960s, and the third wave was mostly composed of Chinese entrepreneurs, who settled in Buenos Aires during the 1990s. By the mid-1990s, Asian Argentines were active in politics, with an example of a political party being a special Unidad Básica (Peronist) party office under the name Unión de Residentes Taiwaneses Justicialistas (\\"Union of Justicialist Taiwanese Residents) at the heart of Buenos Aires's Chinatown Arribeños & Mendoza. This branch later closed, presumably as assimilation continued, while a regular Unidad Básica opened across the street.  Society  Chinese New Year celebration in Buenos Aires' Chinatown A small neighbourhood grocery store in Buenos Aires owned by Asian-Argentines Today, there are an estimated of 212,000 Asian-Argentines, with 120,000 of Chinese descent,27/9/2010 clarin.com January 2009 65,000 of Japanese descent,Argentina inicia una nueva etapa en su relación con Japón - November 21, 2016 25,000 of Korean descent, and 2,000 of Lao descent. Koreans live primarily in the Balvanera and Flores (where the Koreatown is located) districts of Buenos Aires, and are mainly involved in the manufacturing and selling of textiles. Meanwhile, many Chinese live in Chinatown, which also has a Buddhist temple in Belgrano. Many are involved with grocery retailing, which has caused Chinese- owned stores to become a common feature of Buenos Aires. Younger generations of Chinese-Argentines (dubbed ArgenChinos) have readily adopted local ways, with some becoming celebrities, including athletes, a film director and an anchorwoman. The Japanese-Argentine community, located mostly in Pablo Nougués city where a large temple was built, has fully integrated themselves into Argentine society today. Sources believe that 78% of the 4th generation Japanese-Argentine community is of mixed European ancestry, while the 3rd generation is 66% mixed, and a majority of them have non-Japanese ancestors and relatives. The Japanese-Argentine community is less visible due to the intermixing with the European immigrants that have also settled in Argentina like the Italians, Spaniards, German, French, Irish, Polish and Swiss. Today they are one of the most distinguishable communities in Argentina because of their mixed race. Many of their Asian features are almost not visible due to their ancestry. In Buenos Aires, the \\"Jardín Japonés\\" (Japanese Garden and Teahouse) has become a traditional landmark of the city since its opening 30 years ago. Other Asian-Argentines include smaller clusters of ethnic Laotians, Thai, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Hmong, most of whom arrived in the aftermath of conflict in Southeast Asia in the 1970s. They run restaurants, small groceries and vending stands, or are involved in agricultural work. After arriving in Argentina, Lao community settled in Misiones, where the Argentine government provided land and the UN provided $10,000 in financial assistance to each family. In 1997, a Lao temple, Wat Rattanarangsiyaram, was constructed in Posadas.  Discrimination  Presently, the reputation of the community has been jeopardized due to allegations of corrupt business practices. Investigations within Korean-Argentine textile factories and stores have shown that illegal workers from Bolivia were employed in these places.\\"Trabajo esclavo: declaran que pagaban coimas a la Policía\\" - Clarín. \\"Cerraron otros 11 talleres y 3.000 bolivianos marcharon en protesta\\" - Clarín. Because of this, many Korean-Argentines feel that their community has been unfairly targeted due to their economic success. Another incident occurred in June 2006, when the union of truck drivers began a boycott of Chinese-owned stores. This was due to an alleged gun-related incident between a driver and a store owner, which involved illegal firearms.Los camioneros ratifican el boicot a los súper y autoservicios chinos - Clarín.

A leading member of the \\"housers,\\" a group of planners who advocated affordable housing for low-income families, she dramatically changed social housing practice and law in the United States. Wurster's influential book Modern Housing was published by Houghton Mifflin Company in 1934 and is regarded as a classic in the field. Early life On May 11, 1905, Catherine Krouse Bauer was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey to Alberta Krouse Bauer, a self-educated homemaker, and Jacob Bauer. Her father, a state highway engineer, was an early advocate of superhighways and implemented the first cloverleaf interchanges in America while serving as New Jersey's Chief Highway Engineer. Bauer's younger sister was Elizabeth Bauer Mock, a curator and Director of the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and her brother was Jacob Louis Bauer, Jr., an engineer. Bauer completed her secondary education at the Vail-Deane School in her hometown. She first attended Vassar College, spent one year as an architecture student at Cornell University, then transferred back to Vassar College from which she received her undergraduate degree in 1926. In 1926-1927, Bauer spent time in Paris, where she befriended Fernand Léger, Man Ray, and Sylvia Beach. Inspired by the city planning vision advanced by French architect Le Corbusier, Bauer published an article on his worker's apartments in suburban Paris. Professional career Returning to New York City in 1927, Bauer worked at a number of publishing houses, eventually collaborating with American urban critic Lewis Mumford beginning in the late 1920s. It was at his urging that she became involved with the architects of change in post-World War I Europe, among them Ernst May, André Lurçat, and Walter Gropius. Convinced that good social housing could produce good social architecture, and moved by the visible ravages of the Depression, she became a passionate leader in the fight for housing for the poor and in 1934 accepted an appointment by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) to become Executive Director of the new Labor Housing Conference based in Philadelphia. Her book Modern Housing (1934) described the housing achievements Bauer had observed in Europe and lessons for the United States capturing attention of New Deal policy-makers who wanted to boost the economy through housing construction. In 1936 she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to study housing in Europe and the USSR. Bauer was the primary author of the Housing Act of 1937 and advised five presidents on housing and urban planning strategies. Following the passage of the Housing Act of 1937, she was named the Director of Information and Research for the newly formed United States Housing Authority, a federal agency of the Department of the Interior under the New Deal. She served as consultant and adviser to national, state, and local housing and planning agencies during the 1930s-1960s including the Federal Housing Administration, the Housing and Home Finance Agency, and the California Housing and Planning Association. Bauer was instrumental in the creation of the influential documentary film The City, which was included in the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1940, Bauer accepted a position as Visiting Lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Social Welfare. During the 1940s-1950s she lectured and lead seminars at Harvard University, Cornell University, Mills College, and University of Wisconsin, and in 1950 joined the department of architecture at University of California, Berkeley. After her marriage to San Francisco area architect William Wurster, whom she met while teaching at UC Berkeley in 1940, both withstood accusations of disloyalty by the Tenney Committee during the Red Scare of the 1950s. Bauer Wurster contributed to the establishment of University of California, Berkeley's UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design and was also involved in founding the progressive architectural research group Telesis.

They are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in both plants and animals. A vast array of different types of molecules can serve as PAMPs, including glycans and glycoconjugates. PAMPs activate innate immune responses, protecting the host from infection, by identifying some conserved nonself molecules. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), endotoxins found on the cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria, are considered to be the prototypical class of PAMPs. LPSs are specifically recognised by TLR4, a recognition receptor of the innate immune system. Other PAMPs include bacterial flagellin (recognized by TLR5), lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive bacteria (recognized by TLR2), peptidoglycan (recognized by TLR2), and nucleic acid variants normally associated with viruses, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), recognized by TLR3 or unmethylated CpG motifs, recognized by TLR9. Although the term \\"PAMP\\" is relatively new, the concept that molecules derived from microbes must be detected by receptors from multicellular organisms has been held for many decades, and references to an \\"endotoxin receptor\\" are found in much of the older literature. The recognition of PAMPs by the PRRs triggers activation of several signaling cascades in the host immune cells like the stimulation of interferons (IFNs) or other cytokines.  PAMP The term \\"PAMP\\" has been criticized on the grounds that most microbes, not only pathogens, express the molecules detected; the term microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP), has therefore been proposed. A virulence signal capable of binding to a pathogen receptor, in combination with a MAMP, has been proposed as one way to constitute a (pathogen-specific) PAMP. (Free full text available) Plant immunology frequently treats the terms \\"PAMP\\" and \\"MAMP\\" interchangeably, considering their recognition to be the first step in plant immunity, PTI (PAMP-triggered immunity), a relatively weak immune response that occurs when the host plant does not also recognize pathogenic effectors that damage it or modulate its immune response. = In mycobacteria = Mycobacteria are intracellular bacteria which survive in host macrophages. The mycobacterial wall is composed of lipids and polysaccharides and also contains high amounts of mycolic acid. Purified cell wall components of mycobacteria activate mainly TLR2 and also TLR4. Lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan are strong immunomodulatory lipoglycans. TLR2 with association of TLR1 can recognize cell wall lipoprotein antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which also induce production of cytokines by macrophages. TLR9 can be activated by mycobaterial DNA.

Career In 1983, both guitarist \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke and bassist Pete Way had become disgruntled with their own bands and decided to work together in a new outfit. They recruited drummer Jerry Shirley, formerly of Humble Pie, and the then- unknown vocalist Dave King. They took their name from a combination of the founding members' names. However, Way then discovered that he could not escape from his recording contract with Chrysalis Records and then received a tempting offer to play for Ozzy Osbourne, so he abandoned the project without ever playing on a single record. Bringing in session bassist Mick Feat, the band then recorded their debut album, Fastway (1983) (Feat was uncredited on the album). After critical and commercial success, the band toured to promote the album (with one-time Fixx bassist Alfie AgiusFast Eddie Clarke article by Alan Burridge. Retrieved on 9 June 2007. as their session bass player). The band then recruited Richard McCracken, formerly of Taste, as \\"permanent\\" bassist, and released another success in the form of All Fired Up the following year. After the hardships of touring, Shirley and McCracken subsequently left. In 1985, Clarke and King reformed Fastway with a new line- up. Recruiting Shane Carroll (second guitar), Paul Reid (bass), and Alan Connor (drums) from Dave King's first band, Stillwood, this line-up released Waiting for the Roar. The record took an album-oriented rock approach instead of the driving bluesy-metal of the previous albums. The success of the record was limited, and it disappointed many fans. The same year, Fastway was approached to make the soundtrack for the heavy metal horror film, Trick or Treat. The film flopped, but the soundtrack re-established Fastway as a hard- hitting metal band. The soundtrack was a moderate success and stayed on the Billboard Top 200 chart for eleven months. The success of the soundtrack, combined with the little money the band received, caused in-fighting, and the group disbanded. King took most of the band with him and started Q.E.D., a more AOR-styled outfit. They released a two-track single. King then got a call from David Geffen and John Kalodner to come to the United States to head up a heavy metal \\"supergroup\\" called Katmandu. Katmandu also featured Mandy Meyer from Krokus on guitars. The band was rounded out by Caine Carruthers of the soul band The Untouchables, and Mike Alonso of the Detroit rock band The Meanies. Katmandu released one self-titled album and had a couple of minor hits. Dave King would go on to form and front the successful Los Angeles-based Celtic punk band Flogging Molly. Meanwhile, Clarke decided to restart Fastway again from scratch in 1988 using vocalist Lea Hart and session men, quickly releasing On Target in the same year, but it sold poorly. In 1990, this duo of Clarke and Hart released Bad Bad Girls, employing various session musicians including members of Girlschool. It was widely ignored and sold poorly. After calling it a day in 1991, they released a perfunctory live album Say What You Will LIVE (an older recording, curiously with King on vocals). In 1997, Clarke and Hart reunited and released a reworked version of On Target, but there was no commercial success. On 25 May 2007, Toby Jepson, former lead singer with Little Angels, announced he had accepted an approach from Fastway to perform lead vocal duties during the year's festival appearances. An updated line-up played the Sweden Rock Festival, Japanese Hard Rock Hell, and the Download Festival at Castle Donington. Besides guitarist Clarke and Jepson, the new band featured drummer Steve Strange (not to be confused with Visage singer Steve Strange) and John McManus (Mama's Boys). In an interview with Komodo Rock at the Hard Rock Hell Festival in November 2007, Eddie Clark confirmed that he and Toby Jepson would be working on new material. He said \\"Toby and I are going to sit down and maybe do a few tunes over the winter. See if we can write some tunes.\\" In 2008, Toby Jepson announced he would go on to front Scottish hard rockers Gun full-time. In late 2010, \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke returned to the recording studio to record a new album with Toby Jepson, titled Eat Dog Eat. The album was released on 14 November 2011, by SPV/Steamhammer, and it is the first album of entirely new material from Fastway in over twenty years. Clarke died on 10 January 2018, after a battle with pneumonia at the age of 67. No official statement about the disbandment or the future of Fastway has been made following his death. Two years and seven months later Way died on 14 August 2020.

Biography =Early career= Holloway was born in Wells, Somerset, and entered the navy in 1760, aged about 13, aboard the 50-gun ship , under Captain James Webb, who sailed to Newfoundland to serve as Commodore-Governor of the colony. The following year he returned to Newfoundland in the same ship, now under Captain Thomas Graves. Holloway served for another two years in Newfoundland under Sir Hugh Palliser, before sailing for America with Admiral Philip Durell in 1766. In 1768, he joined the , under Commodore Samuel Hood. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1771, and was soon after appointed to the 74-gun ship , stationed as a guard-ship at Portsmouth. =American Revolutionary War= When the American War began, he joined the frigate under Captain George Elphinstone. After a year he transferred to , the flagship of Commodore William Hotham, and was First Lieutenant of her during the encounter between Admirals Richard Howe and the Comte d'Estaing off Rhode Island on 10 August 1778, where the opposing squadrons were arrayed in line of battle when a storm broke, scattering the ships and preventing a battle from taking place. Towards the end of the year, Commodore Hotham was sent to Barbados, to reinforce Rear-Admiral Samuel Barrington's squadron, with 5,000 troops for the capture of St. Lucia. Some time after the conquest of the island, Holloway moved with Hotham into the , but soon joined the , flagship of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, who promoted him to commander. On 23 January 1780, he was promoted to post-captain, and returned to the Vengeance, to serve as Commodore Hotham's flag captain, and was present at the Battle of Martinique in April. In September Hotham assumed command at the Leeward Islands. On the night of 10 October the British were moored at St. Lucia when a hurricane struck, lasting for 29 hours. Eight frigates and sloops were completely wrecked, and the rest of the fleet suffered considerable damage. Vengeance finally sailed for England in early 1781, with another ship and three frigates, as escort to a convoy of thirty-four richly-laden merchant ships, mainly Dutch, which had been captured at St. Eustatia in February. On 2 May they encountered a French squadron of six ships and three frigates, under the command of Picquet de la Motte. Hotham managed to preserve his own squadron, but the French captured twenty-six of the merchant ships, valued at 5 million pounds. Holloway was soon appointed to command of the 80-gun , and was stationed off the Texel under Admiral Howe. He next commanded the Buffalo, attached to Howe's fleet that sailed for the relief of Gibraltar on 11 September 1782. On 11 October the convoy reached the Strait of Gibraltar, but strong winds meant that only four storeships reached the anchorage; the rest passed into the Mediterranean. On the 13th the combined fleets of France and Spain set sail from Algeciras, and Howe ordered Holloway to take the storeships either to the Chafarinas Islands off Morocco, or to Oristano in Sardinia, should they be driven past Cape Tres Forcas, and to use his own judgement in bringing them back to the besieged fortress. After two days Buffalo fell in with four enemy ships off the Barbary coast, and only narrowly escaped being captured. One storeship was captured that night, but the rest escaped in the darkness. Finally, after five or six days, the storeships returned to the British fleet at Gibraltar. \\"Nauticus Junior\\", the anonymous author of Naval Atlantis, published in 1789, severely criticized Howe for selecting the Buffalo for this duty noting that she had been stationed as flagship in the Downs for some time as she was considered unfit for sea, and was seriously undermanned. Nevertheless, Buffalo took her place in the line of battle in the action against the enemy fleet off Cape Spartel on 20 October, having 6 men killed and 16 wounded. On his return to England, Holloway was appointed to command of the 64-gun ship , but following the signing of the peace treaty in September 1783, she was paid off, and Holloway remained unemployed on half-pay for some time. He was eventually appointed to the frigate in July 1786, and sailed for the Leeward Islands, where he served alongside Captain Horatio Nelson in , remaining there until September 1789. During the Spanish Armament of 1790-1791, Holloway commanded the 98-gun , the flagship of Vice-Admiral Hotham. =French Revolutionary War= On the outbreak of the war with France in 1793 he was appointed to command of Hotham's flagship, the 100-gun , seeing action at the siege of Toulon. Following the recall of Admiral Samuel Hood in late 1794, Hotham became Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, and Holloway became his Captain of the Fleet. As such he took part in the Battle of Genoa in March 1795 and the Battle of Hyères Islands in July. At the end of the year Hotham was replaced by Admiral Sir John Jervis, and Holloway was appointed to command of the 98-gun . He was present in her at the Spithead Mutiny in May 1797, and afterwards commanded , attached to the Channel Fleet. On 14 February 1799 Holloway was promoted to rear-admiral, and shortly after was appointed assistant port admiral at Portsmouth, remaining there until the Treaty of Amiens brought a suspension of hostilities in late 1801. Soon after the renewal of the war, in May 1803, he returned to Portsmouth. In the course of the year, he made a survey of the nearby coast; and on his recommendation three 98-gun ships were stationed at Lymington, St. Helens, and at Southampton Water, to guard the Isle of Wight in the event of an invasion. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 23 April 1804, and served on Downs Station, under his former Captain, George Elphinstone, now Admiral Lord Keith. =Governor of Newfoundland= On 10 April 1807 Holloway was appointed Governor of Newfoundland. Concerned about the treatment of the native Beothuk people, he issued a proclamation against mistreating them on 30 July 1807, and offered rewards for information about atrocities. Holloway twice sent officers to the Bay of Exploits to meet the Beothuk, and also sent an expedition under William Cull. Holloway allowed John Ryan to publish Newfoundland's first newspaper, the Royal Gazette and Newfoundland Advertiser, on condition that it would not contain anything \\"inflammatory against the Government of Great Britain\\", nor \\"sow dissension among the inhabitants of this island\\". A traditionalist, Holloway reverted to the anti-settlement mentality of some past governors and forbade the use of land for cultivation. In March 1809, the British parliament made permanent the island's courts of judicature, and re-annexed Labrador to Newfoundland, largely as a result of Holloway's lobbying. He left Newfoundland in October 1809. He was promoted admiral of the blue the same month, and the next July was made admiral of the white. He died in Wells at the age of eighty on 26 June 1826.  Family  In 1781 Holloway married Elizabeth Walrond (b. 5 oct 1749 d. 1838), the daughter of Maine Swete Walrond, 5th Marqués de Vallado, and Sarah Lyons.

Plot K9 has lost his voice, and the Fourth Doctor is confused as to why a robot would have laryngitis. Romana, for reasons unknown, regenerates, eventually choosing the form of Princess Astra of the planet Atrios, in spite of the Doctor's disapproval of it, as well as several \\"test bodies\\" she tries on beforehand. The TARDIS lands on a rocky planet with breathable air but dangerously high levels of radioactivity. The Doctor and Romana explore and see a group of ragged-looking humans burying one of their dead, followed by a spaceship landing and half-burying itself in the ground in a valley. Just as the Doctor and Romana are about to investigate, underground explosions force them back towards the ruins. Whilst exploring them, another explosion occurs, trapping the Doctor. Romana returns to the TARDIS to reassemble K9 so he can assist, but finds the TARDIS half-buried in rubble. She goes back to find the Doctor has vanished. As she turns to leave, a man who has been following her blocks her path. She backs away, falls down a rubble chute, and loses consciousness. She recovers only to have three Daleks burst through the wall and capture her, and command her to work at a drilling site. Meanwhile, the Doctor is thanking the white-clad, silver-haired humanoids who have rescued him, remarking on their strength. He asks their leader, Commander Sharrel, where he is, and is told that the planet is D-5-Gamma-Z-Alpha, otherwise known as Skaro. The Doctor is astonished to hear that the Movellans are here to wage war against the Daleks. Two Movellans bring in a new prisoner, the man who has been following the Doctor and Romana. He identifies himself as Starship Engineer Tyssan. He reveals that the Daleks used him as slave labour as part of a search operation for two years. He tells the Doctor about what has happened to Romana, and they set out to rescue her. The Doctor, Tyssan and three Movellans find Romana and head into the Dalek headquarters. The Doctor establishes that the Daleks are searching for something on a level that they have yet to access, and remembers an alternative route to this area, so they make their way to this floor. There they discover Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who was in suspended animation and now slowly comes to life. The Doctor moves the revived Davros into a blocked-off room in the ruins of the Dalek city. The Doctor and Davros talk about the Daleks' \\"accomplishments\\" during the thousands of years he has been in suspended animation, and whilst the Doctor comments on the countless lives the Daleks have ruined, Davros replies that the Daleks have only just begun their conquest of the cosmos. The Daleks find them both, and the Doctor holds Davros hostage with a makeshift explosive he has just concocted, bargaining with the Daleks to free all their prisoners, and to let him escape. Davros makes them see that the Doctor's logic is \\"impaired by irrational sentiment\\" and the Daleks comply. The Daleks remove the explosive and Davros vows to make them invincible, and the supreme power of the universe. Romana reaches the Movellan spaceship; but learns that the Movellans are not as altruistic as they appear when they knock her out. The Movellans test their nova device: a weapon which changes air molecules so that a planet's atmosphere becomes flammable and can be set alight, killing all life. The Doctor meets up with Tyssan and they find a female Movellan scout. The Doctor confirms his suspicion that the Movellans are actually robots, by removing the power pack on her belt and deactivating her. He finds Romana but is captured by the Movellans. The Doctor learns that the Daleks and Movellans have been in a stalemate for over two centuries, and that both sides' battle computers have been calculating the best strategy and precise moment at which to attack. So far, not a single shot has been fired. The Daleks want Davros to help them gain an advantage. The Movellans want the Doctor to do the same for them, which the Doctor refuses to do. Davros, on the other hand, is all too eager to give the Daleks the upper hand. He orders them to make a suicide bombing attack on the Movellan craft upon realising that the Doctor might do the same thing for the Movellans. Meanwhile, Tyssan leads the prisoners in an attack on the Movellans, deactivating them all, while Romana is able to disable the Movellan's Commander before he can set off the nova device. The Doctor makes his way to the city to confront Davros. The Doctor informs Davros that the Movellans have been disabled; unfortunately Davros does not believe him and intends to destroy the Movellan ship anyway. As the Daleks approach the ship, the Doctor goes to detonate the bombs but is ambushed by a Dalek, which holds him at gunpoint. The Doctor throws his hat on the Dalek's eyestalk, blinding it, then destroying it. He then detonates the bombs and destroys the Dalek squad before it reaches the Movellan ship. The Doctor then puts Davros into the custody of the former slave workers. Davros is placed in cryogenic suspension and taken to Earth to stand trial for his crimes. The Doctor and Romana leave, remarking on the fact that whoever makes mistakes often wins. =Outside references= The Doctor reads Oolon Colluphid's book The Origins of the Universe and says he got it wrong \\"on the first line\\". Colluphid is a character from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy written by script editor Douglas Adams, who inserted the reference to his own work. Production This was Dalek creator Terry Nation's final script for Doctor Who; he declined several further offers due to the extensive uncredited story rewrite by script editor Douglas Adams, who claimed on several occasions that Nation had not delivered a script but simply several pages of story notes that rehashed previous Dalek stories. Ken Grieve, director of the serial, claimed on the DVD commentary that Adams wrote 98% of the script. Nation moved to the United States in 1980 and would go on to work for various television projects in America, most famously as a writer and producer for MacGyver. Michael Wisher was unavailable to reprise the role of Davros, as he was on tour in Australia. David Gooderson replaced him, but the Davros mask (which was originally fitted for Wisher) was five years old and in poor condition; as a result, it suffers in appearance. K9 only appears near the start of the story, explained in-story as due to an electronic form of laryngitis – the croaking was provided by Roy Skelton. K9's absence was because the prop was unsuitable for the large amount of location filming — the production team had suffered several problems using K9 on a similar location in The Stones of Blood, and were not keen on repeating the experience. Terry Nation has said he had no desire to use K9 in his storyline; the scene (as well as other continuity gestures to Season 16) was inserted during rewrites by Douglas Adams. Winspit Quarry in Dorset was used for the planet Skaro, also used were the quarry's small stone cottage and two larger brick buildings, (which all stood side by side and were just empty derelict shells, with their roofs missing). The BBC added to the flooring of the two larger buildings, a large number of silver coloured cylinders and pipes, sticking out of the rubble, the cylinders transformed these two derelict shells into the external ruins of the long abandoned Dalek city and the disused Kaled bunkers. The serial was one of the first British productions to make use of a Steadicam; due to the high cost of such a set-up, nearly all the props and sets were reused, including the Davros mask. The instalments of this serial are credited onscreen as \\"episodes\\", rather than \\"parts\\" – the only serial made after The Green Death to do so. In the next story, City of Death, it was returned to \\"parts\\". =Cast notes= Tim Barlow, who played Tyssan, was deaf at the time of filming. Tony Osoba later played Kracauer in the 1987 serial Dragonfire, and Duke in the 2014 episode \\"Kill the Moon\\". David Yip later played Curly in the audio play The Girl Who Never Was. Broadcast and reception When Episode One was broadcast, ITV was three weeks into a ten-week strike which took it entirely off air with the exception of the Channel region, and all BBC programmes received a significant audience boost as a result. Episode Three broke the record for the highest-rated episode of Doctor Who, set by an omnibus repeat of Pyramids of Mars on 27 November 1976: this would be broken again the following week. According to the BBC's Audience Research Report, the serial was received positively, especially amongst children. The Daleks and Baker were praised, though the response to Ward was more mixed. The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from Tuesday to Friday, 5–8 August 1980, achieving viewing figures of 4.9, 5.8, 7.1 and 6.5 million viewers respectively. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in The Discontinuity Guide (1995) that the serial had \\"a tacky, inconsequential feel that comes from a decade of having its best jokes sneered at.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker criticised Romana's bizarre regeneration, the implication that the Daleks were now robots, and David Gooderson's Davros, believing the character was not only harmed by being played by a lesser actor but that he was also not as well written. Despite this, they said the story \\"ultimately manages to rise above all its undoubted failings and provides a fair degree of entertainment.\\" In 2011, Mark Braxton of Radio Times wrote that the Daleks lacked menace and the script could be too comedic at times, but in spite of its flaws it was \\"clattering good fun\\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn praised the first episode and the introduction of the new Romana, but felt the story quickly became dull and mishandled Davros and failed to do anything with the Daleks. Ian Berriman of SFX gave Destiny of the Daleks two out of five stars, criticising the Daleks as robots and much of the comedy. He also noted that it looked \\"shabby\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1979. This was released just two months after the original transmission – one of the quickest novelisations of the Doctor Who book range, and was released before any of the previous season's stories. A German translation of the book was published by Goldmann in 1990. =Home media= Destiny of the Daleks was released on VHS in July 1994. In 2001 it was remastered and re-released as part of The Davros Collection, which consisted of VHS editions of Genesis of the Daleks, Destiny of the Daleks, Resurrection of the Daleks, Revelation of the Daleks and Remembrance of the Daleks. This story was released on DVD on 26 November 2007. It is available on its own and as part of the Davros Collection DVD box set (as listed above). This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 58 on 23 March 2011.

Sponsored by the U.S.-based American Classical League and the National Junior Classical League, the exam was given in 2012 to over 136,000 students in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, and for the first time Taiwan. \\\\- accessed July 9, 2012 The test covers general knowledge of Latin grammar and vocabulary, mythology, Roman culture, derivatives, and translation abilities. The office of the National Latin Exam is located in Trinkle Hall on the campus of the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Philosophy The philosophy of the National Latin Exam is predicated on providing every Latin student the opportunity to experience a sense of personal accomplishment and success in his or her study of the Latin language and culture. This opportunity exists for all students on the National Latin Exam since they are not competing with their fellow students on a comparative basis, but are evaluated solely on their own performance on the exam. The basic purposes of the NLE are to promote the study of Latin and to encourage the individual student. Format The National Latin Exam is a forty question, multiple-choice test with a time limit of forty-five minutes; it is offered to students on seven levels. On the Introduction to Latin, Latin I, Latin II, Latin III, Latin III/IV Prose, and Latin III/IV Poetry exams, there are questions on grammar, comprehension, mythology, derivatives, literature, Roman life, history, geography, oral Latin, and Latin in use in the modern world. The Latin V-VI exam contains two Latin passages as the basis for questions on grammar, comprehension, historical background, classical literature, and literary devices. The exam is scored based on the number of questions answered correctly, with no penalty for guessing. While a student can take an exam for a higher level than the one in which he or she is currently enrolled, the student may not take any level below his or her completion. The student is not required to take an actual Latin class to take an exam; however, the student must have an official sponsor to take an exam. Awards The National Latin Exam gold medal and certificate The National Latin Exam silver medal and certificate Several awards are available to those students who excel on the NLE: = Medals and Certificates = For Latin I-VI+: * Perfect paper: Hand-lettered certificate * Gold medal and a summa cum laude certificate awarded to top scorers * Silver medal and a maxima cum laude certificate to second-place winners * Magna cum laude certificate to third- place winners * Cum Laude certificate to fourth-place winners For Introduction to Latin: * Perfect Paper: Purple certificate of achievement * A gold outstanding achievement certificate and a purple outstanding achievement ribbon for top scorers * Silver certificate of achievement for second-place winners An NLE Certificate of Merit is also provided for each school participating in the exam. = Carter Stubbs Drake Goad Award (Latin I-VI+) = The students who have three, four, or five years of perfect papers are sent special book awards in addition to the special certificate. The perfect papers must be for ascending levels of the exam exclusive of the Introduction to Latin exam. = The Maureen O'Donnell Oxford Classical Dictionary Award (Latin I-VI+) = The Maureen O’Donnell Oxford Classical Dictionary Award is given to students who win four gold medals in recognition of their outstanding achievement. The students who have won five gold medals will be sent special book awards. Scholarships The National Latin Exam offers three different types of scholarships: =NLE Scholarships= Seniors who win a gold medal on the Latin III, III-IV Prose, III-IV Poetry, or the Latin V-VI+ exam are eligible to apply for one of twenty-one $2,000 scholarships awarded annually. Those who apply must agree to take a least one course per semester of Latin or Classical Greek in their first year of college. Recipients may reapply, if they continue their study of Latin or Greek. =NLE Graduate Scholarship= Students or teachers who are continuing their Latin or Greek on the post- graduate level are eligible to apply for one $2,000 scholarship awarded annually. =The Jane Harriman Hall Professional Development Scholarship= The Jane Harriman Hall Professional Development Scholarship program is designed to support teachers in their ability to teach Latin. The scholarship was developed in honor of Jane Harriman Hall, founder of the National Latin Exam, in order to continue her efforts to bring high quality Latin instruction to their students.

He gained two England caps late in his football career, and remains the oldest outfield player to debut for England (and the oldest post- war debutant in any position). His brother, Denis, was also a footballer and cricketer for Arsenal and Middlesex, though Leslie was more successful in football and Denis in cricket. Football career Compton was born Woodford, Essex and played football for Middlesex Schools before joining Arsenal as an amateur in 1930. He would spend his entire senior club career at Arsenal, over a period of 22 years, making him one of the club's longest-ever serving players. He made his debut on 24 April 1932 against Aston Villa in a 1–1 draw at Villa Park, two months after he had turned professional. He started out as a right-back, and deputised for Tom Parker in the early 1930s, before George Male was converted to that position and became Parker's long-term replacement. Relegated to reserve team football, Compton only played 13 first-team games in four seasons. By 1935–36 he had started to feature more regularly, playing 12 games that season and 15 the next, but missed out on a First Division winners' medal in 1937–38 as he only managed 9 appearances that season. Despite being down the pecking order throughout the 1930s and missing out on the success that Arsenal enjoyed, Compton stuck with Arsenal and won a Charity Shield winners' medal in 1938–39, playing 19 times that season. However the Second World War then intervened; Compton served in the Army while continuing to play football for Arsenal. Converted to an emergency centre-forward, he once scored ten times in a wartime match against Leyton Orient, which finished 15–2 to Arsenal. He also guested for Chester, scoring a hat-trick against Everton during the 1942–43 season. In June 1940, he was one of five Arsenal players who guested for Southampton in a victory over Fulham at Craven Cottage. After the war had ended, he reverted to defence, becoming a mainstay in the Arsenal side at centre half. Although he missed the first six games of the 1947–48 due to cricketing commitments but was a near ever-present for the remainder of the season, as Arsenal won the First Division title and Compton finally earned a top-class honour; his brother, Denis, had also by this time established himself in the Arsenal side and won a medal as well. During the close season, he succeeded Joe Mercer as Arsenal captain, but relinquished the armband soon after, saying Mercer deserved the honour more. Compton went on to win the FA Cup in 1949–50, scoring a last-minute equaliser in the Gunners' semi-final against Chelsea, heading a corner kick from his brother Denis to level the match 2–2; Arsenal won the replay 1–0, and then beat Liverpool in the final. Compton's form was such that he was selected for England for their match against Wales on 15 November 1950, making him, at 38 years and 64 days, the oldest post-war England debutant and the oldest ever outfield player to debut. These records still stand. Alexander Morten holds the all-time record. He was a regular in the Arsenal side until the start of the 1951–52 season, during which he only played four matches. He decided to retire from playing football in the 1952 close season; in total he played 273 matches and scored 6 goals. He stayed on at Arsenal for another three years as a coach and scout. Cricket career Compton also played cricket for Middlesex, playing as wicket-keeper from 1938 to 1956. He appeared 272 times, scoring 5,814 runs (an average of 16.75), and taking 468 catches and 131 stumpings. Together with his brother, he won the 1947 County Championship title with Middlesex, making them the only brothers ever to have won the national title both in football and cricket. Unlike Denis though, Leslie never played Test cricket for England. Retirement and death After retiring he ran the \\"Prince of Wales\\" pub in Highgate High Street, north London. He died in Hendon in December 1984, from complications due to diabetes, aged 72; his foot had been amputated two years previously because of this.

The epidermal growth factor receptor is a member of the ErbB family of receptors, a subfamily of four closely related receptor tyrosine kinases: EGFR (ErbB-1), HER2/neu (ErbB-2), Her 3 (ErbB-3) and Her 4 (ErbB-4). In many cancer types, mutations affecting EGFR expression or activity could result in cancer. Epidermal growth factor and its receptor was discovered by Stanley Cohen of Vanderbilt University. Cohen shared the 1986 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Rita Levi-Montalcini for their discovery of growth factors. Deficient signaling of the EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases in humans is associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, while over-expression is associated with the development of a wide variety of tumors. Interruption of EGFR signalling, either by blocking EGFR binding sites on the extracellular domain of the receptor or by inhibiting intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, can prevent the growth of EGFR-expressing tumours and improve the patient's condition.  Function  EGFR signaling cascades left thumbDiagram of the EGF receptor highlighting important domains Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein that is activated by binding of its specific ligands, including epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor α (TGFα)note, a full list of the ligands able to activate EGFR and other members of the ErbB family is given in the ErbB article). ErbB2 has no known direct activating ligand, and may be in an activated state constitutively or become active upon heterodimerization with other family members such as EGFR. Upon activation by its growth factor ligands, EGFR undergoes a transition from an inactive monomeric form to an active homodimer. – although there is some evidence that preformed inactive dimers may also exist before ligand binding. In addition to forming homodimers after ligand binding, EGFR may pair with another member of the ErbB receptor family, such as ErbB2/Her2/neu, to create an activated heterodimer. There is also evidence to suggest that clusters of activated EGFRs form, although it remains unclear whether this clustering is important for activation itself or occurs subsequent to activation of individual dimers. EGFR dimerization stimulates its intrinsic intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase activity. As a result, autophosphorylation of several tyrosine (Y) residues in the C-terminal domain of EGFR occurs. These include Y992, Y1045, Y1068, Y1148 and Y1173, as shown in the adjacent diagram. This autophosphorylation elicits downstream activation and signaling by several other proteins that associate with the phosphorylated tyrosines through their own phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domains. These downstream signaling proteins initiate several signal transduction cascades, principally the MAPK, Akt and JNK pathways, leading to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Such proteins modulate phenotypes such as cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. Activation of the receptor is important for the innate immune response in human skin. The kinase domain of EGFR can also cross-phosphorylate tyrosine residues of other receptors it is aggregated with, and can itself be activated in that manner. Biological roles The EGFR is essential for ductal development of the mammary glands, and agonists of the EGFR such as amphiregulin, TGF-α, and heregulin induce both ductal and lobuloalveolar development even in the absence of estrogen and progesterone. Role in human disease =Cancer= Mutations that lead to EGFR overexpression (known as upregulation or amplification) have been associated with a number of cancers, including adenocarcinoma of the lung (40% of cases), anal cancers, glioblastoma (50%) and epithelian tumors of the head and neck (80-100%). These somatic mutations involving EGFR lead to its constant activation, which produces uncontrolled cell division. In glioblastoma a specific mutation of EGFR, called EGFRvIII, is often observed. Mutations, amplifications or misregulations of EGFR or family members are implicated in about 30% of all epithelial cancers. =Inflammatory disease= Aberrant EGFR signaling has been implicated in psoriasis, eczema and atherosclerosis. However, its exact roles in these conditions are ill-defined. =Monogenic disease= A single child displaying multi-organ epithelial inflammation was found to have a homozygous loss of function mutation in the EGFR gene. The pathogenicity of the EGFR mutation was supported by in vitro experiments and functional analysis of a skin biopsy. His severe phenotype reflects many previous research findings into EGFR function. His clinical features included a papulopustular rash, dry skin, chronic diarrhoea, abnormalities of hair growth, breathing difficulties and electrolyte imbalances. = Wound healing and fibrosis = EGFR has been shown to play a critical role in TGF-beta1 dependent fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Aberrant persistence of myofibroblasts within tissues can lead to progressive tissue fibrosis, impairing tissue or organ function (e.g. skin hypertrophic or keloid scars, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, chronic kidney disease). Medical applications =Drug target= The identification of EGFR as an oncogene has led to the development of anticancer therapeutics directed against EGFR (called \\"EGFR inhibitors\\"), including gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, brigatinib and icotinib for lung cancer, and cetuximab for colon cancer. More recently AstraZeneca has developed Osimertinib, a third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Many therapeutic approaches are aimed at the EGFR. Cetuximab and panitumumab are examples of monoclonal antibody inhibitors. However the former is of the IgG1 type, the latter of the IgG2 type; consequences on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity can be quite different. Other monoclonals in clinical development are zalutumumab, nimotuzumab, and matuzumab. The monoclonal antibodies block the extracellular ligand binding domain. With the binding site blocked, signal molecules can no longer attach there and activate the tyrosine kinase. Another method is using small molecules to inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase, which is on the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. Without kinase activity, EGFR is unable to activate itself, which is a prerequisite for binding of downstream adaptor proteins. Ostensibly by halting the signaling cascade in cells that rely on this pathway for growth, tumor proliferation and migration is diminished. Gefitinib, erlotinib, brigatinib and lapatinib (mixed EGFR and ERBB2 inhibitor) are examples of small molecule kinase inhibitors. CimaVax-EGF, an active vaccine targeting EGF as the major ligand of EGF, uses a different approach, raising antibodies against EGF itself, thereby denying EGFR-dependent cancers of a proliferative stimulus; it is in use as a cancer therapy against non-small- cell lung carcinoma (the most common form of lung cancer) in Cuba, and is undergoing further trials for possible licensing in Japan, Europe, and the United States. There are several quantitative methods available that use protein phosphorylation detection to identify EGFR family inhibitors. New drugs such as osimertinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and brigatinib directly target the EGFR. Patients have been divided into EGFR-positive and EGFR-negative, based upon whether a tissue test shows a mutation. EGFR-positive patients have shown a 60% response rate, which exceeds the response rate for conventional chemotherapy. However, many patients develop resistance. Two primary sources of resistance are the T790M Mutation and MET oncogene. However, as of 2010 there was no consensus of an accepted approach to combat resistance nor FDA approval of a specific combination. Clinical trial phase II results reported for brigatinib targeting the T790M mutation, and brigatinib received Breakthrough Therapy designation status by FDA in Feb. 2015. The most common adverse effect of EGFR inhibitors, found in more than 90% of patients, is a papulopustular rash that spreads across the face and torso; the rash's presence is correlated with the drug's antitumor effect. In 10% to 15% of patients the effects can be serious and require treatment. Some tests are aiming at predicting benefit from EGFR treatment, as Veristrat. Laboratory research using genetically engineered stem cells to target EGFR in mice was reported in 2014 to show promise. EGFR is a well-established target for monoclonal antibodies and specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. =Target for imaging agents= Imaging agents have been developed which identify EGFR- dependent cancers using labeled EGF. The feasibility of in vivo imaging of EGFR expression has been demonstrated in several studies.

Playing as a striker, Lewis solely featured for Arsenal throughout his footballing career. Lewis is Arsenal's 12th highest goalscorer of all time. Playing career Born in Bilston, Staffordshire and raised in South London Lewis spent his entire career at Arsenal. He joined the club as a schoolboy in 1935, and scored on his debut against Everton on 1 January 1938. He made only four appearances in 1937-38, however, and as a result missed out on a League Championship winners' medal. Lewis broke into the first-team more in 1938-39, making 16 appearances in league and cup, scoring 7 goals, but the advent of the Second World War interrupted his career. During the war Lewis continued to play for Arsenal and shone as a natural goalscorer; although wartime appearances and goals are not officially counted, Lewis scored 143 goals in 130 games, including four in the 1943 War Cup Southern Final, in a 7-1 demolition of Charlton Athletic. Towards the end of the war he served in the British Army of the Rhine in Occupied Germany, but returned to play for Arsenal once first-class football resumed in 1946. On 24 August 1946 an additional fixture was arranged between England and Scotland with all proceeds going to the Bolton Disaster Fund. Lewis was called up to replace the injured Tommy Lawton.The Times 21 August 1946 Sports in Brief Although most of the Arsenal side of the 1930s were past their best by this time, Lewis was still only 26 and he continued to be a regular in the first team throughout the remainder of the 1940s. He was the club's top scorer in 1946-47 with 29 goals, and the following 1947-48 season, he partnered new signing Ronnie Rooke and between them they scored 47 goals as Arsenal won the First Division title. Lewis continued to be a regular for the rest of the decade and he enjoyed arguably his best season in 1949-50. As such in this season, he scored 19 goals in 31 league games and played twice for the England B team. Lewis capped it altogether by scoring both goals in Arsenal's 2–0 victory over Liverpool in the 1950 FA Cup Final. However, during the early 1950s, Lewis became constantly afflicted with injuries, and he made only 12 appearances in 1951-52 and none at all in 1952-53. In the close season of 1953, he retired from the game at the age of 33. His 116 goals in 176 matches makes him Arsenal's twelfth top goalscorer of all time. After retiring, Lewis first ran a pub, then worked in insurance. He died in 1997.

He is best known as the former lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of rock band CKY, which he co-founded in 1998. Other bands Miller fronts include the progressive metal band Foreign Objects, the melodic death metal group World Under Blood and the band 96 Bitter Beings. Early life Miller has stated that his first musical influence, at the age of three years, was Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley. He started taking guitar lessons at the age of eight, after \\"losing interest\\" in playing the piano, and was later influenced by death metal band Death, including vocalist Chuck Schuldiner and guitarist James Murphy, followed by \\"more extreme music ... and more underground musicians\\" such as Cynic, Pestilence and Malevolent Creation. He has described his first guitar as a \\"$50 piece of crap\\", noting that it was possibly J. C. Penney-branded, followed by an \\"imitation B.C. Rich\\" and, later, an Ibanez RG570 in 1992. Career =1992–2002: Early career, Foreign Objects and CKY= Miller played in his first band This End Up in 1992, and later formed Foreign Objects with future CKY drummer Jess Margera, whom he originally met at high school. The band released its debut EP The Undiscovered Numbers & Colors in 1995. Along with bassist Ryan Bruni, the duo later performed under the name Oil, before meeting guitarist Chad I Ginsburg (who was then working as an audio engineer) and changing the name of the band to CKY. Miller is credited with having conceived the name, which stands for \\"Camp Kill Yourself\\" and was believed by the frontman to be \\"a perfect title for a horror movie\\". CKY released its debut album Volume 1 in 1999, which originally featured songwriting credits exclusively for Miller. 2002's follow-up Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild credited \\"Deron Miller w/ Chad I Ginsburg and Jess Margera\\", with Margera being omitted from the formulation for An Answer Can Be Found and Carver City. =2002–2006: Death tribute album and controversies= Miller and James Murphy (pictured) worked together on a Death tribute album and the second Foreign Objects release. In December 2002, it was announced that Miller would be working alongside guitarist James Murphy, drummer Dave Culross and vocalist Brett Hoffman on a tribute album for the band Death, to benefit the family of founding member Chuck Schuldiner. After Schuldiner's family approved the project, bassist Terry Butler, Slipknot members Mick Thomson (guitar) and Paul Gray (bass), and more joined the project, which was titled Within the Mind: In Homage to the Musical Legacy of Chuck Schuldiner and scheduled for release through Mascot Records. In addition to their collaboration on the Death tribute album, Miller and Murphy also worked together again on Universal Culture Shock, the second album by Foreign Objects, released in 2004. Murphy contributed lead guitar and mastering to the album, with Miller praising the guitarist for making the album \\"one thousand times better\\". During the build-up to the release of CKY's third studio album An Answer Can Be Found, Miller was involved in a number of controversies with the music media. First, he called out Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine for threatening to cancel shows at which \\"Satanic\\" bands were also scheduled to appear, asking him to \\"stop creating drama\\". A few weeks later, he criticised a number of commentators on the website Blabbermouth.net for posting negative comments about CKY, describing them as \\"lonely, jealous music fans\\". Following the release of An Answer Can Be Found, Miller also responded to Jenny Eliscu's one-star review of the album for Rolling Stone magazine, describing her as \\"juvenile\\" and an \\"ugly skank\\", and proposing that she was \\"not intelligent enough to understand\\" the band's lyrics. Eliscu responded by complaining to CKY's label, The Island Def Jam Music Group, that the frontman had launched an \\"harassment campaign\\" against the journalist, alleging that he had posted her home phone number online, leading to fans calling her with death threats. =2006–2011: World Under Blood and collaborations= Miller performing in 2009 In October 2006, it was announced that Miller was working with drummer Tim Yeung and producer Logan Mader on a demo for new death metal side project called World Under Blood. The band later released a number of songs on its MySpace page. In 2008, Miller also performed with Malevolent Creation and recorded with thrash metal group Believer, and later also recorded with progressive metal band The Alien Blakk. His Believer contribution later surfaced in the form of a guitar solo on Gabriel opening track \\"Medwton\\". World Under Blood's debut full-length album Tactical was eventually released in July 2011 by Nuclear Blast Records. After a CKY show in St. Louis, Missouri in 2007, Miller reportedly had an altercation with Ginsburg in the tour bus, after which the guitarist claimed that the frontman had left the band. Miller responded with claims to the contrary, while Ginsburg proposed that he would continue CKY with Margera. =2011–present: CKY departure and recent events= The fate of CKY was cast into doubt in 2011, when the band released a video in which each member spoke about their desires for the future of the band; all members but Ginsburg wanted to record solo albums, while the guitarist favoured releasing another CKY album. Miller elaborated on the situation on his Facebook page, claiming that Ginsburg had left the band, and that no one in the \\"CKY camp\\" kept him informed of plans and updates, which had led to tensions. Miller was replaced in CKY for the first time since the band's formation in 2012, when former Year Long Disaster frontman Daniel Davies joined for a series of shows at Australian music festival Soundwave. In 2014, Miller reunited with Ginsburg for a planned reunion of the band and a new album, although no further activity was reported and by 2015 he had once again been replaced by Davies. Since the inactivity of CKY, Miller has released his debut solo album Acoustified!, featuring acoustic recordings of CKY and Foreign Objects songs, as well as resurfaced the Foreign Objects moniker for a new album, Galactic Prey. Both releases were funded via crowdfunding website Indiegogo. In 2016, Miller announced that he was concurrently working on a number of different projects: a deluxe vinyl reissue of CKY's Volume 1, the debut album by MechaCKY (later renamed 96 Bitter Beings), two albums by World Under Blood (Life Is Too Long to Like You and Tetanus Invasive), a new Foreign Objects album entitled Lean, Mean and Bleeding Green, and a sequel to Acoustified! It was later announced that 96 Bitter Beings would be releasing two albums, Synergy Restored and Camp Pain, as part of an Indiegogo campaign. Other projects In an interview in August 2015, Miller revealed that he was working on a pilot for a new show called The Chuck Draper Show with Funny or Die producer Matt Sweeney. He added that he would be playing the eponymous character Chuck Draper and that former CKY Crew member Chris Raab was in line to play Draper's roommate. Speaking about the tone of the show, which he claimed was inspired by the work of Howard Stern and Christopher Guest, Miller described it as \\"very offensive\\" and \\"hilarious\\", joking that he wanted people \\"to be very angry with [him] after seeing it\\". Equipment Speaking in an interview with Guitar.com in 2002, Miller noted that he played Parker Guitars, including the NiteFly M, P38 and P40 models, with d'Addario strings and the Marshall JCM2000 amplifier. He signed a deal with Jackson Guitars in 2011, then later with Esoterik Guitars in 2014. Speaking about Esoterik in a post on his Facebook page, Miller claimed that in 30 years of playing the instrument, he had \\"never played anything nicer\\" than their models.

Tul’chyn, old name Nesterwar (from Hungarian Nester - Dniester and war -town), Latin Tulcinum, , , ) is a town in Vinnytsia Oblast (province) of western Ukraine, former Podolia. It is the administrative center of Tulchyn Raion (district), and was the chief centre of the Southern Society of the Decembrists, Pavel Pestel was located there during planning of the rebellion. The city is also known for being the home to Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych who produced several of this choral masterpieces (including world famous \\"Carol of the bells\\") when he lived here. An important landmark of the city is the palace of the Potocki family, built according to the principles of Palladian architecture according to the plans drafted by Joseph Lacroix during the 1780s. Polish patriot Józef Wysocki (general) was born in Tulchin in 1809, author of Pamietnik Jenerala Wysockiego, Dowodcy Legionu Polskiego Na Wegrzech Z Czasu Kampanii Wegierskiej W Roku 1848 i 1849. History Tulchin in 1908 Polish Tulczyn was first mentioned in 1607. It was a royal city in the Bracław Voivodeship of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1609 King Sigismund III Vasa granted the town to Walenty Aleksander Kalinowski. Until 1728 Tulchin was part of the estates of the Polish magnates of the Kalinowski family (other distinguished members of Tulchin family were Adam Kalinowski and Marcin Kalinowski), and then passed into the hands of Stanisław Potocki bypassing other Kalinowskis' branch, then in 1734 to Franciszek Salezy Potocki and his son Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, who was the most memorable and infamous member of the Tulczyn branch of the Potocki family. During the Targowica confederation Tulchin was the headquarters of the confederates. Mieczysław Potocki sold Tulchin to his brother-in-law Grzegorz Strogonow, who sold it to Piotr Oldenburski, who in turn sold it to Russian Imperial Treasury. Ancient archives of the Polish magnate families of Struś, Łaszcz, Mniszech, Modrzewski, Potocki, and Tarło collected at the palace, were lost during these transfers in ownership, while furniture and art collections were shipped to Paris where Mieczysław Potocki resided. After the Kyiv-Odessa train line had been built Tulchin went into economic decay. There were instances when the Polish soldiers would purposely leave town, abandoning the Jews to the mercy (or lack thereof) of the Ukrainians. This happened, for example, in 1648 in the city of Tulchin. The Polish soldiers made a deal with the Cossacks and left town. The Jews defended the city by themselves until it fell and they were all slaughtered. Prior to October Revolution Tulchin was home a large Jewish population, and there were two trade fairs, July 24 and October 1 each year, and separate 26 market days annually. Between 1917 and 1920 the town frequently changed ownership, between the Poles, the Bolsheviks, White Russians and Ukrainians. During World War II, the German conquerors turned over Tulchyn and the surrounding area to Romanian control. After first being confined to a ghetto, most Jews from Tulchyn were deported to the nearby Pechora concentration camp where they perished. The area was liberated by the Red Army in March 1944. The current estimated population is around 13,500 (as of 2005). Gallery File:Костьол Тульчин вул. Леніна,41.JPGDominican Church in Tulchyn File:Успенська церква Тульчин вул.

From 1850-1860 he was the chief Washington correspondent and associate editor of the New York Tribune. The Tribune was the chief source of news and commentary for many Republican newspapers across the country. Republican editors reprinted his dispatches prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1854 he led the fight against the Kansas-Nebraska Act, calling for the formation of a new political entity to oppose it. Pike wrote that a \\"solid phalanx of aggression rears its black head everywhere south of Mason and Dixon's line, banded for the propagation of Slavery all over the continent.\\" Durden (2000) His reports were, \\"widely quoted, bitterly attacked or enthusiastically praised; they exerted a profound influence upon public opinion and gave to their author national prominence, first as an uncompromising anti-slavery Whig, and later as an ardent Republican.\\" Van Cleve 1934 President Abraham Lincoln appointed Pike to be minister to the Netherlands, where he fought Confederate diplomatic efforts and promoted the Union war aims from 1861 to 1866.Durden (1957) 64-65 On returning to Washington in 1866, Pike resumed writing for the New York Tribune and also wrote editorials for the New York Sun. Pike was an outspoken Radical Republican, standing with Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner and opposing President Andrew Johnson. Long before black suffrage became a major issue Pike had come to believe that the freed slaves must be given the vote. Pike in 1866-67 strongly supported Black suffrage and the disqualification of most ex-Confederates from holding office.Durden (1957), p. 161, 168 Pike did not admire Ulysses S. Grant as a politician, and drifted away from the Republican party. By 1872 Pike was disenchanted with Black suffrage and the corruption and failures of Reconstruction. He argued the federal government should withdraw its soldiers from the Southern states.Durden (1957) p. 186 He was a strong supporter of the Liberal Republican movement that in 1872 opposed President Ulysses Grant, denouncing the corruption of his administration.Durden (1957) p. 197 Pike's boss, New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley, was the Liberal Republican nominee in 1872. Greeley lost to Grant by a landslide, then died. The new editor of the Tribune Whitelaw Reid sent Pike to South Carolina to study the conditions in the deep South under Reconstruction.Durden (1957) pp. 201-2 Pike's reports on South Carolina In 1873 Pike toured South Carolina and wrote a series of newspaper articles, reprinted in newspapers across the country and republished in book form in 1874 as The Prostrate State: South Carolina under Negro Government. It was a widely read and highly influential first hand account of the details of Reconstruction government in South Carolina, that systematically exposed what Pike considered to be corruption, incompetence, bribery, financial misdeeds and misbehavior in the state legislature. His critics argued that the tone and emphasis was distorted and hostile toward African Americans and Grant Republicans. The Prostrate State painted a lurid picture of corruption. Historian Eric Foner writes: :The book depicted a state engulfed by political corruption, drained by governmental extravagance, and under the control of \\"a mass of black barbarism.\\" The South's problems, he insisted, arose from \\"Negro government.\\" The solution was to restore leading whites to political power.Eric Foner, Give Me Liberty!: An American History (2nd ed. 2008) vol 2 pp. 577-78 Historian John Hope Franklin said, \\"James S. Pike, the Maine journalist, wrote an account of misrule in South Carolina, appropriately called The Prostrate State, and painted a lurid picture of the conduct of Negro legislators and the general lack of decorum in the management of public affairs. Written so close to the period and first published as a series of newspaper pieces, The Prostrate State should perhaps not be classified as history at all. But for many years the book was regarded as authoritative—contemporary history at its best. Thanks to Robert Franklin Durden, we now know that Pike did not really attempt to tell what he saw or even what happened in South Carolina during Reconstruction. By picking and choosing from his notes those events and incidents that supported his argument, he sought to place responsibility for the failure of Reconstruction on the Grant administration and on the freedmen, whom he despised with equal passion. Durden wrote that the fundamental clue to Pike's hostile characterization of African Americans in his book The Prostrate State was that \\"in the 1850s no less than in the 1870s, . . . [we see] his constant antipathy toward the Negro race.\\" James Shepherd Pike: Republicanism and the American Negro, 1850-1882 by Robert Franklin Durden, pp. 249 In his biographical study of Pike, Durden concluded that Pike had been ardently \\"free soil\\" before the American Civil War because he thought that the West should belong to the white man. Durden said Pike despaired of living alongside arrogant slaveholders and their repulsive human property, and that he urged peaceful secession during the 1860-61 crisis partly because he had one eye cocked on the chance of getting rid of a \\"mass of barbarism\\" and that during some of the Civil War's darker days he would have settled for a compromise peace if it meant only that a Gulf coast or Deep South \\"negro pen\\" would be lost to the Federal Union. Durden wrote that The Prostrate State makes sense only in this context, and to the extent that Pike's racial views were representative, \\"the Civil War and Reconstruction take on a new dimension of tragedy.\\" James Shepherd Pike: Republicanism and the American Negro, 1850-1882 by Robert Franklin Durden Historian Mark Summers concludes that Pike stressed the sensational, but \\"however maliciously and mendaciously he shaded his evidence, his accounts squared with those of his colleagues Charles Nordhoff of the New York Herald and H.P. Redfield of the Cincinnati Commercial.Summers 193 James Freeman Clarke, a leading Boston abolitionist, visited South Carolina and reported back to his Boston congregation that the facts presented by Pike, \\"were confirmed by every man whom I saw.\\" McPherson p 41 Durden (2000) reports: :A sweeping indictment of Republican rule in this state (and, by inference, other southern states), Pike's dramatic, \\"eye-witness\\" account gained much attention throughout the country. The book was so popular because it was seen as the work of an allegedly impartial Maine Republican and old foe of slavery who had come to his senses about the \\"wicked corruption\\" of the carpetbaggers and their \\"ignorant and barbaric\\" Negro allies. Pike's book not only played a role in the ending of Reconstruction but was much used by historians well into the twentieth century. In fact, it was far from objective, simply reflecting Pike's long-standing racism. Bibliography * Durden, Robert F. James Shepherd Pike. Republicanism and the American Negro, 1850–1882.

The school has Church of England traditions, although it accepts girls of all faiths. The Abbey School offers education for girls aged 3 to 18. The school became an International Baccalaureate World School in 2008. Founded in 1887, the school moved to its present site in 1905 under the leadership of headmistress Helen Musson. Notable alumnæ include the novelist and social activist Brigid Brophy, the novelist Elizabeth Taylor the educationalist Baroness Brigstocke, and the historian Lucy Worsley. Around one hundred years before the school was founded in 1887, the novelist Jane Austen briefly attended Reading Ladies' Boarding School within the Abbey Gateway,Reading Museum's local information on Jane Austen's school which is commemorated by, and incorporated into, the Abbey School's crest. History The school was founded in 1887, named Reading High School, replacing the privately owned Blenheim House Ladies' School. It was located at London Road (in the building which became the Gladstone Club). The Church Schools Company, instrumental in founding the school, felt that Reading, with its growing population reaching 60,000, was in need of a new school. The school aimed to provide high quality education with a Christian ethos at an affordable price. When founded, the school had an enrolment of 40 girls, which steadily increased to 120 by 1902, when Miss Helen Musson MA, the new headmistress, was appointed. In 1905, the school moved to its current Kendrick Road site. On 16 March 1905 William Methuen Gordon Ducat, the Archdeacon of Berkshire, laid the foundation stone of the school, which featured the inscription, \\"In aedificationem corporis Christi\\". This motto, taken from Ephesians IV:12, can still be seen on the school's crest. The new site was a vast improvement on the old site: there were six classrooms, a hall and space for playing fields. The school changed its name to The Abbey School in 1913, after parting from the Church Schools' Company. The name was chosen to commemorate a former Reading school dating from 1835, which was based in the Abbey Gateway. A previous school in the Abbey Gateway operating in the 18th-century, named Reading Ladies’ Boarding School, included Jane Austen among its pupils. The Abbey is now a day school, after ceasing to accept boarding pupils in 1946, and was a direct grant (C. of E.) grammar school in the 1950s . The headmistress is Mrs Rachel Dent. Academic performance The school has established a reputation for academic excellence. According to the Good Schools Guide, the school typically achieves 88 per cent A/B, [and] 97 per cent A/C at A Level, \\"Sciences [are] quite strong\\" and \\"99 per cent [of students go] into higher education.\\"http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/school/the-abbey-school- reading.html Senior school Roughly 45% of entrants in the Upper Third (year 7) come from the Junior School. Also, many students from other schools all around Berkshire and beyond come here. Houses On entering the school, every girl is put into a house: Carrington, Ducat, Kensington or Paget. Houses are named after people who have been important to the school, for example founding it. In these houses, girls can earn points by doing well. House competitions include reading and music, The Music Competition (for solo players), The Baroness Brigstocke Memorial Public Speaking Competition (plus the Young Brigstocke for younger students), House sports competitions (such as swimming, rounders and hockey) and Sports Day. At the end of each term, and each year, a cup is awarded to the house with the most points. They also do House music and drama. Junior School and Early Years Centre The junior school is at Kensington House, a building 400 metres away from the senior school. Also situated here is the Early Years Centre, a unit opened in 2003.

He created the field of somatotype and constitutional psychology that correlate body types with Temperament, illustrated by his Ivy League nude posture photos. Early life and education Sheldon was born in Pawtuxet, Rhode Island on November 19, 1898 to William Herbert Sheldon, Sr., a naturalist and animal breeder, and Mary Abby Greene, a village midwife. His godfather was the noted psychologist and philosopher, William James. He graduated from Warwick Veterans Memorial High School in 1915 and attended Brown University. After graduating, he worked in a range of fields before studying for his master's degree at the University of Colorado. Sheldon attended the University of Chicago and earned his Ph.D. in 1925. He taught psychology at the University of Chicago and at the University of Wisconsin. He attended the University of Chicago Medical Center, receiving his M.D. in 1933. Gaining a two-year fellowship in Europe allowed him to study under Carl Jung, and visit Sigmund Freud and Ernst Kretschmer. After Europe, he moved to Harvard University in 1938. He served in the Army Medical Corps at lieutenant colonel rank in the Second World War. From 1947 to 1959 he was Director of the Constitutional Laboratory at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He became a professor of medicine at the University of Oregon Medical School in 1951. Work In psychology, he developed a new version of somatotypology by classifying people into endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ectomorphic types, based on many photographs and measurements of nude figures at Ivy League schools. Ron Rosenbaum writes: \\"He believed that every individual harbored within him different degrees of each of the three character components. By using body measurements and ratios derived from nude photographs, Sheldon believed he could assign every individual a three-digit number representing the three components, components that Sheldon believed were inborn -- genetic -- and remained unwavering determinants of character regardless of transitory weight change. In other words, physique equals destiny.\\" In numismatics, he authored Early American Cents and later revised that work within Penny Whimsy (these were the most exhaustive catalogues of the varieties of early American large cents at that time). The Sheldon variety list for Early American Cents is still in use today. He also developed the \\"Sheldon scale\\" that graded coins on a numeric basis from 1 to 70, which is still standard among American numismatists. Allegations of theft, and posthumous suits William Herbert Sheldon was also a specialist in United States cents.

Life Jane West's parents were Jane and John Iliffe. She was born in London, though the family moved to Desborough in Northamptonshire when she was eleven. In 1800 she wrote to the man of letters Thomas Percy, bishop of Dromore, seeking his patronage and describing herself as self-instructed and interested in poetry from an early age. By 1783 she was married to Thomas West (d. 1823), a yeoman farmer of Little Bowden, Leicestershire. They had three sons: Thomas (1783–1843), John (1787–1841), and Edward (1794–1821). Jane West benefited from the acquaintance with Bishop Percy, whom she visited in 1810, although her literary connections were never extensive. She corresponded with Sarah Trimmer and wrote a series of poems in praise of women writers: Trimmer, Elizabeth Carter, Charlotte Turner Smith, whom she visited in Ireland and Anna Seward.Roger Lonsdale, ed. Eighteenth- Century Women Poets (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 379; ODNB entry by Gail Baylis Retrieved 4 November 2013. Pay-walled. Conservatism West's writing is consistently conservative and didactic, but she did advocate expanding the education for women. Her works serve as a counterpoint to the revolutionary politics of the day: A Tale of the Times (1799) is anti-Jacobin; The Infidel Father (1802) attacks atheism; and one of her conduct texts, Letters to a Young Lady, \\"forms an ideological counterpart to Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).ODNB entry. Though she was called \\"strident,\\"ODNB entry. her writing was popular in its day for its \\"improving\\" qualities. Letters to a Young Man (1801), for example, went through six editions by 1818. Her poems appeared in journals and anthologies and she was a longstanding contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine. Her dramas would seem to have been less in tune with popular taste, as they were not successful. Although she claimed to consider her womanly domestic duties more important than her literary activities — \\"My needle always claims the pre- eminence of my pen. I hate the name of 'rhyming slattern.'\\" — there are indications that she actively sought success as a writer.Roger Lonsdale, ed. Eighteenth-Century Women Poets, pp. 379–380. She died at Little Bowden at the age of 94, feeling out of step with contemporary trends.ODNB entry. Sources Today West is best known as the author of a novel that served as a source text for Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility (1811). Her novel A Gossip's Story (1796), like Austen's novel, features two sisters, one full of rational sense and the other of romantic, emotive sensibility. West's romantic sister shares the same name as Austen's: Marianne. There are further textual similarities, described in the Valancourt Classics 2015 edition of the novel.Jane West (2015), Devoney Looser, Melinda O'Connor and Caitlin Kelly, eds, A Gossip's Story, and a Legendary Tale (1796), Richmond, Virginia: Valancourt Books, . Austen, like Shakespeare before her, significantly reworked West's plot and characters to suit her own vision. West, on the other hand, drew on Austen's fiction in her critically neglected last novel, Ringrove; Or, Old-Fashioned Notions (1827), with similarities to Austen's Emma (1816).

It has been in business since the late 1920s and is noted for a particular drink, also called an Orange Julius. The beverage is a mixture of ice, orange juice, sweetener, milk, powdered egg whites and vanilla flavoring, similar to a morir soñando or orange Creamsicle.  History  The drink grew out of an orange juice stand opened in Los Angeles, California in 1926 by Julius Freed. Sales were initially modest, about $20 a day (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). In 1929, Bill Hamlin, Freed's real estate broker, developed a mixture that made the acidic orange juice less bothersome to his stomach. Freed's stand began serving the drink, which had a frothier, creamier texture. The sales at the stand increased substantially after the introduction of the new drink, going up to $100 a day. During the 1950s and 1960s, Orange Julius was sold at a variety of outlets, including state and county fairs and freestanding Orange Julius stands. The original stand also provided medicinal tonics and Bible tracts. It now has hundreds of stores in malls across America and Canada, in Singapore, Puerto Rico, South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. In 1987, the Orange Julius chain was bought by International Dairy Queen. IDQ, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, owns the rights to all Orange Julius stores and has expanded the chain so its drinks are offered at many of its Dairy Queen stores, called Treat Centers. Naming and mascot The Orange Julius was named the official drink of the 1964 New York World's Fair.Brown, Ellen, \\"Supercharge your immune system: 100 ways to help your body fight illness, one glass at a time\\", Beverly, MA: Fair Winds Press, 2008. . Cf. p.35. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Orange Julius beverage stands used the image of a devil with a pitchfork around an orange, with the slogan, \\"A Devilish Good Drink\\". The devil image resembled Sparky, the mascot of Arizona State University, and the company later dropped the logo and slogan after threats of a lawsuit from the ASU alumni association. For a short period in the early 1970s, Orange Julius expanded into the UK and Dutch markets, with a fairly large restaurant in Golders Green, selling Julius Burgers as well as the classic orange drink, and a small outlet in the city center of Amsterdam. However, this had gone by the mid-70s. See also * Gibeau Orange Julep * Juice bar Notes Sources * Mariani, John F. (1999). The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink. New York: Lebhar-Friedman. . .

Organization of the colony began in October 1869 by Nathan Meeker in order to establish a religiously oriented utopian community of \\"high moral standards\\". The colony was founded in March 1870 at the site of present-day Greeley, Colorado. Union Colony was financially backed and promoted by New York Tribune editor, Horace Greeley, a prominent advocate of the settlement of the American West. The homesteaded colony greatly advanced irrigation usage in present-day northern Colorado, demonstrating the viability of cultivation at a time when agriculture was emerging as a rival to mining as the principal basis for the territorial economy. Background Horace Greeley had journeyed west in 1859 at the height of the Colorado Gold Rush, going from Denver to Fort Laramie via the Overland Stage Line before continuing on to California. Greeley's route took him up the valleys of the South Platte and Cache la Poudre near the eventual location of the colony. History In 1869 Greeley sent Meeker, then employed as the agricultural editor of the Tribune, to the Colorado Territory to seek out a location for a colony to promote settlement in the West. Meeker returned to New York City in the autumn of 1869, reporting that the South Platte Valley presented a good opportunity for the colony. In October, Meeker began organizing the enterprise, and on December 14, 1869, he placed an advertisement in the Tribune calling for volunteers to join him in the new venture. Meeker's advertisement specifically sought volunteers of high moral standards, who were literate and adherents to the tenets of the Temperance movements. The cost of membership for those accepted to the colony was set at $160. Of the more than 3000 people who responded, Meeker selected 700 applications as prospective colonists, ninety of whom later backed out. Former Union general Robert Alexander Cameron served as the first vice president and later president of the colony, as well as the colony's superintendent. Cameron would also become president of the Fort Collins colony in 1872. Establishment With the collected membership fees, Meeker journeyed west in the Spring of 1870 with two other officers. They purchased a tract of land in Weld County, near the confluence of the Cache la Poudre and South Platte Rivers and founded the settlement. Initially, the colony thrived and expanded, attracting other homesteaders to the area. The religious nature of the colony was not agreeable to all the settlers, however, so a portion of them spread out to other nearby lands in the area. Jacob Flowers, for example, was one of these. In 1872, the success of the colony inspired some of its officers to found another colony upstream on the Poudre River at Fort Collins. The city of Greeley itself was incorporated in 1886. Notoriety During the 1870s, the colony became known for its heavy use of irrigation, with one visitor reporting that nearly every person in the cooperative was involved in the maintaining of at least one irrigation ditch. Meeker was killed by Utes at the \\"Meeker Massacre\\" in western Colorado in 1879. The irrigation system built by the Colony remains an important part of the area today, although growing urbanization threatens more and more of the productive croplands the irrigation systems allowed to be utilized. Significance and legacy The Colony's influence is recognized in the region's history. Greeley remained a dry municipality until 1972. As a result, several nearby towns grew more rapidly as a source of liquor; and at least two small towns, Rosedale, and Garden City, were established and incorporated largely to allow saloons, bars, and liquor stores to feed the demand of nearby University of Northern Colorado students and faculty. Fire protection services for the City of Greeley are today provided by the \\"Union Colony Fire Rescue Authority\\".

He is noted for his founding in 1870 of the Union Colony, a cooperative agricultural colony in present-day Greeley, Colorado. In 1878, he was appointed U.S. Agent at the White River Indian Agency in western Colorado. The next year, he was killed by Ute warriors in what became known as the Meeker Massacre, during the White River War. His wife and adult daughter were taken captive for about three weeks. In 1880, the United States Congress passed punitive legislation to remove the Ute from Colorado to Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in present-day Utah, and take away some land formerly guaranteed them. The town of Meeker, Colorado and Mount Meeker in Rocky Mountain National Park are named for him. Early life Nathan Cook Meeker was born in Euclid, Ohio on July 12, 1817, to Enoch and Lurana Meeker. He had three brothers. Meeker was a writer and submitted articles to area publications when he was a boy. He left home at 17 years-of-age for New Orleans, where he worked as a copy boy for the New Orleans Picayune. In the late 1830s, Meeker returned to Ohio, where he attended and graduated from Oberlin College. Early career and family After college, Meeker worked as a school teacher in Cleveland and Philadelphia. He saved up his money to move to New York, hoping to fulfill a desire to become a poet. In New York, he became a contributor to the Mirror, which was owned by N.P. Willis. Unable to support himself, he moved back to Euclid and was a traveling salesman. Meeker was also a farmer. Meeker married Arvilla Delight Smith, a Congregationalist, on April 8, 1844. He was baptized a Disciple of Christ to address her concern about his lack of faith. Smith was concerned that Meeker was younger than her. So, he stated that his year of birth was 1814 on their marriage certificate. The couple settled in the Trumbull Phalanx colony in Ohio. The colony was based upon the utopian theories of Charles Fourier. Arvilla taught kindergarten and Nathan was a teacher, historian, auditor, librarian, secretary, and poet laureate. In 1845, their son Ralph Lovejoy was born. Two years later George Columbus was born at the colony. The Trumbull Phalanx colony failed due to financial and health issues in the fall of 1847. In 1847, Meeker opened a store with his brothers in Cleveland. Rozene was born in 1849 in Munson. The store failed in 1850. Meeker opened another store in Hiram in 1852. He was asked to help found the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute by the Disciples of Christ, but he was furious when his claim was held up because he sold whiskey. He only sold whiskey by prescription, but was so angry over the misunderstanding that he left the church. In 1854, Mary was born in Hiram, and three years later Josephine was born there. Meeker lost his store and property during the Great Panic of 1857. He moved to Dongola, Illinois, where he opened a small store and grew fruit. Meeker wrote articles, often about sociology, that were published by the Cleveland Plaindealer and reprinted by Horace Greeley in the New-York Tribune. His first novel, The Adventures of Captain Armstrong was published in 1856, with Horace Greeley's assistance. Meeker became a war correspondent for Greeley in his Cairo, Illinois office during the Civil War. He was present at and reported on the battle at Fort Donelson, among other journalists such as Junius Henri Browne and Charles Carleton Coffin. Meeker became made an agricultural journalist and editor at the end of the war for the New-York Tribune. Meeker's novel Life in the West or Stories of the Mississippi Valley was published in 1866. He went to the Rocky Mountains for the Tribune in 1869, and was inspired to live there. Union Colony Meeker's former home, now The Meeker Memorial Museum in Greeley, Colorado. Meeker, who was interested in communal and cooperative farms, created his vision of a utopian community based upon Christianity and communal economic enterprise, which was a modification of Charles Fourier’s definition of a utopian society. With the backing of his editor Horace Greeley, Meeker organized the Union Colony (later the town of Greeley) to be settled in the Colorado Territory. He advertised for applicants to move to the South Platte River basin, in what was intended as a cooperative venture for people of \\"high moral standards.\\" Meeker received approximately 3,000 replies that winter, and accepted about 700 of them to purchase shares. With the capital from the shares, in 1870 Meeker purchased 2,000 acres (8 km²), primarily from Native Americans, at the confluence of the South Platte and the Cache La Poudre River (Powder Bag) rivers near present-day Greeley. The venture relied on funding from Horace Greeley. Meeker also founded the Greeley Tribune in 1870. The settlers brought irrigation techniques to northeastern Colorado, and helped attract additional agricultural settlement in the region. The community failed on a couple of counts. It was not financially successful and the community members had not adopted the Christian values that Meeker espoused. Indian agent In 1878, eight years after the founding of the colony, Meeker was appointed United States (US) Indian agent at the White River Ute Indian Reservation by Henry M. Teller, the Governor of Colorado, on the western side of the continental divide. He received this appointment, although he lacked experience with Native Americans. While living among the Ute, Meeker tried to extend his policy of religious and farming reforms, but they were used to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle with seasonal bison hunting, as opposed to one which would require them to settle on a particular piece of land. The federal government had been trying to persuade the Ute to abandon their nomadic lifestyle, and become farmers. It wanted them to send their children to European-American style schools and assimilate into majority culture. Meeker Massacre An etching that appeared in the December 6, 1879 edition of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper depicts the aftermath of the \\"Meeker Massacre.\\" Meeker grave at lower left; W.H. Post grave at lower right Meeker wanted to convert the Ute from what he considered their state of primitive savagery to become subsistence farmers who adopted his techniques. He was warned that the Ute resented his reforms and attempts at conversion. Ignoring these reports, Meeker ordered that a horse racing track be plowed under to convert the track and horses' pasturage to farmland. The Ute held their horses as a chief source of status and wealth, and considered the order an affront. Meeker suggested to one man that the tribe had too many horses and they would have to kill some to give more land over to agriculture. After having the track plowed, Meeker had a tense conversation with an irate Ute chief. Meeker wired for military assistance, claiming that he had been assaulted by an Indian, driven from his home, and severely injured. The government sent approximately 150-200 soldiers, led by Major Thomas T. Thornburgh, commander of Fort Steele in Wyoming, to settle the affair. On September 29, 1879, before troops arrived, the Ute attacked the Indian agency, killing Meeker and his 10 male employees. They took some women and children as hostages to secure their own safety as they fled and held them for 23 days. Two of the women taken captive were of Meeker's family: his wife Arvilla and daughter Josephine, just graduated from college and working as a teacher and physician. Meeker is buried at the Linn Grove Cemetery, Greeley, Weld County, Colorado.Greeley History Legacy and honors *Meeker, Colorado was named after him. *Mount Meeker, a shorter neighbor to Longs Peak, the tallest mountain in Rocky Mountain National Park, was named for him. *The Meeker Home Museum is located at 1324 9th Avenue Greeley, Colorado.

UTSI was founded to allow the University of Tennessee to take advantage of the aerospace facilities located in the Arnold Engineering Development Center on Arnold Air Force Base, including wind tunnels and other laboratory equipment. Currently, the research activities conducted at UTSI are largely through the Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering department.  History  UTSI was born in the aftermath of World War II and in the midst of the Cold War. The seeds that ultimately led to UTSI began in the 1930s. German aeronautical superiority resulted in German fielding of the first jet propelled aircraft and ballistic missiles, thus proving the need for research facilities devoted to the study of aeronautics and related sciences. Had the German manufacturing capability been equivalent to that of the United States, the outcome of World War II would no doubt have been different.http://www.utsi.edu/index.php/history/ President Harry Truman vowed in 1951 that, \\"Never again will the United States ride the coattails of other countries in the progress and development of the aeronautical art.\\" In the wake of World War II and in the following decades, the military expanded its research capabilities, creating laboratories across the country, including the construction of airplane and missile airframe and propulsion systems wind tunnels and laboratories at Tullahoma. Construction of this facility, which was to be known as Arnold Engineering Development Center, began in 1950. It was recognized that there would be difficulties in attracting scientific personnel to conduct research, or to analyze the results of testing in wind tunnels and engine test facilities. Numerous efforts were conducted while AEDC was under construction to develop a viable concept for an education and research institute that would exist in a collaborative relationship with AEDC. In 1952, an Institute of Flight Sciences was strongly recommended to foster graduate programs, lecture and symposia programs, and student research in the aeronautical sciences. General Jimmy Doolittle, Secretary of the Air Force Donald A. Quarles, Donald Douglas of Douglas Aircraft Company, along with NACA, MIT, and Caltech scientists supported the concept as sound and in the national interest. However, no consensus could be developed as to how to proceed and the concept was abandoned in 1959. In 1956, however, the Air Force decided it could not wait any longer and made contractual arrangements with the University of Tennessee to establish an AEDC graduate study program for center employees, using office and classroom space provided by the Air Force. Dr. Joel F. Bailey was the initial director of the UT effort, followed by Dr. Robert L. Young. The year 1958 sent a new shock wave throughout the world when the Soviet Union orbited the Sputnik satellite. In the aftermath of this event, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was formed. NASA initially considered absorbing AEDC, but ultimately decided to leave it with the Air Force. However, the need for space education was severely felt at AEDC, just as throughout the rest of the military and at NASA. Few academic institutions offered engineering or refresher courses in space technology at the time. Dr. B.H. Goethert seized upon this national need and proposed to the Air Force and the State of Tennessee that a \\"Tennessee Aerospace Institute\\" be located near AEDC. As a result of Dr. Goethert’s proposal, the University of Tennessee Space Institute was finally established in 1964. UTSI played a unique role of vital importance to the US Air Force. It was founded in the wake of two technological revolutions – the development of the airplane and the development of the rocket. In the years following 1964, UTSI’s faculty, students, and alumni have played critical roles in the furthering of American technological superiority in aeronautics and space arenas. UTSI continues to collaborate with AEDC to support present day Air Force pursuits. Currently, UTSI is supporting the development of modern hypersonic systems with multiple federally supported research activities in the area. This research primarily focuses on experimental and computational aspects of high-speed aerothermodynamics, and makes use of the proximity of UTSI to aerospace entities in Huntsville, AL and AEDC.  Relationship with Knoxville Campus  Since UTSI is part of the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, students enrolled at the Space Institute are granted degrees from the University of Tennessee- Knoxville. Furthermore, the two campuses share courses via virtual connection. The majority of faculty at UTSI are in the Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomedical Engineering department. UTSI is also home to many of the University of Tennessee-Knoxville's experimental aerospace testing platforms, including the following: * A Mach 2 Blowdown Tunnel (8\\" x 8\\" Test-Section) * A Mach 2.3 Blowdown Tunnel (6\\" x 6\\" Test-Section) * A Mach 4 Ludwieg Tube (24\\" x 24\\" Test-Section) * A Mach 7 Ludwieg Tube (18\\" x 18\\" Test-Section) (Scheduled for Completion Late 2020)  Notable faculty  * Dr. John D.

Barnett was a batsman who played internationally for England between 1988 and 1989. He was primarily a batsman, but could also deploy effective leg spin, and topped the English first-class bowling averages in 1994 with 13.30, albeit with only thirteen wickets to his name. Barnett was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1989. Domestic career He mainly played for Derbyshire, from 1979 to 1998 and Gloucestershire from 1999 to 2002. He also played for South African teams Boland and Impalas. Barnett played the bulk of his county cricket career for Derbyshire, and was captain between 1983 and 1995. He remained at the club for several more years, until clashes with players and the county's committee resulted in his leaving for Gloucestershire in 1999. He was disappointed not to be offered a renewal of his contract after the 2002 season, and retired from first-class cricket, although he continued to play in regional league competitions. Barnett scored 28,593 first-class runs in 479 matches at an average of 40.38, with 61 centuries and a top score of 239 not out, made against Leicestershire.

Workers along the Baltic went on strike in August 1980 in support of the 21 demands of MKS which eventually led to the creation of Solidarity. Background The labor strikes did not occur because of problems that emerged shortly before the unrest, but due to political and economic difficulties the previous ten years. Under the rule of Władysław Gomułka in the late 1960s, Poland's economy was in disarray. To counter this, the government increased food prices just before Christmas 1970 which irritated the entire populace of the nation. On December 14, 1970 workers from the Lenin shipyard in Gdańsk began a strike against party headquarters within the city insisting on the formation of independent trade unions. In this disturbance 75 people were killed after Gomułka ordered that the revolt be put down with force. As R. J. Crampton wrote: \\"The Kremlin did not agree and intervened to urge the need for a political solution. For the nationalist communist Gomułka, Soviet dictation of internal Polish policies was too much.\\"Crampton, R. J. Eastern Europe in the twentieth century. 2nd ed. London: Routledge, 1994. Google Print, pg. 359 Edward Gierek, who appeared to be more open to workers' needs and have strong political ties to the working class, soon replaced Gomułka. This was the first occasion in Europe since World War II that labor strikes were able to remove a ruler from power. Gierek was able to stress economic reforms during the first half of his tenure of office. According to R. J. Crampton: \\"The stated objective of the reforms was to increase living standards; a less publicly attested motivation was the knowledge that, with prices fixed and with demand increasing, goods had to be put into circulation to avoid rampant inflation.\\"Crampton, R. J. Eastern Europe in the twentieth century. 2nd ed. London: Routledge, 1994. Google Print, pg. 360. In the years prior to the Gdańsk strikes in 1980 the reforms of Gierek did succeed as planned, but the economy of Poland became progressively more unstable. This was due to Poland's reliance on western markets and loans that the nation could not repay. Fueled by large infusions of Western credit, Poland's economic growth rate was one of the world's highest during the first half of the 1970s, but much of the borrowed capital was misspent and the centrally planned economy was unable to use the new resources effectively. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s and economic growth had become negative by 1979.Background Note: Poland Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. U.S. State Department. Last accessed on 15 November 2010 Strikes of 1980 As the economic crisis became unbearable, the Communist government authorized an increase in food prices for the summer of 1980. Once again a revival of labor disturbances erupted throughout the nation. Workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk ultimately went on strike in mid-August, sparked by the firing of Anna Walentynowicz.Cohen, Roger, \\"The Arab Gdansk\\", The International Herald Tribune opinion, January 17, 2011 (NYTimes website; January 18, 2011 in Herald Tribune). Retrieved 2011-01-18. Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers took control of the shipyard and demanded labor reform and greater civil rights including the freedom of expression and religion, and the release of political prisoners. On the third day of the strike, on August 16, 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wałęsa and others announced the end of the strike, however the women of the shipyard, Anna Walentynowicz and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over bread and butter issues into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments.Szporer, Michael (2011). \\"Anna Walentynowicz and the Legacy of Solidarity in Poland\\". Journal of Cold War Studies. Agreement Due to the popular support of the citizens and other striking groups, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. The successful strikers formed the Gdańsk Agreement on August 31, 1980 as an authentic social contract with the government. This allowed citizens to bring democratic changes within the communist political structure. The main concern of the workers was the establishment of a trade union independent of communist party control and the legal right to strike. In creating these new groups, there would be a clear representation of the workers' needs. \\"These new unions are intended to defend the social and material interests of the workers, and not to play the role of a political party, they will be established on the basis of socialization of the means of production and of the socialist system that exists in Poland today.\\"Stan Persky, At the Lenin Shipyard: Poland and the rise of the Solidarity Trade Union, New Star Books, 1981, , p.130 Other major concerns were to control commercial prices, the use of foreign money in all internal economic dealings, ensuring the proper supply of resources within the nation and only exporting the excess. This would ensure that there would be a better chance for prosperity within the nation for all working citizens. List of Points 1\\\\. Acceptance of free trade unions independent of the Communist Party and of enterprises, in accordance with convention No. 87 of the International Labor Organization concerning the right to form free trade unions, which was ratified by the Communist Government of Poland. 2\\\\. A guarantee of the right to strike and of the security of strikers and those aiding them. 3\\\\. Compliance with the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech, the press and publication, including freedom for independent publishers, and the availability of the mass media to representatives of all faiths. 4\\\\. A return of former rights to: 1) People dismissed from work after the 1970 and 1976 strikes, and 2) Students expelled from school because of their views. The release of all political prisoners, among them Edward Zadrozynski, Jan Kozlowski, and Marek Kozlowski. A halt in repression of the individual because of personal conviction. 5\\\\. Availability to the mass media of information about the formation of the Inter-factory Strike Committee and publication of its demands. 6\\\\. The undertaking of actions aimed at bringing the country out of its crisis situation by the following means: a) making public complete information about the social-economic situation, and b) enabling all sectors and social classes to take part in discussion of the reform programme. 7\\\\. Compensation of all workers taking part in the strike for the period of the strike, with vacation pay from the Central Council of Trade Unions. 8\\\\. An increase in the base pay of each worker by 2,000 złoty a month as compensation for the recent raise in prices. 9\\\\. Guaranteed automatic increases in pay on the basis of increases in prices and the decline in real income. 10\\\\. A full supply of food products for the domestic market, with exports limited to surpluses. 11\\\\. The abolition of 'commercial' prices and of other sales for hard currency in special shops. 12\\\\. The selection of management personnel on the basis of qualifications, not party membership. Privileges of the secret police, regular police and party apparatus are to be eliminated by equalizing family subsidies, abolishing special stores, etc. 13\\\\. The introduction of food coupons for meat and meat products (during the period in which control of the market situation is regained). 14\\\\. Reduction in the age for retirement for women to 50 and for men to 55, or after 30 years' employment in Poland for women and 35 years for men, regardless of age. 15\\\\. Conformity of old-age pensions and annuities with what has actually been paid in. 16\\\\. Improvements in the working conditions of the health service to insure full medical care for workers. 17\\\\. Assurances of a reasonable number of places in day-care centers and kindergartens for the children of working mothers. 18\\\\. Paid maternity leave for three years. 19\\\\. A decrease in the waiting period for apartments. 20\\\\. An increase in the commuter's allowance to 100 złoty from 40, with a supplemental benefit on separation. 21\\\\. A day of rest on Saturday. Workers in the brigade system or round-the-clock jobs are to be compensated for the loss of free Saturdays with an increased leave or other paid time off. Impact The Gdańsk Agreement is very important to the politics of Poland because the strikes exposed the corruption and negligence within the state's leadership. In recognizing individual rights, such as the freedom of expression, the government is opened for the creation of civil societies. This allows citizens to come together where all people can agree on human rights regardless of party beliefs. The problems caused by the labor movements and the ensuing Gdańsk Agreement led to the removal of Edward Gierek and the installation of Stanisław Kania in September 1980. Solidarność (Solidarity), the independent trade union that emerged from the Lenin Shipyard strike, was unlike anything in the history of Poland. Even though it was mainly a labor movement representing workers led by chairman Wałęsa, it attracted an assorted membership of different citizens which quickly rose to unpararelled proportion of a quarter of the country's population: 10 million people nationwide. Due to its enormous size and newly found power, the union assumed the role of a national reform lobby able to change politics in Poland forever. On the second anniversary of the agreement, August 31, 1982, a massive wave of anti- government demonstrations took place across Poland. The regime answered with police force; according to Solidarity, at least seven people were killed throughout Poland. References Further reading * Stokes, Gale. From Stalinism to Pluralism.

Such gaps that no longer carry water currents are called wind gaps. Water gaps and wind gaps often offer a practical route for road and rail transport to cross the mountain barrier.  Geology  A water gap is usually an indication of a river that is older than the current topography. The likely occurrence is that a river established its course when the landform was at a low elevation, or by a rift in a portion of the crust of the earth having a very low stream gradient and a thick layer of unconsolidated sediment. In a hypothetical example, a river would have established its channel without regard for the deeper layers of rock. A later period of uplift would cause increased erosion along the riverbed, exposing the underlying rock layers. As the uplift continued, the river, being large enough, would continue to erode the rising land, cutting through ridges as they formed. Water gaps are common in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of eastern North America. Alternatively, a water gap may be formed through headward erosion of two streams on opposite sides of a ridge, ultimately resulting in the capture of one stream by the other.

He served in the United States Army from February 23, 1942, to March 1, 1963, and earned the rank of lieutenant colonel. Corso published The Day After Roswell in 1997, about his alleged involvement in the research of extraterrestrial technology recovered from the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident. On July 23, 1997, he was a guest on the popular late night radio show, Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell where he spoke live about his Roswell story. Corso died of a heart attack less than a year later.http://www.phils.com.au/corso.htm Biography =Military career= After joining the Army in 1942, Corso served in Army Intelligence in Europe, becoming chief of the US Counter Intelligence Corps in Rome. In 1945, Corso arranged for the safe passage of 10,000 Jewish World War II refugees out of Rome to the British Mandate of Palestine. He was the personal emissary to Giovanni Battista Montini at the Vatican, later Pope Paul VI, during the period when the \\"Nazi Rat Lines\\" were most active. According to Corso, in 1947, a secret government group (probably Majestic 12) was created under the orders of the first CIA director, Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter. The mission of that group was to collect information on aliens. During the Korean War (1950–1953), Corso performed intelligence duties under General Douglas MacArthur as Chief of the Special Projects branch of the Intelligence Division, Far East Command. One of his primary duties was to keep track of enemy prisoner of war (POW) camps in North Korea. Corso was in charge of investigating the estimated number of U.S. and other United Nations POWs held at each camp and their treatment. At later hearings in 1992 of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, Corso provided first hand testimony, that many hundreds of American POWs were abandoned at these camps. McCain stated that his knowledge obtained from those who had personal relationships with Eisenhower led him to believe that Eisenhower was just not capable of allowing known American POWs to remain incarcerated after the termination of the Korean War. Corso was on the staff of President Eisenhower's National Security Council for four years (1953–1957). In 1961, he became Chief of the Pentagon's Foreign Technology desk in Army Research and Development, working under Lt. Gen. Arthur Trudeau. =The Day After Roswell= 120px In his book The Day After Roswell (co-author William J. Birnes), Corso claims he stewarded extraterrestrial artifacts recovered from a crash near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Corso says a covert government group was assembled under the leadership of Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, the first director of Central Intelligence (see Majestic 12). Among its tasks was to collect all information on off- planet technology. The US administration simultaneously discounted the existence of flying saucers in the eyes of the public, Corso says. According to Corso, the reverse engineering of these artifacts indirectly led to the development of accelerated particle beam devices, fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit chips and Kevlar material. In the book, Corso claims the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or \\"Star Wars\\", was meant to achieve the destructive capacity of electronic guidance systems in incoming enemy warheads, as well as the disabling of enemy spacecraft, including those of extraterrestrial origin. =Death= Corso died of a heart attack on July 16th, 1998.http://www.phils.com.au/corso.htmhttp://www.v-j- enterprises.com/crsodies.html Gallery =Personal= File:Philip_j_corso_2.jpgIn Rome, 1945 File:Philip_j_corso_1.jpgIn Tokyo, 1953 File:Philip_j_corso_3.jpgIn Germany, 1960 =Files= File:Philip_j_corso_4.gifDA Form 66 (page 1) File:Philip_j_corso_5.gifDA Form 66 (page 2) File:Philip_j_corso_6.gifDA Form 66 (page 3) File:Philip_j_corso_7.gifDA Form 66 (page 4) File:Philip_j_corso_8.gifDA Form 66 (page 5) His service number on his id card was 01047930 as shown on TV.

It was released in both the UK (Epic SEPC 69050) and the US (Epic KE 32800) in December 1973. History By late 1973, Donovan abandoned the style of glam rock featured on his Cosmic Wheels album earlier that year. Andrew Loog Oldham was brought in (replacing Mickie Most) to co-produce Donovan's next album, which would highlight the subdued style of his previous work. Many of the songs were released on Live in Japan: Spring Tour 1973, but that album was not released outside Japan. In a clear sign of Donovan's waning popularity, Essence to Essence became the third Donovan album after H.M.S. Donovan and earlier Fairytale to fail to reach the top 25 in the U.S. charts. Essence to Essence missed the UK album charts altogether and peaked at No. 174 in the United States. On Essence to Essence, Donovan focuses on spirituality and meditative lyrics. The album art features Donovan clothed in white robes, kneeling as in meditation. While the album was derided as a critical failure at the time of its release, many of the songs went on to form a major part of Donovan's live repertoire throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Reissues *On 26 January 1998 Epic/Rewind Records released Essence to Essence in the UK (Epic/Rewind 489443 2), marking the first CD release for the album. *On 23 February 2004 Diablo Records released Cosmic Wheels/Essence to Essence (DIAB8051) in the UK on CD.

Gupton College is a private 2-year college in Nashville, Tennessee that specializes in mortuary science. Founded in 1946, it awards the Associate of Arts degree in Funeral Service. Gupton College is accredited by both the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the American Board of Funeral Service Education. Gupton is located just west of downtown Nashville, in the same building as the Tennessee Funeral Directors Associational Office. Most of Gupton's students attend in order to prepare for careers as funeral directors. All students follow the same curriculum. History =Founding= In March 1946, John A. Gupton Jr. and his wife Bernadean Gupton purchased the former Gov. Hill McAlister Mansion located at 2507 West End Avenue, in Nashville, Tennessee. They founded and opened the John A. Gupton College of Mortuary Science on September 25, 1946. John was President and Bernadean was Educational Director. Renovation of the mansion for the college consisted of: first floor offices and a preparation room; second floor laboratories, a casket display room, library and student lounge; third floor lecture hall, lockers and private living quarters. Dormitories were also available to students. The first class began on September 27, 1946, with an enrollment of 26 students. The course work was nine months in length with matriculation held in March and September. In June 1947, the John A. Gupton Alumni Association was founded. The alumni association has established an endowment fund to show support of the college and its future. =Additions and renovations= In 1952, additions were needed. A large two-story classroom building, Paul L. Williams Hall (in honor of the college's 1st Law instructor), was erected. The new building was with the floor plan as follows: the first floor included two offices, storage rooms, utility rooms, lockers, lecture room and preparation rooms; the second floor included a large lecture room and a science laboratory. The growth of the college began to increase after 1954, with Gupton-Jones merging with the Dallas Institute of Mortuary Science. John A. Gupton College became the only mortuary college in the southeast. In the next few years more additions were made. Alumni Hall was erected adjacent to Williams Hall and housed the administrative offices and a large conference room. Kensington Place Hall, a large two story building, was erected behind Williams Hall and housed Memorial Library, faculty offices and two lecture rooms. Puryear Mims Hall was located two blocks from the main campus at 2810 Vanderbilt Place and was used for a Fine Arts instruction. In addition, the college maintained affiliations with five area hospitals, including Vanderbilt University Hospital, Saint Thomas Hospital, Baptist Hospital, Metropolitan Nashville General Hospital, and the Miller Hospital. Through this affiliation the students had the opportunity to practice the principles and theory of embalming. Embalming was performed at the hospital or the college preparation room. In October 1964, the college was incorporated under the laws of the state of Tennessee as a school of mortuary science. The school was incorporated as a non-profit educational institution in 1965, and has since been known as John A. Gupton College. In keeping with standards set by the American Board of Funeral Service Education in the fall of 1966, a program of study leading to an Associate's degree in Mortuary Science was offered. The college received correspondence from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools on January 14, 1970 and official accreditation at the Association's annual meeting in December 1971. This accreditation made John A. Gupton College the 1st college accredited by both the American Board of Funeral Service Education and a regional accrediting agency with scholastic transferability. John A. Gupton College building at 1616 Church St. in Nashville, Tennessee In 1988, Mr. Gupton's health diminished. He died on December 15, 1988. John A. Gupton, III assumed the position of president of the college. Mrs. Gupton remained on the faculty for several years until her death on August 15, 1994. They both are interred at Calvary Cemetery in Nashville. The board of directors and the Gupton heirs decided to sell the campus to Vanderbilt University in the fall of 1991. The college relocated to a new facility in mid-town Nashville at 1616 Church Street in the fall of 1992. The school purchased a 14 unit apartment building adjacent to the new campus in April 1998, allowing students an opportunity to be housed on campus. In July 2006, the college purchased an adjacent one-half acre lot for additional parking space, bringing the total size to in downtown Nashville.

Life and work Alfred Hill was born in Melbourne in 1869. His year of birth is shown in many sources as 1870, but this has now been disproven. He spent most of his early life in New Zealand. He studied at the Leipzig Conservatory between 1887 and 1891 under Gustav Schreck, Hans Sitt and Oscar Paul. Later he played second violin with the Gewandhaus Orchestra, under guest conductors including Brahms, Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Bruch, and Reinecke. While there, some of his compositions were played with fellow students, and several were published in Germany. These included the Scotch Sonata for violin and piano.Liner notes to Alfred Hill – Symphonies 8 & 9, ABC recording Hill returned to New Zealand, where was appointed director of the Wellington Orchestral Society. He also worked as a violin teacher, recitalist, chamber musician, and choral conductor. He was active in the push for a New Zealand Conservatorium of Music, and for the foundation of an institute of Māori studies at Rotorua. During this period he completed his first string quartet, on Māori themes, which later would achieve some familiarity in the United States through regular programming by the Zoellner Quartet in the period surrounding World War I.See, for example, “Zoellner Quartet Concert Will Be Given in Fraser Hall Thursday Evening,” Lawrence Journal-World, 3 April 1917, accessed April 2012. In 1897 Hill returned to Australia, where he taught for a number of years. He married his first wife, Sarah Brownhill Booth, a New Zealander, on 6 October 1897 in Paddington, New South Wales. They were to have three children, who were given the Wagnerian names Isolde, Tristan and Elsa. In 1921 he divorced his wife, and on 1 October of that year married his former student Mirrie Solomon, also a composer. Alfred Hill's daughter Isolde Hill became a noted opera singer, and granddaughter Patricia Hill, a noted actress. On 1 January 1901 he conducted a choir of 10,000 voices and ten massed brass bands as part of the celebrations of the Federation of Australia in Sydney. After several years regularly travelling between Australia and New Zealand, Hill settled in Sydney in 1911, becoming the principal of the Austral Orchestral College, and the 2nd violin player of the Austral String Quartet. In 1913 Hill founded the Australian Opera League with Fritz Hart, as part of an attempt to create an Australian operatic tradition. Hill was also a founder of the Sydney Repertory Theatre Society, and a foundation council member (later president) of the Musical Association of New South Wales. Alfred Hill (right, seated) with other members of the New South Wales State Conservatorium Quartet (Gerald Walenn, Lionel Lawson and Gladstone Bell) Hill was also active as an organizer of music in Australia. In 1915–16 he co-founded the NSW State Conservatorium of Music and became its first Professor of Theory and Composition, and later deputy conductor to Henri Verbrugghen. When the Australian Broadcasting Commission was formed in 1932, Hill was member of the ABC's Music Advisory Committee. In 1947 he became president of the Composers' Society of Australia. Honours Alfred Hill was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1953, and a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1960. In 1959, his 90th birthday was celebrated by a special concert of his music played by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Henry Krips. Alfred Hill died at the age of 90 in 1960. He was survived by his second wife Mirrie Hill, and the three children of his first marriage. Isolde Hill became well known as a singer. Compositions and reputation Hill composed and conducted music for the Hugh McCrae play The Ship of Heaven, which was produced by the Independent Theatre in 1933. From 1937 onwards, he devoted himself full-time to composition. He wrote more than 500 compositions, including 13 symphonies (of which 11 are arrangements of previously written string quartets), eight operas (including The Weird Flute), numerous concertos, a mass, 17 string quartets and other chamber works, two cantatas on Māori subjects (Hinemoa and Tawhaki) and 11 other choral works, and 72 piano pieces. One of his string quartets (No.11 in D minor), from 1945, was the very first Australian composed chamber work to be recorded.Ian Crispin Creswell, \\"Share of secrets on music for films\\", The Canberra Times, Arts & Entertainment, 12 May 2000, p.12 While mostly neglected nowadays, he is still very well known on both sides of the Tasman for a short song \\"Waiata Poi\\", which was recorded by many singers including Peter Dawson. Since the 1990s, however, there has been renewed interest in Hill's oeuvre. His short piece for narrator and orchestra, Green Water, with words by John Wheeler, has been recorded at least twice. The Marco Polo label recorded most of his symphonies, which were played by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra.

He previously served as an assistant coach for the Oakland Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Pittsburgh Steelers.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BuckBr20.htm College career Buckner played college football at Clemson University, and was a first-team All-ACC selection in his senior year. In addition to ranking fourth all-time in school history with 46 tackles for a loss, he also set a school record with a 1,220 pound lift on a leg sled. Professional career Buckner was selected in the second round (50th overall) of the 1994 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. After missing the first three games of the season, he played in the last 13, and started both playoff games. During one game against the Buffalo Bills, he blocked a field goal. The following season, he was a regular starter for the Steelers, and was an integral part of the defense that led them to Super Bowl XXX against the Dallas Cowboys. After one more year with Pittsburgh, he was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs during the offseason. He was picked up by the Cincinnati Bengals before the 1997 NFL season. He missed two games that season with an injury suffered against the Steelers, his former team. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers before the next season. He notched his third career blocked field goal against the team he would later play for, the Carolina Panthers. He played with the Niners for three seasons before joining the Carolina Panthers as an unrestricted free agent before the 2001 NFL season. Buckner joined with Julius Peppers, Mike Rucker and Kris Jenkins to form what many experts called the most dominating front four defensive line in football. The four led the Panthers defense to Super Bowl XXXVIII against the New England Patriots. On March 1, 2006, Buckner was released by the Panthers. Post retirement After retirement, Buckner hosted a midday show on WFNZ in Charlotte, with former NFL Offensive lineman Frank Garcia. The Frank and Buck Show aired weekdays from 11a-3p.

Early years Raymond Unwin was born in Rotherham, Yorkshire and grew up in Oxford, after his father sold up his business and moved there to study. He was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford. In 1884 he returned to the North to become an apprentice engineer for Stavely Iron & Coal Company near Chesterfield. Unwin had become interested in social issues at an early age and was inspired by the lectures and ideals of John Ruskin and William Morris. In 1885 he moved to Manchester and became secretary of Morris's local Socialist League. He wrote articles for the League's newspaper and spoke on street corners for its cause and for the Labour Church. He also became a close friend of the socialist philosopher Edward Carpenter, whose Utopian community ideas led to his developing a small commune at Millthorpe near Sheffield. In 1887 he returned to Staveley Iron as an engineer, working on development of mining townships and various other buildings, and joined the Sheffield Socialist Society. In 1893 he married Richard Barry Parker's sister Ethel, and formed a partnership in 1896 based in Buxton, Derbyshire. The partners preferred the simple vernacular style and made it their aim to improve housing standards for the working classes. They were also members of the Northern Art Worker's Guild and were close friends of Edgar Wood (1860–1935) the leading Arts and Crafts architect in the North of England and a founding member of the group. Planning career In their various writings, including their book The Art of Building a Home (1901), Parker and Unwin aimed to popularise the Arts and Crafts Movement, and as a result of their success thousands of homes were built on their pattern in the early part of the 20th century. A notable example of one of their earliest collaborations at Clayton, Staffordshire, is dated to 1899, and was originally called the Goodfellow House after the man who commissioned it. Parker and Unwin were involved in designing many of the interior fittings, which remain in the house to this day, and the initial layout of the large gardens. Goodfellow sold the house in 1926 to Colley Shorter who ran the nearby pottery works of Wilkinson's and Newport. He renamed it Chetwynd House and when he married his star designer Clarice Cliff in 1940, she moved into the house and lived there until 1972. It is her association that has made the house particularly famous since.Griffin Leonard. Clarice Cliff: The Fantastic Flowers of Clarice Cliff (Pavilion/Chrysalis 1998/2001 In 1902 Parker and Unwin were asked to design a model village at New Earswick near York for Joseph and Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, and the following year they were given the opportunity to take part in the creation of Letchworth (loosely based on the Utopian plan of Ebenezer Howard), when the First Garden City Company asked them to submit a plan. In 1903 they were involved with the \\"Cottages Near a Town Exhibit\\" for the Northern Art Workers Guild of Manchester. In 1904 after their plan was adopted they opened a second office at Baldock. In 1905 Henrietta Barnett asked them to plan the new garden suburb at Hampstead, now known as Hampstead Garden Suburb. Unwin moved from Letchworth to Hampstead in 1906, and he lived here for the rest of his life at the farmstead Wyldes Farm.Letchworth Garden City, \\"Architects and Planners of Letchworth Garden City\\" In 1907, Ealing Tenants Limited, a progressive cooperative in west London, appointed him to take forward the development of Brentham garden suburb.Brentham Garden Suburbs, \\"Architects and Architecture\\" Unwin joined the Local Government Board in December 1914. In 1915 he was seconded to the Ministry of Munitions to design the villages of Gretna and Eastriggs and supervise others. From 1917 he had an influential role at the Tudor Walters Committee on working-class housing whose report was published in 1919, the year in which he was appointed Chief Architect to the newly formed Ministry of Health. That post had evolved into the Chief Technical Officer for Housing and Town Planning by the time of his retirement in November 1928. His demonstration during the Great War of the principles of building homes rapidly and economically whilst maintaining satisfactory standards for gardens, family privacy and internal spaces, gave him great influence over the Tudor Walters Committee and hence, indirectly, over much inter-war public housing. This report marked Unwin's definitive break from the traditional 'garden city' concept, as it proposed that the new developments should be peripheral 'satellites' rather than fully-fledged garden cities. Unwin became technical adviser to the Greater London Regional Planning Committee in 1929 and largely wrote its two reports, the first published in that year and the second in 1933. Unwin was President of the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) from 1915 to 1916, President of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) from 1931 to 1933, was knighted in 1932 and consulted by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the New Deal in 1933. In 1936 he was appointed visiting Professor of Town Planning at Columbia University and in 1937 he received the RIBA Royal Gold Medal for architecture.

Early life David and Ruth Greenglass Ruth Leah Printz was born to a Jewish family on April 30, 1924, in New York City to Max Printz and Tillie Leiter. She grew up in the same neighborhood, the Lower East Side, as her future husband, David Greenglass. She graduated with honors from Seward Park High School at 16. Although quite young, she and Greenglass wanted to marry before he was drafted to serve in World War II. They married in late November 1942 when he was 20 and she was 18. They shared an interest in politics and joined the Young Communist League. Espionage Julius Rosenberg became a Soviet agent, working under Alexander Feklissov. In September 1944, Rosenberg suggested to Feklissov that he should consider recruiting his brother-in-law, David, and his wife. Feklissov met the couple and on September 21, he reported to Moscow: \\"They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing in the cause of communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible. They are undoubtedly devoted to us (the Soviet Union).\\"Feklissov, Alexander (September 21, 1944) report on David and Ruth Greenglass David wrote to his wife, \\"My darling, I most certainly will be glad to be part of the community project (espionage) that Julius and his friends (the Russians) have in mind.\\" After her husband was drafted and inducted into the Army in 1943, Ruth continued to visit him. In November 1944, she visited him in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he was working as a machinist on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. During that visit, she asked him to forward any information on the project to his brother-in-law, Julius. Rosenberg trial When the FBI questioned him about suspected espionage activities, David agreed to confess to his own activities and to testify against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in exchange for immunity for his wife so that she could remain at home with their two children. At the trial, Ruth implicated Ethel in the espionage ring by testifying that Ethel had typed up the notes that David had provided. Ruth testified that both Rosenbergs had urged her to persuade her husband to become involved in espionage. Ruth's testimony was crucial in securing Ethel's conviction. Later life She rejoined her husband after his release from prison in 1960, and they lived in New York City under assumed names with their children. She died on April 7, 2008, at the age of 83, a fact that became widely known only when the government, numbering her among the deceased witnesses, released her grand jury testimony a few weeks later. David Greenglass died in 2014, aged 92. Reliability The truth of Ruth Printz Greenglass's testimony at the Rosenberg trial has been questioned.Roberts, Sam (2003) The Brother: The Untold Story of the Rosenberg Case. New York: Random House, In September 2008, her grand jury transcripts were released and showed that when testifying before the grand jury in August 1950, she was asked, \\"Didn't you write the information down on a piece of paper?\\" She replied, \\"Yes, I wrote the information down on a piece of paper and Julius Rosenberg took it with him.\\"Eley, Tom (September 13, 2008) The trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg At the trial she testified that Ethel had typed up the notes about the atomic bomb.

Eveleth Taconite Co., 130 F.3d 1287 (8th Cir. 1997), was the first class-action sexual harassment lawsuit in the United States. It was filed in 1988 on behalf of Lois Jenson and other female workers at the EVTAC mine in Eveleth, Minnesota on the state's northern Mesabi Range, which is part of the Iron Range. Facts Jenson first began working at the site in March 1975 and along with other women, endured a continuous stream of hostile behavior from male employees, including sexual harassment, abusive language, threats, stalking and intimidation. On October 5, 1984, she mailed a complaint to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights outlining the problems she experienced.Minnesota Department of Human Rights In retaliation, her car tires were slashed a week later. In January 1987, the state's agency requested that Ogelbay Norton Co.,Oglebay Norton a Cleveland, Ohio-based part-owner of the mine, pay US$6,000 in punitive damages and $5,000 to Jenson for mental anguish, but the company refused. On August 15, 1988, attorney Paul Sprenger filed Lois E. Jenson and Patricia S. Kosmach v. Eveleth Taconite Co. in U.S. District Court in the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis. Class-action status was requested at the time, and granted by James M. Rosenbaum on December 16, 1991. Jenson quit working at the mine on January 25, 1992, and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder a short time later. A liability trial began on December 17, 1992, in front of Judge Richard Kyle in St. Paul, Minnesota, and six months later, he ruled that the company should have prevented the misconduct. The company was ordered to educate all employees about sexual harassment. Patrick McNulty of Duluth was named special master a few months later to oversee a trial that would determine the amount of money owed to the women in damages. The retired federal magistrate permitted lawyers from the mine company to obtain medical records of all of the women for their entire lifetimes. Ahead of the trial, the plaintiffs endured long depositions that explored their personal lives in great detail. The first half of the trial for damages began in Duluth on January 17, 1995 and lasted until February 10. After a break, it resumed on May 22 and ended on June 13. On March 28, 1996, McNulty released a 416-page report that called the women \\"histrionic,\\" made public details about their private lives, and awarded them an average of $10,000 each. However, the judgment was appealed and reversed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on December 5, 1997. A new jury trial on damages was ordered. Settlement On December 23, 1998, just before the trial was set to begin, fifteen women settled with Eveleth Mines for a total of $3.5 million. One of the original plaintiffs, Pat Kosmach, died partway through the case, on November 7, 1994. The case was documented in the 2002 book Class Action and a 2005 fictionalized film version, North Country. See also *Hostile Advances: The Kerry Ellison Story movie about Ellison v.

It was named for its resemblance to the series of starting lights at a drag racing strip, called by that name.  Overview  The first primitive Christmas Tree was used by the Hamill Brothers to bring Spindletop under control. It consisted of a T-valve, with a 6-inch and 8-inch valve on the vertical pipe, and a 6-inch valve on the horizontal pipe. The vertical valve was closed first, and then the valve to the horizontal pipe. Christmas trees are used on both surface and subsea wells. It is common to identify the type of tree as either \\"subsea tree\\" or \\"surface tree\\". Each of these classifications has a number of variations. Examples of subsea include conventional, dual bore, mono bore, TFL (through flow line), horizontal, mudline, mudline horizontal, side valve, and TBT (through-bore tree) trees. The deepest installed subsea tree is in the Gulf of Mexico at approximately . (Current technical limits are up to around 3000 metres and working temperatures of -50 °F to 350 °F with a pressure of up to 15,000 psi.) The primary function of a tree is to control the flow, usually oil or gas, out of the well. (A tree may also be used to control the injection of gas or water into a non-producing well in order to enhance production rates of oil from other wells.) When the well and facilities are ready to produce and receive oil or gas, tree valves are opened and the formation fluids are allowed to go through a flow line. This leads to a processing facility, storage depot and/or other pipeline eventually leading to a refinery or distribution center (for gas). Flow lines on subsea wells usually lead to a fixed or floating production platform or to a storage ship or barge, known as a floating storage offloading vessel (FSO), or floating processing unit (FPU), or floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). A tree often provides numerous additional functions including chemical injection points, well intervention means, pressure relief means, monitoring points (such as pressure, temperature, corrosion, erosion, sand detection, flow rate, flow composition, valve and choke position feedback), and connection points for devices such as down hole pressure and temperature transducers (DHPT). On producing wells, chemicals or alcohols or oil distillates may be injected to preclude production problems (such as blockages). Functionality may be extended further by using the control system on a subsea tree to monitor, measure, and react to sensor outputs on the tree or even down the well bore. The control system attached to the tree controls the downhole safety valve (SCSSV, DHSV, SSSV) while the tree acts as an attachment and conduit means of the control system to the downhole safety valve. Tree complexity has increased over the last few decades. They are frequently manufactured from blocks of steel containing multiple valves rather than being assembled from individual flanged components. This is especially true in subsea applications where the resemblance to Christmas trees no longer exists given the frame and support systems into which the main valve block is integrated. Note that a tree and wellhead are separate pieces of equipment not to be mistaken as the same piece. The Christmas tree is installed on top of the wellhead. A wellhead is used without a Christmas tree during drilling operations, and also for riser tie-back situations that later would have a tree installed at riser top. Wells being produced with rod pumps (pump jacks, nodding donkeys, grasshopper pumps, and so on) frequently do not utilize any tree owing the absence of a pressure- containment requirement. Valves Subsea and surface trees have a large variety of valve configurations and combinations of manual and/or actuated (hydraulic or pneumatic) valves. Examples are identified in API Specifications 6A nd 17D. A basic surface tree consists of two or three manual valves (usually gate valves because of their flow characteristics, i.e. low restriction to the flow of fluid when fully open). A typical sophisticated surface tree will have at least four or five valves, normally arranged in a crucifix type pattern (hence the endurance of the term \\"Christmas tree\\"). The two lower valves are called the master valves (upper and lower respectively). Master valves are normally in the fully open position and are never opened or closed when the well is flowing (except in an emergency) to prevent erosion of the valve sealing surfaces. The lower master valve will normally be manually operated, while the upper master valve is often hydraulically actuated, allowing it to be used as a means of remotely shutting in the well in the event of emergency. An actuated wing valve is normally used to shut in the well when flowing, thus preserving the master valves for positive shut off for maintenance purposes. Hydraulic operated wing valves are usually built to be fail safe closed, meaning they require active hydraulic pressure to stay open. This feature means that if control fluid fails the well will automatically shut itself in without operator action. The right hand valve is often called the flow wing valve or the production wing valve, because it is in the flowpath the hydrocarbons take to production facilities (or the path water or gas will take from production to the well in the case of injection wells). The left hand valve is often called the kill wing valve (KWV). It is primarily used for injection of fluids such as corrosion inhibitors or methanol to prevent hydrate formation. In the North Sea, it is called the non-active side arm (NASA). It is typically manually operated. The valve at the top is called the swab valve and lies in the path used for well interventions like wireline and coiled tubing. For such operations, a lubricator is rigged up onto the top of the tree and the wire or coil is lowered through the lubricator, past the swab valve and into the well. This valve is typically manually operated. Some trees have a second swab valve, the two arranged one on top of the other. The intention is to allow rigging down equipment from the top of the tree with the well flowing while still preserving the two-barrier rule. With only a single swab valve, the upper master valve is usually closed to act as the second barrier, forcing the well to be shut in for a day during rig down operations. However, avoiding delaying production for a day is usually too small a gain to be worth the extra expense of having a Christmas tree with a second swab valve. Subsea trees are available in either vertical or horizontal configurations with further speciality available such as dual bore, monobore, concentric, drill-through, mudline, guidelineless or guideline. Subsea trees may range in size and weight from a few tons to approximately 70 tons for high pressure, deepwater (>3000 feet) guidelineless applications. Subsea trees contain many additional valves and accessories compared to surface trees. Typically a subsea tree would have a choke (permits control of flow), a flowline connection interface (hub, flange or other connection), subsea control interface (direct hydraulic, electro hydraulic, or electric) and sensors for gathering data such as pressure, temperature, sand flow, erosion, multiphase flow, single phase flow such as water or gas.

Founded in 1849, the college offered associate degrees as well as bachelor's degrees. The majority of its associate degree graduates went on to complete bachelor's degrees elsewhere. The college closed on May 10, 2019 due to financial issues. History Photo from the book Holston Methodism Although closely tied to the Methodist Church since its founding, it was not until 1908 that the Trustees of Hiwassee College and the Holston Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South entered into an agreement for joint operation of the institution. Hiwassee College came under the complete control and ownership of the Methodist Church-South in 1937, shortly before its reunion with its northern counterpart in 1939. Prior to 1980, the three United Methodist-related colleges in the Holston Conference (a geographic region that includes East Tennessee and small parts of southwest Virginia and north Georgia) were governed by a unified Board of Trustees. In 1980, the Board of Trustees established a separate Board of Governors for each institution, and by 1990, each of the three colleges operated under a separate, independent Board of Trustees. Hiwassee College was accredited with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, but in 2008 their accreditation was withdrawn. On November 3, 2009 it attained candidacy status for accreditation as a Category II institution by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS). Full accreditation was obtained through TRACS in October 2013 and reaffirmed in 2018. =Closure and aftermath= The college closed on May 10, 2019 due to financial issues. Students and alumni protested the announcement of the closure and many parents of enrolled students raised concerns about the lack of communication from the board of trustees. Neighboring colleges, including Maryville College, Pellissippi State Community College, and South College offered students transfer assistance. The Hiwassee College Alumni Association Inc. (HCAA) submitted a non-cash offer for the college and its debt in July 2019 with hopes of reopening the college. The campus was put up for sale on January 2, 2020 for $8.6 million dollars. The offering Memorandum states, \\"The Trustees of Hiwassee College now intend to divest the real property owned by the college, and as such are offering the property for sale.\\" In January 2020, a former trustee of the college, William Harmon, a Maryville, Tennessee doctor sued the college for return of his $100,000 donation earmarked for construction of a new library which was to be named in his honor. According to its website, Harmon was the college's board of trustees secretary. Harmon wants the Monroe County, Tennessee Chancery Court to find that the donation must paid back to him once the college sells. Campus Hiwassee College's campus grew from the original donated by Reverend Daniel B. Carter to a campus comprising 18 buildings situated on of a tract of land located one mile (1.6 km) north of the town of Madisonville. Organization and administration Hiwassee College was listed by the University Senate of the United Methodist Church. The Senate is an elected body of professionals in higher education created by the General Conference to determine which schools, colleges, universities, and theological schools meet the criteria for listing as institutions affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Academics The college offered a variety of university-parallel and career/vocational programs leading to the Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Applied Science, Bachelor of Arts, or Bachelor of Science degrees. Athletics Hiwassee fielded 10 teams, known as the Tigers, and participated in the NCCAA's Division I. The school competed in the Mideast Region. The Tigers have made National Championship appearances in baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball, and competitive shooting.
