Friction emerged within the firm, and by June 1967, Foster and Rogers, decided to dissolve the firm. The practice originally included Wendy Cheesman's sister Georgie Wolton (n√©e Cheesman) who, as the only qualified architect of the group, allowed the practice to function. Georgie Cheeseman left after only a few months, leaving the remaining members to try to pass their professional exams while continuing to practice.Ian Lambot (Ed.), \\"Norman Foster: Buildings and Projects Volume 1 1964-1973\\", Watermark Publications (1991), . Chapter 1 \\"Team 4\\" by Sir Richard Rogers, pp. 14-15 Rogers, Foster and Brumwell had first met while studying at Yale University. Rogers and Brumwell later married, as did Foster and Cheesman. Notable projects One of the first projects for Team 4 was a commission from Su Brumwell's parents, Marcus and Irene Brumwell, to build a new house in Feock, Cornwall, called Creek Vean. They sold a Piet Mondrian painting bought from the artist in the 1930s, to fund the new house. Marcus Brumwell was the founder of the Design Research Unit. Creek Vean took 3 years to construct and was completed in 1966. It became the first ever house to win a R.I.B.A. Award. Creek Vean is a listed building, having been listed Grade II in 1998, and subsequently upgraded to Grade II*. It is listed as \\"Creekvean and Attached Entrance Bridge and Walls to Road, Feock\\". Team 4 designed Skybreak House in Radlett, Hertfordshire. It was built between 1965 and 1966, and the interior of the house was used in the film A Clockwork Orange. The final project for Team 4 was the Reliance Controls building in Swindon, which was completed in 1967, just before Team 4 dissolved. It was noteworthy as it removed the separation of management and workforce by creating a common entrance and canteen. Rogers claims a planning scheme of 120 houses for Water Homes, at Coulsdon, Surrey, to be \\"probably the most important project of our Team 4 period\\". Foster would later establish Foster Associates and Rogers established the Richard Rogers Partnership.

It lies on the plain between Mount Vesuvius and the Apennines. It is traditionally credited as the diocese that introduced bells to Christian worship. History=Prehistory Excavations at Nola-Croce del Papa have uncovered extensive evidence of a small village quickly abandoned at the time of the Avellino Eruption in the 17th century . This powerful eruption from Mount Vesuvius caused the inhabitants to leave behind a wide range of pottery and other artifacts. The foundations of their buildings are also preserved in imprints among the mud left by the eruption. Antiquity A 2nd-century bronze parade mask found in a Roman tomb at Nola Nola was one of the oldest cities of Campania, with its most ancient coins bearing the name Nuvlana. It was later said to have been founded by the Ausones, who were certainly occupying the city by . It once vied in luxury with Capua. During the Roman invasion of Naples in 328 , Nola was probably occupied by the Oscans in alliance with the Samnites. Amid the Samnite War, the Romans took the town in 311 . Under Roman rule, the city was the site of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battles of Nola during Hannibal's invasion of Italy amid the Second Punic War. On two occasions (215 and 214 ), it was defended by Marcellus. It fell by treason to the Samnites during the Social War. It was stormed by Spartacus during his failed slave revolt. The emperor Augustus died there on 19 August 14, in allegedly the same room his father died in 72 years earlier. Augustus and Vespasian settled colonies in the area. In the Roman road network, Nola lay between Capua and Lower Nocera on the Via Popilia. A branch road ran from it to Abella and Avellino. Though a relative backwater, Nola retained its status as a ', its own institutions, and the use of the Oscan language. It was divided into ', the names of some of which are preserved: ', ', '. The discoveries of the pavement of the ancient city have not been noted with sufficient care to recover most of the plan, but a large number of Grecian vases were made at Nola, using its fine yellow clay and a shining black glaze. They are decorated with red figures. Following the rise of Christianity, it became a bishopric. One bishop, the Christian senator Paulinus, is traditionally credited with the introduction of the use of bells to Christian worship.. His small handbells were subsequently known as s for his seat and the larger tower bells as s from the surrounding area. Revered as a saint, Paulinus's relics turned the town into a site of Christian pilgrimage. Middle Ages Nola was sacked by Alaric in 410 and by the Vandals under Gaiseric in 453. It was raided by Muslim invaders in 904 and captured by Manfred of Sicily in the 13th century. Under Charles of Anjou, it was held by Guy de Montfort as the . It was inherited by his eldest daughter's Orsini husband and then held by members of their family. Modern age The 1460 Battle of Nola is noteworthy for the clever stratagem by which John, duke of Calabria, defeated Ferdinand, king of Naples, who fled the field with only 20 followers. Ferdinand, however, was supported by Pope Pius II, the duke of Milan, and the Albanian lord Skanderbeg. With his wife Isabella successfully wooing John's major supporters away, the king recovered his domain over the next decade. Nola itself subsequently lost its importance after its repeated destruction by earthquakes in the 15th and 16th centuries. The nearby Cicala Castle was the birthplace of Giordano Bruno (. 1548). In 1820, General Pepe's revolution began in Nola. The sculptor Giovanni Merliano was a native of the city; and some of his works are preserved in the cathedral. Nola is a suburb of Naples. In the 1990s to the 2000s, a waste management crisis broke out in the city as a result of illegal dumping by the Camorra. Majority of the waste was dumped in the region between Nola, Acerra, and Marigliano, referred to as the \\"Triangle of Death\\". A 2004 study by Alfredo Mazza published in The Lancet Oncology revealed that deaths by cancer in the area are much higher than the European average. Sights Although Roman ruins, including an amphitheatre and temple to Augustus, survived as long as the 16th century, they were then plundered for building material and few signs remain. A few tombs are preserved, and results from excavations are displayed at the Archaeological Museum.

The Thiers wall and the Porte de Versailles at the turn of the 20th century. On the right is the rampart and the stone scarp wall, on the left is the counterscarp and beyond that the sloping glacis, with the slums of the zone just visible in the background. The Thiers wall (Enceinte de Thiers) was the last of the defensive walls of Paris. It was an enclosure constructed between 1841 and 1846 and was proposed by the French prime minister Adolphe Thiers but was actually implemented by his successor. The long wall and ditch made a complete circuit around the city as it stood at the time of the July Monarchy. It was bombarded by the Prussian Army during the Franco-Prussian War, captured by government troops during the Paris Commune and refortified at the start of the First World War. However, by then it had become obsolete as a fortification, was a barrier to the expansion of the city, and the area immediately outside of it, known as \\"the zone\\", had become a shanty town. The wall was demolished in the interwar period; its path today can be traced by the Boulevards of the Marshals which originally ran just behind the fortifications and by the Boulevard P√©riph√©rique which was later built just outside. A few remnants of the wall can still be seen. Background The triumphal entry into Paris of the monarchs of Austria, Russia and Prussia on 31 March 1814, an event which led to calls for the city to be refortified. By the mid-16th century, Paris was defended by walls which had been built and rebuilt over the preceding centuries, but apart from the latest additions were largely obsolete for modern warfare and enclosed too small an area to contain the growing suburbs. In 1670, King Louis XIV ordered the demolition of all the walls surrounding Paris on the grounds that France was militarily secure and that a modern system of border fortifications had been constructed at great expense, and that like London and Madrid, Paris had become too large to fortify. Following the course of the demolished walls, the first boulevards were laid out, wide tree-lined avenues whose name is the French word for \\"bulwark\\".Pollak 2010, p. 190 An ambitious scheme of fortification for Paris proposed in 1689 by France's leading military engineer, Marshal S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, was not proceeded with. Following the Battle of Paris in 1814, when the Coalition armies had captured the city after a single day's fighting, there was renewed political pressure for the capital to be fortified. A royal commission for the defence of the kingdom considered the issue between 1818 and 1820, finally recommending a detailed plan of defences in the following year, but it was never implemented.Papayanis 2004, pp. 105-106 Planning When Louis-Philippe was proclaimed king of the French in 1830, there was renewed interest in the issue. A further commission on the defence of the kingdom first met in 1836 and by May 1838 began to consider the defence of Paris. After much debate, it was decided that the capital should be fortified in two ways; by a continuous wall which could be manned by the National Guard and would prevent infiltration or a surprise attack, and further out from that, by a chain of detached forts manned by the regular field army, which could prevent an enemy from establishing positions from which they could bombard the city and create a line so long that it would be difficult for besiegers to enforce a tight blockade. A further point in favour of this dual approach was that regular troops would not come into close contact with the notoriously rebellious Parisians, which might lead to a loss of discipline.Cox 2019, pp. 131-133 Implementation Adolphe Thiers in 1840. On 1 March 1840, Adolphe Thiers returned to office as prime minister and soon war threatened over the Oriental Crisis, when France found itself in opposition to Britain and Austria over events in Egypt. He was therefore amenable to an approach by the Duke of Orl√©ans and Fran√ßois Chabaud-Latour to implement the commission's recommendations to fortify Paris. Chabaud-Latour was an army officer who had worked on the commission's plans and was also a deputy in the National Assembly. Thiers obtained the backing of his cabinet for the scheme while the deputies were away on holiday, but then found there was fierce resistance from the left, led by Fran√ßois Arago and Alphonse de Lamartine, who suspected that the government had ulterior political motives: that the fortifications, especially the detached forts, were intended to threaten the Parisians in case of a revolt against the monarchy. Other arguments suggested that by making Paris a fortress, it would make the city an irresistible objective for any invading army. Thiers was forced to resign over foreign policy in October, but his successor, Marshal Soult, was determined to press on with the plan. Debate began in the legislature in January 1841 and the necessary legislation was passed on 3 April.Papayanis 2004, pp. 105-106 This legislation appropriated 140 million French francs for the work, including 17,970 million francs for land acquisition, 16,608 million francs for earthworks and 83,356 million francs for masonry.Lazare 1993, p. 132 It was also necessary to clear an area in front of the fortifications to ensure that there was an unobstructed field of fire. Initially, an area known as a zone non aedificandi (\\"building-free zone\\") of 974 metres was envisaged, which would have been laid out as public parkland; however the final solution was a zone of 250 metres beyond the ditch on which it was forbidden to erect anything except a wooden fence. Although landowners whose property was confiscated for the actual fortifications were paid compensation, there was nothing for those whose property lay within the zone and was thus devalued.Cannon 2015, p. 16 Construction The construction of the new works were overseen by Guillaume Dode de la Brunerie, the inspector-general of engineers and chairman of the fortifications committee.LePage 2006, p. 178 The fortifications not only included a continuous defensive wall or enceinte around the capital, but also a line of sixteen bastion forts lying between 2 and 5 kilometres from the wall. Although designed for all-round defence, these forts, such as Fort d'Issy, were not positioned so as to be able to support each other, unlike the polygonal forts being built by the Prussians at that time.Hogg 1975, p. 99 The work was undertaken by military engineers and commercial contractors and used a workforce of 20,000 troops and civilians. The course of the works crossed through 13 suburbsCannon 2015, p. 16 and was completed in 1846.Jones 2005, p. 292 Description Sceaux, about 1910. The long main wall, colloquially referred to as \\"the fortress\\", consisted of 94 bastions. These were numbered counting anti-clockwise from Bastion No 1 on the right (northern) bank of the River Seine in the southeast of Paris, round to Bastion No 94 which completed the circuit on the opposite bank. For command purposes, the wall was divided into nine military sectors, each sector consisting of between eight and twelve bastions. The wall was pierced by 17 gates (French: portes) for routes nationale or major roads, 23 secondary road crossings (French: barri√®res) for routes departementale, and 12 posterns for local access. The gates were closeable by barriers and acted as toll booths the collection of taxes and tariffs; some of the main portes were fitted with drawbridges. The wall was also pierced in five places by rivers and canals and later, eight railway crossing points were constructed. All these access ways made the wall harder to defend, but in peacetime, there were insufficient crossings for a major commercial centre which resulted in congestion.LePage 2006, p. 181 Profile or cross-section of the Thiers wall. On the left is the earthen rampart with a masonry scarp wall. The ditch is in the centre and on the right is the angled counterscarp with the glacis sloping away to open ground. The enceinte wall itself was constructed following the system devised by Louis de Cormontaigne nearly a century previously. The rampart was composed of packed earth and revetted by a vertical scarp (or front face) wall of stone, topped by a broad earthen parapet. In front of this was a wide dry ditch, bounded on the far side by an earthen counterscarp which sloped at an angle of 45¬∞ and was not revetted. Extending out from the top of the counterscarp was the glacis, a ridge intended to defend the scarp wall from direct bombardment, but the slope away from the fortress was angled so as to allow the defenders to fire on any attacking troops. However, a United States Army commission who visited in 1856 noted that the glacis, which rose above the floor of the ditch, only partially protected the vulnerable masonry of the scarp wall. Originally, there was a covered way which passed along the top of the counterscarp below the crest of the glacis, but by 1856 this had largely been eroded away.Delafield 1860, pp. 197-198 The enceinte wall was serviced and supplied by the Rue Militaire (\\"military road\\") which passed directly behind the works; different sections of which were named after various Marshals of France and are collectively called the Boulevards des Mar√©chaux,LePage 2006, p. 180 and were completed in their present form in 1861.Higonnet 2002, p. 191 In 1869, a supporting railway line was completed which also followed the course of the wall and could be requisitioned by the military in an emergency, the Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture (\\"Little Belt Railway\\"), which in peacetime conveniently linked the various rail termini of the capital.Volner 2019, p. 134 Military history=Siege of Paris Interior of a bastion on the Thiers wall during the Siege of Paris, showing the various emergency shelters and defence improvements. In the enthusiasm of the declaration of war against Prussia in July 1870, there was little thought given to the defence of Paris, as it was assumed that the fighting would all be in Germany. In the thirty years since the construction of the wall and the outlying forts, the range of artillery had almost doubled, and there were many vantage points in the hills surrounding the city from which modern guns could dominate the fortifications. During August, work had commenced on a redoubt at Chatillon in an attempt to remedy the most obvious case, but otherwise little was done. However, once news of the French defeats at Spicheren and W√∂rth reached Paris at the beginning of August, work commenced in earnest. Some 80,000 men were employed in clearing fields of fire in front of the fortifications, including felling many of the trees in the parkland of the Bois de Boulogne, the wood from which was used to build obstacles. Another 12,000 workers set about blocking or obstructing the gates to allow a minimum of traffic to pass.Fermer 2011, pp. 27-28 The openings for canals and aqueducts were blocked or closed with gratings. Dams were constructed in the Seine to allow the normally dry ditch of the wall to fill with water. A large number of redoubts, entrenchments and artillery batteries were built beyond the wall in an attempt cover any dead ground between the forts and to deny the high ground above them to the enemy. Immediately to the northeast of the wall, the area in front of Saint-Denis was flooded.Tiedemann 1877, pp. 127-129 On the wall itself, embrasures were cut into the parapets, traverses (embankments to protect against enfilade fire) were installed and shelters were constructed to protect against plunging mortar fire.LePage 2006, p. 199 The National Guard was expanded from 24,000 in Paris at the start of the war to 350,000 men, although Louis-Jules Trochu, the new president, quipped that \\"We have many men but few soldiers\\". In all the garrison numbered about half a million men, with 3,000 cannon of various types, many manned by naval reservists.Horne 2007, p. 62 When the Prussians arrived on 2 September, they began a wide encirclement of Paris starting from the southwest which was completed a week later when they had entrenched themselves on all the commanding heights, a front of some . The Prussian force was outnumbered, having some 240,000 men and 1,140 guns, so it was decided not to take the city by direct assault, but by bombarding the garrison into submission. Despite their numerical inferiority, the Prussians were able to defeat several sorties by the garrison; however, supplying sufficient artillery ammunition proved problematic until late in the siege. Eventually, the loss of the Arm√©e de la Loire at the Second Battle of Orl√©ans which was the defender's main hope of relief and the starvation of the civil population resulted in a ceasefire on 26 January 1871 and a surrender two days later.LePage 2006, p. 197 Paris Commune At the Point-du-Jour gate, a sympathetic civilian waves a flag on the battered ramparts at to show that the Communard defenders have left. Shortly after the end of the siege, a national legislative election resulted in a conservative and monarchist dominated government led by Adolphe Thiers. This completely alienated the radical working class Parisians, represented by the National Guard which was still under arms in the city. This led to a clash on 18 March between the National Guard and regular soldiers over some cannon stored at Montmartre; the government was forced to withdraw to Versailles and a second siege began while the Parisians elected their own government known as the Commune.LePage 2006, p. 198 Initial fighting was over the outlying forts which had been abandoned in accordance with the peace treaty with the Prussians. On the morning of 3 April, a massed foray westwards towards Versailles by 27,000 National Guards was easily dispersed by artillery fire from Fort Mont-Val√©rien which had been reoccupied by government troops. Fort d'Issy was occupied by the Communards and were only dislodged by a prolonged bombardment lasting until 8 May.Horne 2007, p. 342 Once sufficient troops and guns had been gathered, the Versailles government began a bombardment of the Thiers wall itself, concentrating on a southwestern section at Point-du-Jour on the right bank of the Seine. By 25 May the wall there was partly demolished, but there was no move to assault the breach until a friendly civilian appeared on the parapet to tell the attackers that the National Guard sentries had all gone off to find shelter, allowing the Versailles army to pour into the city.Horne 2007, pp. 363-364 In the \\"Bloody Week\\" that followed, the Communards fought from one street barricade to another, although Haussmann's new wide and straight avenues gave the government artillery good fields of fire and enabled the infantry to outflank fixed positions.Horne 2007, p. 375 First World War Digging a trench at Porte Maillot in 1914. After the outbreak of war, the French reverses in the Battle of the Frontiers and the subsequent Great Retreat at the end of August 1914 showed that Paris was once again threatened. On 3 September, the military governor, General Joseph Gallieni, ordered that the outlying forts be armed and the gates of the Thiers wall be made defensible by the addition of barbed wireCannon 2015, p. 116 and barriers of oak beams pierced with embrasures. Roadside plane trees were cut down to create an abatis along the edge of the ditch.Mellot 2014, p. 142 An order to clear the shacks and huts built on the zone non aedificandi was enacted by the city council but was revoked shortly afterwards. Following the First Battle of the Marne in early September and the removal of an imminent threat, there were popular demonstrations against the inconvenience caused by the barriers and they were dismantled by December of 1914. Social history=The \\"little suburb\\" The building of the Thiers wall caused an immense alteration to the social structure of the outer parts of the city. The legislative boundary of Paris since the 18th century had been the Wall of the Ferme G√©n√©rale, sometimes translated as the \\"Farmers-General Wall\\", which had no defensive function being only high, but served to enforce the octroi, a tariff on goods entering the capital. After the construction of the Thiers wall, the open grassland of the zone non aedificandi immediately outside the new wall quickly became a popular venue for walks and picnics by prosperous Parisians. This encouraged the development inside the walls of restaurants and dancehalls to entertain them and being beyond the Ferme G√©n√©rale wall, allowed food and drink to be sold tax-free. The area between the two walls became known as the petit banlieue or \\"little suburb\\", which underwent rapid development over the following decades, primarily of working class housing and industrial sites, expanding from a population of 75,000 in 1831 to 173,000 in 1856. A few areas between the walls remained rural; the last vineyards in Paris were at Butte-aux-Cailles in the south.Jones 1947, pp. 291-293 In 1853, the appointment of Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann as prefect began the huge renovation of Paris project, starting with the sweeping away of overcrowded slum housing in the city centre. In 1859, the start of the second phase of development extending beyond the recently demolished Ferme G√©n√©rale wall was made possible by the extension of the Paris boundary to the Thiers wall. The inclusion of these slum areas was initially unpopular with Parisians; one journalist complained that \\"They have sewn rags onto the dress of a queen\\". However, the construction of new roads and other infrastructure brought great improvements to the new arrondissements,Jones 1947, p. 312 although it was the more prosperous suburbs that benefitted most.Jones 1947, p. 317 Saint-Ouen. The \\"zone\\" The zone non aedificandi outside the ditch of the wall, generally referred to as \\"la Zone\\", had remained privately owned and although buildings of any sort were forbidden, it was quickly occupied by poor settlers, many of whom had been evicted during the improvements in central Paris. The zone was completely cleared in the siege preparations of 1870, but was reoccupied soon afterwards and several shanty towns developed, the population of which was swelled by migrants and Romani people from the provinces and neighbouring countries. The zone varied along its length from open fields and vegetable gardens to homes made from old railway carriages, sheds and masonry slums. The last outbreak of bubonic plague in France in 1921 killed twenty rag pickers in the zone. By 1926, the population of the zone was more than 42,000. In the inter-war period, there were efforts to clear these slums but resistance was slow due to legal disputes with land owners and was only completed during the wartime Vichy regime.Cannon 2005, pp. 4-6 The French slang \\"zonard\\" (\\"lad\\" in a pejorative sense) derives from the Paris zone.Hall 1986 Demolition and redevelopment The Fortifications of Paris with Houses by Vincent van Gogh, 1887. In 1882, Martin Nadaud proposed the demolition of the wall to parliament, stating that \\"la grande ville √©touffe dans sa camisole de force\\" (\\"the great city is choking in her straitjacket\\"). A scheme to replace the fortifications with a great circular housing estate was devised in 1884 by Adolphe Alphand, the director of public works for Paris. However, the grassy ramparts had become a popular promenade for the people of the suburbs, and was depicted romantically by artists such as Vincent van Gogh in his watercolours Gate in the Paris ramp (1886) and The Fortifications of Paris with Houses (1887).Michaud pp. 105-106 In 1908, the municipal council began negotiations with the war ministry, resulting in two treaties ratified in 1912 to entirely demilitarise the fortifications, the first legal step towards their demolition.Michaud p. 108 On 19 April 1919, there was a vote on the laws to permit the demolition of the enceinte fortifications. which was only completed in 1932. Some of the space created was used to double the width of the Boulevards des Mar√©chaux and on the rest, 40,000 new homes were built. This mostly took the form of affordable housing known as habitations √† bon march√© or HBM, generally in austere seven- storey apartment blocks built around narrow alleys and courtyards.Jones 2005, p. 395 In the west, some more expensive apartment buildings were constructed in Art Deco style of that era. In the south, the space was used to create the parkland setting for the student halls of residence of the Cit√© internationale universitaire de Paris. On 17 February 1953, a law proposed by Bernard Lafay was passed which finally abolished the legal status of the zone non aedificandi and allowed work to start on a new ring road, the Boulevard P√©riph√©rique,Jones 2005, p. 441 which was finally opened in 1973. However, the P√©riph√©rique, which now carries 1.1 million vehicles daily, now represents a similar barrier to the integration of Paris with its suburbs as the old fortifications did and in 2016 resulted in the creation of the M√©tropole du Grand Paris, an administrative body for the whole Paris conurbation.

With the aid of the Thessalian family Aleuadae under Medius, Amyntas recovered his kingdom (Diodorus 14.92.3). To shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians, Amyntas established an alliance with the Chalkidian League. In 383/382 BC the Illyrians invaded again and defeated Amyntas in battle. A present of land was made to the Olynthians by Amyntas III, seeking for help. At that time the League was more powerful; not only did the alliance break down but the Chalcidians actually seized Amyntas' capital of Pella and lands of Macedon (DS 15.19.2; Isok. 6.46; cf. Hammond/Griffith 1979, 174-6). With the help of Sparta, Thessalians, Elimiotes, Iphicrates, Cotys I and city-states in Chalcidice opposing Olynthus, Amyntas recovered his kingdom and the Spartans dissolved the League in 379 BC. As Justin (7.4.6) states about Amyntas Cum Illyriis deinde et cum Olynthiis gravia bella gessit ... then he made serious wars against the Illyrians and the Olynthians. Unlike the first treaty, the second one is clearly beneficial to the League rather than Amyntas. Not only concerning the wood exports, which are related to the aims of the maritime League for constructing an effective navy (Amyntas actually would have little interest in wood from Chalcidice or building a navy) but also the third parties mentioned, are all potential enemies of the League and not Amyntas, whose main threat was from the North, the Illyrians.

He served as Whig Member of Parliament, wrote the memoirs of Maria Fitzherbert, and was a leading Roman Catholic figure during the 19th century. Origins Langdale was born Hon. Charles Stourton in 1787, the fourth son of Charles Stourton, 17th Baron Stourton by his wife Mary Langdale, a daughter and co-heiress of Marmaduke Langdale, 5th Baron Langdale (1771‚Äì1777). He became the heir of his mother's cousin Philip Langdale (d.1815) of Houghton Hall, East Riding of Yorkshire, who died with no sons, and to comply with the terms of his inheritance he adopted the surname Langdale by royal licence dated 1815, for himself and his descendants. Education He was educated at Oscott College and Stonyhurst College. Politics and public life Langdale campaigned for Catholic Emancipation, and after the passing of the Catholic Relief Act 1829 he became Member of Parliament for Beverley following the 1832 general election, becoming one of the first Roman Catholics in the House of Commons. He represented Beverly until 1835, and represented Knaresborough between 1837 and 1841. Throughout his life, Langdale took a leading part in all matters relating to the interests of Roman Catholics. He supported the foundation and became the chairman of the Catholic Poor School Committee, serving until his death. During his tenure, he played an important role in the negotiations for public funds for Roman Catholic schools. Shortly before his death, he was admitted as a lay brother of the Society of Jesus. At his funeral, Peter Gallwey described him as \\"the acknowledged father and patriarch of the oppressed Catholic community in England\\" and as \\"a father to us all\\". Henry Edward Manning, Archbishop of Westminster, in a funeral sermon in London, described him as having been for fifty years the foremost man among the Roman Catholic laity in England. Biography of Maria Fitzherbert Langdale had been a close friend of Maria Fitzherbert during their youth; there was a family connection through her first husband George Weld, whose niece married his eldest brother William. In the publication Memoirs of Lord Holland, it was claimed that Fitzherbert, a Roman Catholic, never believed her marriage vows to George, Prince of Wales, to be in any way binding (the marriage was considered invalid under the Royal Marriages Act 1772 because it had not been approved by King George III and the Privy Council). With a view to the vindication of her character, he published Memoirs of Mrs. Fitzherbert: with an account of her marriage with H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, afterwards King George IV at the request of his brother, Lord Stourton, one of the trustees named in Fitzherbert's will. He was refused access to her papers by the other trustees, but he was able to use the narrative drawn up by Lord Stourton. The memoirs showed that Fitzherbert believed herself to be George's wife. Marriage and children He married twice: *Firstly in 1817 to Charlotte Mary Clifford (died 1819), fifth daughter of Charles Clifford, 6th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh, by whom he had two daughters. *Secondly in 1821 he married May Constable-Maxwell (died 1857), eldest daughter of Marmaduke William Haggerstone Constable-Maxwell, by whom he had at least five sons and six daughters. Death & succession He died in Mayfair, London, in 1868 and was buried near his seat, Houghton Hall, Yorkshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles Joseph Langdale (1822-1895).

He was the founder of the Platt Music Corporation, which he started in 1905. Biography=Early life Benjamin Platt was born in a small town near Kiev, Russia (now a part of Ukraine). He moved to the United States in 1905, when he was twenty years old. Career He started his career as a salesman in New York City, for the Singer Sewing Machine Company. He moved to Los Angeles later that year and started The Platt Music Company; he began the company by selling pianos door-to-door. Platt Music Corporation was a private company that leased space in department stores and sold consumer electric products. By 1926, its annual sales volume was in excess of $3,000,000 and the company's total assets were approximately $2,700,000. Platt owned three buildings on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles: 830 Broadway, 840 Broadway, and 620-622 Broadway, next to the Orpheum Theatre. Walker & Eisen was the architectural firm that designed the 840 Broadway building. (Walker & Eisen is best known for the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.) Lange and Bergstrom were the contractors for 840 building. By 1928, Platt Music was one of the largest retailers of its kind in the world. In 1929, the stock market crashed and Platt Music went into receivership. Because of Platt‚Äôs good relationship with Tom May of the May Company, Platt rebuilt Platt Music to be bigger than ever. Platt Music contracted with the May Company to sell appliances in all of their stores. By 1955, Platt Music was the largest retail business of its kind in America. Platt was honored at the Ambassador Hotel in 1955, on the anniversary of his 50th year in business. Some of the biggest names in Los Angeles attended this event, some from as far as Mexico. Philanthropy He was one of the founders of The City of Hope and was active on its Board for many years. He was also the President of the Jewish Home for the Aging. He served as the President of Sinai Temple for twenty-one years, the longest-serving president to date. Additionally, he was one of the founders of the University of Judaism, now known as the American Jewish University. He then served as its first executive vice president. He was active in Masonry and was a member of Westgate Masonic Lodge, Scottish Rites, and the Al Malaikah Temple of the Shrine. Death and legacy He died at Cedars Hospital on Monday April 18, 1960, at the age of seventy-seven. On April 19, the Los Angeles City Council adjourned in memory of Platt and stopped conducting any business transactions the rest of the day. He is the father of Herman Platt and Leo Platt, the grandfather of Cynthia Platt Flagg and Nancy Platt Jacoby, Michael W.

The intimate relation between geometry and physics may be highlighted here, as the vector field X is regarded as preserving certain physical quantities along the flow lines of X, this being true for any two observers. In connection with this, it may be shown that every Killing vector field is a matter collineation (by the Einstein field equations (EFE), with or without cosmological constant). Thus, given a solution of the EFE, a vector field that preserves the metric necessarily preserves the corresponding energy-momentum tensor. When the energy-momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid, every Killing vector field preserves the energy density, pressure and the fluid flow vector field. When the energy-momentum tensor represents an electromagnetic field, a Killing vector field does not necessarily preserve the electric and magnetic fields.

He was born in Moscow, Russia; both of his parents were engineers, and his mother was also a Russian poet. Mark was educated at Moscow State University, where he received his BS and PhD degrees in 1970 and 1974. His mentor was the famous glaciologist Petr Shumsky. He was introduced to the high mountains by Misha Plam, who later came to Boulder to direct INSTAAR‚Äôs Mountain Research Station. In 1990 Mark received the higher degree of Doctor of Science from the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Science, and in 1992 was awarded the title Professor of Hydrology and Water Resources by the Russian Academy. Mountains and glaciology were two of the biggest passions in Mark‚Äôs life. He went with Professor Shumsky to Antarctica, where he overwintered twice. He conducted glaciological studies in many of the high mountains of Asia and climbed Peak Communism (, now renamed Ismoil Somoni Peak) in 1977, the highest mountain in the former Soviet Union. Mark conducted glaciological research for more than 21 days on the Pamir Glacier Plateau at elevations of without descending. At that time it was a record for a scientist working for so long at such a high elevation. Mark came to the United States in 1995 to work with American glaciologists in Boulder, Colorado. He became an American citizen in 2003. He continued his work as a Research Scientist and Fellow of INSTAAR, and collaborated with personnel at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, as well as with other local scientists and graduate students and colleagues around the world. Mark's closest colleagues were Mark Meier and W. Tad Pfeffer at INSTAAR, and David Bahr (now at Regis University). They helped Mark quickly integrate in the American glaciological community and feel at home in the U.S. In 2004, he received a fellowship from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, and in 2006-07 he was in Stockholm as a recipient of a prestigious Marie Curie Fellowship. At the time of his death, he had published over 120 scientific papers, including two in 2009, in the fields of glacier monitoring, causes of sea-level rise, methods of mass balance and runoff study, and all aspects of glaciers in relation to climate change and meltwater production. Until his last hours, he was working on a major compendium that he was planning to publish in Moscow as an issue of \\"Materials of Glaciological Research.\\" The best known of Mark‚Äôs contributions to the scientific literature are his several global compilations and syntheses of glacier mass balance. His results figured in the climate-change and sea-level sections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, which received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.

It was founded in 1970 as a sister project of Pollution Probe. In 1980, the two organizations formally separated and the Energy Probe Research Foundation (EPRF) was created, describing itself as \\"one of Canada's largest independent think tanks, with 17 public policy researchers\\", focusing \\"on the economic, environmental, and social impacts of the use and production of energy.\\"EPRF 'About Us' web page . Retrieved on 18 October 2011. After its separation and incorporation, and led from then on by Lawrence Solomon, EPRF began to accept funding from the oil and gas industry, and, in 1983, began a campaign \\"to educate Canadians to the social, environmental and economic benefits of less regulation in the petroleum field.\\" In the 1980s, the organization was also responsible for a proposal to dismantle the province of Ontario's publicly owned electricity utility, Ontario Hydro, in favour of privatization. The organization is also well known for its anti-nuclear energy stance, opposing nuclear energy production in Canada, especially in the case of nuclear plants in Ontario, on the grounds that nuclear power production is uneconomic. Additional divisions within Energy Probe are the Urban Renaissance Institute, Probe International, Environment Probe, the Environmental Bureau of Investigation, and the Consumer Policy Institute.  Views on global warming and climate change  EPRF argues that \\"the science behind competing theories of global warming is not yet settled\\", stating that \\"global cooling\\" is on the rise, that climate change is surrounded by \\"clouds of conspiracy\\", and that climate science is \\"corrupt\\" and the \\"greatest scientific fraud of the century\\". EPRF also argues that fossil fuels, especially gasoline, shale oil, natural gas, and coal, are clean and environmentally beneficial choices, putting it at odds with expected notions of environmental organizations. Founder (and National Post columnist) Lawrence Solomon published a series of columns and a book in 2008 titled \\"The Deniers: The World Renowned Scientists Who Stood Up Against Global Warming Hysteria, Political Persecution, and Fraud\\" naming 37 climate scientists and authors as \\"climate change skeptics\\" or \\"climate deniers\\". Several of these scientists and authors published their rejection of this characterization of their views, among them Sami Solanki of the Max Planck Institute, Nigel Weiss of the University of Cambridge, and Carl Wunsch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The National Post, on the urging of Professor Nigel Weiss, later issued a retraction and apology for the allegations made in the column. Founder Lawrence Solomon was a speaker at the conservative and libertarian public policy think tank The Heartland Institute's 2009 International Conference on Climate Change. The Heartland Institute holds similarly skeptical views about man-made climate change and related global warming, stating that the claims that global warming is a crisis are unscientific and delusional. Solomon remains on the rolls of the Heartland Institute as a policy expert. EPRF has also been critical of the Kyoto Protocol as well as of the Paris Accords.  Funding  The EPRF is a registered Canadian charity. Apart from donated income, it receives all of the profits of its \\"non-profit\\" organic coffee company and cafe in Toronto, Green Beanery. The cafe opened in 2008 and closed in March 2020; the online business is to continue. In 2012, the EPRF brought in $1.3 million in non-donation revenue.

His father Charles was a jeweler and watchmaker who moved his family from South Lyon, Michigan to Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1919. John attended Michigan Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University), where his interest in constructing keyboard instruments emerged. He spent four years apprenticing with Arnold Dolmetsch in England, returning in 1930, when he set himself up building instruments in a two-story space above a dress shop in Ypsilanti. At that time he was the only harpsichord maker in America. He later moved to Detroit. When his house was condemned to build the Chrysler Freeway, he moved to New York City. As he was the son of a jeweler, it was to be expected that Challis might include metal work in his instruments, and handmade brass hinges were a signature detail. His early instruments were traditionally constructed using traditional materials, but they evolved more than anyone else's. By the late 1950s his instruments still looked traditional from the outside, but were quite radical within: the frame and wrestplank were aluminum; bridges were brass; only the outer case was wood. Of his soundboard construction, Mr. Challis said, \\"This is my only secret\\"; Wolfgang Zuckermann (in his 1969 book The Modern Harpsichord) conjectured that they were anodized aluminum.Wolfgang Joachim Zuckermann, The Modern Harpsichord, October House Inc., 1969, p.94 Website postings by several harpsichord experts independently report that Challis' soundboards were not single aluminum sheets but are honeycombed. The instruments had a clear and bright sound and stayed in tune through temperature and humidity changes. A Challis pedal harpsichord was used by E. Power Biggs on two Columbia Masterworks recordings of the music of J.S. Bach and two of Scott Joplin. Makers who worked or apprenticed in his shop included William Dowd, Frank Rutkowski, and Stewart Pollens. Kottick, in his authoritative A History of the Harpsichord, expresses admiration for Challis's innovative work, but also notes it was something of a dead end: during Challis's lifetime, the construction of harpsichords shifted strongly toward close imitation of the work of the historical master builders of the 18th century and earlier. Thus, Challis's harpsichords served as a something of a last hurrah for 20th century efforts to improve the harpsichord by using modern technology. The movement toward historicist construction was initiated, among others, by Challis's own student Dowd. NotesReferences *Kottick, Edward (2003) A history of the harpsichord.

It is a remake of the 1984 film of the same name and stars Kenny Wormald, Julianne Hough, Miles Teller, Andie MacDowell and Dennis Quaid. The film follows a young man who moves from Boston to a small southern town and protests the town's ban against dancing. Filming took place from September to November 2010 in Georgia. It was released in Australia and New Zealand on October 6, 2011, and in North America on October 14, 2011. It grossed $15.5 million in its opening weekend and $63 million worldwide from a $24 million budget. Plot After a long night of partying, an intoxicated Bobby Moore and his friends are killed when their car collides head-on with a truck on a bridge on their way home to the town of Bomont, Georgia. This prompts his father Shaw Moore, the Reverend of the town's church to persuade the city council to pass several draconian laws, including a ban on all unsupervised dancing within the city limits. Three years later, Boston-raised teenager Ren McCormack moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's death from leukemia and his father's abandonment. Soon after arriving, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High and from him learns about the ban on dancing. He soon begins to be attracted to Shaw's rebellious daughter Ariel, who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a race involving buses and wins despite his inability to drive one and almost getting killed in it. Shaw distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After a while, Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, which results in a fight between her and Chuck. Later in church, Shaw finds out about the incident and demands Ren's arrest, Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, which prompts Shaw to beg for her to not talk like that in church, having Ariel sarcastically ask Moore if he will pass another law and says that it didn't stop her and Chuck from having sex. Shaw slaps her without warning, which shocks Vi, Moore's wife, and prompts Ariel to tearfully and angrily criticize him for his domineering ways and storm out of the church. Shaw tries to apologize, but Vi stops him, telling him he has gone too far. Being supportive of the dancing movement, Vi explains to Shaw that he is not being good to Ariel and that he cannot be everyone's father, adding that dancing and music are not the problems. Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses that are given to him by Ariel, that describe how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate or worship. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. Despite the city council voting against him, an undaunted Ren convinces a cotton businessman in the neighboring town of Bayson to let the school have a prom in his mill due to the location being outside the city limits. Knowing that Shaw still has enough influence to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come, Ren visits him and the two strike up a conversation. After Shaw tells the story of Bobby, Ren shares about his mother's death and states that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the dance. He then asks Shaw respectfully if he can take Ariel, to which the latter agrees. On the day of the prom, Shaw asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Not long after Ren and Ariel arrive at the prom, Chuck and several of his friends arrive to instigate chaos. However, Ren, Willard, Rusty and Ariel subdue them. Ren goes inside the mill and exclaims \\"Hey, I thought this was a party!\\" Then he flings confetti into a shredding machine and yells, \\"Let's dance!\\" as everyone joins in dancing to the opening song \\"Footloose\\".

The role was playing Ren McCormack's deadbeat dad. Though Bacon passed on the role, he gave Brewer his blessing.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068242/trivia?tab=tr&item;=tr1555313 Filming While the original film has the fictional town of \\"Bomont\\" located in Oklahoma, the remake instead places the town in Georgia. On a budget of $24 million, principal photography began in September 2010 in and around metro Atlanta, and wrapped two months later in November. A courtroom scene was shot at the Newton County Historic Courthouse in Covington, Georgia on September 17, 20 and 21. A family scene was filmed at the New Senoia Raceway in Senoia on October 1. A scene taken from the original film, in which McCormack plays a game of \\"chicken\\" with his love interest's boyfriend, was filmed on the Chattahoochee River bridge on Franklin Parkway in downtown Franklin also in October. The home and church scene in the film were filmed in downtown Acworth. Production used the sanctuary of the Acworth Presbyterian Church and the house of the Mayor, Tommy Allegood. Music The original soundtrack was released by Atlantic Records and Warner Music Nashville on September 27, 2011. It includes eight new songs and four remakes of songs from the original film's soundtrack. Brewer said, \\"I can promise Footloose fans that I will be true to the spirit of the original film. But I still gotta put my own Southern grit into it and kick it into 2011.\\" Kenny Loggins' \\"Footloose\\" was covered by Blake Shelton for the remake, which is an upbeat country version. The film opens with several teens dancing to Loggins' original version of the song. Like the original film, the 2011 version also features \\"Bang Your Head (Metal Health)\\" by the heavy metal band Quiet Riot and \\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\\" by Deniece Williams. Release and promotion The film was originally scheduled for release in North America on April 1, 2011, but was moved to October 14, 2011. Footloose was released in Australia and New Zealand on October 6, 2011. Paramount and HSN partnered for a 24-hour promotion on October 12, 2011. They sold clothing inspired by the film, such as women's red boots, denim, footwear and nail polish brands created by Vince Camuto and Steve Madden. To promote the film, Paramount sent the cast and director on a promotional tour in over a dozen cities. Footloose was promoted on the October 11, 2011, episode of Dancing with the Stars. The episode featured film stars Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough‚Äîa former champion on the show‚Äîdancing to the songs \\"Holding Out for a Hero\\" and \\"Footloose\\" from the film's soundtrack with Blake Shelton performing the song live. At the CMA Awards, Shelton was joined by original \\"Footloose\\" performer Kenny Loggins to sing the song. Many of Viacom owned channels, like MTV, Nickelodeon and CMT advertised and promoted the film. Reception=Box office Pre-release audience pollings predicted the film to take in $20 million its opening weekend. However, Paramount expected it to be closer to $15 million. Footloose opened in 3,549 theaters taking in $15.5 million and placing number two, behind Real Steel ($16.2 million) in its opening weekend. Exit polls indicated that the film appealed to 75 percent of females and 28 percent of the teen market. About 60 percent of the audience were over age 25 and 46 percent over age 35. The 20th highest grossing locations on Friday were in Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, Knoxville, Kansas City, and San Antonio. The opening was lower than other recent dance films like, Save the Last Dance (2001, $23.4 million), Step Up (2006, $20.7 million), but it performed around the same as Step Up 3D (2010, $15.8 million) and You Got Served (2004, $16.1 million). The 1984 Footloose opened to $20 million when adjusted for ticket price inflation. In its second weekend the film held well, with a drop of 34 percent. It placed third and grossed an estimated $10.4 million. In Australia, the film opened to $1.05 million and to $88,078 in New Zealand. Footloose has grossed $51.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $10.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $62 million. The 1984 Footloose grossed over $80 million worldwide. Critical response Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 69% of 169 surveyed critics have given the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.1/10. The website's consensus is: \\"While it hews closely to the 1984 original, Craig Brewer infuses his Footloose remake with toe-tapping energy and manages to keep the story fresh for a new generation.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 58 based on 35 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was an \\"A\\" on an A plus to F scale. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-. Praising the performance of Wormald, she said he \\"handily owns the role for a new audience\\" and closed her review saying, \\"Guardians of the '80s flame will approve of the production's sincere respect for the original; church still matters, and so do Ariel's red cowboy boots.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film one and half stars out of four, calling it \\"a film without wit, humor or purpose\\". Ebert further criticized the film for being too close to the 1984 original and Wormald's perceived lack of charisma compared to Bacon. Varietys Rob Nelson wrote that the film failed to distinguished itself from the original and criticized Wormald and Hough's acting performances, saying, \\"When the music stops, young Hough is saddled, like her co-star, with the impossible task of making 27-year-old verbiage sound fresh.\\" Nelson wrote that Brewer's musical staging is \\"subtly less theatrical than Ross', but it hardly constitutes a reinvention\\" and that Brewer's film comes across as \\"slightly milder\\" than Ross', such as with Ariel's abuse by former boyfriend being toned down for 2011. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter disliked how the dance numbers and action sequences were staged, shot and cut, saying, \\"The visual clumsiness does not disguise that Wormald (a professional dancer since extreme youth), especially, but the others too, are very good dancers. But the compositions vary randomly between close-ups, awkward medium shots and general coverage that cuts together with no cumulative dynamic power.\\" Orlando Sentinel's Roger Moore gave the film two and half out of four stars. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"doesn't have the emotional impact of the original, but it ups the energy level.\\" He said that the film was \\"not so much a remake as a renovation\\" and said the remake is similar to the original \\"in all the ways that count\\". The New York Timess A. O. Scott called the dance numbers \\"woefully inadequate\\" when compared with Glee, High School Musical and Step Up. For Wormald's performance he said, \\"He has energy but no real magnetism, and while he may be in possession of what are technically known as 'moves', his dancing lacks sensuality and a sense of release.\\" Scott gave Miles Teller a good review saying that he \\"has a natural charisma that is both comic and kind of sexy\\". He described the music in the remake as \\"better and more eclectic than the original, with some blues, country and vintage metal mixed in with the peppy dance tunes\\".

The most recent eruptions from Matavanu occurred between 1905 and 1911 with lava flows on its northern side flowing towards the island's coastline and into the sea in the district of Gaga'emauga. The eruptions began 4 August 1905 and stopped in November 1911. The lava flowed over of countryside to the lagoon and reef, destroying villages in its path between Samalae'ulu to the east and Saleaula to the west. The depth of the lava flow in some parts was 400 feet. Due to the destruction of their homes by the seaside, some of the villages relocated further inland by the main island road. The lava fields can still be seen today, especially in Saleaula as well as the village of Mauga where the houses or fale are situated around a small volcanic crater. There are church ruins as well a 'Virgin's Grave', the burial place of a girl where the molten lava flowed around rather than over it. Other volcanoes on Savai'i include Mata o le Afi and Mauga Afi. The island of Savai'i is an active shield volcano. Its highest peak is Mt Silisili. Mythology In Samoan mythology the god of earthquakes is Mafui'e.

Mary was the wife of William Hammond, prebendary and Clerk of Killabegs in the Diocese of Tuam. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, attacks were made by the Gaelic Irish upon the English settlers, which swiftly led to all the English being driven from Tuam. Her husband had gone ahead and made it to the safety of the fort at Galway. Mary was left behind to take care of the household goods and her own safety, despite being within two weeks of childbirth. A week after Christmas 1641, having already had household goods stolen from her by Redmond Burke, she sent three horse loads on the Galway road, only to have them stolen by Riccard Bourke of Ballinderry. She was obliged to remain in the town for a further ten days after this incident. Eventually, knowing that birth was near, she set off on horseback to Galway. She was assaulted at Belclare and taken from her horse. Recovering and going away, she was met by a Patrick Higgins of Liskerry \\"with his skeyne naked in his hand ... [which] made her, not without danger, leap from her horse as soon as he came at her, but then hee, for her husband's sake (as he sayd) did her no other harm.\\" Two or three miles further, two men and a woman attacked her, and were in the act of stripping her when two men named Joyce, of Galway town, rode up and intervened. After this, two other Irishmen attacked her. She was forced to sit \\"in ye rayne till wett to ye skinne before she was delivered from them by one James Lally (that knew her) accidentally coming that way.\\" At Claregalway she was beaten on the street by Irish pikemen. Calling for help, once again the two Joyces came to her rescue. They gave the men a shilling to disperse and drink; she was given no shelter by the people of the town, so the Joyces escorted her \\"wet, dirty, weary and bruised ... a good way though the dirt to a poore Irish house, where the Joyces left her and bade the man of ye house take some care of her.\\" Mary then went into labour. While the man of the house went in search of a midwife, one of her previous tormentors arrived and stole her mantle. She was in labour from Friday night till about eight or nine on Sunday evening, \\"at which time she was delivered of a dead child; [which] she verily believes was kild by ye ill useage she had received [sic].\\" On Monday she was brought to Galway \\"in a carr and kish.\\" References *\\"The N17 in the Seventeenth Century\\", Michael Reynolds, The Great Tuam Annual 3, 1992 Category:People from County Galway Category:17th-century Irish women Category:People of the Irish Confederate Wars ","title":"Mary Hammond (Tuam)"},{"id":"24570757","text":"Coolio's Rules is a reality TV show on MuchMore about Coolio and his family produced by Oxygen Studios.Collio's Rules - Oxygen Website Coolio's Rules focuses on Coolio and his family, living in Los Angeles, California.

The association (also using the name 'Social Democratic Group \\"Zukunft\\"') was founded in 1902. It was affiliated to the General Jewish Labour Bund via its Foreign Committee in Geneva. C. Zeitel was the secretary of the association., Arbetarr√∂relsens arkiv och bibliotek (Labour movement archives and library), 13 July 2006 During its initial year, the identity of the group was kept secret. As of 1907, the association claimed to have around 40 members. In the same year it contacted the Swedish Social Democratic Party and sought cooperation with them to host a public meeting on the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Bund. The meeting was organized by the arbetarkommun of Stockholm on October 8, 1907. Bernand Jof√© of the Bund spoke at the meeting. In October 1908, the Executive Committee of the Swedish Social Democratic Party granted 100 Swedish krona to the association, to set up a reading room for emigree activists in Stockholm. Another 100 krona was allotted by the Stockholm arbetarkommun. The reading room was set up in Folkets Hus, rented jointly by Zukunft and the Israeli Workers Association. The support given from the Swedish Social Democrats to Zukunft caused a rift between the association and the Stockholm-based Support Group of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The RSDLP group was led by Bernhard Mehr who claimed that since the Bund had merged into the RSDLP, the economic assistance should not have been given to Zukunft directly. A year later, the rift has settled and Zukunft, the Israeli Workers Association and the RSDLP support group decided to run the reading room jointly. The economic assistance from the Swedish Social Democratic Party was however discontinued. Bundist activities continued in Sweden, at least late 1940s.

He started what was at the time an almost blasphemous trend of recording for a number of different labels. His pioneering spirit yielded a few genre-defining albums, including this disc. His performances were also at a peak during 1957 as Down Beat magazine proclaimed him the Critics' Poll winner under the category of 'New Star' of the tenor saxophone. This newfound freedom can be heard throughout the innovations on The Sound of Sonny.

Biography He was born at Ivnitsy, a village near Zhitomir, in the Ukraine. In 1928 he obtained an excellent grade in the entrance examination for the Ukrainian Polytechnic Institute, but because his father, a commercial traveler, was considered not to be a worker, he was refused admission; instead, he took employment as a carpenter. In 1929 he left Zhitomir for Moscow, where he worked first as a builder's labourer, then as a draughtsman for architectural exhibitions. He was able to get a job as a technician at the Radio Institute of the Ministry of Communications in 1931, and from that time he remained in his chosen field of physics. During his scientific career in the USSR, Alpert worked from 1931 to 1934 at the Communications Radio Institute; then, from 1935 until 1951 at the Lebedev Physical Institute (FIAN) of the Academy of Sciences; and finally at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Propagation of Radio Waves, and Ionosphere (IZMIRAN) of the Academy of Sciences, from 1952 until he left the USSR in 1987. In 1973 he and his wife Svetlana Pivkova decided to emigrate. The first step was to obtain a letter from a relative in Israel, inviting them to settle there; at that time, even non-Jews leaving the Soviet Union could only go to Israel. He requested such a letter through Israel's Academy of Sciences, and in due course received one. Its arrival was noticed by the Soviet authorities, and as was then customary he was demoted at his place of work, in his case to a post of Senior Scientist with a reduced salary, while she was dismissed from her post (at a different Institute) and could not obtain one elsewhere. In 1975 they were finally permitted to apply for exit visas, but this application was refused, as were 26 other such applications they made during the next 12 years. During this period, he took an active part in a scientific seminar to maintain his skills and those of his fellow ‚Äúrefuseniks‚Äù. It was organized by Victor Brailovsky, and the other participants included Alexander Lerner, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Sharansky; though not himself a candidate for emigration, Andrei Sakharov often attended the seminar and supported the refuseniks until his exile to Gorky in 1980. Following the arrest of Brailovsky in 1981, these seminars were often held at the Alperts' apartment. In 1987, the Alperts received their visas and left for the USA, where they arrived in 1988 and settled near Boston. For the rest of his professional life he was a Senior Staff Scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He never retired formally, but his last publication under the auspices of the Center for Astrophysics was made in 2001. Scientific work Alpert‚Äôs main scientific interests at the FIAN and the IZMIRAN were * Propagation of radio waves, particularly natural ones (i.e., \\"atmospherics\\") below and within the ionosphere. * Physical structure of the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, and plasma wave processes in these regions. * Interaction of moving bodies with a plasma. Between 1936 and 2001, he had 8 books published in Russian and 11 in English (9 original monographs, 3 second editions), the last one being his autobiography. Also he published about 200 scientific papers in Russian or in English and a dozen popular scientific papers in Russian. Forty-three of them are listed in Web of Science.

The building has had several owners through the years but has operated continuously since it opened. In September 1988, Scott and Jane Johnson purchased and renovated Hotel Turkey. The hotel then had 14 patriotic, western or movie themed rooms such as the Gone With the Wind suite. In July 2015, the Hotel Turkey was purchased and re-established by Pat and Tina Carson of Turkey.

It was a scenthound used in a pack to run down and kill game, or bring it to bay. The word appears before the Norman Conquest. It was sometimes confused with 'brache', (also 'bratchet') which is a French derived word for a female scenthound. In medieval hunting in England and Northern Europe, pursuit of the hart or wild boar involved using a 'limer' or 'lyam hound' (a hound handled on a leash or 'lyam') to trace the animal from its footprints or droppings to where it was browsing or lying up. This became known as 'harbouring' the animal. When this had been done, the huntsman reported back to his lord, who then brought the pack of raches to chase it down on its hot scent when it had been unharboured, 'rowsed' or 'upreared'. Sometimes, pairs of raches were held at strategic points along where the quarry was expected to run, to be uncoupled when the huntsman blew the signal, or when the quarry was seen to come close. The Bloodhound was typically used as a limer, and the raches were normally smaller hounds. A lord's pack would include one or two limers to about 20 or more raches. Raches killing a wild boarA king or lord would want to hunt a great stag, a 'hart of ten', or 'warrantable' stag, or a powerful boar, partly for the extra fat it carried when in prime condition in the hunting season, but mostly for kudos. In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Bloodhounds announce the presence of a great boar hiding in a thicket, which then rushes out and plays havoc among the raches of the knight's pack. Not all game was hunted using the limer. Dame Juliana Berners, writing in The Book of Saint Albans (1486) writes (translation): > 'My dear sons, I will now teach each one of you how many kinds of beasts > must be upreared with the limer in wood or in fields - both the hart and the > buck and the boar so wild. All other animals which are hunted must be sought > and found with free-running raches (\\"ratches so fre\\").' Other writers might include the hare, bear, or wolf among animals to be harboured with the limer, but clearly raches could be hunted simply as a pack, as in modern hunting, if chasing 'lesser' game. After c. 1530 the term 'rache' was hardly used in England, 'running hound' (tr. of chien courant), or mostly just 'hound', being preferred, but the term was still used for a while in Scotland,Hector Boece (Boethius) tr John Bellenden The History and Croniklis of Scotland 1536 where the Bloodhound was called the sleuth hound. Hector Boece (1536) describes the rache in Scotland as a versatile scenthound, able to find flesh, fowl, or even fish among the rocks, by smelling. His translator, Bellenden, says that it is not a large as the sleuth hound. The picture below, though it did not appear in Boece's original, was first published to illustrate his account when it was summarised in Conrad Gessner's Historiae Animalium (Zurich 1554, in Latin). The Scottish Rache Obviously raches must have far outnumbered Bloodhounds in the medieval dog population, and may have been quite disparate, depending on the sort of game they were used to hunt. In the picture above from Les Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (1410) the raches are not all of the same breed. In Great Britain, they may have included the now-extinct North Country Beagle and Southern Hound. As styles of hunting changed, and the Bloodhound fell out of use, packs were normally employed on their own to hunt all quarry. Though their name became obsolete, raches must have continued in this use. We may assume that it was from them, rather than the Bloodhound, that the various breeds of pack hounds such as the English Foxhound, English Staghound, Harrier and Beagle were developed. It is apparent that in the 16th and 17th centuries there was a good deal of regional variation in sizes and types of scenthound, from which the prospective Master of Hounds could mix and match to form his pack.

History The garden traces back to 1535 when medicinal plants were first grown by Leonhart Fuchs (1501-1566) beside the Nonnenhaus (House of the Nuns), which still exists. In 1663 a Hortus medicus was created by direction of Eberhard III, Duke of W√ºrttemberg (1614‚Äì74), with university gardener appointed in 1666. In 1681 Georg Balthasar Metzger (1623-1687) was named director, followed in 1688 by Rudolph Jacob Camerarius (1655-1721). The first greenhouse was completed in 1744, and noted botanist Johann Georg Gmelin (1709-1755) appointed director in 1751. In 1804 a new garden was established by decree of King Frederick of W√ºrttemberg (1754-1816) under the leadership of Professor Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer (1765-1844), which grew and flourished throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. By 1809 it contained four greenhouses and a lecture hall, with its first seed catalog published in 1820, and from 1818-1825 its plants were reorganized according to the system of Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. In 1846 a substantial institute building was completed and by 1859 the garden cultivated 5,226 species. In 1866 the garden's final expansion was made with the purchase of adjacent private land. In 1878 Wilhelm Pfeffer (1845-1920) became director, who inaugurated a sizable palm house in 1886. Beginning in 1888, the garden was reorganized to the Eichler system. In 1969, the university established a new botanical garden, the Botanischer Garten der Universit√§t T√ºbingen. The old garden was then converted to today's municipal park.

Family history The Zsilinszky name first appeared in 1720, in the registry of the Evangelical church (Lutheran Church) of B√©k√©scsaba, where his great grandfather, Mih√°ly Zsilinszky, a well off peasant farmer and an elected judge of Slovak origin, lived. Endre's grandfather (born in 1838), and his father Dr. Endre Zsilinszky, were also born in B√©k√©scsaba. In 1883, his father married M√°ria Bajcsy, the stepdaughter of J√°nos Vilim, a lawyer related to the Zsilinszky family. The young couple initially resided in Szarvas and the marriage produced four children; Endre, G√°bor, Margit and Erzs√©bet and on June 6, 1886 he was christened Endre K√°lm√°n in the local Lutheran Church. Youth and Education Endre was a year old when his family moved from Szarvas to B√©k√©scsaba, and he studied at the Gyula Andr√°ssy High School, where, by academic excellence he rose above his peers. He regularly participated in the school's activities and chaired its self-improvement club. His prize winning compositions drew attention, and revealed his grasp of the social issues of the day. He excelled in each subject (Hungarian, Latin, Greek, German), and graduated with honours. This gained him a scholarship grant from the Lutheran Church diocese of B√°nya. After high school graduation in 1904, he continued his university education at the Faculty of Law of the Franz Joseph University in Kolozsv√°r (Cluj-Napoca). His multifaceted abilities exhibited themselves in his first year of university. He read a lot of Sz√©chenyi's works, and in addition to his law studies, he also signed up to study history of philosophy. His second year in school brought him a lot of exciting experiences and intellectual enrichment. He ended up spending two semesters at the universities of Leipzig and Heidelberg. During his sojourn in Germany, his interests increasingly focused on the world of politics. The developing political situation in Germany increased his incentive to study with greater diligence. And yet, in spite of his commitment to his studies, there was time for self-improvement. During his stay in Heidelberg, he developed numerous friendships and social contacts, which required him to extensively socialize. On April 24, 1908 he completed his political science studies, and on December 5, he received his doctorate in law. In the autumn of 1909 he enlisted in the 1st Imperial and Royal Hussars in Vienna as a volunteer, and in September 1910, he received his reserve officer's commission. At this time, through a conflict by his B√©k√©scsaba family, Andr√°s L. √Åchim, one of the founders of the Hungarian Peasants party, was shot to death by Endre's brother, G√°bor Zsilinszky. Career Following these events, from October 1910 on, he worked as a junior law clerk, established friendships, and improved his social life. He lectured in political citizens' circles and contributed articles to the Women's circle. In February 1912, he entered public life and found employment as the apprentice steward of Als√≥kubin in the comitatus (county) of √Årva. At first, he worked without remuneration, then received a minimal annual salary of between and kronen. World War I Immediately after the outbreak of World War I, Bajcsy-Zsilinszky volunteered for front-line duty and his unit, part of the II. Mounted (Hussar) Division, was deployed to the Serbian front. Afterwards he was deployed to the Italian front, and at the beginning of June 1916, as part of the 2nd Imperial and Royal Mounted Hussars' Marksmen Division, he was deployed on the Eastern front. In September of the same year he was wounded, and spent a slow and lingering period of recuperation at the military hospital. At the beginning of 1917, he requested and was granted permission to return to the front. In 1918, he participated in the founding of the Hungarian National Defense Association (Magyar Orsz√°gos V√©der≈ë Egylet) (MOVE), for which, later, he was forced to emigrate to Vienna. Between World Wars After his return to Hungary, he settled in Szeged. His support was welcomed by the nationalists, and the populist political party of Gyula G√∂mb√∂s. Under his editorial guidance, among others, the Voice (Sz√≥zat), a newspaper with nationalist and racist themes, was published. Elected to the Parliament as a representative of the Unity Party in 1922. In 1923 he defected, with Gyula G√∂mb√∂s, to form the Hungarian National Independence Party, better known as the Guardians of Race Party (Fajv√©d≈ë P√°rt). Voice (Sz√≥zat) became the party's official organ. In 1925 he was honoured with the commission of Valiant knight (Vit√©z). In 1926, he became the editor-in-chief of the Hungarians (Magyars√°g), and in 1928 he became the editor-in-chief of the Forward guard (El≈ë√∂rs) newspaper, which also marked the gradual distancing from the political camp of Gyula G√∂mb√∂s. In 1930, he founded the National Radical Party (Nemzeti Radik√°lis P√°rt) and in 1932, he became the editor-in- chief of the anti-Nazi daily Freedom (Szabads√°g). His political stature grew in 1935 when his party and political allies were elected to the Hungarian Parliament. In the same year, he resigned his Vit√©z commission. World War II After the outbreak of World War II, he became the editor-in-chief of the weekly paper Independent Hungary (F√ºggetlen Magyarorsz√°g) in which he espoused the necessity of blocking German expansion (Living space (Lebensraum)), through the united efforts of the small states bordering along the Danube. From 1941, he was the editor of the anti-Nazi paper The Free Word (Szabad Sz√≥), and in the same year, he was one of the major organizers of the March 15 anti-Nazi protests. On March 19, 1944, Bajcsy-Zsilinszky, at his residence, fought with a weapon to prevent arrest by the Gestapo. He was wounded in the brief gun battle, arrested, and hauled away. On October 11 of the same year, his release was demanded and obtained by the Hungarian government. But, in November, he was again arrested and incarcerated in the Sopronk√∂hida prison, where he was executed by hanging on December 23. On May 27, 1945, he was reburied in Tarpa with honours. Plaque dedicated by the Freeholders Party, at his last place of residence at I. Attila √∫t 37 in Buda. In Memoriam Due to his anti-Nazi stance, he was honoured by the government of the post-war Hungarian People's Republic, and his nationalist and anti-Nazi theories still have adherents. Streets named after him in Baja, Balassagyarmat, Balatonalm√°di, Budapest, Debrecen, Gy≈ër, Eger, Esztergom, Kaposv√°r, Kecskem√©t, Kiskunf√©legyh√°za, Kisk≈ër√∂s, K√∂rnye, K≈ëszeg, Miskolc, P√©cs, Szentes, Tokaj and in the inner city of Tatab√°nya. Also, the city of Novi Sad (Serbia) named a street after him in gratitude for raising his voice in Hungarian parliament against the mass killing of Vojvodina Serbs, Jews, and Roma by Hungarian soldiers and gendarmes in 1942. A station on the M1 line (yellow, or Millennium line) of the Budapest Metro is also named after him.

During his time at the U.N. he had become very friendly with Martti Ahtessaari, then deputy secretary general of the U.N. and later President of Finland. This contact was helpful in later years when Ahtessaari was instrumental in getting former Finnish Prime Minister, Harri Holkieri, to be part of the troika with U.S. Senator George Mitchell and retired Canadian General Jean de Chastelain which engaged with paramilitaries on both sides in Northern Ireland which paved the way for the Belfast Agreement in 1998. He was one of the key people in the run-up to that agreement. As one of the few people in the Anglo-Irish Division with serious U.N. experience he put a great emphasis on lodging the agreement with the U.N. as an international agreement and was heavily involved with drafting the text to ensure it was compatible with U.N. treaties.

Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 161 The split was provoked by disagreements over whether the Polish Bund should join the Communist International. At the first Polish Bund conference in 1920 a majority resolution passed, calling for the party to join the Communist International. The decision was never executed however, leading to the split and the formation of Kombund. The Kombund was founded in late January 1922, by Communist Bundist groups. The new party affiliated itself to the Communist International, adopting the twenty-one conditions.Johnpoll, Bernard K. The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943.

Background and history The song, like many on The Boatman's Call, seems to reflect on Nick Cave's personal relationships and spiritual yearnings at the time of writing. This song in particular is widely speculated to either be a love song or directed at either the mother of Cave's son Luke, Viviane Carneiro, or PJ Harvey, with whom Cave had a brief relationship prior to the album's recording and release.

The airfield was last used militarily as a training facility for Belgian Air Cadets, equipped with six Piper L21B Super Cubs, and several Schleicher K 8B Gliders.BELGIAN MILITARY AIRCRAFT DATABASE History Goetsenhoven Airfield was one of the first airfields of Belgian military aviation. It was built in 1922 as a grass airfield by the Belgian Air Force (A√©ronautique Militaire Belge). Its early use was that of observation aircraft of II Group, consisting of 10 Ansaldo A.300 or DH.9 biplanes.THE PERIOD 1919-1939 : IN-BETWEEN TWO WORLD WARS On 1 November 1939, as part of the wartime buildup, three squadrons of British built Fairey Fox III fighter/bombers with Nos. 3 (II Group), 5 (III Group) and 7 (IV Group) squadrons were assigned to the airfield as part of the 2e R√©giment d'A√©ronautique (2nd Air Regiment-Air Combat)Goetsenhoven Airfield History In addition to the combat units, Goetsenhoven was also a Basic Flight School (Ecole de Pilotage El√©mentaire) for the Belgian Air Force, equipped with Stampe-Vertongen SV.4s.Losses of the Belgian Air Force 10/5/1940-30/06/1940 World War II On 10 May 1940, Goetsenhoven was attacked by the Luftwaffe as part of the initial German attack on Belgium, killing several personnel and destroying some aircraft, and was seized by the Wehrmacht a few days later. The Goetsenhoven squadrons hastily retreated to other airfields with their remaining planes. They were eventually evacuated to France. During the occupation of Belgium, the airfield was used by the Luftwaffe as a reserve airfield; no Luftwaffe units were stationed there.The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 In late October 1944, the airfield was attacked by USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs, unguided rockets, and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps to ensure that any German forces at the base were neutralized. Allied ground forces moved into the Tienen area around 20 October and the first American combat engineer units arrived at the airfield shortly afterward. The USAAF IX Engineering Command 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion laid down a 3600' all weather Pierced Steel Planking runway at Goetsenhoven, and rehabilitated some of the buildings for operational use for combat units. On 26 October the airfield was declared operationally ready and was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-10\\", also being known as \\"Le Culot/East Airfield\\".Johnson, David C.

Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. . Once the American combat units moved out, Goetsenhoven became a transport airfield for C-47 Skytrains, which flew frequently in and out of the American controlled airfield, supplying the front line forces with the necessary materiel to support their advance. On return flights to the rear area, casualty evacuation was performed by the transports. At the end of the war Goetsenhoven was returned to Belgian control by the Americans on 25 June 1945. Postwar use After the war Goetsenhoven was totally rebuilt, with the metal runway being removed and the airfield returned to its prewar configuration as a grass airfield. It was reopened in 1950, and became the base field of the ESS (Elementary Flying School). In 1969 the flight training was upgraded to the SIAI Marchetti Aermacchi SF.260. Also, two all-weather asphalt runways were laid down on the site, replacing the grass runway. In 1996 the flight training of the Belgian Air Force was centralised at Beauvechain Air Base, and the formal military presence came to an end at Goetsenhoven. Besides the EVS during the weekends, the airfield is also used by the local flying club De Wouw, following the closure of the ESS was working with engine and gliders. The field is not open for flying on days that is also used by the Olympia Tiense Wielerschool for the training of young cyclists. As of 2020, the aeroclub \\"De Wouw\\" still operates from its premises at the South side of the field; formerly military hangars on the North-West side are now used by an ultralight flying club. The whole area being within the controlled airspace of Beauvechain Air Base, however, civilian flying is subject to strict limitations; basically operations are limited to weekends.

H. L. Hunt, Late of the Grammar School of Christ's Hospital, commonly known as Juvenilia, was a collection of poems written by James Henry Leigh Hunt at a young age and published in March 1801. As an unknown author, Hunt's work was not accepted by any professional publishers, and his father Isaac Hunt instead entered into an agreement with the printer James Whiting to have the collection printed privately. The collection had over 800 subscribers, including important academics, politicians and lawyers, and even people from the United States. The critical and public response to Hunt's work was positive; by 1803 the collection had run into four volumes. The Monthly Mirror declared the collection to show \\"proofs of poetic genius, and literary ability\\", and Edmund Blunden held that the collection acted as a predictor of Hunt's later success. Hunt himself came to despise the collection as \\"a heap of imitations, all but absolutely worthless\\", but critics have argued that without this early success to bolster his confidence Hunt's later career could have been far less successful. Background When Hunt was 15, he entered into a series of competitions run by the Monthly Preceptor calling for the submission of both poems and essays. Throughout 1800, Hunt submitted various works including a translation of Horace, which won first prize. In December, he came in second for an essay called \\"On Humanity to the Brute Creation as a Moral and Christian Duty\\". The Monthly Preceptor printed many of his poems, even ones not submitted for the competition. The successful publication of these works prompted his father Isaac Hunt to collect his son's childhood poetry to publish them. Since publishers would not pay the expenses to publish a book for an unknown author, Isaac Hunt decided to take subscriptions for the book to defer the cost of publication. Under an agreement with the printer James Whiting, the Hunts collected subscribers with the support of his uncle and aunt, Benjamin and Elizabeth West.Roe 2005 pp. 50‚Äì52 Eventually, they were able to collect over 800 subscribers to the volume. The collection was published March 1801 with the title Juvenilia; or, a Collection of Poems Written between the ages of Twelve and Sixteen by J. H. L. Hunt, Late of the Grammar School of Christ's Hospital with a subscription list that ran for more than 15 pages. The subscribers included important academics and artists, well known publishers and booksellers, and many politicians, lawyers, and government employees. The list covered people from all aspects of British life and even included many from the United States. A frontispiece by Francesco Bartollozi based on a painting by Raphael West was included in the edition based on an allegorical representation of penury from Hunt's poem \\"Retirement\\". The third edition included an engraving of Hunt's portrait by Robert Bowyer. By 1803, four editions of the volume had been published with a new set of subscriptions for each, which included many famous politicians, artists, and other well-known individuals.Roe 2005 pp. 52‚Äì57 Poems The collection separated the poems into sections based on genre and type: elegy, hymn, ode, pastoral, sonnet, allegory modelled after Edmund Spenser's, and a section for miscellaneous. The volume begins with \\"Macbeth; or, the Ill Effects of Ambition\\" and \\"Content\\". Poems that followed are \\"Chearfulness\\" and The Palace of Pleasure. The miscellaneous poems include: \\"Retirement, or the Golden Mean\\", \\"Remembered Friendship\\", \\"Christ's Hospital\\", \\"The Negro Boy, A Ballad\\", \\"Epitaph on Robespierre\\", \\"Written at the Time of the War in Switzerland\\", \\"Speech of Caractacus to Claudius Caesar\\", and \\"Progress of Painting\\".Roe 2005 pp. 55‚Äì56 In the \\"Progress of Painting\\", Hunt reveals his debt to the artistic background of his uncle in introducing the wonders of various painters. Hunt's \\"Remembered Friendship\\" is similar to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's depiction of a childhood watching of the sky in Frost at Midnight.Holden 2005 pp. 16‚Äì17 Most of the work was imitative. Although success allowed Hunt greater opportunities and connections in Britain, he later believed that his early success kept him from properly starting his path to become a poet.Holden 2005 pp. 15‚Äì17 Critical response The response to Hunt's Juvenilia was positive. The reviews focused on Hunt's successful youthful accomplishment and he was well received by the literary establishment.Roe 2005 p. 57 In an immediate review, the Monthly Mirror claimed that the poems were \\"proofs of poetic genius, and literary ability, which reflect great credit on the youthful author, and will justify the most sanguine expectations of his future reputation\\".Holden 2005 qtd p. 17 However, Hunt later stated, \\"I was as proud, perhaps, of the book at the time as I am ashamed of it now [...] a heap of imitations, all but absolutely worthless\\".Holden 2005 qtd p. 15 Edmund Blunden, in 1930, argued: \\"The best poetical promise in Juvenilia was an occasional floweriness of colouring and personal fancy [...] But even in most juvenile passages the collection informs us of Hunt's boyish attainments and natural tastes, anticipating his later characteristics in several tendencies.\\"Blunden 1930 pp. 30‚Äì31 In 1985, Ann Blainery wrote, \\"For a boy of 17 it was an achievement, and if it went to his head this was understandable. The shy schoolboy whose poems were despised by his teacher had become a literary lion-cub. Without the confidence imparted by his first book, his career could have been very different.\\"Blainery 1985 p. 17 Nicholas Roe claimed, \\"His Juvenilia has been genuinely impressive for the skill with which he had imitated other writers, and it had deservedly drawn admiration.\\"Roe 2005 p. 68 Anthony Holden argued, \\"The opening ode on Macbeth [...] is declared, as if by way of apology for its orotund emptiness, to have been written at the age of twelve.

The act provides that unclaimed bodies of dead persons cast ashore from the sea should be removed by the churchwardens and overseers of the parish, and decently interred in consecrated ground. The passage of the 1808 act was one of the consequences of the wreck of the Royal Navy frigate HMS Anson in Mount's Bay in 1807. Prior to the passage of this act it was customary to unceremoniously bury drowned seamen without shroud or coffin and in unconsecrated ground. However the burial in this manner of the many dead from the Anson, and the length of time that many of the bodies remained unburied, caused controversy and led to a local solicitor, Thomas Grylls, drafting a new law to provide more decent treatment for drowned seamen. This law was introduced to parliament by John Hearle Tremayne, Member of Parliament for Cornwall, and was enacted in 1808. A monument to the drowned sailors, and to the passing of Grylls' Act, stands near the entrance to the harbour of Porthleven. The construction of this harbour was another of the consequences of the loss of the Anson. This act was amended by the Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1886 (citation 49 & 50 Vict c.20), to extend its applicability to bodies found in, or cast on shore from, all tidal or navigable waters. This was needed following the case of the wreck of the Princess Alice, when various parishes refused to pay the cost of interment. The parish was responsible for burial, under the Burial of Drowned Persons Act, and a fee of 5 shillings (a crown) was also paid by the parish for the recovery of drowned bodies.

It is located at 66 Buccleuch Street in the Southside of Edinburgh, and has been used by the company for over 230 years. Building commenced on 15 August 1776, and was completed in 1777 to designs by Alexander Laing. When the foundation stone was laid in 1776, two lines of Latin were inscribed on a plate which was set in the stone. These lines, beginning , were taken from: The Company's coat of arms above the Hall entrance The Royal Company of Archers were granted the motto \\"Nemo me impune lacessit\\" by a Royal charter of Queen Anne, 1713. The building was extended in 1900 by Robert Rowand Anderson and his partner, A. F. Balfour Paul. The principal hall inside measures , and is high. Two other rooms of are contained in the building, as well as a kitchen, cellars, lobby, and other apartments. The ground behind the house was laid out into a bowling green, maintained by the Edinburgh Bowling Club until its redevelopment in 2008. The hall serves as a venue for various dinners and meetings of the Royal Company of Archers and the club. An external lodge, adjacent to the hall, houses an indoor changing rooms, shooting gallery and a bow workshop. Archers' Hall is a category A listed building, a building \\"of regional or more than local importance\\". There is a proposal to demolish the lodge. In 2008 09 the corner lodge, existing archery butts and bowling pavilion were demolished to improve club facilities. Inside, an 8-person lift was installed to connect the basement, principal and main hall levels, and a new access through the north fa√ßade was built. The work also included repairs to existing stonework, and replacement of missing sections using natural stone chosen to match. The work was carried out by LDN Architects. Since 9 February 2008 the club's commercial entity is Bowmen Limited, a registered private company. It caused considerable distress when Edinburgh Bowling Club, founded in 1848 and said to be Edinburgh's oldest, was obliged by the Royal Company of Archers to vacate the site.Tollcross Community Council http://cc.tollcross.org/Home/planning-and- development/student-accommodation-development-archers-hall/archers-to-target- student-housing The Edinburgh Bowling Club subsequently disbanded and closed.

Biography He was born in Lorient, France, where his father, Aaron Vail (1758‚Äì1813), a prominent businessman and merchant from New York was serving as U.S. consul and commercial agent. Vail's French mother brought the Vail family to the United States after the senior Aaron Vail's death, and they resided in Washington, D.C. The younger Aaron Vail was educated in Washington and became a clerk in the Department of State. In 1831 Martin Van Buren selected Vail to be the secretary of the U.S. legation in London; when Van Buren's appointment as Minister was rejected by the United States Senate, Vail acted as charg√© d'affaires, from April 4, 1832, until 1836. Vail served as a Special Diplomatic Agent to Canada in 1838. From May 20, 1840, to August 1, 1842, Vail served as charg√© d'affaires in Spain, remaining in the post until the arrival of Washington Irving to serve as Minister. After returning to the United States, Vail served for several years as the State Department's chief clerk, its top non-political appointment. He later lived in New York City; while in retirement, he declined diplomatic posts offered by Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. He later moved to Paris, and died in Pau in 1878. Family Vail's brothers included: Eugene, a State Department employee; Edward, an officer in the United States Navy; and Jefferson, an officer in the United States Army. In 1835, Vail married Emilie Salles of New York City; they were the parents of a son, Aaron Vail II, and a daughter, Emilie, who was the wife of Henry C. Bradshaw.

Education and career  After graduating from the √âcole Polytechnique in 1900, he began a career with the railway company, Chemin de Fer du Nord. In 1914, during World War I, he set up a railway routing system which enabled reinforcements to be transferred to the front for the Battle of the Marne. It was under his direction that a new track was laid in a hundred days from Beauvais to the front. He held a number of important posts in the railways. He was director general of the Chemins de fer de l'√âtat (State Railways) from 1928 to 1937 and when the French National Railways (SNCF) were set up in 1938, he became a member of its governing body. Dautry was Armaments Minister from 20 September 1939 to 16 June 1940 in the governments of Daladier and Reynaud. He obtained the permission of Daladier to send a mission to Norway to look for the stocks of heavy water which the Germans were anxious to obtain. During the German occupation of France, he withdrew from political life and retired to his home in Lourmarin in the department of Vaucluse. After the liberation, he was appointed Minister of Reconstruction and Urban Development by General Charles de Gaulle, a post which he held from 16 November 1944 to 20 January 1946.

Nicomedes Santa Cruz explains that, despite popular opinion, the Son de los Diablos has no links with African rituals or with the Andean Morenada, but rather it has a very slight similarity with the Diabladas of Oruro (Bolivia).  Name  In English, the name directly translates as \\"Song of the Devils\\".  History  Developed during the Viceroyalty of Peru with origins in Spain, the Son de los Diablos was assimilated by the black slaves living in the Spanish colony. After the independence of Peru in 1821, people of African descent lived in alleys near churches and plazas of Lima, where festivities were held. Before the celebrations, blacks joined the festivities by forming gangs that danced the Son de los Diablos. Much like the Diablada, the Son de los Diablos was heavily influenced by the Spanish Corpus Christi celebrations, it was predominantly practiced by an ethnic community (in this case the Afro-Peruvian community), and it was banned from religious celebrations by the Catholic Church in 1817. Nonetheless, the dance would remain an important part of carnival celebrations in Lima up until the early 20th century. The dance would gain a revival in the 1950s when Jose Durand used Pancho Fierro's depictions of the dance and the information provided by old Son de los Diablos dancers in order to once again bring the dance back to life.  Music  A distinguishing factor of the Son de los Diablos is its usage of such instruments as the Cajita, a small wooden box that opens and closes creating a distinctive sound, and the Quijada, the jawbone of a horse, donkey, or mule, that when hit creates a raspy buzz.

He captained Donegal to the Sam Maguire Cup in 1992. Early life and family Molloy is from Leamagowra. This is a small townland on the way over Glengesh Pass on the way towards Glencolmcille. He was born on 28 May 1962. In 1992, he was living at 61 Conlin Road in Killybegs. He is the uncle of C. J. Molloy. In December 2019, a niece of his was killed while working as a nurse in the Royal Melbourne Hospital. She was also his goddaughter. Playing career Molloy won the Under-14 Championship with his club in 1976. He played during the 1982 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship, which Donegal won. Molloy went on to play for his county at senior level for twelve years, amassing 123 appearances. He played senior football for Donegal from 1982 until 1994. Molloy played against Cavan in the 1983 Ulster final, won by Donegal. He played against Armagh in the 1990 Ulster final, won by Donegal. Molloy captained Donegal to 1992 All- Ireland title. He famously exclaimed \\"Sam's for the hills\\" as he did so. His speech is still held in high regard within the sport nationally. He would win an All Star in 1992 as well. Molloy also won two New York Senior Football Championships in 1986 and 1992, while playing for Donegal New York. By the end of his playing days, Molloy had been left with a troublesome left knee. It had no joint left, simply bone on bone. Molloy described it, in the Sean Potts- edited book Voices from Croke Park: The Stories of 12 GAA heroes, as being \\"riddled with arthritis\\". County team doctor Austin O'Kennedy regarded it as being one of the worst knees he had ever seen. Molloy had surgery on \\"seven or eight\\" occasions, before having his knee replaced at the Mater Private in October 2008. He funded the earlier operations with his own insurance. However, the ‚Ç¨22,000 owed for the replacement was nearly double the maximum allowed by his insurance and this led to Molloy receiving solicitors' letters from the hospital. He expressed disappointment at the lack of interest from the Donegal County Board in resolving the issue. Molloy contacted his former manager Brian McEniff; McEniff contacted GAA Director General P√°raic Duffy and eventually the GAA paid \\"the outstanding amount\\". Management career Molloy managed the county minor team to an Ulster Minor Football Championship in 1996. He was mentioned as a possible successor to P. J. McGowan as manager in 1997 in a dual role with Tom Conaghan. He withdrew and Declan Bonner became manager. He was managing his local club in 2007. He has also been assistant manager. Molloy has also managed the Naomh Columba club. Immediately following Donegal's All-Ireland semi-final victory over Cork in 2012, manager Jim McGuinness had Molloy deliver a message to the players beneath the Hogan Stand in Croke Park. Captain Michael Murphy later described it: \\"'Seize the opportunity' was pretty much the message he gave us. We're still trying to live by those words now; in every game we play we're living in the present, trying to grab the chance. Molloy didn't beat around the bush when he came in. He warned us that there was no point in us living with the false hope that it would all be quiet, but that we needed to be ourselves. His big message was about seizing the opportunity and how they thought after '92 that they'd win more\\". When Donegal won the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, Molloy raised the hand of Murphy at the local homecoming event, where Paddy McGrath and Pat Shovelin also featured. Other ventures Towards the end of 2009, Molloy joined the Gaelic Players Association but found it unpalatable. He was regarded as a leading candidate to replace P. J. McGowan as County Chairman when McGowan's five years came to an end in December 2012. In 2013, Molloy was one of six nominees for the position of vice-chairman of the Donegal County Board executive. He was critical of the selection process used to decide the new Donegal senior manager in 2017. Molloy has spoken publicly of his struggles with alcoholism. He presented the documentary Deoch an Dorais (Name Your Poison), aired on TG4 on 28 December 2015. He has been involved in insurance, property, sales and with pubs. He stood for the Fianna F√°il political party in the Glenties Electoral Area at the 2019 Donegal County Council election and won a seat.

The song is perhaps best known for the lyrics: Background The song is a \\"whorehouse tune\\", \\"a popular St. Louis party song.\\" The song's title is explained by quoting the lyrics more fully: \\"Shake your shoulders, shake 'em fast, if you can't shake your shoulders, shake your yas-yas-yas\\". Recordings \\"The Duck's Yas Yas Yas\\" was originally recorded in the origin of St. Louis by pianist James \\"Stump\\" Johnson in late 1928 or January 1929. He recorded the tune at least three times during his career. Blues singer Tampa Red and Thomas A. Dorsey also recorded a version on May 13, 1929. Oliver Cobb recorded the song on August 16, 1929, before he died suddenly the next year. Eddie Johnson and The Crackerjacks recorded a cover of the song in 1932. In 1939, Tommy McClennan used some of the lyrics in his song \\"Bottle It Up and Go\\". It has been covered by The Three Peppers and by King Perry & His Pied Pipers (1951) in a hardly recognizable clean version. The song has also been performed by American folk singer Dave Van Ronk as \\"Yas Yas Yas\\" on his album Van Ronk Sings (1961), but his source was a variant recorded in the Bahamas by Blind Blake & his Royal Victoria Hotel Calypso Band under the name \\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\\" (released on Miami's Art Records label in 1951). John Lee Hooker used the first lines of the song in several of his interpretations of \\"Bottle Up and Go\\". Other adaptations The cartoonist Robert Crumb quoted the song in his comic strip album Zap Comix, no. 0, in 1967. It is quoted in the first panel of a story called \\"Ducks Yas Yas\\". He also recorded the tune in 1972 with his band, the Good Tone Banjo Boys (released on a transparent red vinyl 78 rpm stereo record). \\"The Duck's Yas-Yas-Ya\\" is also referenced on Captain Beefheart's album Trout Mask Replica (1969), on the track \\"Old Fart at Play\\", in which Beefheart sings, \\"Momma licked 'er lips like a cat, pecked the ground like a rooster, pivoted like a duck\\", mentioning all three protagonists from the most famous line of the blues song. Christian recording artist Larry Norman recorded a version of the song on his 1981 album Something New Under the Son. Norman's version changes the tone of the song to that of a somewhat humorous cautionary tale and is renamed as \\"Watch What You're Doing.\\" Norman took full writing credit for the song in the album's accompanying liner notes. Norman's version opens with the lyrics \\"Mama killed a chicken, thought it was a duck, she put it on the table with its legs sticking up, Papa broke his glasses, when he fell down drunk, tried to drown the kitty-cat, turned out to be a skunk, ya gotta watch what you're doing.\\" Jon Spencer Blues Explosion quoted the first three lines of the song in \\"Chicken Dog,\\" on the album Now I Got Worry, sung by Rufus Thomas.

Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243.), n√© Li Liao (ÊùéÂØÆ), formally the Prince of Ji√†ng (Áµ≥Áéã), was an imperial prince of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty who, after the assassination of his nephew Emperor Jingzong, was poised to take the throne, but was then himself killed in the armed conflict between the eunuchs who supported him and those who supported Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Li Han, who took the throne as Emperor Wenzong.  Background  Li Wu was the sixth son of Emperor Xianzong. It is not known when he was born; his mother's was Consort Guo, the later Grand Empress Dowager Guo.Old Book of Tang, vol. 175.New Book of Tang, vol. 82.While historical sources failed to claim his mother's identity, the epitaph of his daughter Princess Jianghua claimed that his mother was Guo. He must have been born, however, in or before 805, as in 805, the same year when Emperor Xianzong's grandfather Emperor Dezong died and was succeeded by Emperor Xianzong's father Emperor Shunzong, he was created the Prince of Wen'an. He was originally named Li Liao, but his name was changed to Li Wu when Emperor Xianzong changed the names of many of his sons in 812.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239.  Death  On January 9, 827, Li Wu's nephew Emperor Jingzong, the son of Li Wu's older brother Emperor Muzong, was assassinated by a group of imperial guard officers and eunuchs, led by the officer Su Zuoming (Ëòá‰ΩêÊòé) and the eunuch Liu Keming (ÂäâÂÖãÊòé), who were fearful of his violent temper. Liu ordered the imperial scholar Lu Sui to draft a will for Emperor Jingzong putting Li Wu in charge of the affairs of state. The next day, this will was publicly read, and Li Wu met with the imperial officials in person. Liu, meanwhile, planned to replace the powerful eunuchs ‚Äî including the directors of palace communications (Shumishi) Wang Shoucheng and Yang Chenghe (Ê•äÊâøÂíå) and the commandants (‰∏≠Â∞â, Zhongwei) of the Shence Armies Wei Congjian (È≠èÂæûÁ∞°) and Liang Shouqian (Ê¢ÅÂÆàË¨ô). They reacted by launching the Shence Armies, as well as the Flying Dragon Soldiers (È£õÈæçÂÖµ), to attack Liu and Su and their followers. Liu, Su, and their party was slaughtered, and the four powerful eunuchs supported Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Li Han the Prince of JiƒÅng to be emperor instead (as Emperor Wenzong). During the battle, Li Wu was also killed. Li Wu had at least two sons ‚Äî Li Zhu (ÊùéÊ¥ô) and Li Pang (ÊùéÊªÇ) ‚Äî whom Emperor Wenzong later created imperial princes, and a daughter that Emperor Wenzong later created the Princess Shou'an and married to the general Wang Yuankui.Old Book of Tang, vol. 142.

A few days later, Izzy goes to Caitlin's place. Caitlin tells her parents that, she has been invited to spend two weeks in Casa Vernazza with Summer. Her parents agree and Jamie also joins them. During the flight to Italy, Caitlin reads some tabloids and Ludo notices it. He pretends to be interested in stars‚Äô private life. He then reads a book and Caitlin starts to think that, he does not like her. Gabriella and Luigi come to take them from the airport. Ludo and Caitlin go with Gabriella. When she visits her friend, they talk about Summer. Soon they arrive at Casa Vernazza, Summer shows Caitlin her room and her own mother's pictures. They go into town. Caitlin walks next to the church and she hears Summer's voice. Her friend is talking with a man. She meets Ludo and his father. Ludo invites Caitlin to ride his yacht with him later on. During supper they discuss this and as a result Freddie, Izzy, Jamie, Gabriella and Summer go with them too. During the trip everybody goes swimming except Jamie. Summer and Caitlin abruptly set off to the local gallery. They pretend to be students, who are working on an article about Elena Cumani-Tilney's pictures. But when Lorenzo brings one of them, Summer cries and he knows that, she is Elena's daughter. Ludo calls Caitlin and tells her to come back. Summer will not talk to her because she thinks that Caitlin was after her, when they went to town. Luckily this does not lead to an argument. Caitlin decides to help Summer discover how her mother died. After some time she says that Sir Magnus and Gabriella must have murdered her mother, but she will not talk about it to Summer. In Elena's paintings, Caitlin finds a pretty one called Abbey, July 2004. She finds it in the Internet and discovers that, it is a mental hospital. All of a sudden Summer runs away from home. Whilst everybody is searching for her somebody calls from hospital to inform that Freddie and Izzy had had an accident. Alex di Matteo comes to the Tilneys‚Äô house. He talks to her about his trip to Milan with his grandma, but she had thought that he had another girlfriend. Summer calls Caitlin and everything is explained. Ludo takes her for a walk and tells that, he in fact loves her. A few days later they open a gallery of Elena Cumani-Tilney's paintings in a house next to the Tilneys‚Äô. In the evening, they go for a ride on Ludo's yacht. First, Ludo wants to know if Caitlin is going to send an article about his mother's death to tabloid. She says that she is not but, that she has some titles in her head. Ludo tells Caitlin that he fell in love with her when he saw how seriously she treats those articles.

Early life and education Margaret Naumann Keyes was born in Mount Vernon, Iowa on 4 March 1918 to Charles R. Keyes and Sarah \\"Sadie\\" Naumann Keyes. As a child, Keyes had often accompanied her father on travels to Germany and on his archaeological expeditions, leading to her interest in academics. She attended Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa and graduated in 1939 with a B.A. in Home Economics. After graduation, Keyes taught at several Iowa high schools and undertook graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin during summer terms, earning a master's degree in 1951. She was appointed to the Home Economics faculty at the State University of Iowa in September, 1951. A decade later, she won the Ellen H. Richards Fellowship from the American Home Economics Association to undertake doctoral studies at Florida State University, earning a Ph.D. in Historic Preservation in 1965. Academic career Upon returning to the University of Iowa and Keyes taught a variety of courses including Textile Design, Historic Interiors, and research seminars. In the 1970s and 1980s, Keyes led Iowa's drive to preserve and renovate its historic structures. She served as a board member for the State Historical Society of Iowa, the Terrace Hill (the Iowa governor's mansion) Authority, the Iowa City Urban Renewal Design Review Board, the Victorian Society in America, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Keyes's most important work in historic preservation was her 1975 to 1999 direction of the restoration of the Old State Capitol in Iowa City, converting it to a state historical museum. Keyes's commitments as director of Old Capitol, speaking engagements, and service work left her with little time to fulfill her duties as professor in the Home Economics department. She gradually decreased her course load and officially retired as full professor and was granted emeritus status in 1984. She was active as a researcher and active scholar well into her retirement.

Plot  Siggi Jepsen (the first-person narrator), an inmate of a juvenile detention center, is forced to write an essay with the title \\"The Joy of Duty.\\" In the essay, Siggi describes his youth in Nazi Germany where his father, the \\"most northerly police officer in Germany,\\" does his duty, even when he is ordered to debar his old childhood friend, the expressionist painter Max Nansen, from his profession, because the Nazis banned expressionism as \\"degenerate art\\" (entartete Kunst). Siggi, however, is fascinated by Nansen's paintings, \\"the green faces, the Mongol eyes, these deformed bodies ... \\" and, without the knowledge of his father, manages to hide some of the confiscated paintings. Following the end of World War II, Jepsen senior is interned for a short time and later reinstalled as a policeman in rural Schleswig-Holstein. When he then obsessively continues to carry out his former orders, Siggi brings Nansen paintings that he believes to be in danger to safety. His father discovers his doings and dutifully turns him in for art theft.

While still in his twenties, Attig retired the first time to carry out a record setting voyage in a power cruiser, which he designed and built. Using it he became the first man from the area to make a water journey from Seneca, Illinois on the Illinois River to New Orleans, the terminus of the Mississippi River. From New Orleans, he moved around the Gulf Coast, eventually crossing the Gulf of Mexico to St. Petersburg, Florida and cruised for a period on the yacht. Attig's Schooner under full sail Donald Attig established three sets of World Class Benchmark records in the Adventure and Endurance Challenge categories.

After his eldest son, Omar, who had been born on the ship, was involved in a fatal car crash, Attig turned the ship over to the VEC Youth Reach Program. Benchmark Records in his seventies Between the ages of 71 and 73 he was involved in establishing International Benchmark records in the fields of Endurance Challenge and Adventure Challenge: In 2007, he organized and co-crewed in the first transit of the Shannon Navigation and beyond to the Seaport of Tarbert, County Kerry, in a live aboard boat without an engine. Experienced boaters who understood the hazards involved in such a project thought it impossible. The River Shannon is the longest river in Ireland. In 2008, he traveled the entire Shannon Navigation and beyond to the Seaport of Foynes, County Limerick, using the same live aboard boat without an engine. In 2008, he was the first person to transit the entire River Erne Navigation in a live aboard boat without an engine. These three distinct and different World Class Benchmark establishing record efforts, when combined, involved moving over one ton of live aboard boat and gear over 600 miles (almost 1,000 kilometers) without an engine. Most of the distance was accomplished by rowing. Additional Benchmark records he established include the total of miles transited in the combined efforts‚Äîa total of 600+ miles (960+ kilometers) over the bottom in the three contiguous years in an engineless live aboard boat. Also each record benchmark established over the three years has the additional claim of having a person over 70 involved in its establishment. Shannon Benchmark records The engineless transit, from the start of the Shannon Navigation at the Inishmagrath marker, on Lough Allen, in County Leitrim to the end of Shannon Navigation at Killaloe, County Clare and beyond to the Port of Tarbot in the Sea Estuary, required dealing with 33 bridges, 6 locks, and nine lakes, without mechanical power.

He used the same boat for this effort as was used in 2007 and 2008. There are enough hazards on the Erne Navigation to make passage in an engineless boat large enough to be live aboard a world class challenge. The Northern Ireland tourist site warns that Upper Lough Erne is a shallow maze and that waves on Lower Lough Erne can reach open-sea dimensions. Violent wind shears from the cliffs of Mago can create grave difficulties for full powered cruisers at any time. All this combines to create a formidable challenge for an engineless boat that has the windage connected with live-aboard accommodations.

The character was created by Salvatore Iaconesi in 2007 as a hack to the Biodoll art performance by Italian artist Franca Formenti. The project was later joined by Oriana Persico who curated communication and part of the theoretical approaches of the action. The Angel_F project has been featured in books, magazines, national televisions, and has been invited to many conferences and events, both academic and artistic. Creation Angel_F is an acronym which stands for Autonomous Non Generative E-volitive Life_Form. The project was born in 2007 and resulted from the fusion of two contemporary art performances. Franca Formenti, an Italian artist living in Varese, invented the Biodoll character in 2002 which began making its appearances first on the network and later in the physical world by using what were called \\"clones\\": young women, prostitutes, pornographic starlets, transsexuals and models interpreting the role of a digital prostitute. The Biodoll was an art performance focused on research emerging from the network of new forms of sexualities, and on the analysis of changes brought on by this transformation to the concepts of private and public spaces, privacy, and the possibility of creating multiple fluid identities through language and digital media. The theme of fertility has always been central to the Biodoll performance: the digital prostitute was a wombless clone but desired giving birth to a son, the 'Bloki'. In a process starting in 2006 and ending in February 2007, Salvatore Iaconesi (xDxD.vs.xDxD) used his 'Talker' linguistic artificial intelligence to animate the digital child conceived with prof. Derrick de Kerckhove: Angel_F. Iaconesi and Persico met in November 2006 and immediately started collaborating on the birth of Angel_F. Angel_F was designed as a synthetic digital being composed through narrative, technological and cognitive psychology layers. The objective was to create iconic characteristics that resulted in being evocative and able to mimic human life up to a level in which bringing up a symbolic dialogue was possible. On the other side, the artificial identity was to implement and expose the cultural, emotional and relational ways that were typical of networked social ecosystems, among those technologies, systems and infrastructures that entered and shaped people's daily lives. The young digital being mimicked the evolution of a human baby: initially conceived inside the website of its digital mother it emulated the birth of a child by using the metaphor of a virus developing inside a website, taking progressively more space in the domain's databases and interfaces. Content was produced through the software by using small browser-based spyware techniques, through which Angel_F could infer the list of major portals that had been visited by the website's users. The Biodoll website was invaded by this growing presence and, thus, Angel_F was born. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) component of Angel_F was derived from another project, Talker, through which internet users could build up the AI's linguistic network by feeding it their text and web clips. Angel_F used this component to generate sentences and phrases, publishing them on the interface and on selected blogs. The parallel between the growth of the AI and that of a child kept building up and, just as children learn how to speak and act by observing their parents and the people around them, Angel_F used its spyware and AI components to learn, to navigate websites and web portals using web crawler based techniques, and to interact with other people by using the contents hosted and generated in its database to create surreal dialogues in blogs and websites. A virtual school was created, called Talker Mind, to narratively continue the AI's growth. Five professors (Massimo Canevacci, Antonio Caronia, Carlo Formenti, Derrick de Kerckhove and Luigi Pagliarini) fed their texts and academic articles to Angel_F, simulating virtual asynchronous lessons by using a multi-blog structure. A peer-to-peer system was also created at the time, named 'Presence'. Its interface resembled the one of 8-bit videogames and the peer to peer users travelled in a starry space and were able to perform standard Instant Messaging tasks, such as chat and file sharing. The interactions were possible both among humans and digital beings. Angel_F was the first user of the Presence peer to peer system. Angel_F entered the physical world as a baby-stroller mounted laptop computer that was used to let the digital child join events and conferences held worldwide. Events Angel_F performed all over the world, both in artistic contexts and in academic ones. It was also used for the communication strategy of several activist groups on the themes of intellectual property and digital freedoms. The first public space performance was held in Milan, when the Biodoll distributed a generative free press publication (called the Bloki FreePreXXX, its text was generated algorithmically and inserted into a prepared graphic layout). June 14, 2007: The second performance was held in Rome, at the Forte Prenestino, with a massive playroom created through computational graphics that people could interact with and that were generated by the AI. June 22, 2007: Angel_F presented the closing remarks for an Ipotesi per Assurdo (Absurd Hypothesis) with Salvatore Iaconesi and Oriana Persico at the IULM University in Milan, discussing the possibilities for an ecosystemic, sustainable reinvention of corporations. July 28, 2007: Hundreds of people at LiberaFesta (Free Party) in Rome listened to Angel_F in a speech discussing new politics and hacker ethics. 2007: The Glocal & Outsiders conference held in Prague at the Academy of Sciences was the first academic presentation of the Angel_F project, together with the Biodoll. September 2007: Angel_F was not allowed to post its contribution to the DFIR (Dialogue Forum for Internet Rights) held in Rome in preparation for Rio de Janeiro's Internet Governance Forum (IGF) edition. The case quickly turned into a collaboration among the involved parties Arturo di Corinto and Angel_F was invited to the global event in Brazil where it was the only digital being present. Angel_F contributed a videomessage, in the digital freedoms workshop, which suggested some ideas for action to the United Nations and to all the parties involved in the IGF organization. October 2007: Angel_F was presented live at the FE/MALE 2 event, as an example of an atypical family during a public debate on new sexualities and social change. October 2007: Angel_F made a series of public performances Florence's Festival della Creativit√† (Festival of Creativity), an institutional event held periodically to showcase Italy's and other countries' best technological projects. During the festival Derrick de Kerckhove publicly recognized the little AI as his digital son. December 2007: Several international associations, and scientific researchers had been involved with Angel_F, eventually producing the system and process used to set up the Talker Mind digital school for the AI with Angel_F's professors. March 2008: The Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey university in Mexico City organized the Computer Art Congress 2 international event, featuring Angel_F's project among with the ones by scientific researchers worldwide. July 2008: The project was presented in Austria at the Planetary Collegium's Consciousness Reframed 9 conference, together with the 'NeoRealismo Virtuale'. October 2008: Angel_F was used at a public event on a European scale called Freedom not Fear discussing privacy and civil liberties. July 2009: Angel_F has been seen with its digital father Derrick de Kerckhove to protest against Italy's harsh politics on freedom of speech. The project concluded in 2009 with the publication of a book entitled 'Angel F. Diario di una intelligenza artificiale' (Angel_F, the diaries of an Artificial Intelligence).

Painting by Franz von Lenbach, 1873 Alexander Gustav Adolf Graf von Schleinitz (born 29 December 1807 in Blankenburg am Harz; died 19 February 1885 in Berlin) was the Foreign Minister of Prussia from 1858 to 1861 and minister for the royal household from late 1861 to his death.  Life = Early years  He came from an old aristocratic family from the Margraviate of Meissen that was elevated to the rank of Reichsfreiherr already in the 16th century; his father was the Regierungspr√§sident of Blankenburg, and later minister of state in the Duchy of Brunswick, Karl Ferdinand Freiherr von Schleinitz (1756-1837); his mother was Barbara von Hochstetter (1768-1819). He was the brother of the minister of state of Brunswick, Wilhelm von Schleinitz (1794-1856), and of the Prussian Regierungspr√§sident Julius von Schleinitz (1806-1865). Schleinitz studied in G√∂ttingen and Berlin, and joined the Prussian civil service in 1828. In 1835 he became an embassy attach√©, in 1841 he was made an Expert Councillor (Vortragender Rat) in the foreign ministry. In July 1848 he replaced Heinrich Alexander von Arnim as Foreign Minister, thus joining the government of Gottfried Ludolf Camphausen. However, after a few days he resigned from his post, and subsequently represented Prussia at the court of Hannover.  Political career  In May 1849 he negotiated the peace treaty with Denmark, and in July 1849 once again took up the position of Foreign Minister in the government of Friedrich Wilhelm, Count Brandenburg. However, since his German patriotic views were not compatible with the way Prussian politics was developing, he retired from public service on 26 September 1850 as a Wirklicher Geheimer Rat, and from then lived near Koblenz in close contact with the court of the Prince of Prussia, and at Schloss Gebesee in Thuringia. After the Prince-Regent, the later King and Emperor Wilhelm I, assumed control of the government, Schleinitz, who was one of the King's closest confidants, once again took over the Foreign Ministry, in the Prince-Regent's government of the \\"New Era\\" that was called together in November 1858. The main tenets of his foreign policy were the attempt to form an alliance with England and Austria, the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe and a strengthening of Prussia's role in Germany. The domestic problems of the liberal government moved him to leave the government in October 1861 and take over the Ministry of the Royal Household, where he remained to his death in 1885. From then onwards he was the arch-enemy of Otto von Bismarck, who became Prime Minister of Prussia in 1862. Prussian Liberals, as well as Bismarck himself at times saw the Household Ministry as a \\"Counter-Government\\" of Queen Augusta, to the King's conservative government. On the occasion of the Emperor's and Empress' golden wedding anniversary, Schleinitz and his wife were elevated to the rank of Graf (Count) on 11 June 1879. Marriage From 1865, Alexander von Schleinitz was married to Marie von Buch (1842-1912), who was 35 years younger than he was. As Gr√§fin Schleinitz she became the most important saloni√®re of the time in Berlin. Along with \\"Mimi\\", as she was known, he championed Richard Wagner and the Bayreuth Festival. They had no children. Their joint grave, which has not been preserved, is in the Trinity Church Cemetery No. 1 in Berlin.

It was built between 1903 and 1905 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. It was the last mill in Ashton spinning cotton. It ceased in 1980. It was demolished and the land was used for housing.  Location  Cedar mill was built on Alderley Street, Hurst, to the north of Ashton.  History  The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. The syndicate went on to build the Rock Mill, Atlas Mill, Curzon Mill and the Tudor Mill. Cedar Mill was built with a capital of 70,000 GBP. It was their sixth mill. It installed its machinery in July 1905. The Cedar Mill Company went into voluntary liquidation 7 January 1921 became part of the Atlas Mills Limited. The final mill built by the syndicate was Texas Mill. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914‚Äì1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited was taken over by the LCC in 1929. Thus, Cedar Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. Ownership passed to Courtaulds Northern Textiles in the 1960s and it was still spinning cotton until 1980, making it the last cotton spinning mill in Ashton.  Architecture  This was a Sydney Stott building. It was five-storeys high built on a basement, built of engineering brick with yellow brick decoration. It had large rectangular windows grouped in threes on the long sides and twos on the others: 30 windows long and 16 windows wide. It was 198 ft by 136 ft. There was an ornamental water tower. The engine and boiler house were to the east. The chimney was round and displayed the two rings that were a trademark of a Sydney Stott mill.  Power  The steam engine was a 1500 hp triple expansion vertical engine by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw built in 1905. It had a 22 ft flywheel that operated at 75 rpm. The flywheel drove 28 ropes that transmitted the power to each floor. The cylinders all had Corliss valves. They had a 48 in throw, the High pressure was 20\\" in diameter, the intermediate was 32 in and the low pressure was 50 in. The air pump was driven from the low pressure crosshead, there was a Saxon governor on the high pressure end of the bed. The boilers operated at 120psi. Usage Cedar Mill was used for spinning 50s counts of twists from Egyptian cotton, for the hosiery and manufacturing market.

He served first as a minister in the state government of Punjab. He served as Chief Minister of Haryana for a few months (March to November) in 1967, and also served as a minister in Punjab state, Haryana state and the Union cabinet. He also served as the first speaker of Haryana state assembly in 1966-67.  Early Life  Rao was born in 1921 and hails from affluent Ahir Family of Rewari, Punjab Province (British India), [now Haryana] in British India. He was adopted by Ahir personality, Rao Balbir Singh. His Family is Direct descendent of Ruler and Freedom Fighter, Rao Tula Ram. Career=East Punjab The years that Birendra Singh spent at St. Stephan's college were the early years of India's independence. The college was situated in New Delhi, the very hub of political activity, and Birendra Singh was drawn to politics by the environment. The first elections in free India were held in 1952 and Birendra Singh contested as an independent candidate from his native Ahirwal region, of which the city of Rewari is the urban center. He lost that election because there were many twists and turns of the politics in the Ahirwal region. Birendra Singh then joined the Congress Party. Rather than contest elections to the State Legislative Assembly, he managed to get himself nominated to the State Legislative Council, which is the upper house of the state legislature. He managed this feat by ingratiating himself with Nehru on the basis of his clipped accent and very 'progressive' views on any subject, all of which resonated with Nehru. His royal background could also prove useful to Nehru while dealing with more recalcitrant royals from the princely states. Thus, Birendra Singh became a member of the State Legislature of the Indian state of undivided Punjab, known informally as East Punjab, without winning an election. He would serve as a nominated member for two successive terms (a total of 12 years) until 1966. During these years, he was made a minister in the Pratap Singh Kairon government and held charge, at various times, of several important ministries like PWD, Irrigation, Power, Revenue and Consolidation, etc. Creation of Haryana When India became independent in 1947, the old province of Punjab was partitioned and East Punjab was retained by India. Several Princely states located on the plains of East Punjab were merged to create the state of PEPSU. Several other princely states in the hills of East Punjab were similarly merged to create the Chief Commissioners' Province of Himachal. The portion which had been directly ruled by the British (rather than by the Maharajas of various princely states) became a third, separate state and received the name Punjab. The Ahirwal region and Rewari lay within this state of Punjab (India), and Birendra Singh was a minister in this state. In the period 1956-66, the three political entities described above were merged and de-merged so that finally, in 1966, the political map of the region as it stands today emerged. The final step in this process of re-organization was the separation of the Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab into the new state of Haryana, and the creation of the Union Territory of Chandigarh to serve as the common capital of both states. This was accomplished after some acrimony and political maneuvering. Rao Birendra Singh played a prominent role in this process of division. He did so because Ahirwal/Rewari was a Hindi-speaking area in the near vicinity of Delhi and he felt that the Hindi-speaking people of undivided Punjab were not getting their just due in the political dispensation. Therefore, beginning 1962, he spearheaded the campaign for division and achieved success when the state of Haryana was born in November 1966. Defection from Congress After the formation of Haryana in November 1966, Bhagwat Dayal Sharma became Haryana's first Chief Minister, and Birendra Singh was elected the first speaker of the Haryana assembly which was a spin-off from the Punjab Assembly. The first-ever poll to Haryana Vidhan Sabha was held in March 1967. Birender Singh was elected a member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly from the Pataudi assembly constituency as Congress Party's candidate. However, he established the Vishal Haryana Party immediately by defecting from Congress with many MLAs. He was appointed Chief Minister of Haryana on 24March 1967, replacing Bhagwat Dayal Sharma with his newly formed VHP assuming power. But the assembly was dissolved, and Haryana placed under President's rule, in November 1967. Congress won the Vidhan Sabha election in 1968 and Bansi Lal became Chief Minister. Birender Singh's VHP came creditable second to Congress in the election. He was elected to the 5th Lok Sabha in 1971 from the Mahendragarh on the Vishal Haryana Party ticket. Later career In September 1978 he merged this party with the Congress. In 1980, he was re-elected to the 7th Lok Sabha and he played a prominent role in the formation of the Congress Government in the centre. He served in Ninth Cabinet of India as Cabinet Minister of Agriculture (India), Food, Rural development, Irrigation, and Civil supply. In 1984, he was re-elected to the 8th Lok Sabha from Mahendragarh(Lok Sabha constituency) and became a part of the 10th ministry of India under prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. He later resigned from both the Congress party and the Lok Sabha in 1989 on the issue of Bofors scandal. He joined Janata Dal and was elected to 9th Loksabha in 1989, and became Cabinet minister in the Chander Shekhar's Govt. He left active politics after 1996. Rao Birender Singh died on 30 September 2009 in the age of 89. Army career Rao Birender Singh also enrolled in the Territorial Army during the Second World War. * In 1947, he resigned from the Army as a Captain. He came to Rampura and took all the movable and immovable property of Rao Balbir Singh in his possession. * In the batch of 1949-50, he was selected for Indian Police Service but he did not join that service. * Again in 1950 to 1951, he joined the Territorial Army as a Commissioned Officer. Contribution to Rewari By his efforts, Rewari was made a separate district in 1989. The ruling government was of Chaudhary Om Prakash Chautala who was the Chief Minister Education and welfare of Ahirwal areas Apart from his political service to the Nation Rao Birender Singh also served the backward areas of Ahirwal by establishing many educational institutions like Ahir College Rewari, RBS School-Rewari, Rao Tularam School- Rewari, Rao Tularam Technical College- Delhi. He is the founder of RBS College of Education- Rampura, Rewari. Death He died of cardiac arrest in Gurgaon on 30 September 2009.

Already famous for having written Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Stowe came to Florida after the U.S. Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of Palmetto Leaves appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida. Scion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly felt a sense of Christian responsibility that was expressed in her letters. She considered it her duty to help improve the lives of newly emancipated blacks and detailed her efforts to establish a school and church in Mandarin toward these ends. Parts of the book relate the lives of local African-Americans and the customs of their society. Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of \\"excessive\\" heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter. Her audience comprises relatives, friends, and strangers in New England who ask her advice about whether or not to move to Florida, which at the time was still mostly wilderness. Although it is a minor work in Stowe's oeuvre, Palmetto Leaves was one of the first travel guides written about Florida and stimulated Florida's first boom of tourism and residential development in the 1880s.  Background = Stowe buys an estate  Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1872 while she was writing the letters that would become Palmetto Leaves By the time Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811‚Äì1896) moved to Florida in 1867, she was already internationally famous for authoring Uncle Tom's Cabin, published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning slavery in the United States. Stowe's opposition to slavery sprang from a moral passion based on her Christian faith. She had grown up the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.Gotta, John (September 2000). \\"The Anglican Aspect of Harriet Beecher Stowe\\", The New England Quarterly, 73 (3) p. 412‚Äì433. In 1860, Stowe's son Frederick \\"Fred\\" William Stowe enlisted in the First Massachusetts Infantry Regiment when Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers in anticipation of the Civil War. Much beloved, yet troubled, Fred Stowe had developed a problem with alcohol as early as sixteen. He took to army life, however, and was promoted to lieutenant. After receiving a head wound at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, he endured severe headaches and was forced to resign his commission.Wilson, p. 493. His alcoholism worsened, and he may have compounded it with a liberal use of opiates and narcotics, which were widely available.Thulesius, p. 21.Wilson, p. 498. In 1866, Fred encountered two young farmers in Connecticut who had spent time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful and cheap, and many recently emancipated blacks were available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation.Thulesius, p. 32. For $10,000 ($ in 2009) she purchased a cotton plantation near Orange Park, south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader Zephaniah Kingsley in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, until 1811.May, Philip S. (January 1945). \\"Zephaniah Kingsley, Nonconformist\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly 23 (3), p. 145‚Äì159.Kingsley and Anna Jai moved to another plantation at the mouth of the St. Johns River in 1814 where they lived for 25 years, now protected by the National Park Service as Kingsley Plantation. Stowe intended that Fred would manage the estate as he recovered from his wounds and addictions. As an extension of her abolitionist ideals, she wrote to her brother Charles Beecher, however, about her potential role in the endeavor: > My plan ... is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have for many > years had a longing to be more immediately doing Christ's work on earth. My > heart is with that poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, > and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative state in which > whoever seizes has them. > Corrupt politicians are already beginning to speculate on them as possible > capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads with all sorts of > vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere > else, been pouring. Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; > but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, > nothing more.Wilson, p. 515. Charles Stowe, her son, later wrote that his mother searched for higher purpose in everything she did, from growing potatoes to writing. She wrote that the prospect of setting up a series of churches along the St. Johns River would be the best way to train former slaves, remarking \\"I long to be at this work and cannot think of it without my heart burning within me\\".Stowe, Charles, p. 220‚Äì221.Whitfield, Stephen (April 1993). \\"Florida's Fudged Identity\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 71 (4), p. 413‚Äì435.The publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin had made Stowe an international celebrity. Already active in abolitionist circles, she had been familiar with Frederick Douglass, a former slave who had educated himself and risen to prominence throughout the North, giving lectures on the evils of slavery and thinking about how a population of freed but impoverished and uneducated blacks could sustain themselves (Thulesius, p. 61‚Äì65). At some point following Uncle Tom's Cabin but before the Civil War, Stowe invited Douglass to her house and asked him this question personally. Education, according to Douglass, was the primary answer. Stowe was leaving soon on a speaking tour of England and she expected to be given a large sum of money from British sympathizers to be employed in charity work to assist runaway slaves. Douglass intended to start an industrial school for ex-slaves and anticipated she would give him about $20,000. Whether through some miscommunication, Stowe's mishandling of funds, or Douglass' own fault, Stowe eventually gave him only $500; Douglass was confused and disappointed (Thulesius, p. 65). Florida was little populated and developed: it had just a fraction of the population of Georgia and Alabama. South of Ocala, approximately two people lived per square mile.Stover, John F. (February 2000). \\"Flagler, Henry Morrison\\", American National Biography Online. Retrieved on June 30, 2009. Florida's school system was in disarray at the end of the Civil War; in 1866 a Northerner named A. E. Kinne noted there were fewer schools for white children than freedmen's schools for black children. In 1860, there were no official schools for black children and slaves were prohibited from any education. At the same time, there were 97 public schools for white children and 40 private academies for them, some of which appeared to get public funding. In May 1865, the total Florida population was 154,000, and an estimated 47% of it was black, almost all of whom were former slaves.Laura Wallis Wakefield, \\"'Set a Light in a Dark Place': Teachers of Freedmen in Florida, 1863-1874\\", Fall 2004, MA Thesis, pp. 9, 12-14, University of Central Florida, accessed 17 Nov 2010 A difference in attitudes about education between the races was apparent as freed blacks saw education as the key to increasing their opportunities, or at least escaping conditions they had endured during servitude.Wakefield, Laura (Spring 2003). \\"'Set a Light in a Dark Place': Teachers of Freedmen in Florida, 1864-1874\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 81 (4), pp. 401‚Äì417.  Transformation and failure  Map of the St. Johns River in 1876 showing Mandarin; Laurel Grove was on the opposite side of the river. In the late winter of 1867, Stowe followed her son to Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her to spend more time on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once,Wilson, p. 520. writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become \\"young & frisky\\".Thulesius, p. 36. She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about across the St. Johns River. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe fell in love with a cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid- back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking \\"How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?\\" She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: \\"I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos‚Äîwhere the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing. [Ralph Waldo] Emerson could insulate himself here and keep his electricity. [Nathaniel] Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida.\\"Thulesius, p. 117. Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced and made poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, plantations had been largely self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took days off at a time to visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (Helicoverpa zea) destroyed much of the cotton crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York,Alcohol would haunt Fred Stowe for the rest of his life. He sailed to the Mediterranean to remove himself from temptation, but could not shake his addiction. In 1870, he was living with his parents in Mandarin when he resolved not to embarrass them anymore. He caught a ship to Chile, but continued to San Francisco, then a rough port. Some friends took him to a hotel, where he settled in and left to run an errand. He was never heard from again. Stowe tried in vain to have him located, and in her old age, she spoke of him constantly. (Wilson, p. 559‚Äì560.)(Stowe, Charles, p. 278‚Äì279.)Thulesius, p. 39‚Äì41.Wilson, p. 526‚Äì527. and at some point in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin. Citrus was distributed primarily in a regional market and was a luxury in northern cities; oranges in New York sold for about 50 cents per fruit.Wilson, p. 521. The acreage attached to the house Stowe purchased could produce an income of $2,000 a month ($ in 2009). Stowe wrote to author George Eliot to update her on the progress of improvements to the house in Mandarin, putting up wallpaper, improving plaster, and building a veranda that wrapped around the structure. She took pains not to disturb a giant oak and instead built the veranda around the tree. The house could accommodate as many as 17 family members and friends.Stowe, Charles, p. 221‚Äì222. From 1868 to 1884, Stowe split her time between her residence in Hartford, Connecticut, a mansion named Oakholm, and her house in Mandarin. A few weeks before Christmas each year, she would oversee arrangements to close Oakholm for the season, which involved preparing the house for the winter, packing all their clothes, living necessities, her writing materials, and the carpets in the house and shipping everything to Florida. Various family members would accompany her, living in the comfortable two-story house she modestly called a \\"cottage\\" or \\"hut\\".Thulesius, p. 69‚Äì73. In Hartford she was barraged with requests and at the center of a whirl of activity. Mandarin was not connected to a telegraph line until the 1880s and mail was received only once a week by boat. Stowe was able to relax somewhat in Mandarin and write for at least three hours a day.Thulesius, p. 90.  Description of text and publication  Stowe remained active, attending speaking engagements, writing, traveling frequently and publishing several novels while she was wintering in Mandarin. Though she promised her publishers, J. R. Osgood, another novel, she instead compiled a series of articles about Florida and letters to relatives in New England about her daily life. Some of them were first published in Christian Union, a local New England newspaper established by her brother Henry Ward Beecher. In all, twenty chapters make up Palmetto Leaves that vary in tone depending upon Stowe's audience. \\"Buying land in Florida\\", \\"Florida for Invalids\\", and \\"Our Experience in Crops\\" are addressed more to general readers who may be considering moving to the region. Some essays are directed to describing the best sights in the area, such as \\"Flowery January in Florida\\", \\"Picnicking up Julington\\", \\"The Grand Tour up River\\", and \\"St. Augustine\\". A more personal touch is included in chapters entitled \\"A Letter to the Girls\\", \\"Letter- Writing\\", and \\"Our Neighbor Over the Way\\" as Stowe includes intimate details about her daily life in Mandarin. Her observations of the state and characteristics of emancipated slaves are mentioned intermittently in letters and essays, but the final two chapters, \\"Old Cudjo and The Angel\\" and \\"Laborers of The South\\", are dedicated solely to this topic. Palmetto Leaves was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she published Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands about her first trip to Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe.Robbins, p. 83. She followed this with Agnes of Sorrento that appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly from 1861 to 1862. Source material for Agnes of Sorrento was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands, writing: > If the criticism be made that every thing is given couleur de rose, the > answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with > too bright a pencil, the reader will consider that, after all, there are > many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors. > The object of publishing these letters is, therefore, to give to those who > are true-hearted and honest the same agreeable picture of life and manners > which met the writer's own eyes. Because little was known about the region, the elements of its climate, citrus, water, and general ideas about illness and health, Stowe was possibly first among several authors and advertising schemes that portrayed Florida as an exotic place of natural wonders and powers that could rejuvenate frail health. What travel writers published on Florida were exaggerated claims, readily accepted by audiences hungry for escapist literature.Eacker, Susan A. (August 1998). \\"Gender in Paradise: Harriet Beecher Stowe and Postbellum Prose on Florida\\", The Journal of Southern History, 64 (3) p. 495‚Äì512. Biographer Forrest Wilson considers the finished product, Palmetto Leaves‚Äîpublished in 1873‚Äîto be the first promotional writing about Florida ever. Occasionally letters about the state were printed in local newspapers in the North, but because Florida was still very much a rugged wilderness, Northerners really had no concept of what the region was like.Wilson, p. 576. Rather besotted with the marvelous properties she saw in the orange, Stowe intended to call the book Orange Blossoms, but changed the title to better express the plant that proliferated the region the most.Thulesius, p. 91.  Subject and themes = Duty and calling  Stowe was fascinated with oranges, calling them \\"golden apples\\" and using them as a metaphor for the duty she was called to do in Florida. In the first chapter of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe tells how she takes a steamer to Savannah, Georgia. On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes attached to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals to take care of the poor and suffering.Stowe, p. 1‚Äì11. The impressive orange tree served as a metaphor for Stowe in Palmetto Leaves. She calls it \\"the fairest, the noblest, the most generous, it is the most surprising and abundant of all trees which the Lord God caused to grow eastward in Eden\\", and compares it to her task of educating emancipated slaves.Stowe, p. 18. When she first arrived in Mandarin, from 1868 to 1870, religious services were held in the Stowes' home, with Calvin presiding and Stowe teaching Sunday School to both black and white children and sometimes serving as an acolyte during services. Stowe purchased a lot in 1869 to build a church for her neighbors that would double as a school to educate children, freed slaves, and anyone eager to learn. Though she encountered considerable frustration in dealing with the bureaucracy of the Freedmen's Bureau, construction was finished within a year and a teacher was in place, procured from Brooklyn, New York.Thulesius, p. 78‚Äì80. Stowe had an organ that was rolled from her home to the church, but after it became too difficult to roll back and forth, they locked it in a closet in the school. The building burned down to Stowe's deep dismay, probably because of some drifters who spent the night in it and caught the southern pine wood on fire from carelessness, although Olav Thulesius suggests it was arson committed by Stowe's neighbors who did not appreciate her efforts to educate black children.Thulesius, p. 81. After a frost in 1835, the orange trees in north Florida were killed, even underground, but they sprouted back only to be assaulted by insects, yet they recovered. While her neighbors helped to raise funds to rebuild the church, Stowe and the small community handed spellers to local blacks who were eager to learn. She decried the delay in the children's education: \\"To see people who are willing and anxious to be taught growing up in ignorance is the sorest sight that can afflict one\\".Stowe, p. 22.  Florida and daily life in Mandarin  From her first sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a beautiful land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens)Stowe, p. 97‚Äì115. and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora)Stowe, p. 87‚Äì96. flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things to find in the woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats,Stowe, p. 40‚Äì68. but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Ph≈ìbus the cardinal.Stowe, p. 149‚Äì152. Stowe attempts to disabuse readers of the notion that the region is perfect. She writes, \\"In New England Nature is an up-and- down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk\\" and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an \\"indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and does every thing when she happens to feel like it\\".Stowe, p. 29‚Äì30. Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, she would be a dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness.Stowe, p. 26‚Äì39. Malaria is a fact of life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with tuberculosis. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh all these issues before making their decisions.Stowe, p. 116‚Äì136. In The Journal of Southern History, Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a \\"woman's rights woman\\". Stereoscopic view of Stowe's home in Mandarin showing the porch interrupted by a massive oak tree Stowe recounts several sailing trips she takes on the St. Johns and Julington Creek and the animals she sees during her excursion, appreciating the alligators, \\"water-turkeys\\" (Anhinga anhinga), and \\"fish-hawks\\", or ospreys (Pandion haliaetus). Long an animal lover, she took her dogs, cats, and birds with her as part of the \\"earthquake\\" of the annual relocation from Hartford to Mandarin. She extended this care to other animals as well. In Naples, Italy, she once got out of a carriage to walk as it was being pulled up a steep hill by two beleaguered horses that were being whipped by the driver, and asked her companions and guide to do the same.Thulesius, p. 104‚Äì115. Not only did she write the first travel guide to Florida, but Stowe also became the first defender of wild animals. She pays particular attention in Palmetto Leaves to hunters who shoot at anything they see. Not taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: \\"it must be something that enjoys and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it\\".Stowe, p. 260. In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's wading birds, whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.  Emancipated slaves  Illustration accompanying the chapter entitled \\"Old Cudjo and the Angel\\" The final two letters in Palmetto Leaves address the newly freed slaves in Florida. Two strong women who are less docile than Stowe is accustomed are included. One, a field hand turned domestic named Minnah, whom Stowe has tried in vain to teach how to do household chores, is so forthright in her speech that Stowe writes, \\"Democracy never assumes a more rampant form than in some of these old negresses, who would say their screed to the king on his throne if they died for it the next minute. Accordingly, Minnah's back was marked and scored with the tyrant's answers to free speech.\\"Stowe, p. 298 Minnah eventually returns happily to the fields. Another, Judy, is complacent and enjoys taking mornings and afternoons off to see to her husband. Stowe attributes their work ethic to poor training and \\"the negligent habits inducted by slavery\\"; the truly talented and hard-working black laborers had moved on from homesteads to industry, able to demand their own price for their labors.Stowe, p. 314‚Äì317. Although Stowe describes Minnah and Judy with some tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave owned by the captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues to work for him following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. Her knowledge of the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.Stowe, p. 249‚Äì250. In another story, Stowe and Calvin meet a man on a Mandarin dock who has been cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small homestead on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him.Stowe, p. 267‚Äì278. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.Stowe, pp. 279‚Äì321. Reception and criticism Third incarnation of the school Stowe helped support, built in 1873, now the Mandarin Community Club Palmetto Leaves became a best-seller for Stowe and was released in several editions. It was published again in 1968 as part of Bicentennial Floridiana, a series of original facsimile texts about the history of the state. It was so popular that through publishing it, Stowe virtually ruined the peace and quiet she sought in Mandarin to be able to work. The year following the publication of Palmetto Leaves, Stowe reported that 14,000 tourists had visited North Florida. Two years after its initial publication, a writer working for Harper's magazine noted that Stowe was \\"besieged by hundreds of visitors, who do not seem to understand that she is not an exhibition\\".Thulesius, p. 94‚Äì95. Stowe's house, which was located on the bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats shuffling tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home.Wilson, p. 584. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to pose for tourists.Thulesius, p. 95. Stowe was among several authors who wrote about Florida following the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something that may have been allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: > Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence > in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under > tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of > thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She > herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help > restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first > promoter was merely a Good Samaritan. Uncle Tom's Cabin was clearly Stowe's magnum opus (although she considered Old Town Folks, which was written while she was in Mandarin, to have that designation), as Stowe family history recalls that Abraham Lincoln entertained the author during a visit to the White House, and greeted her by saying \\"So this is the little lady who made this big war?\\"Wilson, p. 484. Compared to it, Palmetto Leaves is considered a minor work and is rarely included in the canon of criticism about Stowe's writings. The Cambridge Introduction to Literature series on Stowe addresses it briefly, however, noting that the mixed essay and letter format make it \\"uneven in quality and unstable in stance\\".Robbins, p. 87‚Äì89. More assertive criticism was directed toward Stowe's portrayals of the local Mandarin blacks. Cambridge Introduction to Literature author Sarah Robbins called it \\"downright offensive\\" and declared that Stowe negated her own attempts to persuade her readers that emancipated slaves were industrious and could assist in rebuilding the South of their own volition by including unflattering descriptions of their physical features‚Äîcomparing Old Cudjo to a baboon, for example‚Äîand writing that supervising and taking care of them was necessary. Susan Eacker agrees, writing that Stowe's views were representative of the majority of white Americans' ideas of where blacks should be in the social scheme of the New South.  Post-publication  Governor Marcellus Stearns, his cabinet, and the staff of the Florida State Capitol greet Stowe, dressed in black on the sixth step on the right in 1874 The effects of Stowe's writings about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During a visit to his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff on the steps of the state capitol building‚Äîwhich was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion‚Äîand they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.Thulesius, p. 132. In 1882 Stowe purchased a plot of land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever to spend the rest of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with plants and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across.Stowe, Charles, p. 300‚Äì301. She died in 1896. Stained glass window dedicated to the Stowes at the Church of Our Saviour, destroyed in 1964 A frost in 1886 killed much of the orange industry in Mandarin and the town saw an economic decline. In 1916, an ornate stained glass window constructed by Louis Comfort Tiffany was installed in the Church of Our Saviour, depicting a large oak tree overlooking the river. The church and Mandarin residents offered no more than $500 for the window; for three years ten cent subscriptions were raised around Mandarin, and notices were placed in New York magazines to solicit finances for it. Although scholars have stated that Stowe's efforts to educate local blacks were ultimately unsuccessful, the woman who spearheaded the fundraising effort for the memorial window noted that the project was enthusiastically supported by local black churches and residents, who gave what they could out of affection for Stowe, remembering that she taught some of them to read. The window probably cost Tiffany $850 ($ in 2009), and though there is no record of exactly how much Tiffany was paid, he took the project on because he liked the design: the tree, the moss, the Southern motif, and because it was to memorialize the Stowes. He probably made no profit from it. Beneath it read \\"In that hour, fairer than daylight dawning/ Remains the glorious thought, I am with Thee\\", part of a hymn penned by Stowe.Wilson, p. 621.\\"Stowe Memorial Planned; In Florida Hamlet Where the Author of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" Lived\\", The New York Times (April 4, 1914), p. 15. The school Stowe sponsored closed in 1929. Following Stowe's departure, the next owners of the house turned it into a lodge named after her. It closed in the 1940s and was subsequently replaced by a spacious home; what survives is the 500-year-old oak tree, which the Stowes built around instead of removing.Thulesius, p. 141‚Äì142. The oak had continued to grow and upset the foundation of the new home.Hooker, Kenneth W. (January 1940). \\"A Stowe Memorial\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 18 (3) p. 198‚Äì203. The stained glass window became a tourist attraction and the last memorial to Stowe in Florida; in later decades some of the parishioners and clergy had doubts about its \\"churchliness\\" as it was a rare depiction in an Anglican church not referencing a Biblical theme.Thulesius, p. 164. In 1964 Hurricane Dora destroyed the Church of Our Saviour, including the stained glass window.

Mandarin has since grown into a suburb of the expansive city of Jacksonville. Artist Christopher Still created an oil on linen painting named The Okeehumkee on the Oklawaha River that hangs in the Florida House of Representatives.

Its area is , and it is mostly from deep. It is a circular piece of continental rocks surrounded by oceanic crust. Volcanism occurred there .C. Gaina, R. D. M√ºller, B. Brown and T. Ishihara: Microcontinent formation around Australia in Geological Society of Australia Special Publication 22, 2001 page 400-405 The East Tasman Plateau is separated from the island of Tasmania by of deeper water, and the East Tasman Saddle is a higher ridge connecting the plateau to the Freycinet Peninsula region of the Tasmanian East Coast. This ridge runs north west from the plateau. South-west of the plateau is the L'Atalante Depression. Tectonics Prior to tectonic rifting, the East Tasman Plateau microcontinent was attached to the southeast of Tasmania and the north east of the South Tasman Rise. To the northeast, east and south east of the plateau was the Lord Howe Rise. In the Cretaceous period, the continental breakup of Gondwana started near Tasmania. About a rift entered the east coast of Tasmania from the south and split off the Lord Howe Rise from the South Tasman Rise to the west. Sea floor spreading continued to move this continental sliver away to the east from Tasmania and Australia, and the rift jumped into the Lord Howe Rise and separated off the East Tasman Plateau. The detachment of the East Tasman Plateau from the Lord Howe Rise has left a large gulf on the west side of the Lord Howe Rise around 38¬∞S 162¬∞E where it used to be. In the late Cretaceous the East Tasman Plateau was at 65¬∞S and it moved north to 60¬∞S in early Oligocene. Geology The geology of the East Tasman Plateau includes early hard continental type rocks, volcanic rocks which are part of sea mounts, and marine sediments deposited since it was below sea level. The earliest continental East Tasman Plateau rocks that have been brought to the surface of the sea are of Neoproterozoic age, and include gneiss, rhyolite, quartzite, sandstone, ferricrete, and metamorphosed sediments. The eastern edge of the plateau facing the Tasman Basin is steep, dropping more than and composed of granite. Sediments on the East Tasman Plateau start with silty clay from Maastrichtian to Eocene. These were deposited in shallow sea water. The microfossils found in these layers include spores, pollen from coniferous forests, and dinocysts. The pollen showed that the climate was humid, with cool winters. From early to mid Eocene, 55 to 37 Ma, the climate on nearby land was uniform, wet and cool and supported angiosperm forests. During the mid Eocene microfossils include diatoms. Above this in the stratigraphic record is glauconite containing siltstone deposited at the end of the Eocene. This material was due to condensed sedimentation due to the added water from the current. During this period around 36 million years ago the plateau started sinking to a depth of . After this there was a gap in the deposition, due to the opening of the Southern Ocean between the Australian Continent and Antarctica. A seaway carrying the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current developed. The current eroded part of the surface, and stopped the sediments from the land masses from reaching it. During Oligocene to mid Miocene there were oceanic deposits of clay and calcareous ooze. Microfossils from this time include foraminifers. After this the circumpolar current strengthened and only ooze deposited. The current rate of buildup of ooze on the seabed on the plateau is about per year which is quite slow. The sinking has been at the rate of in 10 million years (0.1 mm/year), so the buildup of sediments is not keeping pace with submergence. After the deposition of sediments, the sediment has been modified by phosphatisation and the formation of ferromanganese crusts. Paleoclimate Carbonate-clumped isotope thermometry uses the carbon-13 and oxygen-18 isotope levels in carbonates to determine the sea temperature. This is in addition to the microfossils, which give a temperature clue as different organisms live in different water temperatures. The sediment cores from the East Tasman Plateau give a history of the temperature of the Southern Ocean and are valuable in seeing the limits of climate change in the future. Water temperature on the Plateau has been as high as . Cascade Seamount The Cascade Seamount is an undersea mountain which has a height from its base higher than those on Tasmania. The peak of Cascade Seamount is currently deep. The top of the seamount is fairly flat and domed, but once down to deep the sides slope off very steeply. The Cascade Seamount is a volcano formed during the Late Eocene period as a result of the Balleny mantle plume. This volcano has produced volcanic breccia, hyaloclastite and alkali olivine basalt. The extra weight of the seamount isostatically depressed the adjacent plateau to form a basin. The basin filled with up to of sediment during Late Eocene, and early Oligocene, and another of calcareous ooze and chalk during late Oligocene. Originally the volcano was more than above sea level. The age is confirmed by foraminifera microfossils Chiloguembelina cubensis, Globigerapsis index, Globigerapsis rubriformis, Subbotina angiporoides and Subbotina linaperta found in the sediment on the volcano. This sediment settled in shallow water. The Cascade Seamount is part of a chain of volcanic seamounts that extend south to the Balleny Islands near Antarctica. High frequency echograms show that the top of the seamount is covered in sediment, but that the steep slopes are rocky. There is possibly a debris flow on the east flank. The name for Cascade Seamount has also been called Cascade Guyot. The feature was discovered in 1944, and appeared on chart BA214 in 1954. It was named after the Cascade Brewery. Fauna Above the sea at this location typical Southern Ocean animals are found such as several kinds of whales, albatross and petrels. Species detected include Diomedea exulans, Diomedea royal, Diomedea sanfordi, Euphausia frigida, Fregetta tropica, Limacina retroversa, Oceanites oceanicus, Oithona similis, Pachyptila belcheri, Pachyptila crassirostris, Pachyptila turtur, Pachyptila vittata, Pelagodroma marina, Phoebetria fusca, Phoebetria palpebrata, Procellaria aequinoctialis, Pterodroma cookilaria, Pterodroma lessonii, Pterodroma leucoptera, Pterodroma macroptera, Pterodroma macroptera, Pterodroma mollis, Pterodroma neglecta, Puffinus assimilis, Puffinus tenuirostris, Thalassarche bulleri, Thalassarche cauta, Thalassarche melanophrys, and Thysanoessa macrura.

History=Secondary modern school Remains of former RAF Dunholme Lodge The school was opened as a secondary modern in 1952 on the site of RAF Dunholme Lodge, a WW2 Bomber Command station, which had been bought for ¬£600 in 1946 by Rev William Farr, the vicar of Welton. The school was named after him when he died in 1955. The old former wartime buildings were replaced in 1960. Comprehensive The school acquired comprehensive status in 1972, whilst Brian Sawyer (BA) was the headmaster. The sports hall was built in 1974, and the sixth form added in 1995. In 2000 William Farr signed up for the latest education initiative, Technology College status. The school is also an associate school of the University of Lincoln. Queen Elizabeth II visited the school in 1996 to open a new Humanities building. In 2001 William Farr achieved the distinction of having the best comprehensive school A-level results in England. The school changed its Technology College status in 2007, to become a Science College. It gained Grant Maintained status in 1992. This latter scheme was later abolished, but the school became a foundation school, a similar arrangement, in 1999. Academy The school became an independent academy on 1 January 2011 although head teacher Paul Strong, prior to his retirement in August 2011, stated he did not want to rename the school; it kept its full title, William Farr Church of England Comprehensive School.

Rick develop in the south of Mexico on October 15, Rick traversed an area favoring rapid intensification, allowing it to become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression. An eye began to form during the afternoon of October 16; once fully formed, the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening. During the afternoon of October 17, the storm attained Category 5 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Several hours later, Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906 mbar (hPa; 26.75 inHg). After maintaining this intensity for several hours, Rick began to weaken in response to a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear. By October 19, the storm was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane and the following day to a tropical storm. The long-anticipated northeast turn took place near the end of this phase, also accompanied by a brief decrease in forward motion. On October 21, Rick quickly moved northeast, brushing the tip of Baja California Sur before making landfall near Mazatl√°n with winds of . Several hours after moving inland, the final advisory from the NHC was issued as the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated. Prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initially forecast Rick to make landfall in southern Baja California as a high-end Category 2 hurricane, prompting hurricane watches. Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened. Overall, the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated. In Mexico, three people were killed by the storm, one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur. Meteorological history Hurricane Rick originated from a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on October 3, 2009. Convective activity was initially sparse as the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By October 8, an area of low pressure developed within the disturbance wave and convection increased. The low eventually moved over South America and dissipated on October 11\\\\. The wave, however, remained well-defined and continued westward, entering the Pacific Ocean on October 12. By the morning of October 15, the wave began to regain convection and eventually spawned a new area of low pressure roughly south-southwest of Puerto √Ångel, Mexico. By the afternoon, the NHC reported that the system had become increasingly organized and was likely to develop into a tropical depression later that day. Around 11:00 am PDT (1800 UTC), the NHC declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression, the 20th of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. The storm featured well-developed outflow in all directions. Environmental conditions consisting of low wind shear, high moisture content and above average sea surface temperatures in the path of the system were exceptionally favorable for rapid development. Additionally, the storm was being steered through this region by a low- to mid-level ridge over Mexico. Six hours after being declared a depression, the system quickly intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Rick. Deep convection, an early indication of an eye forming, had begun wrapping around the center of the system. Early on October 16, a ragged eyewall began to develop and several hours later, Rick intensified into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). The rapid intensification was fueled by waters of , several degrees above average. By the evening of October 16, microwave satellite imagery depicted a well-defined eye; however, this feature was not present on infrared images. Despite this, the NHC upgraded Rick to a Category 2 hurricane with winds now reaching 100 mph (155 km/h). Early the next morning, the storm intensified into a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. The eye was clearly visible on satellite images and deep, very cold convection surrounded it, signifying a powerful cyclone. Less than 40 minutes after this upgrade, the NHC issued a special advisory stating that Rick had further strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane. alt=Satellite photograph of a sprawling, mature storm with a pronounced eye at the center and curving rainbands. The southern Baja California peninsula protrudes from the north. Continuing to gain strength, Rick attained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) several hours later on October 17\\\\. A possible outer eyewall, a second eye larger than the first that often forms at the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle, was noted at this time. The eye of the storm became very well-defined and nearly cloud free, measuring roughly in diameter. In addition to the rapid intensification, Rick was also growing in size. By the afternoon hours, tropical storm-force winds extended up to from the center of the storm, with a maximum gale diameter of . At 3:10 pm PDT (2210 UTC), the NHC issued its second special advisory for Rick, this time stating that the storm had become a Category 5 hurricane, the first in the basin since Hurricane Kenna in 2002. Around 8:00 pm PDT (0300 UTC on October 18), Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record. Maximum sustained winds in the eyewall reached an estimated 180 mph (285 km/h) and the barometric pressure is estimated to have bottomed out at . The pressure was not directly measured by Hurricane Hunter aircraft because the storm was too far from land at the time. Lixion Avila, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC, described Rick's satellite presentation at this time as \\"spectacular.\\" Rick maintained its peak intensity for roughly two hours between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm PDT (0200 and 0400 UTC) on October 17, before it began to weaken in response to an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear. Throughout the day, deep convection around the eye warmed slightly and a combination of dry air and wind shear restrained the extent of the storms' outflow to the west. The combination of these factors imparted steady weakening. Later that day, Rick began to turn towards the northwest as the subtropical ridge north of the system began to weaken. Early on October 19, Rick degraded to a Category 3 hurricane as it began its approach to the southern end of the Baja California peninsula. Wind shear and dry air quickly entered the core of the system, with the eye disappearing from satellite imagery later that morning. During the evening of October 19, the center of Rick became devoid of convective activity, resulting in the NHC downgrading it to a tropical storm. According to meteorologists at the NHC, the weakening was \\"...almost as fast as it strengthened several days ago.\\" The first Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the storm took place during the afternoon of October 20\\\\. During the mission, sustained winds of and a surface pressure of were recorded. Several hours after this, convection rapidly increased, with a large area of deep convection developing northeast of the center of circulation; however, this was not associated with intensification. Around 7:00 am PDT (1400 UTC) on October 21\\\\. Tropical Storm Rick made landfall near Mazatl√°n with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Following landfall, the storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression and roughly seven hours after moving inland, the surface circulation of Rick dissipated over the high terrain of Mexico. Preparations alt=Satellite image of a more poorly organized and less intense storm. Thunderstorms no longer surround the center, and are instead concentrated on the northeastern side of the circulation. The hurricane is approaching land. Officials in Oaxaca shut down beaches and warned people not to venture out into the water. Residents were advised of potentially heavy rainfall. Along coastal areas of Mexico, specifically around Acapulco, officials closed ports to small crafts due to rough seas. Residents around the city were also warned about the possibility of mudslides from heavy rain associated with the cyclone's outer bands. Upon Rick's intensification to a Category 4 hurricane, officials in Mexico raised the alert level in Guerrero, Jalisco and Michoac√°n to severe. In Sonora, the local government placed 14 municipalities under a blue alert, the pre-storm phase; the alert was upgraded to a yellow alert for the municipalities of √Ålamos, Benito Ju√°rez, Navojoa, Etchojoa and Huatabampo on October 18. Early on October 19, the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for areas of Baja California Sur between Santa Fe and San Evaristo. Following the issuance of the watch, authorities in the region began planning to open shelters and begin evacuating residents from low-lying areas. Later that day, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning as Rick weakened to a tropical storm. By October 20, a new tropical storm watch was issued for mainland Mexico for areas between El Roblito and Altata. Shortly after, officials had opened nine shelters in the region; however, schools remained open until further notice. Later in the day, the tropical storm warning for Baja California was discontinued while the watch for mainland Mexico was upgraded to a warning. This warning was later discontinued on October 21 as Rick dissipated over the mountains of Mexico. Several cruises were affected by the storm throughout southern Baja California. The Carnival Splendor made a sudden docking as the storm formed and delayed its arrival in Cabo San Lucas by several days. The Carnival Spirit, scheduled to dock in Acapulco on October 21, delayed its arrival until October 22\\\\. The Sapphire Princess rescheduled its course, remaining near San Francisco, California, for several additional days instead of traveling south. The Norwegian Star skipped its planned docking in Cabo San Lucas and remained at sea until the passage of Rick. Other cruises affected by the storm include Radiance of the Seas, Mariner of the Seas, MS Veendam and MS Statendam. Impact and aftermath=Mexico alt=A beach is battered by choppy seas from an offshore storm and overcast, dark skies hang overhead. Schools throughout southern Sinaloa were closed for two days beginning on October 21 due to the arrival of Tropical Storm Rick. Residents in low-lying areas were urged to evacuate due to both storm surge and fresh water flooding from the anticipated of rain. Although several hundred miles from land, wind gusts up to 40 mph (65 km/h) were felt along coastal areas in Mazatl√°n. Near the coast of Oaxaca, large seas capsized a boat carrying three people. Two of the passengers were rescued; however, the third was found dead. Large swells killed one person along the southern end of Baja California Sur on October 19. Another fatality took place in the same region after a boy was swept away from an eroded beach. Roughly 320 people near Cabo San Lucas were evacuated due to the threat of flooding. Reports near the city also indicated that there was structural damage and significant traffic issues from rain-induced mudslides. In Mazatl√°n, near where Rick made landfall, high winds downed trees and signs, leaving numerous residents without power. Heavy rain was also reported during the passage of the storm. Throughout Mexico, damage from Rick amounted to 192 million pesos ($14.6 million USD). On December 29, the Government of Mexico allocated 381 million pesos (US$29.6 million) to assist in recovery from both Hurricanes Jimena and Rick. United States Although no longer a tropical cyclone, remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States. Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana. Further north, the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada. In Louisiana, the storm system spawned seven tornadoes, two of which were ranked as EF-1. One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10 structures, destroyed a grain silo, flipped a tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power. In all, the tornadoes left nearly $1 million in losses and injured one person. In Texas, the remnants of Rick produced torrential rainfall, peaking at within a concentrated area. Meteorologists did not anticipate the severity of the precipitation in this area. One person was killed after being swept away in her Jeep on a flooded roadway. Several homes were also flooded during the event and an estimated 300 homes were left without power. Following the floods, numerous roads were closed and some schools had delayed openings. Throughout the state, flood damage amounted to $690,000, with most of this being in Travis County. Heavy rainfall in Louisiana contributed to widespread flooding that resulted in the closure of several major highways. In Union Parish, rainfall exceeding led to flash flooding that inundated several homes and a local school, inflicting over $100,000 in damage. Records and intensity forecasts On October 17, Hurricane Rick was classified a Category 5 hurricane, becoming the first in the eastern Pacific basin since Hurricane Kenna in 2002 and the first east of the International Date Line since Hurricane Ioke in 2006. The storm also became the thirteenth cyclone of this intensity east of the International Date Line since official records in the Eastern Pacific began in 1949. Shortly after being upgraded to Category 5, Rick attained its peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of , making it the second-strongest hurricane ever recorded in the East Pacific, surpassing Kenna. Only Hurricane Linda of 1997 was stronger than Rick, with minimum pressure of . Hurricane Patricia in 2015 later far surpassed both Rick and Linda, attaining a pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg). It also became the second storm in the basin to have sustained winds of or higher, the first being Linda with winds. Patricia surpassed both with winds. Upon being declared a tropical depression on October 15, computer forecasting models already anticipated the likelihood of rapid intensification due to the unusually favorable environmental conditions ahead of the system. The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF) showed the storm attaining a minimum pressure below 900 mbar (hPa; 26.58 inHg), an intensity not attained by any Eastern Pacific hurricane on record at the time. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) rapid intensification index, a storm's probability of intensifying by or more within 24 hours, was set at 60%. This percentage quickly increased to 82% several hours later, 11 times higher than the sample mean. The official forecast from the NHC by their second advisory stated that Rick would become a Category 4 hurricane by October 19; however, they mentioned that due to the favorable environment, the storm could intensify faster than forecast. Once Rick had become a Category 2 storm on October 16, the NHC increased their forecast peak intensity to , a mid-range Category 4 hurricane. The first mention of Rick possibly becoming a Category 5 hurricane was in the seventh discussion released by the NHC on October 17\\\\. In their advisory, it was noted that the storm had a 10% chance of reaching this intensity within 36 hours. Several hours after this advisory was released, a special update advisory was issued. This new advisory placed the peak intensity of Rick just below Category 5 status, with maximum winds of . It was not until the late morning hours of October 17 that the NHC officially anticipated the storm to attain Category 5 status. Upon attaining winds of , Rick was forecast to peak with winds of , which would have tied the record (at the time) intensity set by Hurricane Linda.

She wrote the 1975 book Why Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her Life.  Early life and career  Rose Rehert was born on June 22, 1929, in Baltimore, Maryland. Her parents were Eastern European immigrants Israel and Fannie Gravitz Rehert, both of whom died by the time she was 10 years old. As a child, she aspired to a career as a physician, but her family was unable or unwilling to send her to college. After high school she worked at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine from 1947 to 1951 and took pre-med courses at Baltimore Junior College in 1949.Kushner, Rose. Papers, 1953-1990, Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, July 1999 In 1951 she married Harvey Kushner and had three children, born between 1952 and 1958. She returned to college in the 1960s, changing her concentration to journalism, and in 1972 receiving an A.B. degree summa cum laude from the University of Maryland. In the late 1960s and early 1970s she did medical writing and freelance journalism work, including work in Bolivia and Vietnam, as well as coverage of the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Breast cancer advocacy After Rose Kushner's June 1974 discovery of a cancerous lump in her breast, breast cancer became the focus of her life. On the basis of her library research into breast cancer treatment, she objected to the treatment which was then standard, in which a tumor biopsy and radical mastectomy were performed in a single surgical operation while the patient was under anesthesia. However, she had difficulty finding a doctor who would perform a diagnostic biopsy and allow her to decide what action to take next. After a biopsy determined that her tumor was cancerous, she resisted the then-standard radical mastectomy procedure, in which muscle tissue and lymph nodes were removed along with the breast. In order to have a less invasive procedure, she traveled from her Kensington, Maryland home to Buffalo, New York, where she had found a doctor (Dr. Thomas Dao) who was willing to do a modified radical mastectomy.Judith Rosenbaum, Rose Kushner, Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. Retrieved October 5, 2009 As Kushner recovered from her surgery, she started writing about her experiences with breast cancer. She was outspoken in her criticism of Betty Ford's September 1974 treatment for breast cancer, using personal connections in Washington, DC, in an unsuccessful effort to convince the First Lady not to undergo a one-step biopsy and radical mastectomy. After being told that \\"the President has made his decision\\" (regarding his wife's medical treatment) she railed against the \\"male-chauvinist-piggery\\" represented by that statement, writing in a letter: \\"That statement has got to be engraved somewhere as the all-time sexist declaration of no-woman rights.\\" Her first major article on the topic of breast cancer was published in The Washington Post on October 6, 1974. She traveled to Europe to learn about breast cancer treatment there, finding that the radical mastectomy was not used as widely as in the United States. Upon her return home, she started a book about the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer, completing the manuscript in just seven weeks. The book, published in 1975 under the title Breast Cancer: A Personal History and Investigative Report, contained extensive medical information and advice for patients, including strong criticism of radical mastectomies and the practice of performing a biopsy and a mastectomy as a one-step surgical procedure. In her critique of prevalent medical practices she used rhetoric familiar to the 1970s feminist movement, with statements such as \\"No man is going to make another impotent while he's asleep without his permission, but there's no hesitation if it's a woman's breast.\\"Barron H. Lerner (2003), The breast cancer wars: hope, fear, and the pursuit of a cure in twentieth-century America, Oxford University Press US, , The book was strongly endorsed by Dr. Dao, who had conducted research on breast cancer treatment and had performed Rose Kushner's surgery, but it was widely criticized by other doctors and the American Cancer Society. In 1975 Kushner and Dorothy Johnston, established a telephone hotline called the Breast Cancer Advisory Center, based in Kensington, Maryland, that operated until 1982, responding to calls and letters from thousands of women wanting information about breast cancer and its treatment. The center's establishment was motivated in part by Kushner's desire to promote patient self-help and mutual support, thus displacing the medical profession and the American Cancer Society from their roles as information \\"gatekeepers\\".Anne S. Kasper and Susan J. Ferguson (2001), Breast Cancer: Society Shapes an Epidemic, Palgrave Macmillan, , , page 327 Kusher became a relentless critic of the treatment of breast cancer by the medical profession. She attended numerous meetings of medical professionals, interrupting presentations, questioning conclusions, and speaking against the prevalent practices of one-step breast cancer surgery and radical mastectomy. In 1975 she was \\"booed off the stage\\" at a meeting of the Society of Surgical Oncology, whose members objected to her challenges to traditional treatments. In spite of her unpopularity with the mainstream medical profession, Kushner's work was well received in the public and won increasing respect in official circles. In June 1977, she was the only lay member appointed to a ten-member National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel that evaluated treatment options for primary breast cancer. In 1979, the panel issued its findings, concluding that the Halsted radical mastectomy should no longer be the standard treatment for suspected cases of breast cancer, instead recommending total simple mastectomy as the primary surgical treatment. Additionally, Kushner convinced her fellow panel members to include a statement calling for an end to the one-step surgical procedure. At the time of her death, Dr. Bruce A. Chabner of the National Cancer Institute said she was \\"probably the single most important person\\" in ending the practice of one- step surgery for breast cancer, because of her persistence and because she brought medical information to a wide public audience that otherwise might have remained unaware of the options. Following her service on the NIH panel, President Jimmy Carter appointed Kushner to the National Cancer Advisory Board as the board's first lay member, and she was engaged by the NIH to review grant applications. She took pleasure in the fact that she was working within the system, joking \\"I'm a full-fledged member of the Establishment.\\" After Kushner's cancer recurred in 1981, she refused chemotherapy, which she considered to be unacceptably toxic, and was treated with tamoxifen. In the 1980s she campaigned against aggressive use of chemotherapy. In a 1984 article \\"Is Aggressive Adjuvant Chemotherapy the Halsted Radical of the '80s?\\" she suggested that chemotherapy was being used as indiscriminately as radical mastectomy surgery had been in earlier decades, saying that doctors gave insufficient attention to the serious side effects of chemotherapy, and calling chemotherapy \\"therapeutic overkill.\\"Barron H. Lerner, Ill Patient, Public Activist: Rose Kushner's Attack on Breast Cancer Chemotherapy, Bulletin of the History of Medicine, Volume 81, Number 1, Spring 2007, pp. 224-240Kushner, Rose (1984), Is Aggressive Adjuvant Chemotherapy the Halsted Radical of the '80s?, CA Cancer J Clin 1984; 34:345-351. Barron Lerner has suggested that the vehemence of her attack on chemotherapy may have reflected a conflict of interest, related both to her personal interest in the implications of her own decision to refuse chemotherapy and a \\"close working and financial relationship with the manufacturers of tamoxifen.\\" She continued to advocate for the interests of breast cancer patients for the rest of her life. In 1986 she was a cofounder of the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, an umbrella organization on whose board she served from 1986 to 1989. In 1989 she was appointed to the Breast Cancer Task Force of the American Cancer Society. Up until a few days before her death in 1990, at the age of 60, she was actively lobbying for the U.S. federal government to require health insurance to cover mammograms.Barron H Lerner (2001), No shrinking violet: Rose Kushner and the rise of American breast cancer activism, The Western Journal of Medicine, 174(5): 362‚Äì365; May 2001  Works  The following are among Rose Kushner's published writings: * Kushner, Rose (1977), Why Me?

It is a pin mold that is characterized by erect sporangiophores (specialized hyphae that bear a sporangium) that are simple in structure, brown or yellowish-brown in color, and with branched aerial filaments that bear the zygospores. It grows as a parasitic mold on mushrooms, including several species from the genera Mycena, including M. haematopus, M. pura, M. epipterygia, M. leptocephala, and various Collybia species, such as C. alkalivirens, C. luteifolia, C. dryophila, and C. butyracea. It has also been found growing on agaric species in Amanita, Gymnopus, and Hygrophorus. Taxonomy The species was first described by German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1818 as Mucor rhombosporus, but he later conceded to making a mistake in examining the spores. Link later suggested the name Mucor fusiger for the species, and it has been known under a variety of names, such as Mucor macrocarpus, Phycomyces agaricicola, Spinellus macrocarpus, and Spinellus rhombosporus. It was assigned its current name by French botanist Philippe √âdouard L√©on Van Tieghem in 1875. Description During the reproductive phase of its life cycle, Spinellus fusiger grows throughout the cap of the mushroom host, eventually breaking through to produce radiating reproductive stalks (sporangiophores) bearing minute, spherical, terminal spore-containing structures called sporangia. Ultimately, the spores in the sporangia are released after the breakdown of the outer sporangial wall, becoming passively dispersed to new locations via wind, water, and insects. The sporangia contain non-motile mitospores known as aplanospores. Like other Spinellus species, S. fusiger is homothallic, a condition where sexual zygospores can be produced union of branches from the same mycelium and so can be produced by the growth from a single spore.

The film starts with an examination of Evita Duarte's origins, her relationship with her parents (particularly her father) and siblings. Evita approaches intimate aspects of Duarte's early childhood and adolescence, leading to her resolving to flee her home in the countryside for the capital city of Buenos Aires. The latter segments of the film are highlighted by interviews with former teachers from her elementary schooling in Junin. Throughout the film, the director is reminding the audience of the domestic and international context out of which Evita Duarte emerged, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the facts. The second act of the film concludes with her funeral in Buenos Aires. The third act exposes the macabre plot to have Evita Peron's corpse disappear, and looks at the curious series of events leading to the exchange of cadavers between the so-called Peronist youth and the military regime.

Specifically it is used to try to prevent periods of worsening rather than for those periods themselves. It is used by inhalation through the mouth. Onset typically begins within half an hour and lasts for 24 hours. Common side effects include a dry mouth, runny nose, upper respiratory tract infection, shortness of breath and headache. Severe side effects may include angioedema, worsening bronchospasm, and QT prolongation. Tentative evidence has not found harm during pregnancy, however, such use has not been well studied. It is an anticholinergic medication and works by blocking acetylcholine action on smooth muscle. Tiotropium was patented in 1989, and approved for medical use in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than nine million prescriptions. There is no generic version available in the United States as of 2019.  Medical uses  Tiotropium is used as maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Pocket Guide to COPD Diagnosis, Management and Prevention [Internet] Fontana, WI The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2020 [Cited 12/04/2020] Available from: https://goldcopd.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/03/GOLD-2020-POCKET-GUIDE-ver1.0_FINAL-WMV.pdf It may also be used as an add-on therapy in people with moderate-to-severe asthma on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It is not however approved for acute exacerbations of COPD or acute worsening of asthma. Tiotropium is also used in a combination inhaler with olodaterol, a long-acting beta- agonist, for the treatment of COPD, under the trade names Stiolto and Spiolto.  Adverse effects  Adverse effects are mainly related to its antimuscarinic effects. Common adverse drug reactions (‚â•1% of people) include: dry mouth and/or throat irritation. Rarely (<0.1% of patients) treatment is associated with: urinary retention, constipation, acute angle closure glaucoma, palpitations (notably supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) and allergy (rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis). A 2006 review found the increase in bronchospasm was small and did not reach statistical significance. Data regarding some serious side effects is mixed as of 2020. In September 2008 a review found that tiotropium and another member of its class ipratropium may be linked to increased risk of heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death. The US FDA reviewed the concern and concluded in 2010 that this association was not supported. A 2011 review of the tiotropium mist inhaler (Respimat); however, still found an associated with an increase in all cause mortality in people with COPD.  Mechanism of action  Tiotropium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, often referred to as an antimuscarinic or anticholinergic agent. Tiotropium has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3-receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. Although it does not display selectivity for specific muscarinic receptors, when topically applied it acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells and submucosal glands. This leads to a reduction in smooth muscle contraction and mucus hyper-secretions, and thus produces a bronchodilatory effect. The terminal half-life of tiotropium in COPD patients following once daily inhalation of 5 mcg tiotropium was approximately 25 hours. Society and culture Tiotroprium is available in two inhaler formats: a soft mist inhaler (Respimat) and a dry powder inhaler (HandiHaler). The safety and efficacy profiles of both devices are comparable and people's preference should play a role in determining inhaler choice. There is no significant difference in all-cause mortality between tiotropium soft mist inhalers compared to dry powder inhalers, however caution needs to be taken in people with severe heart or kidney problems.

It is taken by mouth two to three times per day with food or given by injection into muscle once every 8 to 12 weeks, depending on individual response. Side effects of testosterone undecanoate include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, hypertension, elevated liver enzymes, hypertiglyceridemia, and increased sexual desire. The drug is a prodrug of testosterone, the biological ligand of the androgen receptor (AR) and hence is an androgen and anabolic steroid. It has strong androgenic effects and moderate anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculinization and suitable for androgen replacement therapy. Testosterone undecanoate is a testosterone ester and a prodrug of testosterone in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of testosterone. Testosterone undecanoate was introduced in China for use by injection and in Europe for use by mouth in the 1970s. It became available for use by injection in Europe in the early to mid 2000s and in the United States in 2014. As of 2019, a formulation for use by mouth has been approved in the United States - Jatenzo. Along with testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate, testosterone undecanoate is one of the most widely used testosterone esters. However, it has advantages over other testosterone esters in that it can be taken by mouth and in that it has a far longer duration when given by injection. In addition to its medical use, testosterone undecanoate is used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. Medical dosage Testosterone undecanoate is used in androgen replacement therapy. It is specifically approved only for the treatment of hypogonadism.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/022219s000lbl.pdf As an intramuscular injection, it is administered at a dosage of 1,000 mg once every 12 weeks. Conversely, oral testosterone undecanoate must be taken two or three times a day with food. Side effects Side effects of testosterone undecanoate include virilization among others. Anaphylaxis The Reandron 1000 formulation (Nebido in the United States) contains 1,000 mg of testosterone undecanoate suspended in castor oil with benzyl benzoate for solubilization and as a preservative, and is administered by intramuscular injection. As an excipient in Reandron 1000, benzyl benzoate has been reported as a cause of anaphylaxis (a serious life-threatening allergic reaction) in a case in Australia. Bayer includes this report in information for health professionals and recommends that physicians \\"should be aware of the potential for serious allergic reactions\\" to preparations of this type. In Australia, reports to the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC), which evaluates reports of adverse drug reactions for the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), show several reports of allergic reactions since the anaphylaxis case from 2011. Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics Testosterone undecanoate is a prodrug of testosterone and is an androgen and anabolic‚Äìandrogenic steroid (AAS). That is, it is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Pharmacokinetics Testosterone undecanoate has a very long elimination half-life and mean residence time when given as a depot intramuscular injection. Its elimination half-life is 20.9 days and its mean residence time is 34.9 days in tea seed oil, while its elimination half-life is 33.9 days and its mean residence time is 36.0 days in castor oil. These values are substantially longer than those of testosterone enanthate (which, in castor oil, has values of 4.5 days and 8.5 days, respectively). Testosterone undecanoate is administered via intramuscular injection once every three months or so. Chemistry Testosterone undecanoate, or testosterone 17Œ≤-undecanoate, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is an androgen ester; specifically, it is the C17Œ≤ undecylate (undecanoate) ester of testosterone. A related testosterone ester with a similarly very long duration is testosterone buciclate. History In the late 1970s, testosterone undecanoate was introduced for oral use in Europe, although intramuscular testosterone undecanoate had already been in use in China for several years. Intramuscular testosterone undecanoate was not introduced in Europe and the United States until much later, in the early to mid 2000s and 2014, respectively. Testosterone undecanoate was approved in the United States after three previous rejections due to safety concerns. Society and culture=Generic names Testosterone undecanoate is the generic name of the drug and its and . It is also referred to as testosterone undecylate. Brand names Testosterone undecanoate is or has been marketed under a variety of brand names, including Andriol, Androxon, Aveed, Cernos Depot, Jatenzo, Nebido, Nebido-R, Panteston, Reandron 1000, Restandol, Undecanoate 250, and Undestor. Availability Intramuscular testosterone undecanoate is available in the United States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere in the world. It is approved in over 100 countries worldwide. Oral testosterone undecanoate is available in Canada, Europe, Mexico, Asia, and elsewhere but not in the United States. Intramuscular testosterone undecanoate is marketed most commonly as Nebido in Canada and Europe and as Aveed in the United States while oral testosterone undecanoate is marketed most commonly as Andriol. Legal status Testosterone undecanoate, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act and a schedule IV controlled substance in Canada under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Research=Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis In 2013, a phase II clinical trial testing intramuscular testosterone undecanoate for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was initiated in the United Kingdom.Testosterone Replacement in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (TEREPINS) (TEREPINS) In the United States in 2018, Lipocine Inc. began investigating the potential of using an oral testosterone undecanoate formulation, known as LPCN-1144, in patients with NASH.Lipocine Inc. - Clinical Trials Oral testosterone undecanoate Recently, two different oral formulations of testosterone undecanoate were developed for the treatment of hypogonadism in the United States. On March 27, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Jatenzo (testosterone undecanoate), an oral testosterone capsule to treat men with certain forms of hypogonadism.

In 1976, following another passion, he walked 1,000 miles across Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming to help raise awareness of conservation issues for the World Wildlife Fund. On this journey his photographs, radio and television interviews were his introduction to a world of media co-operation that would steer his next thirty years in environmental activism. In 1979 he volunteered as a photographer on board the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior during its Icelandic anti-whaling campaignTime Europe, 9 July 1979 where he first met Allan Thornton, Greenpeace's director at the time. In 1983, while he was working in public relations photography and teaching, Thornton persuaded him to join another anti-whaling ship, \\"Balaenoptera\\". With Jennifer Lonsdale, another Greenpeace veteran, they carried out undercover work in the Norwegian port of Vado, posing as journalists to gain entry to whaling factories. They were able to truthfully insist they were not working for Greenpeace as the factory workers feared, but knew it was unwise to state they were on an independent environmental activist ship. The campaign was incredibly successful resulting in a two-thirds reduction in whaling quotas and huge embarrassment for the Norwegian government.\\"How it all began\\", article by Dave Currey in EIA 25 years book, EIA 2009 From 1978 to 1986 he often contributed to Wildlife magazine and later when it became BBC Wildlife, for a while being their \\"roving naturalist\\" to places such as the Everglades National Park,\\"Exploring the Everglades, by Dave Currey, Wildlife, April 1981 Yellowstone National Park,\\"Yellowstone\\" by Dave Currey, Wildlife Magazine, July 1982 and Baja California, Mexico.\\"Whales ‚Äì from Brighton to Baja\\" by Dave Currey, Wildlife Magazine, July 1981 He also acted as a book and television reviewer for the magazine.

During this time he fronted many campaigns, co- authoring an account of the ivory investigation with Allan Thornton in their book \\"To Save An Elephant\\". After 1995 he remained on the board and on staff and concentrated on building new campaigns, most notably to protect the Indian tiger (1995‚Äì1999)\\"India trip 1995\\", Currey, an EIA Internal Report, 1995 and then rainforests in Indonesia (1999‚Äì2007). He was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Medal by the Animal Welfare Institute with Allan Thornton in 1990 for their work protecting elephants and dolphins.Schweitzer Medalists EIA was awarded the Global 500 Roll of Honor by UNEP for \\"outstanding contributions to the protection of the environment\\" in 2001.  Working undercover  Since the investigation in Vado in 1983 he has led teams all over the world. His teams' findings include uncovering wild primates smuggled to British laboratories from Gambia, massive mortalities in wild birds caught for pets in Senegal. From 1987‚Äì1989 he was undercover in Dubai and Ajman (UAE), Tanzania, Kenya, Singapore and Hong Kong posing as a journalist, photographer, tourist or ivory dealer. His work helped uncover the trade routes and dealers in poached ivory. In 1987 he was famously hoisted, with cameraman Clive Lonsdale, on a forklift truck crane to the top shelf of a warehouse in Dubai to photograph the neighbouring unit. Through a small hole cut in the cardboard packing case they filmed for 45 minutes the poached ivory being worked in the Poon brothers clandestine ivory factory. The documentation proved crucial in unravelling the ivory pipeline and EIA's successful launch of a campaign for an international ivory ban achieved in 1989. His undercover experiences span twenty five years. For instance he has been stopped by the South African Police wanting the name of an informant he could not divulge. In Guyana and Senegal he can no longer operate undercover, having been threatened in the former with a gun. During the ivory investigations he was checking his car for bombs after credible warnings.Animal Detectives press pack, Carlton UK Television, March 1995 He has stated that it can get dangerous, especially with multiple covers when working in the same country but he has a strong sense when to get out of a bad situation.The Guardian \\"Good Lives\\" 6 June 2006  Whaling  He has witnessed and photographed the killing of fin whales in Iceland minke whales in Norway and hundreds of pilot whales and dolphins in the Danish Faroe Islands.The Whale Butchers, Sunday Mirror, 5 April 1987 He investigated the killing of dall's porpoise in their tens of thousands in Japan. In his role for EIA he has attended the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meetings as a delegate, had his photographs published widely and written numerous reports.\\"The Fight to cut the nets of death\\", Plus Magazine 26 September 1990 At one IWC meeting in 1990 EIA needed a resolution on small whales and dolphins to be proposed but sought a country to do this. When he heard the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was due to appear on television just before him, he let the UK know. It made the difference and the UK, wishing to look good on television proposed the resolution. Currey was able to praise the move.  Elephants and the ivory trade  In 1989 Currey, using his considerable first-hand knowledge of the international ivory trade, took Desmond Hamill, senior foreign correspondent with Independent Television News (ITN), to Tanzania and the UAE. They filmed the ivory room in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and flew to Selous Game Reserve to film anti-poaching units in the field. In the UAE they confronted one of the ivory dealers, George Poon, outside his secret Ajman factory. The first time he had been filmed. ITN put together three News Specials broadcast on 10, 11 and 12 May 1989 which had a powerful impact on the public, the UK government and other organisations. This was the perfect launch to EIA's campaign for an ivory ban achieved later the same year after the release of an explosive report, by Currey and Thornton, packed with evidence of the international ivory trade: naming names, describing routes, quoting dealers from hidden recordings and blowing apart many of the pro-trade arguments with documented evidence. When attempts to reverse the ban were clearly to be made, Currey travelled with a companion to Zimbabwe in November 1991, the pro-trade's main proponent. They uncovered corruption, illegal trade and the brutal death of Capt Nleya, a Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) officer who had reported poaching, smuggling and cattle rustling by the ZNA in Mozambique and along the Zimbabwe border, to the Under Secretary in the Defence Ministry. A hand-written note on 4 January 1989 from Capt Nleya to his wife, photographed by Currey as evidence, alleged he had been \\"collected by Special Investigations Branch and Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) members.... Foul play is expected.... \\" On 12 March his decomposed body was found under a tree behind Hwange army barracks. A rope was hanging over a branch above his corpse. The next day CIO officers came to see his wife at her home and threatened to kill his brothers. On 14 March 1989 she was informed his body had been found. They uncovered other suspicious deaths of officials who attempted to expose the ZNA's involvement in elephant and rhino poaching. Currey and his companion were followed during this investigation.\\"Under Fire, elephants in the front line\\", Austin, Currey, Galster, Reeve, Thornton and Watts, EIA Report, Jan 1992, He co-authored a report on the success of the ivory ban in 1994.\\"Living Proof\\" by Dave Currey & Helen Moore, EIA Report Sept 1996 Currey has represented EIA as a delegate at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) on a number of occasions. In 2015 he started blogging, most notably on the renewed poaching crisis for African elephants and the ivory trade.Dave Currey's blog  The wild bird trade  He has investigated the trade in wild-caught birds for pets in Argentina, Bolivia, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guyana, and Senegal. He was central to co-operation between EIA, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in a joint campaign to ban the wild bird trade. EIA's provision of evidence and startling photographs and film footage, and his personal experience in the field, gave him an important role with these much larger organisations.The Wild Bird Trade, Investigations reports from Africa, South America and South-east Asia, EIA, RSPB, RSPCA, 1991 He led an investigations team in Senegal in 1986 which uncovered every stage of the trade, from capture to export, in the exporting country. Senegal was the world's biggest exporter of wild-caught birds. They estimated 20 million wild birds were caught annually for the export trade, 50% dying before export. Once the air transport and quarantine mortalities were considered, they estimated four out of five wild-caught birds died before sale to the public. The footage and photographs were used widely around the world and formed the basis of EIA's and other organisations' campaigns for years to come.\\"The Trade in Live Wildlife\\", by Nick Carter and Dave Currey, EIA report, 1987 In November 1991 to promote the bird campaign and shoot new material for a National Geographic documentary, he led a three-person team to Argentina. They documented the trail of capture to export of the blue-fronted amazon parrot. It revealed extreme cruelty, illegality, conservation failures and high unreported mortalities.\\"Flight to Extinction\\" by Bowles, Currey, Knights, Michels, EIA and Animal Welfare Institute Feb 1992 Within a year of the film showing, the Argentinian quota was set to zero.Voyager ‚Äì National Geographic ‚Äì Dead on Arrival British Film Institute Further parrot trade was uncovered by Currey leading the same team in Ghana and C√¥te d'Ivoire in West Africa. Co- operating with the Ghanain authorities they tracked grey parrots caught illegally in Ghana being moved to neighbouring C√¥te d'Ivoire where they were \\"legalised\\" by corrupt officials for export. This investigation became part of a television documentary shown all over the world and additionally resulted in the arrest, set up by Currey and his team, of a Ghanain parrot dealer in the capital Accra.British Film Institute One of the greatest successes of the EIA wild-caught bird campaign was persuading over 70 airlines to voluntarily stop carrying wild birds.\\"Airline Embargoes Save Hundreds of Thousands of Wild Birds\\" EIA Briefing 1992  Indian tiger conservation  Currey carried out an in depth research trip to India in 1995, meeting conservationists, government officials, villagers and assessing if EIA could have a useful role in tiger conservation. The government was in denial over poaching, some wildlife wardens denied poaching to save face, conservationists and indigenous groups quarrelled. With strong advice from a group of trusted wildlife experts he put EIA's international campaign at the forefront of forcing government to face its failures and reconvene the Indian Board for Wildlife, chaired by the Prime Minister which had not met for eight years. In October 1996 Currey launched a new EIA report in London, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Kolkata with a hard hitting video public service announcement and video news release.\\"The Political Wilderness\\" , by Dave Currey, EIA Report 1996 \\"The Political Wilderness\\" report re-emerged in the media in different ways for over a year and helped revitalise discussion on tiger conservation in India. The Indian Board for Wildlife was reconvened.\\"Wildlife board: Gowda to face Maneka\\", The Tribune, Chandigarh, 14 March 1997 Whilst researching the report, Currey was taken to the Indian state of Assam by Sanjay Deb Roy, a former chief wildlife warden for Assam and later, for India. He had retired but was still active and the two men became friends. Deb Roy took Currey to Manas Tiger Reserve where armed insurgents had closed the park. Poachers moved relatively freely. Deb Roy had been instrumental in setting up this reserve while chief wildlife warden. In Kaziranga the situation was different. Brave forest guards risked their lives to protect tigers and one-horned rhinoceros from heavily armed poachers. But they needed equipment, salaries and uniforms.\\"The Thin Green Line\\" by Brian Jackman, UK Telegraph Magazine, 19 October 1996. EIA launched Currey's photographic skills documented the plight of Kaziranga National Park and illustrated the problems faced in Assam in a hard-hitting article in the UK's Daily Telegraph Magazine. EIA launched an appeal guaranteeing that everything raised would be spent on the park. Through this appeal EIA spent over ¬£80,000 on essentials and boosted staff morale. The campaign continued with a further report published to identify the problems for tigers in the Indian State of Madhya Pradesh following research in the state.\\"The State of the Tiger\\", Debbie Banks & Dave Currey, EIA Report Currey stood back after this to let his colleague, Debbie Banks, continue the work.  The timber trade and orang-utans  In 1998 Currey led a team to Indonesia to document illegal logging and assess EIA's international role. They met with many local and national NGOs and struck up a close relationship with Telapak who they continue to work in partnership.Telapak www.telapak.org They travelled to Kalimantan where forest fires were raging and a million hectares of forest was being destroyed in a misguided government scheme to grow rice on acidic peat. They revealed it was an excuse to gain timber and lucrative construction contracts, so prevalent at that time.\\"The Investigator\\", EIA newsletter Autumn 1998 With his team Currey decided to focus the campaign on the destruction of Tanjung Puting National Park in Central Kalimantan and Gunung Leuser National Park in Sumatra, both vital orang-utan habitat. The high-profile species assisted in communicating the problems of commercial illegal logging. He visited both places, helped film and photograph illegal logging, as well as undercover work in Kalimantan to identify the head of the timber mafia.\\"The Final Cut\\" , EIA Report, Newman, Currey, Ruwindrijarto, Hapsoro. Aug 1999 It was a difficult time with one staff member of Telapak and one from EIA being kidnapped while investigating the timber baron Abdul Rasyid. Currey oversaw the rescue mission devoting tens of thousands of dollars of campaign funds to get them safely out of Kalimantan.\\"The Timber Mafia\\" , ABC, The kidnap gave EIA and Telapak publicity on which they built their campaign, successfully pushing through a ban on Indonesian ramin timber species,\\"The Ramin Racket\\" , Lawson, EIA Report, Sept 2004 a main target for Rasyid's empire, and reaching powerful figures in the Indonesian government, including its President.EIA website, http://www.eia- international.org/cgi/news/news.cgi?t=template&a;=86&source;= \\"Legislator Abdul Rasyid accused of illegal logging\\" , Jakarta Post, 15 November 2001 Perhaps the most significant move came in 2001 in Bali when governments gathered and, in the wake of the 9/11 attack the same week, agreed the Bali Declaration to renew efforts to protect forests. Currey and his team had been important catalysts to this change in international direction and although most governments did not live up to their agreement it provided a springboard to unilateral action in the US, the UK, Japan, the European Union and exporting countries such as Indonesia.World Bank Currey helped his team build strong and close relationships with local NGOs by securing grants for their participation from the UK's Department for International Development and the EU.\\"Building the capacity of NGOs to work on illegal logging\\", DFID, 2000\\"Improving Governance of Forest Resources and reducing illegal logging and associated trade with full civil society participation in SE Asia\\" TFBL -EU  Other campaigns  As executive director of EIA up to 1995 (and board member afterwards) Currey has been involved in most EIA campaigns. This includes marine turtle conservation in Sri Lanka, a ban on ozone-depleting substances, the environmental threats to whales and dolphins and a campaign to stop the use of rhinoceros horn in Taiwan.EIA website  Visual training for activists  In 1998 when Currey returned from witnessing the forest fires in Borneo and working with local NGOs he developed an EIA programme, with a donor's support, to train local activists in the use of cameras and video. He helped develop this by securing a grant from the UK's Department for International Development. This pioneering work has empowered over 100 Indonesian NGOs in the use of visual evidence in campaigning. It also enabled a local environmental radio station to stay on air after its aerial was hit by lightning as well as the setup of a television station in Sulawesi. This training has since developed into one of EIA's core programmes.  Documentary films and other media  In his role as EIA's spokesperson for two decades Currey has fronted dozens of press conferences and been interviewed hundreds of times on television, radio and for newspapers. His undercover background has sometimes provided comical copy such as \\"They giggled, kissed and held hands just like any other honeymoon couple. But each night they slept back to back. For Dave Currey and Lydia Swart were no ordinary newlyweds. They were ecodetectives....\\"\\"For the love of dolphins\\", Daily Mirror, 5 July 1990 He has even been immortalised in a cartoon showing his confrontation with ivory trader Mr Poon.\\"Raiders of the Green Ark\\" cartoon, Daily Telegraph, 19 January 1991 Besides using his professional photographic skills, Currey has filmed a great deal of video for EIA and commercial productions. He has also co- produced seven film documentaries shown on prime time British television (ITV) as the series Animal Detectives.Animal Detectives Each programme showed EIA undercover operations on a particular species. Currey led four teams in the series and it boosted all the campaigns. In particular, the film on marine turtle (tortoise-shell) smuggling from the Maldives to Sri Lanka brought quick arrests and enforcement, helping to protect the hawksbill turtle in the region.Animal Detectives ‚Äì turtles This series produced with Paul Cleary and Goldhawk Media won a British Environment and Media Award for best film, the Brigitte Bardot International Genesis Award (Los Angeles), and the Gold Plaque at the Chicago Documentary Film Festival. Currey appeared on Discovery Channel in the US making a speech when receiving the Genesis Award. Animal Detectives was also shown on Animal Planet Channel. Two other television series benefited from the footage and investigations carried out by Currey and his crew. They are Wildlife Detectives produced by Murphy Entertainment and shown throughout the worldhttp://www.fancast.com/tv/Wildlife- Detectives/92649/episodes/season/-1 and a three part series on Germany's RTL2 channel.Fahrte des Todes Teil, RTL2, 2 June 1995 He also co-produced and wrote (with Allan Thornton) a film Let Them Live about EIA broadcast by the BBC in the UK.Let Them Live, BBC Open Space Series, 6 April 1987 Currey's friendship with Paul Cleary from Goldhawk Media with whom Animal Detectives was made had previously resulted in three other major documentaries made with EIA's full co-operation with Currey taking the lead EIA role. They were two National Geographic Voyager series films Dead on Arrival and Wildlife DetectivesBritish Film Institute and a BBC Nature Special Whale Wars.British Film Institute In addition two films were made entirely around Currey: Deadline 2000Channel 4 TV, British Film Institute and A New WorldRAI TV (Italy) Dreamtime Productions, Dec 1995 Currey appears as one of the investigators in a film broadcast in 2011 on Nat Geo Wild in the US and UK and other territories called Blood Ivory Smugglers. Blood Ivory documentary 2011  Photography and writing  His photographic professionalism has provided EIA with considerable media opportunities. The most notable photo spreads using his images have appeared in the Sunday Times Magazine,\\"Kenya's Bloody Ivory\\", Sunday Times Magazine, 26 February 1989\\"Sing a Song of Sadness\\", Sunday Times Magazine, 12 April 1987\\"Death Drive\\", Sunday Times Magazine, 8 June 1986 The Telegraph Magazine, and Life magazine.\\"The Big Picture ‚Äì double page spread \\"Blood Sport in the Atlantic\\", Life, Oct 1986 His photographs have also illustrated articles (linked to EIA campaigns) he has written for magazines including World magazine,\\"Faroes ‚Äì trade or tradition\\", Dave Currey, World Magazine, Sept 1987 Country Life magazine,\\"Trail of Death\\", Dave Currey, Country Life, 3 May 1990 BBC Wildlife\\"The redtail sting\\", Dave Currey, BBC Wildlife magazine, Nov 1993, and The Scotsman magazine.\\"Blood Hunt\\", Dave Currey, Scotsman Magazine April 1987 In addition to writing and co-writing a plethora of reports over years, Currey has contributed to many newspapers and magazines.

The granite outcrops of the Seychelles Islands in the central Indian Ocean were amongst the earliest examples cited by Alfred Wegener as evidence for his continental drift theory. Ridge‚Äìplume interactions have been responsible for separating a thinned continental sliver from a large continent (i.e. India). The granites of the Seychelles Microcontinent were emplaced 750 Ma, during the late Precambrian. Thermally-induced rifting in the Somali Basin and transform rifting along the Davie Fracture Zone began in the late Permian 225 million years ago, with Gondwana supercontinent beginning to break up in the Middle Jurassic (about 167 million years ago) when East Gondwana, comprising Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and Australia, began to separate from Africa; East Gondwana then began to separate about 115‚Äì120 million years ago when India began to move northward. The Seychelles Islands then underwent two more stages of rifting to isolate it from Madagascar and India. Between 84‚Äì95 million years ago rifting separated Seychelles/India from Madagascar. An initial period of transform rifting moved the Seychelles/India block northward. At 84 million years ago oceanic crust started to form in the Mascarene Basin, causing a rotation of the Seychelles/India land mass. This continued until 66 million years ago when new rifting severed the Seychelles from India forming the currently active Carlsberg Ridge. The rift jump coincided with the maximum output of the Deccan Traps, and volcanics found on the Seychelles Plateau have also been linked with this event. This has led to suggestions that the initiation of the Reunion plume caused rifting to jump to its current location.

Heinrich Alexander (from 1841 Freiherr) von Arnim(-Suckow) (born 13 February 1798 in Berlin; died 5 January 1861 in D√ºsseldorf) was a Prussian statesman. Arnim received his education in the P√§dagogium in Halle, then in 1814 joined the cavalry of the Landwehr of the Uckermark and fought with five brothers in the War of the Sixth Coalition. He joined the Prussian civil service in 1820, he was at first an embassy attach√© in Switzerland, then a legation secretary in Munich, Copenhagen and Naples and was made charg√© d'affaires in Darmstadt in 1829. There, he successfully worked towards the creation of the Zollverein, after which he was made an Expert Councillor (Vortragender Rat) in the Foreign Ministry in 1834. However, Frederick William IV, with whom he was in close personal contact, made him an envoy in Brussels in 1840, and in Paris in 1846. In these positions he earned much credit through resolutely defending German trade interests, namely by bringing about the Belgo-Prussian trade agreement of 1 September 1844 and through the determination with which he confronted the prevailing protectionist attitudes, publicly and officially as well as through his work Mein handelspolitisches Testament (translation: My Legacy in Trade Policy) (Berlin 1844). After the end of the July Monarchy (February 1848), he hurried to Berlin and on 17 March handed the King a memorandum, in which he advocated liberal reforms and the pursuing of a German national policy. He was behind the King's momentous declaration of support for the German cause (21 March). On the same day he took office as Foreign Minister of Prussia in the government that was led first by Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg, then by Gottfried Ludolf Camphausen; this government already resigned on 20 June, however. Arnim then lived for a while as a private citizen in Neuwied and endeavored to work towards a moderate solution to the German question, through various pamphlets (Frankfurt und Berlin, Frankfurt 1848; √úber die Mediatisationsfrage, Frankfurt 1849). He was a member of the first chamber of the Prussian Parliament from 1849 to 1851, and supported the German- Constitutional party. He vigorously opposed the domestic as well as the feeble foreign policy of the now victorious reactionaries in the most dynamic way possible. An even greater impression than his speeches and petitions was made by the publication of various \\"undelivered\\" speeches (Zur Politik der Epigonen in Preu√üen, Berlin 1850; Zur Politik der Konterrevolution in Preu√üen, Berlin 1851). Due to this last pamphlet Arnim was prosecuted in court at the instigation of the feudal party, and despite a stellar defence that he later published, he was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine. After that he stayed clear of the political stage, until after the downfall of the government of Otto von Manteuffel in 1858 he was elected by a Berlin constituency to the Landtag. His sickliness however prevented him from devoting his whole energy to the new era of Prussian public life that was then just beginning. He died on 5 January 1861 in D√ºsseldorf. A broad body of knowledge, worldly wisdom and frankness secured him a significant personal reputation from early on.

When Sternberg presented her with a screenplay entitled Backwash that incorporated experimental camera techniques and in which she would play a blind girl, Pickford declined it. M-G-M assigned Sternberg, now under an eight-movie contract, to direct a more conventional project, The Exquisite Sinner.Sarris, 1966. P. 10, 12Baxter, 1993. P. 54Weinberg, 1967. P. 24 Pre-production The Exquisite Sinner, Sternberg's first commercial feature, would be meticulously vetted by MGM: ‚ÄúIn 1924, the year in which it was formed, Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer ‚Ä¶possessed a sophisticated system for accessing stories‚Äù monitoring every stage of production from story to the screen. Escape - the working title during production ‚Äì was based on a novel by the same name by Alden Brooks, a romance set in France just after the end of the First World War. MGM reviewers regarded the novel as ‚Äúhighly dramatic, but slight‚Äù that could be made into ‚Äúa beautiful and compelling picture.‚Äù Sternberg presented the studio with ‚Äúa continuity sketch‚Äù (i.e. ‚Äútreatment‚Äù) based on the work...and scriptwriter Alice Duer Miller submitted ‚Äúa screenplay of 120 scenes based on the novel.‚Äù MGM's estimate of Sternberg's sketch was positive, with a caveat: ‚Äúrefreshing‚Ä¶it seems to be directed toward [a] pictorial treatment rather than a logical and consistent development of the story.‚Äù Baxter, 1993. P. 55 Sternberg flew to Quebec, Canada to gather a sense of French Canadian ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù.Baxter, 1971. P. 33 Production The Exquisite Sinner was filmed in Hollywood during February 1925.Baxter, 1993. P. 54-55 Robert Florey, the films assistant director, provides a sketch of Sternberg's on-set persona in the journal Hollywood d'hier et d'aujourd'hui. Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer had recently endured the ‚ÄúTeutonic tantrums‚Äù exhibited by director Erich von Stroheim during the filming of The Merry Widow and were not amused by Sternberg's histrionics.Baxter, 1971. P. 15 As the production proceeded, studio executives began to doubt Sternberg's commitments to satisfying their expectations of a commercial success. Despite Sternberg's eccentricities, Florey regarded the completed film as cinematically advanced in photographic technique, describing the movie as ‚Äúfull of interest‚Äù and exhibiting ‚Äúthe humor of which Sternberg was a master.‚Äù When MGM reviewed the ‚Äúfinished version‚Äù, the film was deemed ‚Äúphotographically and pictorially [impressive]...But it is in vain we look for the theme of the story.‚Äù An MGM staff reader considered it ‚Äúwell worthwhile to reconstruct the story and the picture‚Äù through re-editing, as well as ‚Äúinjecting some vital sequences.‚Äù After a rigorous re-working and a new title - The Exquisite Sinner - the film was previewed to a test audience in March 1925 and ‚Äú[poor] audience reaction‚Ä¶was a serious blow to the production.‚Äù The preview seems to have been ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù in determining MGM's decision not to release the film. Despite the considerable investment ‚ÄúThe Exquisite Sinner was put on hold.‚Äù Studio executives hoped ‚Äúto make it into something [appealing] to a mass audience.‚Äù Their ambivalence towards the picture would result in ‚Äútwo versions of the film [screenplays] that MGM was eventually to make and release by 1927.‚Äù By the time The Exquisite Sinner had been pulled ‚ÄúSternberg had already moved to The Masked Bride, the project that would prompt him to walk out on MGM in the summer of 1925‚Äù after just two weeks. His replacement, Christy Cabanne, would garner sole directorial credit for the Mae Murray feature.Baxter, 1993. P. 55-56Baxter, 1971. P. 34Weinberg, 1967. P. 24-25 In an effort to salvage The Exquisite Sinner, ‚ÄúMGM set its veteran director Phil Rosen to work on a second version of the film‚Ä¶using the same stars.‚Äù This demonstrates that the studio was in a position financially and organizationally to delay release of a major production and ‚Äúin the meantime entirely rescript and reshoot the film under another director in an attempt to produce a certain profit-earner.‚ÄùBaxter, 1993. P. 57 The movie was re-scripted as ‚Äúa bittersweet wartime romance, the studio hoping to emulate the success of King Vidor‚Äôs The Big Parade (1925), which also starred Ren√©e Ador√©e in a romance with a young Frenchman. As a result ‚ÄúMGM had two films on its shelf that shared a [story] source, a title and their stars. It is not clear if the Rosen film also made use of any footage that Sternberg shot in 1925.‚Äù Rosen's version was re-titled ‚ÄúHeaven on Earth...a farce comedy...told on screen in a brisk and logical manner which unifies the plot and holds the attention of the audience‚Äù according to an MGM reviewer. The second film was released in 1927, after a number retakes.Weinberg, 1967. P. 24: The Rosen remake \\"mercifully forgotten.\\" Film historian John Baxter describes the Hollywood studio system that was emerging when Sternberg was beginning to make commercial features: Critical Response As The Exquisite Sinner was never released to the general public, the ‚Äúreception‚Äù to the film is limited to studio employees involved in the production and to film historians. Writing in the early 1930s documentary filmmaker and critic John Grierson defended the film and its director: \\"He made a fine picture for Metro called The Exquisite Sinner and had been heaved off the payroll for adding some genuine local color to the Breton scene.\\" The National Board of Review, despite the film's poor performance and Sternberg's own misgivings, selected The Exquisite Sinner as among the top forty best pictures of 1926. Preservation status SilentEra says a copy of the film is in the Turner Entertainment Co. archives.Progressive Silent Film List: The Exquisite Sinner at silentera.com It is rumored that the Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment archives holds a full print of this film, but as of 2014, no print has surfaced.

Rifting in the Somali Basin began at the end of the Carboniferous 300 million years ago, as a part of the Karoo rift system. The initiation of Gondwana breakup, and transform faulting along the Davie Fracture Zone, occurred in the Toarcian (about 182 million years ago) following the eruption of the Bouvet (Karoo) mantle plume. At this time East Gondwana, comprising the Antarctic, Madagascar, Indian, and Australian plates, began to separate from the African Plate. East Gondwana then began to break apart about 115‚Äì120 million years ago when India began to move northward.Plummer, P. S., and E. R. Belle (1995), Mesozoic tectono‚Äìstratigraphic evolution of the Seychelles microcontinent, Sedimentary Geology, 96, 73‚Äì91. Between 84‚Äì95 million years ago rifting separated Seychelles and India from Madagascar. Since its formation the Madagascar block has moved roughly in conjunction with Africa, and thus there are questions as to whether the Madagascar Plate should be still considered a separate plate. Assembly of Gondwana Madagascar was formerly located in the central part of the supercontinent Gondwana. It contains part of the East African Orogen, which formed in the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian assembly of the Gondwana. This heavily influenced the geology of central and northern Madagascar.Collins, Alan S., and Brian F. Windley. \\"The tectonic evolution of central and northern Madagascar and its place in the final assembly of Gondwana.\\" The Journal of Geology 110.3 (2002): 325‚Äì339. The entire island can be divided into four tectonic and geologic units:Wit, Maarten J. de. \\"Madagascar: heads it's a continent, tails it's an island.\\" Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences 31.1 (2003): 213‚Äì248. the Antongil block, the Antananarivo block, the Bekily Belt in the south, and the Bemarivo Belt in the far north. *The Antongil Block is characterized by a 3.2 Ga gneiss intruded by granite that has undergone greenschist facies metamorphism. *The Antananarivo Block contains 2.5 Ga gneiss layered with younger granitoids and gabbros. It has metamorphosed to granulite facies conditions. *The Bemarivo Belt contains two regions, metasedimentary gneisses in the southern part and granitic domes in the north. *The Bekily Belt is made up of mostly sedimentary protoliths and granulite and upper amphibolite grade gneisses. The blocks in the northern part of the island are made up of Archean cratonic material. The Antongil block has been linked with the Dharwar Formation of India, however the Antananarivo block to the west has been too heavily altered to link easily to another continent. The central part of the island contains metasediments from African and Indian continental shelves. This is the Itremo Group, which also contains intrusions of material from the Antongil block. The Itremo sheet was folded in the amalgamation of Madagascar ~700 Mya, and now contains upright folds, divergent reverse faults, and strike-slip faults. Rifting The Madagascar plate experienced two major rifting events during the break-up of Gondwana. First, it separated from Africa about 160 Mya (million years ago), then from the Seychelles and India 66‚Äì90 Mya.Kusky, Timothy M., Erkan Toraman, and Tsilavo Raharimahefa. \\"The Great Rift Valley of Madagascar: An extension of the Africa‚ÄìSomali diffusive plate boundary?.\\" Gondwana Research 11.4 (2007): 577‚Äì579. The first rifting event, separation from Somalia and the rest of Africa, caused displacement along the Davie Ridge, in the Mozambique Channel to the west of the islands, a now extinct transform. The rifting is also associated with extensive deformation as well as volcanism in the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic (Eocene to Miocene). The second separation caused volcanism in the southern part of the island as well as further south, such as on Marion Island. The volcanism was so extensive that in the late Cretaceous Madagascar may have been entirely covered in flood basalts from volcanism associated with this second rifting event. It was at this point in the end of the Cretaceous that Madagascar became entirely isolated from any other continent. Modern tectonics Madagascar remains seismically and volcanically active. The most seismically active area is beneath the Ankaratra Plateau in the centre of the island, which experienced magnitude 5.2 and 5.5 earthquakes in 1985 and 1991. The Aloatra-Ankay rift to the north of the plateau is also seismically active, as well as the Davie Ridge off the coast, which is an extension of the East African Rift Zone.Grimison, Nina L., and Wang‚ÄêPing Chen. \\"Earthquakes in the Davie Ridge‚ÄêMadagascar region and the southern Nubian‚ÄêSomalian plate boundary.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (1978‚Äì2012) 93.B9 (1988): 10439-10450. The Ankaratra Plateau contains a major volcanic field with volcanic cones and extensive flows. It was active from the Neogene to the Quaternary. To the northwest, there are the recently active Comoro Islands, which are hypothesized to be related to a hot spot. The Madagascar plate now moves mostly in conjunction with the African plate, so some believe it should not be still considered an independent plate.

Typically, narcissistic parents are exclusively and possessively close to their children and are threatened by their children growing independence.Stephen E. Levich, Clone Being (2004) p. 31 and p.89-91 This results in a pattern of narcissistic attachment, with the parent considering that the child exists solely to fulfill the parent's needs and wishes.David Stafford & Liz Hodgkinson, Codependency (London 1995) p. 41 A narcissistic parent will often try to control their children with threats and emotional abuse. Narcissistic parenting adversely affects the psychological development of children, affecting their reasoning and their emotional, ethical, and societal behaviors and attitudes.(2015, Apr. 27 ). In Wikipedia. Retrieved Apr. 27, 2015, from http://hciresearch4.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/~rfarzan/APSWI- Patrick/stage/site/searcharticles.php?title=Parenting%20styles. Personal boundaries are often disregarded with the goal of molding and manipulating the child to satisfy the parent's expectations.Banschick M.D., M. (2013, March 13). The Narcissistic Father. Retrieved April 29, 2015, from https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201303/the- narcissistic-father. Narcissistic people have low self-esteem and feel the need to control how others regard them, fearing that otherwise they will be blamed or rejected and their personal inadequacies will be exposed. Narcissistic parents are self-absorbed, often to the point of grandiosity. They also tend to be inflexible, and lack the empathy necessary for child raising. Characteristics The term ‚Äúnarcissism,‚Äù as used in Sigmund Freud‚Äôs clinical study, includes behaviors such as self-aggrandizement, self-esteem, vulnerability, fear of losing the affection of people and of failure, reliance on defense mechanisms, perfectionism, and interpersonal conflict.Raskin, Robert, and Howard. Terry. (1988). A Principal-Components Analysis of the Narcissistic Personality. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 54 (5), PP 890-902 To maintain their self-esteem and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists seek to control the behavior of others, particularly that of their children whom they view as extensions of themselves.Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.Co-Narcissism: How We Accommodate to Narcissistic Parents. The Therapist, 2005. Thus, narcissistic parents may speak of \\"carrying the torch\\", maintaining the family image, or making the mother or father proud. They may reproach their children for exhibiting weakness, being too dramatic, being selfish, or not meeting expectations. Children of narcissists learn to play their part and to show off their special skill(s), especially in public or for others. They typically do not have many memories of having felt loved or appreciated for being themselves. Instead, they associate their experience of love and appreciation with conforming to the demands of the narcissistic parent.Boyd, R. How Early Childhood Oedipal Narcissistic Development Affects Later Adult Intimacy and Relationships 2011 Destructive narcissistic parents have a pattern of consistently needing to be the focus of attention, exaggerating, seeking compliments, and putting their children down.Simon Crompton, All about Me: Loving a Narcissist (London 2007) p. 120 Punishment in the form of blame, criticism or emotional blackmail, and attempts to induce guilt may be used to ensure compliance with the parent's wishes and their need for narcissistic supply. Children of narcissists Narcissism tends to play out intergenerationally, with narcissistic parents producing either narcissistic or co-narcissistic children in turn.Simon Crompton, All about Me: Loving a Narcissist (London 2007) p. 119 While a self-confident parent, or good-enough parent, can allow a child his or her autonomous development, the narcissistic parent may instead use the child to promote his or her own image.Salman Akhtar, Good Feeling (London 2009) p. 86 A parent concerned with self-enhancement, or with being mirrored and admired by their child,Heinz Kohut, How Does Analysis Cure? (London 1984) p. 183 may leave the child feeling like a puppet to the parent's emotional/intellectual demands.Joseph Glenmullen, Prozac Backlash (New York 2000) p. 278 and p. 266 Children of a narcissistic parent may not be supportive of others in the home. Observing the behavior of the parent, the child learns that manipulation and guilt are effective strategies for getting what he or she wants. The child may also develop a false self and use aggression and intimidation to get their way.Lynne Namka, Ed.D. Selfishness and narcissism in Family Relationships.. Instead, they may invest in the opposite behaviors if they have observed them among friends and other families. When the child of a narcissistic parent experiences safe, real love or sees the example played out in other families, they may identify and act on the differences between their life and that of a child in a healthy family. For example, the lack of empathy and volatility at home may increase the child's own empathy and desire to be respectful. Similarly, intense emotional control and disrespect for boundaries at home may increase the child's value for emotional expression and their desire to extend respect to others. Although the child observes the parent's behavior, they are often on the receiving end of the same behavior. When an alternative to the pain and distress caused at home presents itself, the child may choose to focus on more comforting, safety-inducing behaviors. Some common issues in narcissistic parenting result from a lack of appropriate, responsible nurturing. This may lead to a child feeling empty, insecure in loving relationships, developing imagined fears, mistrusting others, experiencing identity conflict, and suffering an inability to develop a distinct existence from that of the parent.McBride, K. (2008). The Empty Mirror. Will I Ever Be Good Enough?: Healing the Daughters of Narcissistic Mothers. p. 18. Sensitive, guilt-ridden children in the family may learn to meet the parent's needs for gratification and seek love by accommodating the wishes of the parent. The child's normal feelings are ignored, denied and eventually repressed in attempts to gain the parent's ‚Äúlove‚Äù. Guilt and shame keep the child locked in a developmental arrest. Aggressive impulses and rage may become split off and not integrated with normal development. Some children develop a false self as a defense mechanism and become codependent in relationships. The child's unconscious denial of their true self may perpetuate a cycle of self-hatred, fearing any reminder of their authentic self. Narcissistic parenting may also lead to children being either victimized or bullies, having a poor or overly inflated body image, tendency to use and/or abuse drugs or alcohol, and acting out (in a potentially harmful manner) for attention.Pinsky, Drew, S M. Young, and Jill Stern. The Mirror Effect: How Celebrity Narcissism Is Seducing America. New York: Harper, 2009 Short term and long term effects Due to their vulnerability, children are extremely affected by the behavior of a narcissistic parent. A narcissistic parent will often abuse the normal parental role of guiding their children and being the primary decision maker in the child's life, becoming overly possessive and controlling. This possessiveness and excessive control disempowers the child; the parent sees the child simply as an extension of themselves. This may affect the child's imagination and level of curiosity, and they often develop an extrinsic style of motivation. This heightened level of control may be due to the need of the narcissistic parent to maintain the child's dependence on them. Narcissistic parents are quick to anger, putting their children at risk for physical and emotional abuse. To avoid anger and punishment, children of abusive parents often resort to complying with their parent's every demand. This affects both the child's well-being and their ability to make logical decisions on their own, and as adults they often lack self confidence and the ability to gain control over their life. Identity crisis, loneliness, and struggle with self expression are also commonly seen in children raised by a narcissistic parent. The struggle to discover one's self as an adult stems from the substantial amount of projective identification that the now adult experienced as a child. Because of excessive identification with the parent, the child may never get the opportunity to experience their own identity. Mental health effects Studies have found that children of narcissistic parents have significantly higher rates of depression and lower self-esteem during adulthood than those who did not perceive their caregivers as narcissistic. The parent's lack of empathy towards their child contributes to this, as the child's desires are often denied, their feelings restrained, and their overall emotional well- being ignored. Children of narcissistic parents are taught to submit and conform, causing them to lose touch of themselves as individuals. This can lead to the child possessing very few memories of feeling appreciated or loved by their parents for being themselves, as they instead associate the love and appreciation with conformity. Children may benefit with distance from the narcissistic parent. Some children of narcissistic parents resort to leaving home during adolescence if they grow to view the relationship with their parent(s) as toxic.

The episode originally aired on October 16, 2009 on Syfy in the United States, followed by being aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on October 20. The episode was directed by Peter DeLuise, who had previously directed episodes of both Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. However, he had not worked on the Stargate franchise for the previous two years. The episode was written by Brad Wright who co-wrote the pilot episode. In the episode, the crew have to deal with a loss of power, which deactivates every system except for life support and basic emergency lighting in a few sections. The episode was watched by nearly 2.1 million viewers. Most of the episode was shot on-set at The Bridge Studios, with a few scenes shot off-set for Young's visit with his wife. Plot As everyone settles in aboard the Destiny, Colonel Young (Louis Ferreira) begins arranging meetings with the crew to work on various supply issues, and to give everyone something to do. Interspersed throughout the episode, Eli Wallace (David Blue) uses a Kino to record short video messages from the crew in case they don't survive. Meanwhile, Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) is busy trying to keep the ship running, while sleep deprivation combined with nicotine and caffeine withdrawal make him increasingly short- tempered. Young tries to have someone assist Rush to get an idea of what Rush is doing, but Rush angrily dismisses help. As Young comes in to check himself, Destiny shuts down, leaving only life support systems active. An increasingly frantic Rush explains that Young's attempt to dial back to Earth in \\"Air\\" and the crew's haphazard attempts to access the ship's systems drained most of the ship's already low power reserves, and that power cannot be restored. He eventually suffers a nervous breakdown and collapses. Young uses the communication stones to contact Earth while everyone else works on the problem. David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips) switches places with him, and is dismayed at Young's apparent mishandling of the situation, seeking to have him replaced. Young returns after speaking with his wife, cutting Telford off in the middle of an attempt to relieve Young of duty. The crew then learn that the ship dropped out of faster-than-light travel just outside a system with several potentially habitable planets, and has plotted a course that will use a nearby gas giant to slingshot itself deeper into the system. The episode ends with Rush's and Lieutenant Scott's (Brian J. Smith) realization that the Destiny is on course to fly into the star. Production The episode was originally titled \\"Fire\\" and was a single stand alone episode, however producers decided to make it into a two-part episode as the original story took it 20 minutes over the episodes time frame. The episode was shot at both The Bridge Studios on stages 2 and 4 (Destiny set), whilst the Earth scenes were shot out of studio and feature Ona Grauer as Emily Young, Everett Young's wife. Reception \\"Darkness\\" gathered a total of 2.099 million live viewers, making it the second most-watched program on Syfy, behind Ghost Hunters. The episode dropped 14% from previous episode, \\"Air (Part 3)\\". On Sky1 in the United Kingdom the episode was watched by 635 thousand viewers in total. Rob Vaux of Mania.com reacted negatively towards the episode, saying \\"Universe emphasizes the struggle to survive out in the depths of space, but ship breakdowns and unexpected course corrections into the heart of a sun are already wearing out their welcome\\". Carl England of Den of Geek was far more positive, praising the visual effects and writing his desire to see the conclusion; \\"I am highly impressed with this week's installment, and am impatiently awaiting the arrival of episode five, which should, hopefully, prove to be as remarkable as this week's, if not more so\\". IGN's Ramsey Isler said the series started to feel like \\"crisis of the week show that oftentimes lacks any real sense of urgency\\". Negative towards writing of the episode, Isler said \\"This could have possibly been a chance to inject a little horror- style storytelling into the series, but instead we get nothing more than constant bickering mixed with some very depressed characters and slow pacing\\". The episode was given 7.4 out of 10. Jane Boursaw from TV Squad was positive towards the episode, saying it reminded her of the now canceled American science fiction series, Firefly.

Lara, 541 U.S. 193 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court landmark case which held that both the United States and a Native American (Indian) tribe could prosecute an Indian for the same acts that constituted crimes in both jurisdictions. The Court held that the United States and the tribe were separate sovereigns; therefore, separate tribal and federal prosecutions did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.United States v. Lara, (hereinafter cited as Lara). In the 1880s, Congress passed the Major Crimes Act, divesting tribes of criminal jurisdiction in regard to several felony crimes. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled in Duro v. Reina that an Indian tribe did not have the authority to try an Indian criminally who was not a member of that tribe. The following year, Congress passed a law that stated that Indian tribes, because of their inherent sovereignty, had the authority to try non- member Indians for crimes committed within the tribe's territorial jurisdiction. The defendant, Billy Jo Lara, was charged for acts that were criminal offenses under both the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe's laws and the federal United States Code. Lara pleaded guilty to the tribal charges, but claimed double jeopardy against the federal charges. The Supreme Court ruled that double jeopardy did not apply to Lara since \\"the successive prosecutions were brought by separate and distinct sovereign bodies\\"., (2008).  Background = History  1892 Map of Spirit Lake Reservation, then known as Devil's Lake Reservation The Sioux people consist of three main groups, the Lakota in the west, the Western Dakota in the center, and the Eastern Dakota in the east. In the east, the Santee was originally from the Minnesota area. The Chippewa or Ojibwe people were also from the same general area. The two tribes had been at war from at least 1736, (1990); , xvi, 15 (2011). and by 1750 the Chippewa had forced the Santee to the west into the prairie., at 37; , at xvi-xvii, 15. The war between the tribes continued until at least the 1850s., at 77. Only after 1862, when the Santee rose up against the whites and were subsequently removed to the Dakota Territory, did the fighting cease., at 77. In 1872, the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of the Santee signed a treaty that resulted in their moving to the Spirit Lake Reservation.  Major Crimes Act  Crow Dog Originally, crimes committed by Indians against Indians were not subject to federal or state jurisdiction, but were handled by tribal law. In 1881, a Brul√© Lakota named Crow Dog shot and killed another Indian, Spotted Tail, on the Great Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Crow Dog was tried in federal court for murder, found guilty, and sentenced to hang. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Crow DogEx parte Crow Dog, . the Supreme Court found that the federal government did not have jurisdiction to try the case. Crow Dog was ordered released, having made restitution under tribal law to Spotted Tail's family. In response to Ex Parte Crow Dog, Congress passed the Major Crimes Act in 1885.Major Crimes Act of 1835, March 3, 1885, (codified as amended as et seq.). The Act provided that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over certain Indian-on- Indian crimes when the crimes were committed in \\"Indian country.\\" et seq.; Allison M. Dussias, Heeding the Demands of Justice: Justice Blackmun's Indian Law Opinions (1995). In 1886, the Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in United States v. Kagama.United States v. Kagama, .  Duro v. Reina  In 1990, the Supreme Court held in Duro v. ReinaDuro v. Reina, . that an Indian tribe did not have jurisdiction to try an Indian of another tribe.Duro, 495 U.S. at 694; , at 45. Tribal leaders urged Congress to fix the problem that the Duro decision created., at 47. In 1991, Congress amended the Indian Civil Rights ActIndian Civil Rights Act of 1968, April 11, 1968, (codified as amended at ). (ICRA) to recognize that Indian tribes had inherent power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians., at 47; , at 187. This legislation became known as the \\"Duro fix\\",Alex Tallchief Skibine, United States v. Lara, Indian Tribes, and the Dialectic of Incorporation 47 (2004‚Äì2005) (hereinafter cited as Skibine, Dialectic; Elizabeth Burleson, Tribal, State, and Federal Cooperation to Achieve Good Governance, (2007); , (2010). and was based on tribal sovereignty rather than a federal delegation of power., (2005).  Arrest  Billy Jo Lara was an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians located in northern North Dakota near the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border.Skibine, Dialectic, at 51. The Spirit Lake Reservation is approximately south of the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. Lara had married a member of the Spirit Lake Santee tribe and had resided on the Spirit Lake Reservation with her and their children until he was banished from the reservation due to several serious misdemeanors., (2007); , at 153. Lara returned to the reservation, where he was arrested and charged with public intoxication. After the arrest, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officer Bryon Swan took Lara to the police station where Lara was informed of a Sioux order excluding him from the reservation. Lara then struck Swan, who as a BIA officer was considered both a tribal officer and a federal law enforcement officer.United States v. Lara, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20182 (D.N.D. 2001) aff'd, 294 F.3d 1004 (8th Cir. 2002) on rehearing en banc, 324 F.3d 635 (8th Cir. 2003) rev'd, 541 U.S. 193 (2004) and rev'd, 324 F.3d 635 (8th Cir. 2003) rev'd, 541 U.S. 193 (2004).  Procedural history  Trial courts = Following his arrest, the tribal court of the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe charged Lara with assaulting the arresting officers, along with four other charges.MacKenzie T. Batzer, Trapped in a Tangled Web United States v. Lara: The Trouble with Tribes and the Sovereignty Debacle (2005); , (2009). Lara pleaded guilty to the tribal charge of \\"violence to a policeman\\". Soon after, federal prosecutors charged Lara with assault on a federal officer and a federal grand jury indicted him.Batzer, at 295. Lara moved to dismiss the charge based on double jeopardy and other constitutional grounds.Will Trachman, Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction After U.S. v. Lara: Answering Constitutional Challenges to the Duro Fix, (2005); Skibine, Dialectic, at 51; , at 781. The Federal District Court, with Magistrate Judge Alice R. Senechal sitting by consent, denied the motions and Lara entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal.Lara, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20182 at *1. Senechal noted that two other trial courts in the circuit had already ruled that double jeopardy did not apply, that the ICRA only recognized the inherent sovereignty of the tribes and did not delegate prosecutorial power to the tribe. She further noted that another circuit court had ruled the same way.Lara, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20182 at *3. Lara also argued that the Petite doctrine, if applied, would preclude his prosecution, and that since it was never applied to federal prosecutions following convictions in tribal court, it discriminated against Indians.Lara, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20182 at *3-4. Senechal denied this motion, noting that Lara had shown no examples of other races not being prosecuted for like offenses.Lara, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20182 at *4. = Court of Appeals = Lara appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court obtained its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States.United States v. Lara, 294 F.3d 1004 (8th Cir. 2002) on rehearing en banc, 324 F.3d 635 (8th Cir. 2003) rev'd, 541 U.S. 193 (2004) (hereinafter cited as Lara I). The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did.Lara I, 294 F.3d at 1006. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes.Lara I, 294 F.3d at 1006. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim.Lara I, 294 F.3d at 1007. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.Lara I, 294 F.3d at 1007‚Äì10. (Hansen dissenting). Lara then requested a rehearing en banc by the full court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed the decision of the three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy.United States v. Lara, 324 F.3d 635 (8th Cir. 2003) (en banc) rev'd, 541 U.S. 193 (2004) (hereinafter cited as Lara II). While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian.Lara II, 324 F.3d at 637-38. This meant that double jeopardy attached.Lara II, 324 F.3d at 641. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.Lara, 541 U.S. at 193.  Supreme Court = Arguments  United States = Solicitor General Ted Olson argued that Congress, in response to the Duro decision, acted to \\"recognize and affirm\\" the Indian tribe's inherent power to enforce its criminal laws against Indians of other tribes.Br. of United States 11-12, 17-18. Olson noted that the United States v. WheelerUnited States v. Wheeler, . decision clearly stated that a tribe could prosecute a tribal member for a crime and that the Federal government could subsequently prosecute for the same criminal acts without invoking double jeopardy if the actions of the accused violated Federal law.Br. of United States 15-16. Olson noted that the legislative history of the Duro fix bill clearly indicated that Congress intended to restore, not delegate, authority to prosecute non-member Indians by a tribe.Br. of United States 18-19. The government argued that the limitation in Duro was a statutory limitation of the tribe's sovereignty, not a constitutional limit, and that Congress had the authority to remove that limitation.Br. of United States 23-26. He noted that a tribe's sovereignty has allowed prosecution of non-member Indians for centuries, until it was limited by Congress.Br. of United States 31 n. 11. The United States was supported by amicus briefs filed by the State of Washington and seven other states, the State of Idaho and five other states, the National Congress of American Indians,Br. of Nat'l Cong. of Am. Indians. and eighteen Indian tribes. = Lara = Alexander F. Reichert was appointed by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian TribeOliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, . to support his argument.Br. of Lara 1-2. He stated that it was the place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe.Br. of Lara 6. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy.Br. of Lara 8-12; Skibine, Dialectic, at 51. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution in the same manner as any other citizen.Br. of Lara 13-15. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress.Br. of Lara 19-21. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen.Br. of Lara 21-22. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,Br. of Nat'l Assoc. of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation,Br. of the Citizen's Equal Rights Found. and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).Br. of Morris.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion in Lara. Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the opinion of the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty.Lara, 541 U.S. at 196; Alex Tallchief Skibine, Redefining the Status of Indian Tribes within Our Federalism: Beyond the Dependency Paradigm 667, 678 (2005‚Äì2006) (hereinafter cited as Skibine, Status). He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.Lara, 541 U.S. at 199. Breyer stated that the Indian Commerce Clause Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 3. of the United States Constitution granted Congress \\"plenary and exclusive\\" power to legislate in respect to the Indian tribes.Lara, 541 U.S. at 200; Skibine, Formalism, at 437. He noted that the Indian Treaty Clause Art. II, ¬ß 2, cl. 2. did not specifically grant Congress the right to legislate, but that treaties made pursuant to the clause could grant Congress the authority to legislate in regards to treaty matters.Lara, 541 U.S. at 201; Skibine, Status, at 678. These powers included the ability to both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions.Burleson, at 210; Skibine, Status, at 679. Congress has done both, such as in the withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination ActMenominee Termination Act of 1954, June 17, 1954, , codified at (repealed 1973). in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration ActMenominee Restoration Act of 1973, December 22, 1973, , codified at et seq. to restore tribal recognition and powers.Lara, 541 U.S. at 203. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions.Lara, 541 U.S. at 205; Burleson, at 210; Skibine, Status, at 679. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, and it is clear that Congress has the power to change that law.Lara, 541 U.S. at 207; Skibine, Status, at 678. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.Lara, 541 U.S. at 210; Skibine, Dialectic, at 51; Burleson, at 210; , at 48. Breyer noted Lara's other arguments, but as the double jeopardy issue was dispositive, he declined to address those issues.Lara, 541 U.S. at 207-09; Skibine, Dialectic, at 52. He did note that \\"we are not now faced with a question dealing with potential constitutional limits on congressional efforts to legislate far more radical changes in tribal status.\\"Lara, 541 U.S. at 205; Skibine, Status, at 682. The decision allowed both courts to prosecute Lara. Since separate sovereign bodies had filed the charges, double jeopardy did not apply to Lara's case., at 48. The decision of the Eighth Circuit Court was reversed in the 7-2 decision.United States v. Lara, (accessed on January 13, 2013).  Concurrences  Justice Clarence Thomas, author of one of the concurring opinions = Justice Stevens = Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a concurring opinion that argued that the Indian tribes have a stronger claim on inherent sovereign powers than do individual states. He noted that the Indian tribes governed themselves since before Columbus arrived, and that most states never governed themselves outside of the United States.Lara, 541 U.S. at 210-11 (Stevens concurring). = Justice Kennedy = Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a concurrence which stated that Congress was very careful to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority.Lara, 541 U.S. at 211 (Kennedy concurring). Kennedy states that is all that is needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians.Lara, 541 U.S. at 211-12 (Kennedy concurring); David M. Schraver & David H. Tennant, Indian Tribal Sovereignty‚ÄìCurrent Issues 133, 138-39 (2011‚Äì2012); Skibine, Dialectic, at 55. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the Equal Protection Clause.Lara, 541 U.S. at 212-13 (Kennedy concurring); Skibine, Dialectic, at 52 (noting that Lara should have raised these issues in the tribal court). He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.Lara, 541 U.S. at 214 (Kennedy concurring). = Justice Thomas = Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion stating that it was time to re-examine the entire concept of tribal sovereignty.Lara, 541 U.S. at 214 (Thomas concurring); Schraver, at 156 n.127. He noted that doubtful precedents stated that Congress, and not another part of the government had the power to regulate everything that a tribe could or could not do, which renders tribal sovereignty a \\"nullity.\\"Lara, 541 U.S. at 215 (Thomas concurring); Schraver, at 138 n.23; Skibine, Status, at 682. Thomas did not believe that Congress has the constitutional authority to set the \\"metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty.\\"Lara, 541 U.S. at 215 (Thomas concurring) (internal citations omitted); Skibine, Dialectic, at 58. He noted that such authority was not in the Indian Treaty Clause Art. II, ¬ß 2, cl. 2. nor the Indian Commerce Clause. Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 3. \\"In [his] view, the tribes either are or are not separate sovereigns, and our federal Indian law cases untenably hold both positions simultaneously.\\"Lara, 541 U.S. at 215 (Thomas concurring). Thomas further questioned the lawAct of March 3, 1871, , codified at . ending the practice of making treaties with the tribes, noting that this was the one clear constitutional provision that provides for dealing with other sovereigns.Lara, 541 U.S. at 215 (Thomas concurring). Thomas noted that a delegation of prosecutorial power is always to an executive branch and that the tribes are not part of any executive branch of the Federal government. Therefore, the case hinges on the tribes' inherent sovereignty, and based on precedent, the tribes possess that power.Lara, 541 U.S. at 216 (Thomas concurring).  Dissent  Justice David Souter, author of dissenting opinion Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter referenced prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama,Kagama, 118 U.S. at 375. to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland.South Dakota v. Bourland, . Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases.Lara, 541 U.S. at 226-27 (Souter dissenting). Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, the only way for the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress.Lara, 541 U.S. at 227 (Souter dissenting); Skibine, Status, at 678. Bourland was even more specific as to that point.Lara, 541 U.S. at 227 (Souter dissenting). Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.Lara, 541 U.S. at 229 (Souter dissenting). Souter wrote that this dissonance in court decisions will lead to confusion, stating: \\"And confusion, I fear, will be the legacy of today's decision, for our failure to stand by what we have previously said reveals that our conceptualizations of sovereignty and dependent sovereignty are largely rhetorical.\\"Lara, 541 U.S. at 230 (Souter dissenting); Skibine, Status, at 682. Souter concluded that he would stand by the decisions made in Duro and Oliphant.Lara, 541 U.S. at 230 (Souter dissenting).  Subsequent developments = Release of Lara  Lara was released from federal prison on August 19, 2005, about a year and four months after the Supreme Court delivered their decision.Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator: Billy Jo Lara #08061-059. Viewed July 27, 2014.  Law reviews  This case has been the subject of numerous law review articles since the decision was made. Points raised include: * Indians are very integrated across tribal boundaries, intermarrying across tribes and sharing child and medical care services across tribes. Lara was an example of this; he married a Spirit Lake Sioux woman and moved to that reservation before his exclusion by the tribe.Matthew L.M. Fletcher, American-Indian Law: United States v. Lara: Affirmation of Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction Over Nonmember American Indians, (2004). * \\"As 'domestic dependent nations,' Indian tribes possess criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country that is 'complete, inherent, and exclusive,' except as limited by Congress.\\"Fletcher, at 24; , (3d ed. 1998). * The decision enhanced tribal self-determination because tribes could act even in the presence of related federal activity.Skibine, Dialectic, at 49-50. They noted that Lara had been in numerous altercations with the tribal police at Spirit Lake for intoxication, spousal abuse, and resisting arrest. Only when the tribe ran out of options did it issue an exclusion order to bar him from the reservation.Melissa L. Tatum, Symposium: Tribal Sovereignty and United States v. Lara: Symposium Foreward, (2004); Kevin K. Washburn, Symposium: Tribal Sovereignty and United States v. Lara: Lara, Lawrence, Supreme Court Litigation, and Lessons From Social Movements, (2004). *The decision limited tribal sovereignty by affirming the ability of Congress to relax or to restrict tribal powers. The opinion of Justice Thomas was especially telling in this, as Thomas had opined that plenary power and tribal sovereignty were mutually exclusive.Lara, 541 U.S. at 193; William Bradford, Symposium: Tribal Sovereignty and United States v. Lara: Another Such Victory and We are Undone: A Call to an American Indian Declaration of Independence, (2004); Batzer, at 283; Skibine, Dialectic, at 49-50.  Books and media  The case has been widely covered in books and news media. Tribal court authority has been altered by the U.S. government for decades, affecting jurisdictional powers. In Justice Thomas's conclusion at the end of this case, he stated, \\"History points in both directions.\\" Paul McSloy, Ode to Billy Jo, The Supreme Court's latest look into Indian law , , May 17, 2004. Thomas further stated, \\"Federal Indian policy, is, to say the least, schizophrenic.\\" McSloy, supra.

It was built in 1749 for the Wordsworth family by the renowned northern architect James Paine. It is currently a private residence and has been since approximately 1995. The house, however, has served a number of purposes over the past 250 years. The building is constructed of magnesian limestone ashlar with a Westmorland slate roof. The main block is 3 by 4 bays in two storeys with attics with a later service wing attached. History The Wordsworth name appeared in the 11th century after a wave of migration was caused by the Norman Conquest of Britain in 1066. The Wordsworth Family lived in Yorkshire at 'Wadsuuorde' or Wadsworth. The English Language has only been standardised over the last few centuries and names were frequently misspelt on official documents due to illiteracy, giving a possible explanation of why the Hall and its surrounding village is called Wadworth (a variation of Wordsworth). First found in Yorkshire, the family were seated at Wadsworth, recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as 'king's land', a moorland with two churches and scattered houses. An isolated building within the village is said to be the setting of Emily Bront√´'s famous novel Wuthering Heights. The village was granted by King William to Roger de Bully (believed to be the ancestor of the Wadsworths) following the Norman Conquest of England. The estate was then passed on to the Ross family in the 19th century. James Clark Ross in the West Riding Electoral Registers of 1860, 1861 and 1862, \\"Qualification: Freehold Mansion and Land\\", \\"Place: Wadworth hall\\". After its use as a family home, it was sold to the West Riding County Council in 1957 and was transformed into a nursing home before it was then sold on to a firm of architects, who converted it into offices. In the mid 1990s, the architects downsized and Andrew Cusack moved his computing business in on part of the ground floor of the hall. A year later, the opportunity arose for Cusack to purchase the hall.

The episode originally aired on April 16, 2010 on Syfy in the United States, and on SPACE in Canada. The episode was directed by William Waring who directed two other episodes for the series. The episode was written by Denis McGrath, and this episode represents his first foray into the Stargate franchise. In this episode, the Destiny finds herself drawn to the gravity well of a sun, leading the ship off-course. However, there is no trace of the sun in the database, and as the Destiny uses a parabolic manoeuvre to correct its course which will take roughly a month, the crew uses this time to explore a habitable planet and collect supplies. Plot Destiny mysteriously exits FTL in a star system that the ship does not recognise; the seeding ships never informed Destiny of the system, and the habitable planet orbiting it. It is later revealed that the star is only 200 million years old, too young to start a system. Dr. Rush (Robert Carlyle) believes that the ship has dropped out of FTL in order to correct its course by performing a parabolic maneuver, which will take a month. In the meantime, a team uses the opportunity to explore the planet; the team finds fresh fruit, water and plants with medicinal attributes, which the expedition can take back with them. Also, during a flyover in the shuttle, Scott (Brian J. Smith) spots an artificial obelisk at least 2000 feet high. While Destiny is out of shuttle range for the next few weeks, the team on the planet settles in. Rush uses the time to explore more of the ship, where he and his team make numerous new discoveries. Adam Brody (Peter Kelamis) and Lisa Park (Jennifer Spence) repair the second shuttle where Senator Armstrong sacrificed himself to save the crew. Eli (David Blue) and Wray (Ming-Na) discuss the possibility that the system might have been built by possibly the most advanced race in the Universe. Tension between the military and civilians since the coup passes. On the planet, T.J. (Alaina Huffman) is revealed to be pregnant with Colonel Young's (Louis Ferreira) baby. During their last days on the planet, the team on the planet see the obelisk sending a beam of light into the night sky. By the time Destiny is back in range, Young learns that several of them wish to stay on the planet, including Robert Caine (Tygh Runyan) who believes that a higher power is responsible for creating the planet as a \\"lifeline\\" for the expedition, as well as believing that the race responsible will find them and return them to Earth. Young goes down to the planet with the partially repaired shuttle, and offers it to those who wish to stay, so long as all the military personnel return to Destiny, otherwise everyone will be returned by force. With the military personnel back on Destiny, a few civilians remain on the planet while Destiny jumps back to FTL. In the end, the expedition enjoy a feast from the food they brought from the planet. Reception Carl England of Den of Geek found the episode more inclined to the dramatic side of the series, but noted, \\"it shouldn't ward off sci-fi fans, as it teases many alien-related plot points to come back to in later weeks.\\" Overall, England said that \\"this episode may not have been as great as last week's, but it's a really good entry in the season one catalogue.\\" IGN's Ramsey Isler was much more negative than Carl England, describing the episode as \\"a return to the slow stuff, and it really killed a lot of momentum.\\" Among the complaints that Isler had was the re-bonding of the Destiny crew which he understood because of the recent mutiny but said, \\"it makes perfect sense, it just doesn't make for good drama.\\" Isler also found the pregnancy of Lt. Johansen a little clich√© citing he does not, \\"like that this is somewhat of a stereotypical role for a woman to be thrown into.\\" Meredith Woerner from io9.com generally favoured the episode. Woerner had felt a little slighted by the ending of Divided but said this episode, \\"didn't attempt to end everything with a big shiny reset bow forcibly tied on in the end. And I loved it.\\" She goes onto say it was, \\"a healthy dose of reality as soap dishy as it was.\\" Woerner praised the character development of Lt. Johansen stating that, \\"we watched TJ, a normally calm and cool character, unravel for obvious reasons. Then we the audience got to weigh all the possible options with her. And even though we never really knowing the full story we assumed by her attitude you knew it couldn't have been pretty.\\" However Woerner did have her complaints; citing Dr. Caine, \\"lunatic ramblings about the obelisk alien overlords.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Faith\\" at mgm.com * \\"Faith\\" at Stargate wikia Category:Stargate Universe episodes Category:2010 American television episodes it:Episodi di Stargate Universe (prima stagione)#Fede ","title":"Faith (Stargate Universe)"},{"id":"24574030","text":"Maximum brake torque (MBT) is the use of optimal ignition timing to take advantage of an internal combustion engine's maximum power and efficiency. There is always an optimal spark timing for all operating conditions of an engine. MBT is ideal at wide-open throttle (WOT), but not desirable when the engine is at idle. Although MBT is desired at WOT, it is wise to retard timing slightly to prevent knocking that may occur and to create a small safety margin. It is possible to calculate the MBT of an engine by taking into account all of the operating conditions of an engine through its sensors. Operating conditions are defined by these engine parameters: lambda (air/fuel ratio), engine load, internal exhaust gas recirculation, engine speed, and spark advance.

The episode originally aired on April 23, 2010 on Syfy in the United States, and on SPACE in Canada. The episode was directed by series creator, Robert C. Cooper and was written by Jeff Vlaming. The episode focuses on Dr. Rush working on modifying the chair interface, so that he can use it in an attempt to gain access to the master code while replaying the memories during his wife's dying days. The episode was viewed by 1.3 million Americans and was generally well received. Plot Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) uses the Ancient repository chair, which was previously used by Jeremy Franklin, who almost died using it. Rush devises a program which allows the chair to download the information slowly, and works out how to crack the master code to finally gain control of Destiny. He replays the memories from when his wife, Gloria (Louise Lombard), was dying from cancer, and when Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) recruited him to the Stargate program. When Rush finds the master code, he will exit the program. In the meantime, Colonel Young (Louis Ferreira) learns of this and considers disconnecting him if Rush's life is threatened. As Rush is about to give up, he realises a recurring element popping up everywhere; the number 46. When he visits Gloria at her death bed, she reveals that the number is a reference to Human genetics; 46 is the normal number of chromosomes for humans. After disconnecting himself from the chair, Rush writes a program to crack the master code, which is a specific gene used by the Ancients. In the meantime, Destiny drops out of FTL near a planet that contains a ruined city. Greer (Jamil Walker Smith), Scott (Brian J. Smith), Eli (David Blue) and Chloe (Elyse Levesque) explore the ruins. Searching for the civilisation that lived there, the Kino gets lost in a network of tunnels. While looking for it, Greer encounters a giant spider and shoots it, causing the tunnels to collapse. A team led by Vanessa James (Julia Benson) arrives to dig them out, but with little time remaining, she resorts to using C4. However, the resulting explosion makes matters worse. Scott orders her to leave. The episode ends with Destiny jumping back to FTL, stranding the four on the planet. Production The original title to the episode was \\"Lucid\\"; this was changed to \\"Human\\" by episode director Robert C. Cooper. Reception The episode's praise was mostly directed towards Robert Carlyle's performance, and his character's development. The episode was initially viewed by 1.313 million live viewers in the United States, resulting in a 0.8 Household rating, a 0.4 among adults 18-49. Carl England of Den of Geek positively received the episode, due to being the first episode to centrally focus on Rush, citing \\"something I've wanted to happen since day one\\", and that much of Rush's history before the series wasn't disclosed. The episode was also praised for Carlyle's performance, and the endings of both story lines. However, England was critical with the scenes on the alien planet, stating \\"the scenes on the alien planet drag it down a little, as the lack of emotion held within do not play well against the heightened emotions of Dr Rush's storyline.\\" Ramsey Isler of IGN rated \\"Human\\" a \\"great\\" 8.7 out of 10, calling the episode \\"a very well written dramatic story\\". It was praised for Rush's character development, particularly that this was a good \\"origin story\\" for the character. Islar was also somewhat critical with the planet scenes, stating that he was \\"hoping there would be more suspense and maybe some horror-style scares\\", and found the cliffhanger disappointing. Meredith Woerner from Io9 stated that the episode showed promise and that the episode laced the original Stargate style and banter with raw SGU drama that the series was trying to create. Woerner praised \\"Human\\" for Michael Shanks's performance, which he felt brought charisma to the series, as well as Carlyle's performance, particularly the scenes between him and Louise Lombard. However, Woerner had mixed feelings towards Chloe's role in the episode's secondary storyline. The episode was nominated for three Leo Awards. Robert C. Cooper was nominated for \\"Best Direction in a Dramatic Series\\". Also, Michael Blundell was nominated for \\"Best Cinematography in a Dramatic Series\\", while Rick Martin was nominated for \\"Best Picture Editing in a Dramatic Series\\".

The episode was directed by, Rohn Schmidt who previously acted as the director of photography in Air. It was written by Martin Gero, a co-executive producer of Stargate Atlantis. In this episode, the off-world team continues its search for a way out of the tunnels. However a collapse traps Sgt. Greer under the rubble. Fearing his death the team leaves him behind trying to catch up to the Destiny, which is close to leaving the galaxy. In his solitude Greer relives memories of his abusive father. Plot Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) continues to work with Adam Brody (Peter Kelamis) to try to rescue the stranded off-world team. Meanwhile, Sgt. Riley (Haig Sutherland) has taken over kino duties, documenting activities around the ship. However their efforts are hampered by Destiny's sudden loss of power, including the kinos. As the off-world team explores the tunnels searching for a way out, Eli (David Blue) comes up with a plan to get them back to Destiny. He plans to move from planet to planet hoping there are gates in range to keep them moving, eventually reaching Destiny. Power is partially restored to Destiny, but it reveals bad news. Dr. Rush informs Colonel Young (Louis Ferreira) that the ship is about to leave the galaxy, and that the next time Destiny comes out of FTL will be the last chance to find the off-world team. Meanwhile, the kino has found an exit out of the tunnels. Chloe (Elyse Levesque) believes she has found a map to aid them. Greer checks the hypothesis, but a tremor causes rubble to fall on Greer, trapping him. Eli, Chloe and Scott race to free Greer, but as the tremors get worse, and no reply from Greer is given, the team is forced to abandon the rescue and leave Greer behind. Meanwhile, Destiny has dropped out of FTL and Young dispatches a team to try to find the off-world team by moving planet to planet using the Stargates. As Greer regains consciousness and tries to dig his way out of the rubble, he relives memories of his abusive father (Sean Blakemore), such as being locked in a closet, being told to move and stack bricks and subsequently being left to fend for himself as a child. Greer is able to dig his way out and races towards the Stargate, but it is too late. Eli, Chloe and Scott have left and begin trying to find their way back to Destiny. Greer, with no other choice, settles in, waiting for a rescue. He relives a memory of his home on fire. He is able to rescue his mother (Stefanie Samuels), but his father is caught in an explosion. Meanwhile, with time running out, James and Rush split up to cover more planets in an effort to find the off-world team. On the Destiny T.J. (Alaina Huffman) reveals to Colonel Young that she is pregnant and that he is the father. Colonel Young assures T.J. that they will make it work. Eli, Chloe and Scott continue to jump from planet to planet. However they lose their only kino to a planet with a toxic atmosphere. Eli recognizes one of the addressees, as the planet where Rush was stranded. Chloe suggests re-tracing their steps, but Eli disagrees. With no kino, each trip through the gate could be their last. Eli suggests going to the planet, and looking through the downed ship's computers to try to have a better chance of getting to the Destiny. Scott reluctantly agrees to do so. Meanwhile, James has managed to find Greer. As Eli searches through the ship's computer, he is unable to make sense of it. However Chloe recognizes some of the symbols and uses her knowledge to access a map of the galaxy. Eli now knows how to get back to the Destiny but realizes it is about to leave the galaxy and they race to make it back. Eli, Chloe and Scott make it to the final planet and attempt a dial to Destiny. However at the same time Rush and his team arrive back on Destiny blocking Eli's attempt. With time expired, Destiny jumps to FTL, and the team is left stranded. Reception Lost was viewed by 1.587 million live viewers, resulting in a 1.0 Household rating, a 0.6 among adults 18-49. These figures were not seen since the episode Divided. Carl England of Den of Geek positively received the episode, saying that it \\"takes us from one place to another without feeling contrived.\\" England was also pleased with the chance to explore Greer's past; being able to find out \\"why he is the way he is, showing his relationship with his parents and the obvious effect it had on him.\\" Overall, England thought the ending was \\"pretty dour\\" and it left him with questions that would be answered in the following episode. Ramsey Isler of IGN rated \\"Lost\\" an \\"Impressive\\" 8.2 out of 10. It was praised for Jamil Walker Smith's portrayal of Sgt. Greer, saying that \\"this is the first time Greer comes off as vulnerable, and even a little scared, and it fully fleshes out a character who was already a fan favorite.\\" However among Isler's complaints was the \\"crazy guy in the hospital flashback\\", the cheesiness of the T-Rex scene and the overall pacing of the episode was slow. Meredith Woerner from Io9 was \\"generally pleased\\" with the episode. Woerner was a split with Greer's past, saying it was \\"stereotypical mean Daddy issues\\" and the idea of post traumatic syndrome as the excuse for the change in behavior is cliche.

The episode originally aired on May 7, 2010 on Syfy in the United States, and on SPACE in Canada. The episode was directed by, Peter DeLuise who previously directed the two episode arc, Darkness and Light. It was written by Barbara Marshall. In this episode, the Destiny begins its journey to the next galaxy. However Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) calculates that the ship will fall 50,000 light years short of its target. To resolve this problem, Rush brings in Dr. Amanda Perry (Kathleen Munroe) to help increase the efficiency of the FTL drives. However their efforts are hampered as a hostile force has managed to disable the Destiny's FTL drive and begin an attack in order to gain control of the ship. Plot Colonel Young (Louis Ferreira) has gathered everyone in the gateroom to inform them of the situation. He issues an order for strict rationing of food and water as there are no more gates to replenish their supplies. Rush calls Young away to inform him that the ship will fall short of its destination by 50,000 light years. Brody (Peter Kelamis) suggests increasing the efficiency of the FTL drive so power will not be an issue. However, with limited knowledge of drive technology, Rush calls in Dr. Amanda Perry to help. At first Lt. James offers to exchange bodies with Perry. However, Perry uses a wheelchair and uses a respirator to breathe; James is unable to adapt and is forced to return. Wray (Ming-Na) subsequently volunteers her body so she can spend time at home. Suddenly there is an explosion aboard the Destiny and it drops out of FTL. As Rush and Perry try to figure what has happened, there is an incoming wormhole. It's Eli (David Blue), Chloe (Elyse Levesque) and Scott who have returned. As T.J. (Alaina Huffman) checks on the health of the three, Eli explains he thought someone aboard Destiny managed to help them dial-in, as he had done nothing on his end. Young orders Eli back to work to help get the ship fixed. Lt. James tends to Franklin (Mark Burgess) and believes despite his unresponsive affect, that he understands what is transpiring but lacks control over his body. However, James does have her doubts about this belief, citing lack of sleep caused by a nightmare about being trapped in a dark room. T.J. thinks it's just a phantom memory from Perry. As Perry gathers calculations from Eli, she reveals to him she has feelings for Rush. After examining the situation, Perry concludes that the Destiny should now be able to make it across the void despite the overload to the FTL drive. The overload has happened in the least efficient module and bypassing it would fix the ship and increase overall efficiency. Eli decides to use a robot they found in \\"Faith\\" to aid in the repairs. Meanwhile, Young decides to send a team to the planet Eli, Chloe and Scott were occupying to gather supplies. However the hostile aliens from \\"Space\\" are there waiting, leaving no choice but to fix the Destiny. Three weeks pass and the repairs are nearly complete. After a night of drinking from a still that Brody made, Perry invites Rush to her room. The pair attempt to get intimate but Rush stops himself, citing the events in \\"Human\\". They are interrupted by T.J. coming to collect them for a meeting with Young. Young informs them that when James came back to her own body, she knocked the stones onto the floor, thus never wiping the stone clean. One of the aliens then used this opportunity to connect to James and sabotage Destiny before broadcasting its location. Young prepares his soldiers for the battle before he is to sit in the chair interface to try to get the FTL up and running. However, Franklin, who seems to have regained some of his faculties, tells James to take him to the chair. He takes the place of Young and orders them to leave the room. Franklin is able to engage the FTL but upon re- entering the chair room Young and James find that Franklin is missing.

ACTRESS MUST BE PHYSICALLY THIN. (THINK CALISTA FLOCKHART). BA Haller from his blog at Media Dis&Dat; responded negatively to the casting call saying \\"I'm profoundly disturbed by what this casting call suggests about disabilities (that a person's body is 'useless' unless fully abled, for example, that a disability is something that should be fixed, that people with disabilities do not have sex lives, and that a person with a disability is less than fully realized as a human being.) The casting call is making the rounds on the blogosphere, and is being roundly criticized in some quarters but welcomed in others.\\" Sarah Warn from AfterEllen.com chose to take aim at the network, saying \\"wow. And this is from the network that, when they received a failing grade from GLAAD a few weeks ago, said \\"we need to work harder.\\" If this is working harder, I'd hate to see what slacking off would look like.\\" Series creators, Brad Wright and Robert Cooper responded by saying the following: Recently, a casting breakdown was released to agents for an upcoming character in our television show, Stargate Universe. The character, Doctor Eleanor Perry, is a brilliant scientist at the top of her field, who also happens to be a quadriplegic. As part of a science fiction conceit that is core to our series, Perry's consciousness is temporarily exchanged with one our series main characters, Camile Wray, who is a lesbian. In the course of the story, Perry has the experience of being able bodied for the first time since she was a child. At the same time, Wray, temporarily encumbered by Perry's physical disability, experiences the unconditional love of her life partner. The language of the breakdown was insensitive and inaccurate, and we sincerely apologize to those who may have been offended. The audition pages that have been under scrutiny were from an early draft and released out of context.

Carl England of Den of Geek said it was a \\"great episode that brought the whole crew together pretty well.\\" Among England's praises, was the ending, calling it \\"mind-boggling,\\" and saying that the \\"showrunners and writers of SGU consistently deliver superb endings that mean a lot to the show.\\" Particular praise was given to the scenes with Dr. Rush and Perry, citing that it \\"really bring home the effect of the episode Human, which centred on his life prior to the Stargate.\\" However, England was rather negative of the now-standard 20 episode season for the Stargate franchise, and stated he wished there was a little more room to spread the plot a bit more. Ramsey Isler of IGN rated \\"Sabotage\\" a \\"Decent\\" 7.2 out of 10. Isler was generally negative about the episode, citing some of the plot to be \\"ridiculously convenient to the point of contrivance.\\" Among Isler's complaints was the sudden arrival of Eli, Chloe and Scott, saying that the \\"drama set up in the previous episode is squandered\\". Also, the revelation that James had caused the FTL drive to explode, was \\"kind of random.\\" Isler also did not like the plot device of the communication stones being used for intimacy. Meredith Woerner from Io9 was also very negative with the episode. Woerner's biggest complaint was with Eli, Chloe and Scott, saying \\"was I alone in screaming \\"No, no no no no no no\\" at the TV when the gate linked up again?\\" Among her other complaints was the lack of character development for Wray and the quick explanation of the device that was found in the episode \\"Faith\\". Overall, Woerner said: \\"I was hesitant to invest in another story line that may or may not be solved by a simple reset. I still have high hopes for the series[,] because the last few episodes have continually elevated the material and characters.\\"  References  External links  * Sabotage at mgm.com * \\"Sabotage\\" at Stargate wikia Category:Stargate Universe episodes Category:2010 American television episodes it:Episodi di Stargate Universe (prima stagione)#Sabotaggio ","title":"Sabotage (Stargate Universe)"},{"id":"24574083","text":"Statue of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva on Mount Emei, with his six-tusked elephants. The Samantabhadra Meditation S≈´tra (; Japanese: ÊôÆË≥¢Á∂ì; R≈çmaji Fugen- ky≈ç; Korean: Í¥ÄÎ≥¥ÌòÑÎ≥¥ÏÇ¥ÌñâÎ≤ïÍ≤Ω; Gwanbohyeonbosalhaengbeop Gyeong), also known as the S≈´tra of Meditation on the Bodhisattva Universal Virtue, is a Mahayana Buddhist sutra teaching meditation and repentance practices. The extant Chinese text of the meditation sutra was translated by Dharmamitra between 424 and 442 CE (T09n277). The Samantabhadra Meditation S≈´tra is often included in the so-called \\"Threefold Lotus Sutra,\\" along with the Lotus Sutra and the Innumerable Meanings Sutra. It is not known, however, when or by whom the sutra was first recited, but it is considered by many Mahayana sects to be a continuation (an epilogue) of the Buddha's teachings found within the Lotus Sutra. This sutra is believed to have followed two earlier translations, including one by Kumarajiva, which are now lost; no original Sanskrit translation has been found.  Samantabhadra Bodhisattva  According to the sutra itself, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva (\\"Universal Virtue\\") was born in the east Pure Wonder Land and whose form was already mentioned clearly by the Buddha in the Avatamsaka Sutra. In the Threefold Lotus Sutra, the chapter preceding the Samantabhadra Meditation S≈´tra, chapter 28 of the Lotus Sutra, describes Samantabhadra as a perfect example of an adherent to the four practices: * He practices the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. * He protects the Dharma teachings from every kind of persecution. * He witnesses the merits obtained by those who practice the teachings and the punishments of those who slander the Dharma or persecute the practitioners. * He proves that those who violate the Dharma can be delivered from their transgressions if they are sincerely penitent. In the Meditation Sutra, the Buddha describes Universal Virtue's body as unlimited in size, and the range of his voice and the forms of his image are also described as unlimited. He possesses divine powers that enable him to come into the world when he wishes and shrink down to a smaller size. Through his wisdom-power, he appears transformed as if mounted on a white elephant to the people of Jambudvƒ´pa defiled by the three heavy hindrances: Arrogance, envy, and covetousness. The Buddha Shakyamuni describes in detail the form of the elephant on which Universal Virtue is mounted. Universal Virtue rides the white elephant for the sole purpose of guiding the people of Jambudvƒ´pa, or the sahƒÅ-world, through practices that are associated with their environment. The bodhisattva riding on his white elephant is a symbolic image of Buddhist practice, as well as a representation of purity. The purity of the six sense organs is represented by the six tusks of Universal Virtue's white elephant. It is undeniable that the Meditation Sutra is a continuation of the Lotus Sutra, because the sutra itself testifies to the \\"Dharma Flower Sutra\\" three times. Meaning of Repentance The denotational meaning of the word \\"repentance\\" in a general sense, is the confession or remorse of one's own past physical and mental misdeeds, or transgressions. When we repent, we purify our minds and we free ourselves from a sense of sin, and we feel greatly refreshed. Psychoanalysts have applied this principle in helping many people who are mentally afflicted. Contemplation of Reality In Japan, the text is also called the Repentance Sutra (Japanese: Êá∫ÊÇîÁ∂ì; R≈çmaji: Sange-ky≈ç). The second chapter of the Lotus Sutra explains in detail the concept of TathƒÅtƒÅ, or \\"Suchness\\". The sutra emphasizes repentance by means of meditating on \\"the true aspect of reality\\" and the \\"Vaipulya sutras.\\" The essence of Buddhist repentance is summed up in the following lines from the verse spoken by the Buddha concerning the purification of the six sense organs: :The ocean of impediment of all karma :Is produced from one's false imagination. :Should one wish to repent of it :Let him sit upright and meditate on the true aspect of reality. :All sins are just as frost and dew, :So wisdom's sun can disperse them.

The Defenestration Trilogy The trilogy consists of : On The Air (2001), originally premiered as The Birth and Theft of Television on March 26‚Äì27, 2001 at the Theater for the New City, Nightingale: The Last Days of James Forrestal (2002), premiered May 19-June 4, 2002 at the Present Company Theatorium, and Man: Biology of a Fall (2007), premiered October 4‚Äì7, 2007 at Kumble Theater of Long Island University, Brooklyn Campus. Each work sets a libretto by Gary Heidt, employs a cast of approximately 10 singers, and employs an orchestra of 7-15 players.Lockwood (October, 2007) The Birth and Theft of Television is a fictional interweave of the travails of the two great American inventors, Philo T. Farnsworth (inventor of television) and Edwin H. Armstrong (inventor of F.M.), and their battles against corporate America, consolidated into the personage of David Sarnoff (CEO of RCA), leading up to Armstrong's suicide by self-defenestration in 1954. Nightingale: The Last Days of James Forrestal is an imagined glimpse into the mind of the first U.S. Secretary of Defense in his final six weeks of life (1949) as he underwent treatment for nervous exhaustion in the 16th floor of the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Among the characters who visit him are Harry Truman, Sidney Souers, his wife Josephine, and Lyndon B. Johnson before Forrestal dies by falling from his window. Man: Biology of a Fall is a similar glimpse into unknowable events surrounding the last week of life of Frank Olson, a biochemist who is believed to have been murdered in 1953 by defenestration. The backdrop of this opera is Fort Detrick, the CIA's MK-ULTRA mind control program, Greenwich Village, and the Statler Hotel in New York City. Other characters drawn from real persons include Sidney Gottlieb, William Sargant, and George Hunter White.

It was especially successful when performed by Ronnie Ronalde who often performed it as his finale and sold over a million recordings. Origin There are conflicting accounts of the origins of this piece. Here are four accounts: 1\\\\. From Franciscans Here and There, no.34: > During Fr. Edgar's noviciate... a visit was made to Chilworth in 1910 by Fr. > Edgar's brother, Joseph. The latter, as J.H. Larway, was a well-known music > publisher... He brought with him to Chilworth on this 1910 visit a man who > was at that time distinguished as a composer, conductor and musical editor: > Albert Ketelbey... Joseph Larway and Albert Ketelbey were taken round the > friary and grounds of Chilworth. During the tour of the woods Ketelbey > turned to Joseph Larway and said \\"I've got an idea. If I put it on paper, > will you publish it.\\" The idea or inspiration was In a Monastery Garden. > Between one thing and another some time elapsed before the various parts > were ready for publication... In 1915 Joseph Larway... took out the > copyright... What was the surprise Fr. Edgar had in store for his guests at > the 1959 Jubilee of his 50 years in the Order? Notwithstanding the many > moves a friar may have in 50 years Fr. Edgar went up to his cell to bring > down a remnant he had stored, and saved from the wreck of many moves. It was > the score of the original MS of Ketelbey's In a Monastery Garden... Asked if > he would mind this original score going into the archives of the Province, > Fr. Edgar not only agreed, but agreed most willingly, and handed over the > MS, which was once described in a musical review as \\"touching the hearts of > millions of people\\"... 2\\\\. This account is included in the article In a Monastery Garden, by Albert W. Ket√®lbey, in Music Masterpieces, Part 12, 18 March 1926, page 183: > It is highly necessary to feel what one writes, and also to have the right > kind of inspiration. When I was writing In a Monastery Garden, one of my > most popular compositions, I was for the time being an imaginary monk, and > as in my earlier days I had had certain ascetic inclinations it was not > difficult to get myself into a suitable frame of mind. The first inspiration > to write the piece came to me during a visit to Scarborough. I happened to > drive over to Bridlington one day, and on the way I visited a beautiful old > monastery. Its quietude and its aloofness from the gaiety of the world at > its doors seemed to cry aloud for expression through the medium of the > orchestra. I had an idea, and when I returned home I set to work to draw a > musical picture of the scene as it had impressed itself upon my mind - the > chanting of the monks, the serenity and calm of the landscape, and the > emotional aspect generally. I have always thought it a great compliment that > many clergymen have asked me to allow them to incorporate the \\"chant\\" > section of the piece into their church services. 3\\\\. The following account was given in Radio Times, 4 September 1931, page 203: > In a Monastery Garden was commissioned for performance in a seaside resort. > The idea for it came to the composer during a visit to a monastery while out > motoring. At first no publisher would take it unless Ket√©lbey [sic] removed > the Kyrie section: but later a publisher bowed to Ket√©lbey's will, and it > became, Kyrie and all, one of the world's \\"best sellers\\". 4\\\\. Ket√®lbey's colleague, Herbert C. Ridout, has the following in Behind the needle, 5: Looking over forty years of the gramophone (in The Gramophone, November 1940, page 132): > It was in October 1915 that we issued a record of a then unknown work called > In a Monastery Garden, and I think we must have been animated by the wish to > give our friend Albert Ketelbey's piece a good send-off, because the > coupling on the record was the more famous Destiny waltz. But there soon > came a time when Monastery Garden stood quite well on its own merits, and > became such a success that it pointed out a distinct path for its composer > to follow. I know Albert Ketelbey would have to be identified with the more > serious music he had composed and published (some of it under the nom-de- > plume of Anton Vodorinski) and, but for a purely accidental happening in > connection with his Monastery Garden, this might have well been the case. > The story really began two years or so earlier and in a recording > atmosphere, so it is quite apropos here. Among the members of the orchestra > regularly employed by Ketelbey for recording was a clarinet player called > Scoma. In the summer months every year, when orchestral engagements in > London were at their lowest ebb, Scoma himself conducted an orchestra of his > own in Bridlington during the holiday season. Being great friends with > Ketelbey, Scoma asked him if he would write for him an original orchestral > work that he could feature as a novelty in his seaside programmes. That was > in 1912. After paying a visit to Scoma at Bridlington, Ketelbey conceived > the idea of In a Monastery Garden and passed the manuscript to Scoma. The > latter soon began to report in excited letters that the little work not only > aroused enthusiasm when played, but that he was receiving enquiries as to > its publication. Scoma repeated the performances the following season, and > this time declared that he had been pestered with requests for it in > published form, rather shrewdly, however, advising the composer against > publication for the moment, urging patience until it had been thoroughly > tried out. He played it yet a third year at Bridlington, but this time news > of its reception had traveled to London independently, for Ketelbey was > approached by several London publishers anxious to secure it. Eventually > J.H. Larway was the publisher chosen - at Ketelbey's own terms! The lyrics of 1921 in the Indiana State archive are shown as follows; Through the misty twilight falling, Voices from afar are calling ‚Äì Calling all the weary homeward to their rest, The evening bell is softly pealing, While from out the cloisters stealing, Comes this prayer of mercy, peaceful and so blest. KYRIE, ELEISON, Hope will bring to us its gladness, Faith shall take away all sadness, While the gates of day are closing in the West, Joy will come again with morning, Shadows pass, but love is dawning, God is Love and gives us all Eternal Rest. KYRIE, ELEISON URL: http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/metsnav/navigate.do?oid=http://fedora.dlib.indiana.edu/fedora/get/iudl:323880/METADATA&pn;=1&size;=screen Summary There appear to have been two pre-publication versions. The piano manuscript was with Edgar Larway at Chilworth, while the orchestral parts were with Enrico Scoma at Bridlington. Even after publication, there is one difference of harmony between the two versions that makes them incompatible. What none of these accounts mentions is that the first appearance of In a Monastery Garden nationwide was as the recording on Regal Records. This appeared in the Regal catalogue for May 1914, the year before the publication of the sheet music. This first recording uses a different orchestration from the published one, and has details closer to the piano version. References * The Music of Albert W.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Whirlwind hauled out of the water while in civilian use sometime between 1909 and 1917, prior to her U.S. Navy service.Whirlwind was built as a civilian wooden-hulled, triple-screw, steam yacht of the same name in 1909 by the Charles L. Seabury Company and the Gas Engine and Power Company at Morris Heights in the Bronx, New York. The U.S. Navy purchased her from her owner, Julius Fleischmann of New York City, on 11 May 1917 for World War I service as a patrol vessel. She was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard at Brooklyn, New York, as USS Whirlwind (SP-219) on 26 June 1917 with Lieutenant, junior grade, A. S. Johnstone, USNRF, in command. World War I service=First period in commission, 1917 Whirlwind fitted out at the Charles L. Seabury Company shipyard, then arrived at New Haven, Connecticut, on 17 August 1917. She soon commenced patrols off the Cornfield Point lightship. Her duties included hailing passing vessels and seeing that they kept within their designated channels and that other section patrol boats were on their stations. She also escorted Allied ships through the nets that guarded those waters. In the course of one of her normal cruises, she prevented the steamer SS Noreg, out of Nova Scotia, Canada, from fouling the antisubmarine net during a heavy squall on 24 August 1917. Early in September 1917 she inspected the 11th Division of the 3rd Naval Districts local patrol forces on station in Long Island Sound. By early September 1917, it had become apparent that Whirlwinds sea-keeping qualities left much to be desired. Her heavy rolling and pitching caused the Navy to cease using her as an offshore patrol vessel. She arrived at the Charles L. Seabury Company shipyard at Morris Heights on 13 September 1917 for overhaul, then was decommissioned at the Marine Basin at Brooklyn on 8 December 1917. Second period in commission, 1918 Reconsidered for naval use in a different nautical environment, Whirlwind was recommissioned at Waukegan, Illinois, on 29 September 1918. Operating out of Naval Training Station Great Lakes at Great Lakes, Illinois, she cruised to Waukegan and Chicago, Illinois, and to Milwaukee and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, before proceeding to Detroit, Michigan. During this time, she made three cruises on Lake Michigan with family members of Naval Training Station Great Lakes commandant Captain William A.

The technology employed has mirrored the development of transportation since the late 17th century, when the first members of the Royal Family ventured from Great Britain to British North America. As the Canadian Royal Family is not predominantly resident in the country, those that belong to it have generally always had to make a trans-Atlantic crossing before switching to alternate over-land, water, or air transportation once in Canada. Royal favour As different forms of transportation developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, members of the Royal Family, like the general public, used them all. For instance, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), during the first true royal tour of Canada, which he undertook in 1860, was keen to try all the different forms of conveyance available, including steam ship and locomotive. His grandson, Edward, Prince of Wales, favoured American cars and became the first member of the Royal Family to pilot an airplane and, though his brother, King George VI, was predictable and sedate in his choice of transport, George's wife, Queen Elizabeth, tried everything from golf carts to helicopters. Similarly, Queen Elizabeth II has travelled in the state landau, a stagecoach, and monorail, the latter at her own personal request when touring Expo 67. Water Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), heads a canoe on the Nipigon River during a private vacation in northern Ontario, 1919 Up until the middle of the 20th century, ships were frequently used for royal and vice-regal tours of Canada. Members of the Royal Family would voyage from the United Kingdom to the east coast of Canada at Halifax or Saint John, or transit the Saint Lawrence River to Quebec City; from one of these ports they would then embark on a train for overland journey. The ships used were either commercial or military; for their 1939 tour, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth travelled across the Atlantic on the Canadian Pacific ship RMS Empress of Australia for the westbound voyage, and on the RMS Empress of Britain eastbound. The royal yacht HMY Britannia was completed in 1954, and after the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959, could sail into the Great Lakes. This ship was decommissioned in 1997, however, and last sailed in Canadian waters in the summer of 1983, when it carried Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. Rail King George VI and Queen Elizabeth greet Canadians from the back of the Royal Train, in Hope, British Columbia, 1939 The Royal Hudson #2850, which pulled the Royal Train westbound across Canada in 1939 and received royal designation from King George VI, today housed at the Canadian Railway Museum Railways were a frequently used mode of transportation for royal and vice- royal parties from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries; though, until the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), the viceregal party would have to pass through the United States in order to reach the western parts of Canada. Dedicated carriages were constructed and special trains reserved for official and private trips, but, unlike other vehicles, were never owned by the monarch, either as head of state or in a private capacity; instead, they were built and maintained by the railway companies‚Äîthe Canadian National Railway (CNR) and the CPR‚Äîeach always attempting to better the other in terms of luxury and conveniences. Prince Albert Edward was in 1860 the first royal to use a train in Canada; the CPR constructed for his tour two railway cars, one specifically for a sightseeing journey across the Victoria Bridge in Montreal after its opening by the Prince. Then, in the 1880s, Governor General the Marquess of Lorne and his wife, Princess Louise, were supplied with a railway car named Victoria for use in both travelling around the provinces and territories and as a mobile royal and vice-royal residence in parts of the country where amenities were minimal. When it was stopped at the yet to be named capital of Saskatchewan, it was in this car that the Princess in 1882 named the new community Regina, after her mother, the Queen. For the 1901 tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary), two railway cars were specially built by the CPR to serve as mobile royal quarters. One, named Cornwall, served as the day car, with a reception room panelled in Circassian walnut with blue and gold Louis XV ornament and fitted with a piano, as well as a dining room painted in a Watteau style, and a boudoir for the Duchess lined in silk. The other car, York, contained the bedrooms, reached through a green velvet lined vestibule, the Duke's in grey and crimson and the Duchess' in blue. Altogether the Royal Train, which always followed the viceregal and ministerial train, consisted of ten, cars, the remainder being Canada, with an additional five sleeping cabins; Sandringham, the staff dining car; South Africa, housing the secretaries' offices and medical dispensary; and Australia and India, with further sleeping quarters. Three years later, the Alexandra was built and used as the primary VIP transport by members of the Royal Family, governors general, and prime ministers through to the 1920s. It was used, and, in contrast to his opinion of royal trains in Britain, enjoyed by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), during his months long tours of Canada; as he said in 1919: \\"I progressed westward in a magnificent special train provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway. My quarters were in the rear car, which had an observation platform. This last... while providing me with a continuous view of the varied Canadian landscape had however the drawback of making me vulnerable to demands for ad lib speeches from the crowds gathered at every stop.\\" Four years later, the Prince briefly took the controls of the CPR 4-6-2 engine pulling the Royal Train. In 1926, two other carriages were built for state use: the Mount Stephen‚Äîwhich was used by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip; Princess Margaret; and Princess Anne--and the Wentworth‚Äîwhich served as car number 5 (the accommodation for then prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King) of the Royal Train for the 1939 tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. During that journey, the King, somewhat of a railbuff, rode in the engine cab when possible, and at the end of the trip gave his permission for the CPR both to use the prefix royal before the locomotive class' name of Hudson and to display the royal crown on the running boards of these engines. The engines and cars were sold and dispersed in later years; the Mount Stephen and Wentworth today form a part of the CPR's Royal Canadian Pacific train; the Royal Hudson #2850 resides at the Canadian Railway Museum; and the car Pacific, purchased by Paul Higgins, the former Chairman of Mother Parker's, now sits unused on a spur line in Ajax, Ontario. Until 1959, Royal Trains operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway and the federally-owned Canadian National Railways were used to transport Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh across the country. For them, and all royal parties before them travelling by train, precautions were taken ahead of the locomotive; railway line staff would be placed at platforms and on bridges for crowd control, a scout train would check for problems ahead of the royal train's arrival, and other trains that might be running parallel with the Royal Train were made to move at a different speed to prevent passengers looking into the royal carriages. Today, the Royal Canadian Pacific train service operates in Western Canada and was given the 'Royal' designation in 2000. Air The Royal Family has been mostly transported since the 1960s aboard the Canadian Royal Flight, originally using a CC-137 Husky, and currently using a customized CC-150 Polaris flown by crews of 437 Transport Squadron, based at 8 Wing, Trenton, Ontario. 437 Squadron is part of the Air Transport Group, who, along with 412 Squadron in Ottawa, are charged with flying the Royal Family, the governor general, and other VIPs.

Save for a period during the Second World War, the landau has been used for ceremonial processions through Ottawa of the governor general or members of the Royal Family, typically between the royal residence of Rideau Hall and Parliament Hill. The landau is maintained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police since 1911. The current Queen has also used another landau, but it is not owned by the Government of Canada. The C Spring Barouche landau, owned by the Ontario Jockey Club, was a gift from E.P. Taylor.

Plot In 1923 Tokyo Lady Minako is the owner of a shabby boarding house with a collection of bizarre characters for tenants. G≈çda, one of her tenants, spends most of his time in the attic spying on the other tenants through holes he has drilled into the ceiling. During one of his peeping sessions, G≈çda witnesses the murder of one of the tenants at the hand of Lady Minako. G≈çda becomes obsessed with Lady Minako, and determines to commit a grotesque murder in order to prove to her that he is her soul mate. He kills another tenant - a priest - by dripping poison into his mouth through the ceiling. A series of grotesque murders follow. The film ends apocalyptically with the Great Kant≈ç earthquake which kills both of them during their intercourse. Cast * Junko Miyashita: Minako Kiyomiya * Hiroshi Osa: K≈çichir≈ç Kiyomiya * Renji Ishibashi: G≈çda Sabur≈ç * Tokuko Watanabe: Miyuki Tomita * K≈çji Yashiro: End≈ç * Haruka Tajima: Ginko * Toshihiko Oda: Hiruta * Shir≈ç Yumemura: Pierrot * Reiko Akitsu: Model * Aoi Nakajima: Prostitute * Ky≈çichi Mizuki: Druggist Background This film was the middle entry in director Tanaka's \\"Showa Era Trilogy\\", which includes A Woman Called Sada Abe (1975) and Beauty's Exotic Dance: Torture! (1977). All three films star Junko Miyashita.Weisser, p. 61. The story was based on a novel by the Japanese horror-mystery writer, Edogawa Rampo.Sharp, p. 134. It had been filmed as a pink film in 1970 by director Akitaka Kimata,Sharp, p. 135. and Akio Jissoji remade Watcher in the Attic in 1995 in one of the earliest un-fogged pink films. The uncensored version of Jissoji's film was released internationally, though the Japanese theatrical release of this film was fogged.Weisser, pp. 32, 454. Lead actress Junko Miyashita had joined Nikkatsu with the third entry in the Apartment Wife series, Apartment Wife: Unforgettable Night (1972). She starred in several of Nikkatsu's greatest Roman Porno successes, and became known as the second \\"Queen\\" of Roman Porno after the retirement of Kazuko Shirakawa.Weisser, pp. 273, 331. A skillful and versatile actress, her career also benefitted by appearing in films by Nikkatsu's best directors. Besides Tanaka, she was closely associated with the films of Tatsumi Kumashiro.Weisser, p. 274, 331. Lead actor Renji Ishibashi had background in the live theater, and made a name for himself in Roman porno for psychologically unbalanced characters. Besides Watcher in the Attic, another of his major roles is in Tatsumi Kumashiro's Woman with Red Hair (1979), also starring Junko Miyashita.Weisser, p. 515. He later regularly appeared in old yakuza roles in the films of Takashi Miike and others. Themes and legacy Jasper Sharp notes that director Tanaka portrays the Taish≈ç period, in which the film is set, as \\"a pandemonium of styles and colours\\". Tanaka emphasizes the mixture of the erotic and the grotesque in Rampo's work, and in popular culture of the period, which led to its description as \\"ero guro\\". According to Sharp, Tanaka's vision of Rampo's world set the tone for later filmed versions of the author's works as well as biographical films. Tanaka's influence can reportedly be seen in Jissoji's 1994 remake of Walker in the Attic, Kazuyoshi Okuyama's The Mystery of Rampo (1994), Jissoji's The D-Slope Murder Case (1998), and in Rampo Noir (2005). Voyeurism‚Äîalready present in Rampo's story‚Äîis a major theme in the film.Sharp, p. 136. Tanaka makes the audience aware that Lady Minako is conscious of G≈çda's--and, by extension the audience's--spying on her illicit sexual activities. Sharp writes that the camera views Minako through G≈çda's ceiling peephole, \\"acknowledging the viewer's powerless and passive spectatorial role as she returns our gaze.\\" Sharp also notes that voyeurism is a common theme in the pink film, and that it would be deeply explored in the later films of director Hisayasu Sat≈ç. Not only a psychological theme, voyeurism also provided a practical way for the director to obscure sexual organs, which were censored by law. Sharp writes, \\"Framing the sex scenes from an awkward nozoki point-of-view perspective, through keyholes, gaps in open doors, holes in walls, etc, proved one particularly expedient method of blocking the action.\\" Critical appraisal Some critics had recognized Tanaka's talents in the early Roman Porno, Secret Chronicles: She Beast Market (1974), but it was Watcher in the Attic which brought him mainstream success. Peer Cinema Club Annual, a conservative, mainstream publication, wrote that the film was \\"a perfect marriage of decadence and art.\\" At first treated as a standard entry of Nikkatsu's \\"Psycho Killer Showcase\\" series, after the film began receiving mainstream critical approval, Nikkatsu promoted Walker in the Attic beyond the softcore Roman Porno market. English-language critical opinion of the film has been high in the decades since its first release. Magill's Survey of Cinema: Foreign Language Films (1985) calls Watcher in the Attic \\"a frenzied fantasy treat\\". In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films (1998), the Weissers give the film three and a half out of four points. Jasper Sharp comments that the film shows Tanaka's versatility as a director. Availability Watcher in the Attic was released theatrically in Japan on June 12, 1976. It was released to home video in VHS format in Japan on September 9, 1994. As part of Geneon's second wave of Nikkatsu Roman porno series, it was released on DVD on December 22, 2005. On October 28, 2008, Mondo Macabro released Watcher in the Attic in the U.S. on region 0 DVD.

One of the most controversial figures in contemporary Western New York politics, Pigeon was Erie County Democratic Chairman from 1996 to 2002. Recently, he was counsel to New York State Senate Majority Leader Pedro Espada Jr.,After the coup, Pigeon resented as 'hired gun', 2009. and directed Tom Golisano's Responsible New York political committee. Early life and career Pigeon was born in 1960 in St. Louis, Missouri. His uncle was Donald J. Gralike, the majority leader of the Missouri State Senate, and as such, Pigeon was around politics from an early age. In 1972, Pigeon's father, an air traffic controller, was transferred to Buffalo, and the family moved to West Seneca. Pigeon's first campaign was in 1972, where he stuffed envelopes for Assemblyman Vincent Graber. In 1977, at the age of 17, Pigeon worked on Mayor James D. Griffin's successful campaign for mayor. Griffin ran for mayor in opposition to party boss Joseph F. Crangle, and this began Pigeon's lifelong feud with Crangle and his supporters. In 1984, aged only 24, Pigeon managed Gary Hart's presidential primary campaign in upstate New York. This was in opposition to Crangle, who was a key supporter of Walter Mondale both in New York and nationally. Pigeon was elected to the Erie County Legislature from West Seneca in 1988, following a special election. In 1989, he won a full (two-year) term. He won controversy during his term for pushing an industrial park development in that town, which later was called North America Center. This began his association with future State Senator Anthony Nanula, who developed the project. Pigeon was defeated for re-election in 1991 by Republican Sandra Lee Wirth, and went on to work for the Nixon Hargrave law firm. Pigeon was a key player on Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign in upstate New York. He served on the Clinton transition team and was appointed special assistant to Secretary Donna Shalala at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. In 1994, Pigeon joined with Jimmy Griffin in an attempt to recall Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello. Pigeon ran for State Assembly the same year, but lost to his old opponent, Sandra Lee Wirth. Chairmanship, 1996-2002 Pigeon was elected chairman of the Erie County Democratic Committee in 1996. He was 36. Pigeon's election was engineered by County Executive Dennis Gorski, who at the time was consolidating his influence in the Democratic Party over rivals like Mayor Anthony Masiello. Pigeon replaced James Sorrentino, another Crangle opponent who had opposed Gorski's re-election as chairman and thereby lost Gorski's support. Pigeon's tenure as chairman was mixed. While he personally gained influence through the support such political figures as Charles Schumer for U.S. Senate, Eliot Spitzer for Attorney General and Alan Hevesi for State Comptroller, the party suffered a number of losses on the county and local levels. Gorski himself lost his seat in 1999 to Joel Giambra, and Republicans won a number of county and judicial offices during this period. Republicans also carried the county for statewide office on multiple occasions. At the same time, Pigeon became known for supporting billionaire Tom Golisano, who had run as a third-party candidate (i.e. not a Democrat) in statewide elections. All these actions generated considerable opposition to Pigeon's chairmanship among many Democratic leaders, such as Assemblymen Arthur Eve and Robin Schimminger, County Clerk David Swarts, and Amherst Democratic Chairman Dennis E. Ward. After the losses in the 1999 election, Pigeon was continually and publicly opposed by various factions in the party. In 2002, Masiello and Assemblyman Paul Tokasz decided to remove Pigeon, and he was replaced as chairman by Len Lenihan. Post-Chairman career In 2002, Byron W. Brown was elected to the State Senate with Pigeon's support, and appointed Pigeon as a top aide. Brown later disassociated himself with Pigeon in the run-up to the 2005 mayoral election in Buffalo, which Brown won. Pigeon left the Senate payroll in 2004. Pigeon later became a consultant to the Underberg & Kessler law firm in Buffalo. Pigeon was the top fundraiser in Western New York for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008, and later raised money for Barack Obama's campaign. Pigeon was a major player in the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis, where he acted as Tom Golisano's representative. Pigeon later was hired as counsel to Pedro Espada Jr., who ended up as Senate Majority Leader at the conclusion of the crisis. Pigeon also was instrumental in delivering control of the Erie County Legislature to a Democratic- Republican coalition allied with County Executive Chris Collins in 2009. Wins & losses Here is an incomplete list of some candidates Steve Pigeon has supported or opposed, and how the elections turned out. * Anthony Nanula wins a State Senate Election in 1994 and Buffalo City Comptroller in 1999 * Anthony Masiello survives a 1994 recall attempt by Pigeon * Barbara Kavanaugh loses her 1997 attempt to unseat Rosemary LoTempio as head of the Buffalo Common Council * Charles Schumer wins his U.S. Senate election in 1998 * Eliot Spitzer wins his Attorney General election in 1998 * Byron Brown wins a New York State Senate seat in 2002 * Dennis Gorski loses re-election as County Executive in 1999 * Republicans sweep judicial races in 1999 * Andrew Cuomo loses his 2002 primary challenge for Governor to Carl McCall * Fran Pordum loses his 2002 primary challenge against County Clerk David Swarts * Kathy Konst loses in her 2008 challenge to State Senator Dale Volker * Joe Mesi wins Democratic Primary but loses in his 2008 campaign for State Senate * Barbara Kavanaugh loses in her 2008 challenge to Assemblyman Sam Hoyt * Christina Bove wins election to County Legislature in 2009 * Tim Kennedy wins election to the State Senate in 2010. Pigeon himself: * Won election to County Legislature in 1987 * Lost re-election in 1991 * Lost 1994 race for State Assembly to Sandra Lee Wirth * Wins Erie County Democratic Party Chairmanship in 1996 * Denied an appointment to the board of the Erie County Water Authority in 2000 Controversies Controversies have dogged Pigeon over his entire political career. Pigeon's personality has been called abrasive. Some point to major Democratic defeats under Pigeon's leadership, and Pigeon's support for Republican and third-party candidates and his opposition to endorsed Democratic candidates for public office. Others have said that Pigeon mixes his political and business lives in his job as a business development consultant for law firms, where he often wins government contracts from the very officials he supports. On the other hand, Pigeon's supporters agree with his take-no-prisoners approach to supporting political candidates, and his early support of popular New York officials like Charles Schumer. Recent controversies Mr. Pigeon's name has been mentioned in connection with an election scandal in 2007 of the county executive campaign of former West Seneca Supervisor Paul T. Clark. Sedita can act on Pigeon case, some prosecutors say, 2009. Assistant Erie County District Attorney Mark Sacha published a complete statement accusing his boss, Frank A. Sedita III, of refusing to prosecute Steve Pigeon for election law violations. Mark Sacha On District Attorney‚Äôs Failure To Prosecute Steve Pigeon , 2009. Sam Hoyt's campaign spokesman Jeremy C. Toth filed a complaint Responsible New York - Complaint , 2009. against Pigeon and Responsible New York, which he sent to the district attorneys of Erie, Monroe, and Albany counties. Toth hopes that the circumstantial case he makes that Responsible New York staff coordinated its activities with the Barbra Kavanaugh campaign‚Äîa felony‚Äîwill compel the DAs to take a closer look at Pigeon and company. Chasing Pigeon: Past Is Prologue , 2009. Erie County‚Äôs Republican elections commissioner has alleged that former Democratic Chairman G. Steven Pigeon laundered thousands of dollars from Buffalo Sabres owner B. Tom Golisano‚Äôs political committee and others in an attempt to conceal the origin and circumvent contribution limits, in violation of state election law.

In April 2010, Pigeon was linked to a federal probe involving Senator Pedro Espada and accusations and tax fraud and money laundering. News reports linked Pigeon to the investigation based on payments made to an Espada-controlled company by a Buffalo-area firm. Espada probe includes Pigeon, 2010. On 28 May 2015, Pigeon's Buffalo waterfront house was raided as part of an ongoing campaign finance investigation. On 30 June 2016, Pigeon was indicted on bribery, extortion, and 7 other charges.

The original title is Stora landsv√§gen. Structured as a journey play in seven stages, it is an allegory of the individual's passage through life. History When Strindberg wrote this play, he was already suffering from the stomach cancer that would kill him three years later, and he intended it as a summation of his thoughts on various questions, a kind of theatrical self- portrait and last testament. A literal translation of the Swedish title would be \\"The Great Country Road\\", and Strindberg intended this to reference the street where he had lived as a child, which led directly to the cemetery. The world premiere of the play took place on February 19, 1910, at the Intimate Theater of Stockholm with August Falck in the lead role of the Hunter. It was not the kind of play the public associated with Strindberg and it closed after a comparatively short run (16 performances according to Strindberg, Th√©√¢tre Complet 6, Paris 1986, p. 538). It was considered unperformable for decades afterwards and is still produced only rarely. Synopsis The Great Highway is a memory play structured as a journey with seven 'stations' at which the protagonist, the Hunter, encounters and re-encounters other characters. Like the Hunter, all the other characters are symbolically named and include the Hermit, the Traveller, a group of Millers, the Girl, the Schoolmaster, the Blacksmith, the Photographer, the Organ-Grinder, the Japanese, the Murderer, the Child, the Woman, and the Tempter. As the Hunter proceeds on a walking tour in the mountains, he finds himself in one surreal situation after another. For example, the Millers he meets are fighting over the wind; elsewhere the Schoolmaster lives in the town of Eseldorf (Donkey Village) where being sane is a crime punishable by death. As the Hunter descends from the purer heights of the mountains, he begins to encounter characters from his own past, including the daughter he deserted. The play is written chiefly in unrhymed verse, with the language veering frequently from the banal to the lyrical. The past tense recurs repeatedly in the characters' speech. It ends with an admission of failure and a prayer: :Bless me, whose deepest suffering, :deepest of human suffering, was this‚Äî :I could not be the one I longed to be. Critics' views of the play vary a great deal. Many consider it a masterpiece of emotional truth-telling despite flaws like its unusual mixture of mundane and sublime language. However, some have dismissed it for being undramatic or as pseudo-mystical claptrap.

It has been argued that these tagging systems can provide navigational cues or \\"way-finders\\" for other users to explore information. The notion is that given that social tags are labels users create to represent topics extracted from online documents, the interpretation of these tags should allow other users to predict the contents of different documents efficiently. Social tags are arguably more important in exploratory search, in which the users may engage in iterative cycles of goal refinement and exploration of new information (as opposed to simple fact- retrievals), and interpretation of information contents by others will provide useful cues for people to discover topics that are relevant. One significant challenge that arises in social tagging systems is the rapid increase in the number and diversity of tags. As opposed to structured annotation systems, tags provide users an unstructured, open-ended mechanism to annotate and organize web content. As users are free to create any tag to describe any resource, it leads to what is referred to as the vocabulary problem. Because users may use different words to describe the same document or extract different topics from the same document based on their own background knowledge, the lack of any top-down mediation may lead to an increase in the use of incoherent tags to represent the information resources in the system. In other words, the lack of structure inherent in social tags may hinder their potential as navigational cues for searchers because the diversities of users and their motivation may lead to diminishing tag-topic relations as the system grows. However, a number of studies have shown that structures do emerge at the semantic level ‚Äì indicating that there are cohesive forces driving the emergent structures in a social tagging system.  Distinction between descriptive and predictive models  Just like any social phenomena, behavioral patterns in social tagging systems can be characterized by either a descriptive or predictive model. While descriptive models ask the question of \\"what\\", predictive models go deeper to also ask the question of \\"why\\" by attempting to provide explanations for the aggregate behavioral patterns. While there may be no general agreement on what an acceptable explanation should be like, many believe that a good explanation should have a certain level of predictive accuracy. Descriptive models typically are not concerned with explaining the actions of individuals. Instead, they focus on describing the patterns that emerge as individual behavior is aggregated in a large social information system. Predictive models, however, attempt to explain aggregate patterns by analyzing how individuals interact and link to each other in ways that bring about similar or different emergent patterns of social behavior. In particular, a mechanism-based predictive model assumes a certain set of rules governing how individuals interact with each other, and understand how these interactions could produce aggregate patterns as observed and characterized by descriptive models. Predictive models can therefore provide explanations to why different system characteristics may lead to different aggregate patterns, and can therefore potentially provide information on how systems should be designed to achieve different social purposes.  Descriptive models = Information theory models  For most tagging systems, the total number of objects being tagged far exceeds the total number of tags in the collective vocabulary. If a single tag in this system is specified, many documents would match, so that using single tags cannot effectively isolate any one document. However, some documents are more popular or important than others, which is reflected in the number of bookmarks per document. Thus, the focus should be on how well the mapping of tags to documents retains information about the distribution of the documents. Information theory provides a framework to understand the amount of shared information between two random variables. The conditional entropy measures the amount of entropy remaining in one random variable when the value of a second random variable is known. A 2008 paper by Ed Chi and Todd Mytkowicz showed that the entropy of documents conditional on tags, H(DT), is increasing rapidly. This suggests that, even after knowing completely the value of a tag, the entropy of the set of documents is increasing over time. Conditional entropy asks the question: \\"Given that a set of tags is known, how much uncertainty remains regarding the document set referenced by those tags?\\" This curve is strictly increasing, which suggests that the specificity of any given tag is decreasing. As a navigation aid, tags are becoming harder and harder to use, and a single tag will gradually reference too many documents to be considered useful. Another approach is through mutual information, a measure of independence between two variables. Full independence is reached when I(D;T) = 0. Chi and Mytkowicz's research shows that as a measure of usefulness of tags and their encoding, there is a worsening trend in the ability of users to specify and find tags and documents when they are engaged in simple fact retrieval. This suggests that search and recommendation systems should be built to help users sift through resources in social tagging systems, especially when they are engaged in activities beyond fact retrieval, as characterized by information theory. Although the number of documents associated with any given tag is increasing, there are many ways contextual information can help users to look for relevant information. This is one of the major weakness of the simple information theory in explaining usefulness of tags ‚Äì it ignores how humans can extract meanings from a set of tags assigned to a document. For example, a 2007 paper showed that while the number of tags is increasing, the general growth pattern is scale-free ‚Äì the general distribution of tag-tag co-occurrences follows a power law. The same paper also found that the characteristics of this scale-free distribution depend on the semantics of the tag ‚Äì tags that are semantically general (e.g., blogs) tend to co-occur with many tags, while semantically narrow tags (e.g., Ajax) tend to co-occur with few tags across a wide set of documents in a social tagging system. This suggests that the assumption of the information theory approach is too simple ‚Äì when taking into account the semantics of the set of tags assigned to documents, the predictive value of tags on contents of documents is relatively stable. This finding is important for development of recommender systems ‚Äì discovering these higher-level semantic patterns is important in helping people find relevant information.  Tag convergence  Despite this potential vocabulary problem, research has found that at the aggregate level, tagging behavior seemed relatively stable, and that the tag choice proportions seemed to be converging rather than diverging. While these observations provided evidence against the proposed vocabulary problem, they also initiated research investigating how and why tag proportions tended to converge over time. One explanation for the stability was that there was an inherent propensity for users to \\"imitate\\" word use of others as they create tags. This propensity may act as a form of social cohesion that fosters the coherence of tag-topic relations in the system, and leads to stability in the system. It was shown that the stochastic urn model created in 1923 was useful in explaining how simple imitation behavior at the individual level could explain the converging usage patterns of tags. Specifically, the convergence of tag choices was simulated by a process in which a colored ball was randomly selected from an urn, then replaced in the urn along with an additional ball of the same color, simulating the probabilistic nature of tag reuse. This simple model, however, does not explain why certain tags would be \\"imitated\\" more often than others, and therefore cannot provide a realistic mechanism for tag choices and how social tags could be used as navigational cues during exploratory search.  Complex systems dynamics and emergent vocabularies Research based on data from the social bookmarking website Del.icio.us has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Furthermore, although there is no central, controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable, power-law distribution. Once such stable distributions form, the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be partitioned to obtain a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies can be seen as emerging from the decentralized actions of many users ‚Äì a form of crowdsourcing.  Tag choice by stochastic process  The memory-based Yule-Simon (MBYS) model attempts to explain tag choices by a stochastic process. It was found that the temporal order of tag assignment influences users' tag choices. Similar to the stochastic urn model, the MBYS model assumes that at each step, a tag would be randomly sampled: with probability p that the sampled tag was new, and with probability 1-p that the sampled tag was copied from existing tags. When copying, the probability of selecting a tag was assumed to decay with time, and this decay function was found to follow a power-law distribution. Thus, tags that were more recently used had a higher probability of being reused. One major finding was that semantically general tags (e.g., \\"blog\\") generally co-occurred more frequently with other tags than semantically narrower tags (e.g., \\"Ajax\\"), and this difference could be captured by the decay function of tag reuse in their model. Specifically, it was found that a slower decay parameter (when the tag is reused more often) could explain the phenomenon that semantically general tags tended to co-occur with a larger set of tags. In other words, it was argued that the \\"semantic breadth\\" of a tag could be modeled by a memory decay function, which could lead to different emergent behavioral patterns in a tagging system.  Predictive models = Semantic imitation model  Descriptive models were based on analyses of word-word relations as revealed by the various statistical structures in the organization of tags (e.g., how likely one tag would co-occur with other tags or how likely each tag was reused over time). Thus, these models are descriptive models at the aggregate level, and have little to offer about predictions at the level of an individual's interface interactions and cognitive processes. Rather than imitating other users at the word level, one possible explanation for this kind of social cohesion could be grounded on the natural tendency for people to process tags at the semantic level, and it was at this level of processing that most of the imitation occurred. This explanation was supported by research in the area of reading comprehension, which showed that during comprehension, people tended to be influenced by meanings of words rather than the words themselves. Assuming that people in the same culture tend to have shared structures ‚Äì such as using similar vocabularies and their corresponding meanings to conform and communicate, users of the same social tagging system may also share similar semantic representations of words and concepts, even when the use of tags may vary across individuals at the word level. As such, part of the reason for the stability of social tagging systems can be attributed to the shared semantic representations among the users, such that users may have relatively stable and coherent interpretation of information contents and tags as they interact with the system. Based on this assumption, the semantic imitation model predicts how different semantic representations may lead to differences in individual tag choices and eventually different emergent properties at the aggregate behavioral level. The model also predicts that the folksonomies in the system reflect the shared semantic representations of the users. Semantic imitation has important implications to the general vocabulary problem in information retrieval and human‚Äìcomputer interaction ‚Äì the creation of a large number of diverse tags to describe the same set of information resources. Semantic imitation implies that the unit of communication among users is more likely at the semantic level rather than the word level. Thus, although there may not be strong coherence in the choice of words in describing a resource, at the semantic level, there seems to be a stronger coherence force that guides the convergence of descriptive indices. This is in sharp contrast to conclusions derived based on a purely information-theoretical approach, which assumes that humans search and evaluate information at the word level. Instead, the process of semantic imitation in social tagging implies that the information-theoretic approach is at most incomplete, as it does not take into account the basic unit of human information processing. Similar to the fact that human communication occurs at the semantic level, the fact that people may use different words or syntax does not affect the effectiveness of communication, so long as the underlying \\"common ground\\" between two people is the same. In the social tagging case, as long as users share a similar understanding of the contents of the information resources, the fact that the information value of tag-document decreases (that humans have more words in their languages) does not imply that it will always be harder to find relevant information (similarly, the fact that there are an increasing number words in human languages does not mean that communication becomes less effective). However, it does point to the notion that one needs to effectively present these semantic structures in the information system so that people can effectively interpret the semantics of the tagged documents. Intelligent techniques based on statistical models of language, such as latent semantic analysis and the probabilistic topics model, could potentially overcome this vocabulary problem.

Hull Phoenix moved to Cottingham for the 2006 summer season and became the open age summer team of Cottingham Tigers RLFC under the name Cottingham Phoenix. The Premier divisions underwent a restructure and Cottingham found themselves playing in the North Premier, Phoenix were successful in finishing top of the league but lost narrowly in extra time in the Grand final against East Lancashire Lions. Cottingham accepted an invitation to play in the revamped Rugby League Conference National Division during summer 2007. Cottingham Phoenix were subsequently expelled about half- way through the season for forfeiting three fixtures.

Behind her is the USS Lewis. Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard inside the Bathyscaphe Trieste. Project Nekton was the codename for a series of very shallow test dives (three of them in Apra Harbor) and also deep-submergence operations in the Pacific Ocean near Guam that ended with the United States Navy-owned research bathyscaphe Trieste entering the Challenger Deep, the deepest surveyed point in the world's oceans. The series of eight dives began with two harbor dives, then a Pacific Ocean test dive at Guam, by the newly modified Trieste, which had been modified to dive far deeper than before. After two checkout dives, the first abyssal dive reached a record of on November 15, 1959. The series included a record deep dive to near the bottom of the Nero deep in the Mariana Trench at , and finally culminated with a trip to the bottom of the Challenger Deep at , on January 23, 1960. The project name was proposed by oceanographer Dr. Robert S. Dietz in early 1958, as plans to modify the Trieste bathyscaphe to go to the deepest part of the oceans were being contemplated. It is in reference to ocean life that actively swims (nekton) as opposed to the plankton organisms that only drift. The bathyscaphe Trieste to be used for Project Nekton was able to move independently, in contrast to tethered bathyspheres. The Trieste featured two electric motors, each with a propeller, of two horsepower each. These allowed it to move forward, backward and to turn horizontally. A maximum speed of was attainable over a few miles distance.See page 133 for name origin, page 231 for propeller and motor description Objectives Aside from the prestige of being the first to make the deepest dive, the Navy Electronics Laboratory held the following objectives for Project Nekton in furtherance of its underwater sound research for SOSUS and sonar development: * precise determination of the sound velocity throughout the water column being explored * determination of the water column's temperature and salinity structure * water current measurements * light penetration, visibility, and bio- luminescence observations * distribution of organisms under observation in the water column and on the sea floor * marine geological study of the trench environment * engineering tests of equipment at great depths * determination of pressure effects on hull polarity  Operations Trieste departed San Diego on October 5, 1959 for Guam aboard the freighter SS Santa Mariana to participate in Project Nekton, a series of very deep dives near Guam, culminating in a descent to the Mariana Trench. It had been modified with a larger gasoline float, larger ballast tubs, and a newly designed heavy pressure sphere (made by Krupp in Germany), after having been purchased by the Office of Naval Research, which undertook the modification. Guam was selected for the test dives because it was a major naval base with complete facilities only from the Challenger Deep. The tug towed Trieste between Guam and the dive sites where project flagship tracked the submerged Trieste with sonar. The first two test dives in the Nekton series were conducted at Guam in the Apra Harbor, then a third dive off the Western flank of Guam reached . This dive was intended to have the same duration as the deep dive for an endurance test to reveal material failures or hazards not encountered during shorter dives. Trieste could surface in 20 minutes from this depth if problems arose, but no problems were encountered. Fourth dive The fourth dive in the Nekton series, was a very deep dive into the Nero Deep of the Marianas Trench. This deep had been discovered in 1899 by the in a search for a deep sea cable route to the orient. It was dive 61 in a long series of bathyscaphe dives supervised by Jacques Piccard. Trieste reached , later recalibrated to depth, to the sea floor, on November 15, 1959. This dive set a new world record depth formerly held by the French Navy for the descent on their bathyscaphe FNRS-3 off Dakar, Senegal in 1954. Northeasterly trade winds caused high seas slowing the tow to the dive site, and raising concern about damage to Triestes topside equipment as the she nosed into the waves. Seas moderated on the day of the dive, and pre-dive inspection found no damage. The surface vessels lost underwater telephone contact with Trieste as the bathyscaphe descended below and communication below that depth was limited to a few manually keyed signal codes from the bathyscaphe transducer. A small boat remained over the dive site while the tug and destroyer stood off to avoid damaging Trieste if the bathyscaphe surfaced beneath them. Just before the bathyscaphe surfaced, its crew was startled by a loud \\"bang\\" as the expanding bathyscaphe segments broke their epoxy joint seals at a depth of . Inspection after returning to Guam revealed some water leakage along the seals between the three sections of the sphere. Trieste was taken out of the water to replace the epoxy glue seals and augment them with mechanical holding ring bands. Some new instrumentation was also installed during this repair period. Dive 62 (fifth in the Nekton series) was another Apra Harbor dive to test the new instrumentation. There was also some concern about possible leakage between the bathyscaphe sphere segments near the surface, although pressure was expected to seal the joints at depth. The next dive (sixth in the series, dive 63 for Piccard) was another checkout dive on December 18, west of Guam. It reached to test the holding bands and new instrumentation at that depth. Although not usually considered as part of the counted series, there were five shallow dives for crew training purposes in Apra Harbor before the next deep dive of the series. Seventh dive The next dive (dive 64 in a series, seventh in the Nekton series) reached in the Nero Deep in the Mariana Trench off Guam. Although this dive set a new depth record, there had been some damage to topside equipment during the tow to the dive site which prevented this dive from quite reaching the bottom, below. Topside damage to the gasoline release valve prevented negative buoyancy adjustment after ballast had been released when the bottom was sounded, and once rising, the bathyscaphe could not be stopped. The crew was startled by implosion noises as Trieste descended past . A portable navigation light which should have been removed prior to diving imploded, and a topside pipe stanchion recently installed for safety purposes collapsed because no compensating holes had been drilled. The implosions caused no structural or instrument damage, and a newly installed underwater telephone allowed voice communication with the surface at greater depths. Diving into the Challenger Deep Lewis arrived at the dive site on 20 January to locate the Challenger Deep for Triestes dive. The ship's fathometer was not designed for such depths. Lewis made depth determinations by dropping explosive charges over the side and timing the interval between the explosion and the return echo. Over 300 explosive charges were used to locate the target trench area long and wide. On dive 65 (eighth in the Nekton series), on January 23, 1960, Trieste reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard (son of the boat's designer Auguste Piccard) and Lieutenant Don Walsh, USN. This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of , although this was later revised to and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep to be slightly shallower, at . The descent to the ocean floor took 4 hours and 48 minutes at a descent rate of .NGC: On the sea floorTo the Depths in Trieste , University of Delaware College of Marine Studies After passing one of the outer Plexiglas window panes cracked, shaking the entire vessel.Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste. , Rolex Deep Sea Special, Written January 2006. The two men spent barely twenty minutes at the ocean floor, eating chocolate bars to keep their strength. The temperature in the cabin was a mere at the time. While on the bottom at maximum depth, Piccard and Walsh unexpectedly regained the ability to communicate with Wandank using a sonar/hydrophone voice communications system. At a speed of almost (about five times the speed of sound in air), it took about seven seconds for a voice message to travel from the craft to the surface ship and another seven seconds for answers to return. While on the bottom, Piccard and Walsh reported they observed a number of small sole and flounder swimming away, indicating that at least some vertebrate life might withstand the extremes of pressure in any of the Earth's oceans. They noted that the floor of the Challenger Deep consisted of \\"diatomaceous ooze\\". The ascent to surface took three hours, fifteen minutes.

In 1518, the Master's Lodgings were still in the tower above the main entrance of the College. In 1531, he moved to larger accommodation at Little University Hall in the High Street, next to the College. He appointed a number of members of his family to be fellows of the College. The first commoner undergraduates started at University College during Hutchinson's time as Master. Thus University College moved from being largely a postgraduate institution without formal teaching to also being a graduate teaching institution, as most Oxford colleges are today. Hutchinson lived on until 1554, eight years after he ceased being Master of University College. It was unusual for the time to take such a retirement.

It was the first major action of the Puerto Rican Campaign during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Background Under the command of Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, a U.S. fleet‚Äîconsisting of the flagship armored cruiser , battleships and , the unprotected cruisers and , the monitors and , the torpedo boat , the auxiliary cruiser , the collier , and two unarmed yachts transporting officials and the press,‚Äîprepared to attack Puerto Rico. Their mission was to intercept the Spanish Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete and his fleet steaming from the Cape Verde Islands to the Antilles. American commanders believed the Spanish fleet was steaming for Puerto Rico. With this understanding, Sampson set steam from Key West and lifted anchor at about noon on 2 May, for the Spanish province. The Fleet reached Cape Haitien, Haiti, on 8 May, where Rear Admiral Sampson telegraphed Washington to report updates and await for further instructions. Sampson intended to destroy the Spanish squadron and then move on to attack San Juan's castles, forts and batteries. On 8 May, in San Juan Bay, the captured the Spanish cargo ship Rita. The Americans installed a prize crew and sent the cargo vessel to Charleston, South Carolina. The following day, a Spanish auxiliary cruiser, name unknown, and Yale fought a minor battle off San Juan. The Spanish auxiliary cruiser was much better armed, which led to Yale, fleeing shortly after the commencement of the engagement. The next day, on May 10, Yale returned to San Juan Bay and briefly exchanged fire with Fort San Cristobal, with little effect. Finally on 11 May, a day away from Puerto Rico and after receiving no new information about the Spanish fleet, William Sampson boarded Detroit and issued his orders. Detroit was to lead the U.S. battle line up San Juan's bay, their orders where to initiate a bombardment of the enemy positions if fired upon. Sampson also transferred his flag to Iowa. Bombardment The next morning at 05:00, Detroit proceeded with leading the American battle line. Steaming far up into the bay, initially no Spanish shots were fired on the approaching U.S. fleet. Which allowed the American ships to reach the tip of the bay in full view of San Juan's harbor. Commander Sampson, feeling his warships were steaming too close to the enemy held city, ordered his ships to stop. Despite these orders, Detroit steamed forward, which prompted the other U.S. ships to follow. Castillo San Felipe del Morro during the battle. After failing to stop his vessels, Sampson ordered Iowa to train her guns on the nearest enemy stronghold, the Morro castle. This was only a ruse though; Iowa fired one shot into the water and the Spanish, believing they had been fired on, returned a salvo from their battery which failed to score a direct hit. Iowa fired again with a massive broadside which reportedly blew away a large portion of the castle. Rough seas and high winds meant that both American and Spanish rounds were being blown off target, which resulted in a severe disadvantage for the American and Spanish gunners. Several shots ended up falling on San Juan houses and other buildings. The rough seas made the U.S. ships wobble back and forth, disallowing the sailors a steady platform to fire from, this also attributed to stray rounds. At least one shell struck the 16th-century San Jos√© Church. All the damaged civilian structures were adjacent to Morro castle, which meant that any round failing to hit the castle would most likely hit the town accidentally. The U.S. warships maneuvered in circular motions, firing from both their port and starboard guns. Once Morro seemed to be considerably damaged, Sampson ordered his fleet to begin bombarding Fort San Crist√≥bal, the Spanish Ballaja Barracks, a small sea fort, El Ca√±uelo, which appears from Spanish records to have been unarmed and unoccupied, and a battery known as San Carlos. The battle damage inflicted on Ballaja barracks. The American ships were reported to be so close to the Spanish positions that their infantry were in able range to fire on the U.S. warships. However, none of their small arms were capable of inflicting serious damage on the modern steel vessels. A French cruiser‚Äîthe Amiral Rigault de Genouilly‚Äîsat in San Juan's harbor, along with three small Spanish gunboats. Two of the gunboats were most likely the and . Possibly to avoid an international crisis with France, no major American attack was made on the Spanish gunboats as they were quite close to Amiral Rigault de Genouilly. Still, a few shots that did go in that direction damaged to the French cruiser's smoke stack and rigging. Apparently neither the French nor Spanish ships responded returned fire towards the Americans. From 05:00‚Äì08:00, Sampson's fleet fired their guns, while receiving light damage on only two ships, New York and Iowa. USS Iowa, firing her guns. At 08:00, Sampson instructed his ships to cease firing due to the lack of Spanish return fire. The crew of the monitor Terror failed to understand these orders and they continued the bombardment solo until 08:30. Casualties The only U.S. sailor killed in action served aboard the New York with four injured; three others were slightly wounded aboard Iowa. Amphitrite suffered one gunner's mate killed of heat exposure while occupying one of the barbettes. After the battle, the commanding Spanish Military Governor, Manuel Mac√≠as y Casado, confirmed that two of his troops were killed while manning the few different batteries and another 34 injured. Civilian casualties were five killed and 18 wounded. Most of the Puerto Rican civilians had fled their city at the sound of the first salvo. The number of refugees was reportedly so large that San Juan's streets were almost deserted, with the exception of the several hundred strong Spanish garrison. Armament The U.S. Navy had more and larger guns than the Spanish. The battleships, cruisers and monitors carried four 13\\", four 12\\", eight 10\\", twelve 8\\", and four 6\\" guns, in addition to many smaller pieces. Fort San Cristobal had two 150mm (5.9\\") Ord√≥√±ez guns and two 240mm (9.45\\") Ord√≥√±ez howitzers, Castillo San Felipe del Morro, which apparently fired the first shot, had five 150mm Ord√≥√±ez guns and two 240mm Ord√≥√±ez howitzers, the San Antonio battery had four 150mm Ord√≥√±ez guns, the San Fernando Battery had four muzzleloading 210mm (8.3\\") sunchado (or zunchado, meaning banded), howitzers, the Santa Elena battery had three more, the San Agustin battery had three almost as obsolete 150mm sunchado guns, and the Santa Teresa battery had three 150mm Ord√≥√±ez guns. The Navy fired 1,362 shells whereas the Spanish fired only 441 rounds. Aftermath The U.S. fleet steamed, or sailed in some cases, back to the Havana, Cuba, blockade. On May 18, Sampson learned that Admiral Cervera's force had sailed to Santiago de Cuba.

It is led by the environmental and human rights activist Luis Yanza. The coalition focuses on regional, national and global environmental and collective rights in the Ecuadorian Amazon. It has offices in the Amazonian towns of Nueva Loja (also known as Lago Agrio) and Coca, as well as the nation's capital, Quito. The Amazon Defense Coalition (ADC) structure is focused on training (a three-year integral leadership training course offered to Amazonian residents in Orellana and Sucumb√≠os provinces), legal (legal advice and defence of campesino and indigenous socio- environmental community rights), environmental monitoring (a technical team which monitors and reports on areas and communities that suffer from oil pollution as a result of drilling in the Amazon), and alternative products (promotion of cleaning and energy products that do not harm the environment as well as seeking local sustainable development and biodiversification). The Amazon Defense Coalition was formed in 1994 after a group of 75 indigenous people and farmers brought an environmental clean-up lawsuit against Texaco (consolidated into Chevron Corporation in 2001) in the name of 30,000 Amazonian residents near the Lago Agrio oil field. The accumulation of waste there over three decades now fills a region the size of Rhode Island. The case was initially heard in a U.S. court in New York City where it received representation from New York human rights lawyer Steven Donziger. It 2003, it was moved to Nueva Loja at the request of Chevron who cited the lack of a jury system in Ecuador as one of its reasons. With a 2011 judgement of $18 billion against the oil giant, confirmed but lowered to $9.5 billion in 2013 by the Ecuador Supreme Court, it is potentially the biggest environmental litigation ever brought against a multi-national corporation. The money would have been used by the ADC to detoxify the soil and treat cancer patients. However, as of 2020, Chevron has evaded the judgement by moving all of its operations out of Ecuador's jurisdiction. Attempts to seek the $9.5 billion in the United States have been blocked by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan who decried the proceedings as a \\"five-year effort to extort and defraud Chevron\\". The main witness supporting Kaplan's ruling was found to have lied and been paid by Chevron in 2015. The Ontario Court of Appeals has ruled against the collection on the grounds that Chevron Canada operates with sufficient autonomy from the American company. The ADC was initially the main organization to follow up the lawsuit. In 2001, the Assembly of People Affected by Texaco (ADAT) was created to better represent the affected communities and make the most significant decisions about the judicial process. The Amazon Defense Coalition became part of the ADAT, which later evolved into the Union of People Affected by Texaco (UDAPT) in 2012. However, the ADC continued to maintain its former structure and internal rules and to act as a social organization in defense of the rights of the Amazonian communities.

Its feeder elementary schools are Plympton-Wyoming (Aberarder Central School), Watford (East Lambton and St. Peter Canisius), Grand Bend (Grand Bend Public) and Forest (St.John Fisher and Kinnwood Central) as well as Hillside School on the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation and Bosanquet Central outside Thedford. History Until the 1880s, students seeking to go beyond a basic elementary school education would have to board in larger centers such as Sarnia, where a district grammar school had been established in 1844. The abolition of the district grammar schools in 1871 led to the creation of collegiate institutes and high schools, the former devoted to traditional forms of education and the latter catering to male and female students in subject areas like English and the natural sciences. Students living in larger cities who planned to further their education at university were more likely to attend collegiate institutes. However, in communities such as Forest the development of high schools provided a base for those wishing to continue their studies at normal school or university.R.D. Gidney and W.P.J. Millar, 'Inventing Secondary Education: The Rise of the High School in Nineteenth- Century Ontario' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 1990) In 1890, Forest's first permanent high school was built for $6,300 with Principal James H. Philip and four additional teachers serving approximately 160 students. Prior to this Forest had been served by a Model School. The school was gradually enlarged but suffered a catastrophic fire in 1940 at which point it was substantially rebuilt. Over the subsequent decades, enrolments increased due to the demographic increase of the \\"Baby Boom\\" and an increasing demand for higher education. The last major addition to the school was completed in the early 1970s. With the creation of the Lambton County Board of Education in 1969, Forest District High School was renamed North Lambton Secondary School.Jean Turnbull Elford, Canada West‚Äôs Last Frontier: A History of Lambton (Lambton County Historical Society, 1982), 24-28. Plans for the expansion of the school were tentatively approved in the spring of 1969 which would see $1 million spent on increasing student capacity from 750 to 1,200.

Founded in 1922, shortly after the establishment of Greater Romania, it united Jewish socialists in Bukovina, Bessarabia and the Romanian Old Kingdom. Standing for the lay wing of the Jewish representative movement, the Romanian Bund had atheistic leanings and offered an alternative to the mainstream Jewish organization. Like other Bundist groups, but unlike the Marxist-inspired Poale Zion bodies of Bessarabia, it rejected Zionism. History In 1922 the Bundists of Bukovina (who had belonged to the Jewish Social Democratic Party in Austria-Hungary) decided to approach the Jewish socialists from the Old Kingdom and Bessarabia and propose a unification. The General Jewish Labour Bund in Romania was founded at a conference in CernƒÉu≈£i (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine) on January 6‚Äì7, 1923. At the founding conference there were four delegates from the Old Kingdom, three from Bessarabia and from Bukovina there were delegates from CernƒÉu≈£i, RƒÉdƒÉu≈£i, Suceava, Siret and Storojine≈£.Joseph Kissman, \\"The History of the Jewish Worker Movement Bund in Bukovina\\", in Hugo Gold (ed.), History of the Jews in the Bukowina, Tel Aviv, Vol. 1 (1958), pp. 129-144 Soon after the founding of the party, a support organization was founded in the United States, called the Gross Rum√§nische Arbeiter Liga (\\"Greater Romanian Workers League\\"). During the interwar period, the General Jewish Labour Bund stood as one of several small organizations which represented the enlarged Jewish community of Greater Romania, covering the ground between the right-wing representatives of Jewish nationalism and the far left. Boris Marian, \\"O carte-reper √Æn studiul istoriei Europei RƒÉsƒÉritene\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 12/2008 The party had its main strength in Bessarabia, and to a lesser extent in Bukovina.

Well represented at kehilla elections in the Bessarbian city of Chi≈üinƒÉu, it lacked political presence in Transylvania. The party had a strong influence in the Yiddish school movement in Bessarabia, but was in competition over political support with the Zionists at Poale Zion and the Agudat Yisrael of Haredi Jews. In Bukovina, the Bund was secondary to the Jewish Autonomist movement led by Benno Straucher and his Jewish National People's Party. At the 1922 Senate election in Czernowitz, the Bundist Leon Gheller, standing for the Romanian Social Democratic Party, was defeated by 1,991 votes to 3,800 for Salo Weisselberger.

In the 21st century, leaders of the Cherokee people define themselves as those persons enrolled in one of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes: The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, The Cherokee Nation, and The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. The first live predominantly in North Carolina; the latter two tribes are based in Oklahoma. The Cherokee people have extensive written records, including detailed genealogical records, preserved in the Cherokee language, the Cherokee syllabary, and in the English language. Origins Great Smoky Mountains The Cherokee were members of the Iroquoian language-family of North American Indigenous Peoples, and are believed to have migrated from the Great Lakes area, where most of such language families were located, to the Southeastern Woodlands. The Cherokee were first encountered by European colonists in the southeastern United States. They historically speak the Cherokee language, which has its own form of writing, the Cherokee syllabary. In 1540, at the time of the Hernando de Soto expedition, the Southeastern Woodlands region was inhabited by several mound-building cultures that are described in detail in the expedition records. These Indigenous peoples were the Coosa and a chiefdom owing allegiance to Tuskaloosa, who were both ancestors of the future Muscogee Creek confederacy of tribes. Also described were the mound-building Chicsa or Yuchi. The expedition also described the mound town of Joara, which is believed to have been a chiefdom of the Mississippian culture, which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and into the Southeast. The powerful Cherokee were well established at the southern end of the Great Appalachian Valley by the 1720s, having displaced the Muscogee Creek and other tribes.Brown, John P. \\"Eastern Cherokee Chiefs.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 16, No. 1, March 1938. (retrieved 21 Sept 2009) Other indigenous peoples also occupied territory and villages in Eastern Tennessee as late as the Long Hunter expeditions of the 1760s, who recorded encountering Yuchi and Siouan-speaking traders and villages. Several Mississippian culture sites were at one time misattributed to the Cherokee, who did not build earthwork mounds. These included Moundville and Etowah Mounds which are associated with the Mississippian descendants, the Muscogee Creek. later Cherokee culture shows some association with Pisgah Phase sites. Artifacts from historic Cherokee villages featured iconography from the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, but this is believed likely to have been due to assimilation of survivors by the Cherokee expansion. Corn is traditionally central to the religious ceremonies of the Cherokee, especially the Green Corn Ceremony, a tradition shared with other Iroquois-language tribes, as well as with the Creek, Choctaw, Yuchi, and Seminole. A Cherokee myth recorded in the late 18th century says that a \\"Moon-eyed people\\" had lived in the Cherokee regions before they arrived. The group was described in 1797 by Colonel Leonard Marbury to Benjamin Smith Barton. According to Marbury, when the Cherokee arrived in the area they had encountered a \\"moon- eyed\\" people who could not see in the day-time. Early culture Prior to the 17th century, Cherokees lived in western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee Much of what is known about pre-19th century Cherokee culture and society comes from American writer John Howard Payne, whose papers describe what he learned. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional societal structure in which a \\"white\\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. According to Payne, this group, which was hereditary and described as priestly, was responsible for religious activities such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \\"red\\" organization, was responsible for warfare. Warfare was considered a polluting activity, which required the purification of the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century. The reasons for the change have been debated, with the origin of the decline often located with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the Ani-kutani (\\"An√≠-\\" is a prefix referring to a group of individuals, while the meaning of \\"kut√°ni\\" is unknown).Irwin 1992. Early ethnographer James Mooney, who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.Mooney, p. 392. By the time of Mooney, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity. Another major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the didanvwisgi (Cherokee:·èó·èì·èÖ·è´·èç·é©), Cherokee medicine men, using the Cherokee syllabary created by Sequoyahin the 1820s. Initially only the didanvwisgi used these materials, which were considered extremely powerful. Later, the writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people. Unlike most other Indians in the American southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an Iroquoian language. Since the Great Lakes region was the core of Iroquoian- language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. However, some argue that the Iroquois all migrated north from the southeast, with the Tuscarora breaking off from that group during the migration and settling in South Carolina. Linguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting a split between the peoples in the distant past. Glottochronology studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 B.C.Glottochronology from: Lounsbury, Floyd (1961), and Mithun, Marianne (1981), cited in Nicholas A. Hopkins, The Native Languages of the Southeastern United States. The ancient settlement of Kituwa on the Tuckasegee River, formerly next to and now part of Qualla Boundary (the reservation of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), is often cited as the original Cherokee settlement in the Southeast. 16th century: Spanish contact The first known Cherokee contact with Europeans was in late May 1540, when a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto passed through Cherokee country near present-day Embreeville, Tennessee, which the Spaniards referred to as Guasili. De Soto's expedition visited many of the villages later identified as Cherokee in Georgia and Tennessee. It recorded them as ruled by the Coosa chiefdom, while a Chalaque nation was recorded as living around the Keowee River where North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia meet.Mooney New infectious diseases carried by the Spaniards and their animals decimated the Cherokee and other Eastern tribes, who had no immunity.Hill, 65 A second Spanish expedition came through Cherokee country in 1567 led by Juan Pardo. He was seeking an overland route to Mexican silver mines; the Spanish mistakenly thought the Appalachians were connected to a range in Mexico. Spanish troops built six forts in the interior southeast, including at Joara, a Mississippian culture chiefdom. They visited the Cherokee towns Nikwasi, Estatoe, Tugaloo, Conasauga, and Kituwa, but ultimately failed to gain dominion over the region and retreated to the coast.Hill, 66‚Äì67 The Native Americans rebelled against their efforts, killing all but one of the garrison soldiers among the six forts. Pardo had already returned to his base. The Spanish did not try to settle this area again. 17th century: English contact Sir Alexander Cumming to England in 1730. The first Anglo-Cherokee contact may have been in 1656, when English settlers in Virginia Colony recorded that six to seven hundred \\"Mahocks, Nahyssans and Rechahecrians\\" had encamped at Bloody Run, located on the eastern edge of present-day Richmond, Virginia. They were driven off by a combined force of English and tributary Pamunkey, but the Pamunkey chief Totopotomoi was slain in the battle. While the first two named groups are considered to be Virginia Siouan, the identity of the Rechahecrians has been much debated. Historians have noted that the name closely resembles that of the Eriechronon, commonly known as the Erie tribe, an Iroquoian people who had been driven away from the southern shore of Lake Erie in 1654 during the Beaver Wars by the powerful Iroquois Five Nations. The anthropologist Martin Smith theorized that remnants of the Erie migrated to Virginia after the wars. (1986:131‚Äì32) Robert J. Conley (Cherokee) and a few other historians have suggested that this tribe was identical with the Cherokee but this view does not have a consensus.Conley, A Cherokee Encyclopedia, p. 3 The Erie language is too scarcely attested to place its relationship to Cherokee or other Iroquoian languages. In 1673, fur trader Abraham Wood from Fort Henry (modern Petersburg, Virginia) sent two Englishmen, James Needham and Gabriel Arthur, to Overhill Cherokee county. Wood hoped to forge a direct trading connection with the Cherokee to bypass the Occaneechi people, who acted as middlemen on the Trading Path. The two colonial Virginians likely made contact with the Cherokee. Wood called the people Rickohockens in his book of the expedition. The map accompanying the book, showed the Rickohockens occupying all of present-day southwestern Virginia, southeastern Kentucky, northwestern North Carolina and the northeastern tip of Tennessee, areas that have become known as historic Cherokee territory. Needham departed with a guide nicknamed 'Indian John,' while Arthur was left behind in Chota to learn the Cherokee language. On his journey, Needham argued with 'Indian John', who killed him. 'Indian John' tried to encourage his people to kill Arthur, too, but the chief prevented this. Disguised as a Cherokee by covering his skin in clay and ash, Arthur accompanied the Chota chief on raids of Spanish settlements in Florida, Indian communities on the east coast, and Shawnee towns on the Ohio River. In 1674 he was captured by the Shawnee, who discovered that he was a white man. The Shawnee allowed him to return to Chota. In June 1674, the Chota chief escorted Arthur back to his English settlement in Virginia. By the late 17th century, colonial traders from both Virginia and South Carolina were making regular journeys to Cherokee lands, but few wrote about their experiences. The nature of and events of the early trading contact period have been pieced together by historians' examination of records of colonial laws and lawsuits involving traders. The English and other Europeans were seeking mainly deerskins, raw material for the booming European leather industry, in exchange for which they traded European \\"trade goods\\" that featured technology new to the Native Americans, such as iron and steel tools (kettles, knives, etc.), firearms, gunpowder, and ammunition. In 1705, traders complained that they were losing business to the Indian slave trade, instigated and supported by Governor James Moore of South Carolina. Moore had commissioned people to \\"set upon, assault, kill, destroy, and take captive as many Indians as possible\\". When the captives were sold, slave traders split profits with the Governor.Mooney, p. 32. Although colonial governments from an early period prohibited selling alcohol to Indians, traders commonly used rum, and later whiskey, as common items of trade. During the early historic era, Europeans wrote of several Cherokee town groups, usually using the terms Lower, Middle, and Overhill towns to designate the towns, in relation to their locations in the Piedmont and across the Allegheny Mountains. The Lower Towns were situated on the headwater streams of the Savannah River, mainly in present-day western South Carolina and northeastern Georgia. Keowee was one of the chief towns, as was Tugaloo. The Middle Towns were located in present western North Carolina, on the headwater streams of the Tennessee River, such as the upper Little Tennessee River, upper Hiwassee River, and upper French Broad River. Among several chief towns were Nikwasi and Joara, a Mississippian culture chiefdom when recorded during the Spanish construction of Fort San Juan there in 1568. The Overhill Towns were located across the higher mountains in present-day eastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia. Principal towns included Chota, Tellico, and Tanasi. These terms were created and used by Europeans to describe their changing geopolitical relationship with the Cherokee. Two more groups of towns were often listed as part of the three: the Out Towns, whose chief town was Kituwa on the Tuckaseegee River, considered by the Cherokee as their mother town; and the Valley Towns, whose chief town was Tomotley on the Valley River (not the same as Tomotley on the Little Tennessee River). The former shared the dialect of the Middle Towns and the latter that of the Overhill people (later Upper) Towns. Of the southeastern Indian confederacies of the late 17th and early 18th centuries (Creek (Muscogee), Chickasaw, Choctaw, etc.), the Cherokee were one of the most populous and powerful. They were relatively isolated by their hilly and mountainous homeland. They established a small-scale trading system with Virginia in the late 17th century. In the 1690s, the Cherokee founded a much stronger and more important trade relationship with the colony of South Carolina, which was based in the port of Charles Town on the Atlantic coast. By the 18th century, South Carolina overshadowed the Virginia relationship. 18th century history Three Cherokee diplomats in London, 1765 In the 1660s, the Cherokee had given sanctuary to a band of Shawnee. But 50 years later, from 1710 to 1715, the Cherokee and Chickasaw, allied with the English, fought the Shawnee, who were allied with the French, and forced them to move north.Vicki Rozema, Footsteps of the Cherokees (1995), p. 14. The Cherokee were also allied with the English and the Yamasee, and Catawba in late 1712 and early 1713, against the Tuscarora in the Second Tuscarora War. Following their defeat, most of the Tuscarora, another Iroquoian-language tribe, migrated north to New York. By 1722 they had been accepted as the 6th Nation in the League of the Iroquois. In the Southeast, the English and Cherokee began an alliance that remained strong for much of the 18th century. In January 1716, Cherokee warriors murdered a delegation of Muscogee Creek leaders who were visiting at Tugaloo, marking the Cherokee's entry into the Yamasee War. This ended in 1717 with peace treaties between South Carolina and the Creek. Hostility and sporadic raids between the Cherokee and Creek continued for decades.Oatis, Steven J. A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680‚Äì1730. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004. . These raids came to a head at the Battle of Taliwa in 1755 (in present-day Ball Ground, Georgia), resulting in the defeat of the Muscogee. In 1721, the Cherokee ceded lands to South Carolina. In 1730, at Nikwasi, Sir Alexander Cumming persuaded the Cherokee to crown Moytoy of Tellico as \\"Emperor.\\" Moytoy agreed to recognize King George II of Great Britain as the Cherokee protector. Seven prominent Cherokee, including Attakullakulla, traveled with Cuming back to London, England. The Cherokee delegation signed the Treaty of Whitehall with the British. Moytoy's son, Amo-sgasite (Dreadful Water) attempted to succeed him as \\"Emperor\\" in 1741, but the Cherokee elected their own leader, Old Hop of Chota (sometimes spelled or recorded as Echota). Political power among the Cherokee remained decentralized, with towns acting autonomously. In 1735 the Cherokee were estimated to have sixty-four towns and villages and 6000 fighting men. A significant interaction between European and American peoples was embodied in the assimilation of Gottlieb Priber into Cherokee society, a German radical who advocated for a trans-tribal region-wide Indian confederation to oppose European colonization of Native land. In 1738 and 1739 smallpox epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity to the new infectious disease. It was endemic among English and European populations, who had been living (and dying) with the virus for centuries. Nearly half the Cherokee population died within a year. Many other ‚Äîpossibly hundreds ‚Äîof Cherokee survivors committed suicide, due to the disfigurement of their skin from the disease. From 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in North Georgia. The Cherokee were victorious in the Battle of Taliwa. British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to confront the French during the years of the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years War in Europe. These included Fort Loudoun, along the Little Tennessee River near Chota, a major Cherokee town. In 1756 the Cherokee fought alongside the British in the French and Indian War; however, serious misunderstandings between the two allies arose quickly, resulting in the 1760 Anglo-Cherokee War. In the peace treaty ending the Seven Years War, Britain took over the North American territories of defeated France east of the Mississippi River. King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbidding British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, attempting to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes, but the prohibition proved difficult to enforce.Rozema, pp. 17‚Äì23. In 1769‚Äì72, predominantly Virginian settlers squatting on Cherokee lands in Tennessee, formed the Watauga Association.\\"Watauga Association\\". North Carolina History Project. (retrieved 21 Sept 2009) In \\"Kentuckee\\", Daniel Boone and his party tried to create a settlement in what would become the Transylvania colony. Some Shawnee, Lenape (Delaware), Mingo, and Cherokee attacked a scouting and foraging party that included Boone's son. This sparked the beginning of what was known as Dunmore's War (1773‚Äì1774). In 1776, allied with the Shawnee and led by Cornstalk, Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, the Washington District and North Carolina in the Second Cherokee War. Nancy Ward (Overhill Cherokee and a niece of Dragging Canoe), had warned pioneer settlers of the impending attacks. European-American militias retaliated, destroying over 50 Cherokee towns. In 1777, most of the surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the newly established states during the American Revolutionary War. Dragging Canoe and his band, however, moved to the area near present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee, establishing 11 new towns. Chickamauga was his headquarters and his band became known as the Chickamauga; some people mistakenly described them as a distinct tribe of Cherokee. From here he led fighting of a guerrilla-style war against settlers, which became known as the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars. The Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse, signed 7 November 1794 with , ended the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars. 19th century Historical marker at New Echota Tah-Chee (Dutch), A Cherokee Chief, 1837. Published in History of the Indian Tribes of North America. The Cherokees organized a national government led by Principal Chiefs Little Turkey (1788‚Äì1801), Black Fox (1801‚Äì1811), and Pathkiller (1811‚Äì1827). The seat of the Upper Towns was at Ustanali (near Calhoun, Georgia), also the titular seat of the Nation. Former warriors James Vann and his prot√©g√©s The Ridge (formerly known as Pathkiller) and Charles R. Hicks, made up the \\"Cherokee Triumvirate\\" and the dominant leaders, particularly of the younger, more acculturated generation. These leaders had had more dealings with European Americans and tended to favor acculturation, formal education, and their methods of farming. Facing removal, members of the Lower Cherokee, who lived in areas of the Piedmont of North Carolina and Georgia, were the first to move west. Remaining Lower Town leaders, such as Young Dragging Canoe and Sequoyah, were strong advocates of voluntary relocation in order to preserve the Cherokee people, as they believed that the increasing number of European-American settlers, backed by the military of the US, were too much to resist. Removal era In 1815, the US government established a Cherokee Reservation in Arkansas.Logan, Charles Russell. \\"The Promised Land: The Cherokees, Arkansas, and Removal, 1794‚Äì1839.\\" Arkansas Historic Preservation Program. 1997 (retrieved 21 Sept 2009) The reservation boundaries extended from north of the Arkansas River to the southern bank of the White River. The Bowl, Sequoyah, Spring Frog, and Tatsi (Dutch) and their bands settled there. These Cherokee became known as \\"Old Settlers,\\" or Western Cherokee. John Ross became the Principal Chief of the tribe in 1828 and remained the chief until he died in Washington, DC in 1866. During the American Civil War, he led the minority group of Cherokee who allied with the Union. He and followers withdrew because of the hostility from Cherokee who allied with the Confederacy. =Treaty party= Among the Cherokee in the early 19th century, John Ross led the battle to resist their removal from their lands in the Southeast. Ross's supporters, commonly referred to as the \\"National Party,\\" were opposed by a group known as the \\"Ridge Party\\" or the \\"Treaty Party\\". The Treaty Party, believing that the Cherokee could get the best deal from the US by signing a treaty and negotiating terms, represented the people by signing the Treaty of New Echota. They believed that removal was finally inevitable, given the numbers and might of the Americans. Among the terms and conditions for removal, they agreed to cede much of the remaining Cherokee lands in the Southeast, in exchange for lands in Indian Territory, plus annuities, supplies and other incentives. =Trail of Tears= Chief John Ross, ca. 1840 Cherokees were displaced from their ancestral lands in northern Georgia and the Carolinas in a period of rapidly expanding white population. Some of the rapid expansion was due to a gold rush around Dahlonega, Georgia in the 1830s. President Andrew Jackson said removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction, which he said was the fate of \\"the Mohegan, the Narragansett, and the Delaware\\".Wishart, p. 120. There is ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques. A late 20th-century analysis shows that their area was in general in a state of economic surplus.Wishart 1995. Jackson was under immense pressure from European Americans who wanted to take over and develop the Cherokee lands for themselves. In June 1830, a delegation of Cherokee led by Chief Ross brought their grievances about tribal sovereignty over state government to the US Supreme Court in the Cherokee Nation v. Georgia case. In the case Worcester v. Georgia, the United States Supreme Court held that Cherokee Native Americans were entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments. Worcester v. Georgia is considered one of the most important decisions in law dealing with Native Americans But the Georgia government essentially ignored it, and removal pressure continued. The majority of Cherokees were forcibly relocated westward to Indian Territory in 1838‚Äì1839, a migration known as the Trail of Tears or in Cherokee ·èÖ·éæ ·èì·é§·é≥ ·è®·è± or Nvna Daula Tsvyi (Cherokee: The Trail Where They Cried). This took place under the authority of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The harsh treatment the Cherokee received at the hands of white settlers caused some to enroll to emigrate west.Perdue (2000), p. 565. As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African-Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European-Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears. On June 22, 1839, in the Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory, Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot were assassinated by a party of twenty- five Ross supporters. They included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald Spear, James Spear, Joseph Spear, Hunter, and others. They had considered the Treaty of New Echota to be an attempt to sell communal lands, a capital offense. Stand Watie was among the men who were attacked, but he survived and escaped to Arkansas. =Eastern Band= C√≥l-lee, a Band Chief, painted by George Catlin, 1834. Some Cherokee in the western area of North Carolina were able to evade removal, and they became the East Band of Cherokee Indians. William Holland Thomas, a white storeowner and state legislator from Jackson County, North Carolina, helped more than 600 Cherokee from Qualla Town to obtain North Carolina citizenship. As they were willing to give up tribal citizenship, they were exempted from forced removal. Over 400 other Cherokee either hid from Federal troops in the remote Snowbird Mountains, under the leadership of Tsali (·è£·éµ),\\"Tsali.\\" History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians). (2007-03-10) or negotiated directly with the state government to stay locally. Many were from the former Valley Towns area around the Cheoah River. An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states. Many were of mixed-blood or mixed-race descent, and some were Cherokee women married to white men, and their families. Together, these groups were the ancestors of most of the current members of what is now one of three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Civil War The American Civil War was devastating for both East and Western Cherokee. Those Cherokee aided by William Thomas in North Carolina became the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders, fighting for the Confederacy in the American Civil War.\\"Will Thomas.\\" History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians). (2007-03-10) The Cherokee in Indian Territory split into Confederate (the majority) and Union factions. They were influenced both by many leaders being slaveholders and by Confederate promises to establish an Indian state if they won the war. There was warfare within the tribe, and many Union supporters escaped to Kansas to survive. Reconstruction and late 19th century Yankton, and Sisseton 1909. The United States required the Cherokee and other tribes that had allied with the Confederacy to make new treaties. Among the new terms was a requirement to emancipate their slaves, and to provide citizenship to those freedmen who wanted to remain with the Cherokee Nation. If they went to US territory, the African Americans would become US citizens. By an 1866 treaty with the US government, the Cherokee agreed to grant tribal citizenship to freedmen who had been held by them as slaves. Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had with whites, and there were numerous Black Cherokee. Often the identity of the mother influenced whether children were brought up in Cherokee or African-American culture and identity. Many Cherokee Freedmen became active politically within the tribe. The US government also acquired the Cherokee to grant easement rights to the western part of the territory, which became the Oklahoma Territory, for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off and more readily assimilated if each family owned its own land, in the widespread model of subsistence farming in the US. The Dawes Act of 1887 provided for the breakup of communal tribal lands and allotments to individual heads of households of tribal members. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. This also opened up later sales of land by individuals to people outside the tribe. Map of the present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue) The Curtis Act of 1898 advanced the break-up of Native American government. For the Oklahoma Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems by the U.S. Federal Government. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a state, which was being promoted by many speculators. By the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokees were laboring under the constraints of a segregated society in the South. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively disfranchise all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed Jim Crow laws that divided society into \\"white\\" and \\"colored\\", mostly to control freedmen, but the Native Americans were included on the colored side. They suffered the same racial segregation and disfranchisement as did former slaves and their children. Blacks and Native Americans would not regain their rights as US citizens until the Civil Rights Movement and passage of national civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.

It was established in 2009 to promote public understanding of the British Constitution and to work to encourage informed debate between legislators, academics and the public about proposals for constitutional change. The Constitution Society does not take any position on the merits of specific reform proposals, and neither endorses nor opposes the introduction of a written constitution. History The Constitution Society was founded in 2009 by Nat le Roux. It has since grown rapidly in interest and membership, and in 2017 Sir Malcolm Jack was appointed as the first President of the Constitution Society. Aims Though neutral about substantive constitutional issues, the Constitution Society strongly supports due process and good government and believes that constitutional change should only be introduced to address genuine deficiencies, and only after careful analysis and broad consultation.

In 2008 they were the first Canadians since Glenn Gould to play at Philharmonic Hall, in St. Petersburg Russia. They have also made several recordings including their acclaimed CD The heart has its reasons for Warner Classics UK, and their most recent CD Estuary, was released in 2015. The Togni Trio, a jazz ensemble with drummer Malcolm Gould and bassist George Koeller, performs throughout Canada and the United States, and has two released recordings. Togni also regularly collaborates with artists such as jazz saxophonist Mike Murley and cellist Jeffrey Ziegler. Togni was born in Pembroke, Ontario in 1959, and is the son of organ master Victor Togni. He spent his early years in Toronto where he attended St. Michael's Choir School. He later went on to study at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, studying organ with Frederick Geoghegan and composition with Stephen Chatman. He went on to study organ and improvisation in Paris France with the great French organist Jean Langlais. Togni also studied composition with Allain Gaussin at the Schola Cantorum in Paris where he was awarded first prize in composition. For over twenty years, Togni has also been a broadcaster, hosting radio programs for CBC Radio 2, including That Time of the Night, the award-winning Stereo Morning, Weekender and Choral Concert. He currently resides in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

After the defeat of the 1905 Russian revolution, several members of the Russian Bund fled to Bukovina (part of Austria-Hungary), where they were received by local Jewish socialists. The Bukovina Jewish socialist members of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria began orienting themselves towards Bundist ideas and an informal Bundist grouping emerged. In neighbouring Galicia, the Bundist-oriented Jewish Social Democratic Party was founded in 1905. The Bukovina Bundistn (\\"Bundists\\") were sympathetic towards the Galician party, but were wary of publicly joining it as this would have resulted in a breach with the Austrian party. The Bukovina Bundistn sent a two-member observer delegation to the 1908 congress of the Galician party. In the fall of 1908 an educational association called Morgenrot, albeit officially apolitical, was founded along Bundist lines. Soon thereafter, the Bukovina Bundistn registered a formal political association named 'Bund'. After its foundation, the Bund association began campaigning for the recognition of a separate Jewish nationality in the Austrian census of 1910. In order to be able to register themselves as an association with the Austrian authorities, the organization had to adhere to the stringent rules of Austria-Hungary for political associations. Thus formal membership was restricted to male Austrian citizens aged 24 years or above. The Bukovina Bund merged with the Jewish Social Democratic Party of Galicia in 1912.Joseph Kissman, The History of the Jewish Worker Movement Bund in Bukovina, in Hugo Gold (ed.), History of the Jews in the Bukowina, Tel Aviv, Vol. 1, 1958, pp. 129-144 After the merger, the party adopted the name 'Jewish Social Democratic Party in Galicia and Bukovina'.Brenner, Michael and Penslar, Derek Jonathan.

Personal fulfillment is an ongoing journey for a human individual. It commences when an individual starts becoming conscious of oneself and one's surroundings. It is then that one's exploration begins to realize what one is capable of. Like the tentative steps of a child that invariably lead to a few falls followed by seeking for some help from people around. Then the joy of achievement when one can successfully take a few steps without falling. The appreciation of people around is a key component of achieving personal fulfillment. It is invariably followed by a sense of habituality (i.e., being able to perform any act, such as walking, habitually). Then boredom. Followed by a yearning for the next horizon, whatever it may be for an individual. Key components then of personal fulfilment are: # Consciousness - of oneself and the environment # Consciousness - of people around oneself # Exploration - of something new that one may be capable of # Initial failure - as one's initial attempts at exploration leads to stumbles and falls # Trying - again and again till such time that one does not stumble and fall # Experiencing joy - of having tried and achieved something new # Commendation and applause - of those around, especially of the ones that the individual values # Boredom - as one performs the 'not so new anymore' task as a matter of habit # Then back to step three for something new to explore # The cycle continuing throughout one's life as the individual grows and expands into newer and unexplored dimensions of personal fulfilment Consciousness is the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been defined as sentience, awareness, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to feel wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind. Consciousness of the self is a complex experience for an individual being. A prime aspect of consciousness and awareness of the self is the awakening to one's capabilities and potential. The awakening to one's capabilities and potential is a continuous process throughout the period of existence of a being - from the birth of the physical being through the expiration of the same. Inherent to this process of being is a drive or a force that seems to be part and parcel of being in the physical being on earth. This drive manifests itself from the start of one's being - like a child crying as soon as it is born. It is the awakening of the child to its capabilities of exercising its vocal cords. The drive continues through the life of one's being (albeit in varying degrees of forcefulness and momentum at various points in time) through to death of the physical being as we know. This drive is primal and is the single force that leads to exploration.

Icelandic State Architect Gu√∞j√≥n Sam√∫elsson (1887‚Äì1950) was the first to draw a model of the church and it was according to his design that the foundations were cast. However work was postponed because of World War II. In 1953, architects Sigur√∞ur Gu√∞mundsson (1885-1958) and Eir√≠kur Einarsson (1907-1969) came together to design the current concrete church, with its brick interiors, copper roof and tower. Icelandic sculptor Ger√∞ur Helgad√≥ttir (1928- 1975) designed the stained glass artwork of the church. The frescoes around the altar are the work of Finnish artist Lennart Segerstr√•le (1892‚Äì1975).

It is not necessary to specify that [S,r] ‚äÜ S, because anticommutativity of the Lie product causes [s,r] = ‚àí[r,s] ‚àà S. The Lie \\"normalizer\\" of S is the largest subring of L in which S is a Lie ideal. Comments Often, when right or left ideals are the additive subgroups of R of interest, the idealizer is defined more simply by taking advantage of the fact that multiplication by ring elements is already absorbed on one side. Explicitly, :\\\\mathbb{I}_R(T)={r\\\\in R \\\\mid rT\\\\subseteq T } if T is a right ideal, or :\\\\mathbb{I}_R(L)={r\\\\in R \\\\mid Lr\\\\subseteq L } if L is a left ideal.

She was notably a principal artist at the Vienna State Opera for over a decade and was a frequent performer at the Salzburg Festival. She performed a broad opera repertoire that encompassed French, German, Italian, Czech, and Hungarian operas. The latter part of her career was dedicated mainly to performing the German operetta literature at the Vienna Volksoper. A very beautiful woman, she was a greatly admired Angele in Richard Heuberger‚Äôs Der Opernball. Biography Born in Budapest, R√©thy studied singing with in her native city and in Vienna. In 1934 she made her professional opera debut at the Hungarian State Opera House as the Shepherd in Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user. She remained at that house for the next three years, drawing particular acclaim as Mica√´la in Georges Bizet's Carmen. She also appeared as a guest artist at a number of opera houses in Central Europe. In 1937, R√©thy became a principal artist at the Vienna State Opera, where she committed until 1949. She made her first appearance at that house as Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust with Jussi Bj√∂rling in the title role. Her other roles with the company included Agathe in Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz, Countess Almaviva in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, Alice Ford in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff, Desdemona in Verdi's Otello, Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Lauretta in Giacomo Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, Ma≈ôenka in Bed≈ôich Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Micaela, Mim√¨ in Puccini's La boh√®me, Pamina in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Violetta Val√©ry in Verdi's La traviata, and the title role in George Frideric Handel's Rodelinda among others. While singing in Vienna, R√©thy was active as a guest artist with many European opera houses. She remained a frequent performer at the Hungarian State Opera House and appeared often as a guest at the Bavarian State Opera, Berlin State Opera, and Semperoper under such conductors as Karl B√∂hm, Victor de Sabata, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Hans Knappertsbusch, Clemens Krauss, and Josef Krips. She became internationally famous through her many appearances at the Salzburg Festival where she sang Susanna in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro (1937‚Äì1939, 1941 with Ezio Pinza as Figaro), Sophie in Richard Strauss'a Der Rosenkavalier (1937‚Äì1939), Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni (1950), and Europa in the first public performance of Strauss‚Äôs Die Liebe der Danae (1952). She also appeared at the 1940 Salzburg Festival in an operetta concert. In 1940, she was supposed to appear in several roles at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, but the events of World War II made this impossible. After World War II, R√©thy became a highly lauded performer in operettas, beginning with a triumphant portrayal of Rosalinde in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus under the baton of Herbert von Karajan at the Vienna State Opera. From 1948 she sang frequently at the Vienna Volksoper in the operettas of Emmerich K√°lm√°n, Franz Leh√°r, and Strauss. Her first performances at the house were as Annina in Eine Nacht in Venedig and Saffi in Der Zigeunerbaron. Her operetta repertoire grew to include Ang√®le Didier in Der Graf von Luxemburg, Angele in Der Opernball, Fiametta in Boccaccio, Gabriele in Wiener Blut, Hanna Glawari in Die Lustige Witwe, and Laura in Der Bettelstudent among others. R√©thy retired from the stage in 1968, after which she was committed to teaching singing in Vienna. She died there at the age of 91 in 2004. She was married to Dr. Vincent Imre. Her son, Laszl√≥ Imre, became a successful conductor.
