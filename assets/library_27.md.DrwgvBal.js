It is a plump frog, with a wide, short head, and a skin fold from the eye to the shoulder. The fore legs are very short and the hands are large, with broad discs on the finger tips. The hind legs are longer and the feet have partially webbed toes and disc-like toe pads. The colour of the dorsal surface is black with grey markings and the limbs are grey with dark bands. The throat region is reddish-brown and the belly is pale grey. The male has reddish-brown femoral glands on his hind legs and a vocal sac that inflates sidewards. Distribution and habitat This species is known only from the Western Ghat Mountains in the vicinity of the Jog Falls on the River Sharavathi in Karnataka State, India, at a height of above sea level. It lives in seasonal streams or among vegetation close to the streams which swell during the monsoon season. Reproduction Breeding takes place during the monsoon season. The male chooses a suitable spot for egg deposition on a branch, leaf, or steep rock about a metre (yard) above a stream. Here, he calls to attract a female. When she arrives, he grasps her in a vigorous amplexus, but the eggs are not laid until after he dismounts. The female attaches the cluster of eggs to the spot chosen by the male and then departs. The male then stands over the eggs. Over the period of about eight days until the eggs hatch, both parents remain close to the clutch, often straddling it, presumably preventing the eggs from becoming dehydrated and preventing predators from eating them. When the tadpoles emerge from the gelatinous coating of the eggs, they fall into the water below, where they continue their development. They undergo metamorphosis in about 32 days.

Early life Alpaidze was born on 7 November 1916 to Georgian village peasants and raised in the settlement of Kursebi in Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire). He finished a seven-year educational curriculum and graduated from the Kutaisi Industrial College in 1937, primarily studying heat and energy development technology. For two years he worked as an electrician in a hydroelectric power plant before entering Red Army service in 1938. In 1940 Nadiradze graduated from the Tbilisi School of Artillery. Great Patriotic War At the outbreak of war in June 1941, as a major Alpaidze was already the deputy commander of an artillery battalion of the 36th artillery regiment, Soviet 43rd army. He participated in the defensive operations around the river of Gum from August to October 1943 and during the Battle of Moscow. In that period he also became a member of the CPSU. In September 1943, Alpaidze took command over the 36th Artillery Regiment which by then was already merged to the 7th Guard Army. He and his regiment took part in the crossing of the Dnieper and from 1 to 8 October, repulsed dozens of attacks at the bridgehead of the river, destroying numerous German tanks, guns, armoured vehicles, troop carriers and one infantry battalion. Afterwards the regiment moved to the Battle of Romania and the Vienna Offensive. In March 1945 Major Alpaidze distinguished himself again during the Balaton Offensive when his newly assigned 972nd Artillery Regiment destroyed a number of German tanks and around 30 firing points, while at the same time suppressing six enemy artillery batteries. On 11 March, on a single day, he got wounded a total of three times but still managed to coordinate and control the fire of his units. For courage and heroism in battle, Alpaidze was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union as well as the Order of Lenin on 28 April 1945. Cold War After World War II, Galaktion Yeliseyevich Alpaidze continued service in the Southern Group of Soviet Forces, later applying to the Dzerzhinsky Military Academy. When graduating, he became Colonel and took over command of an Infantry Artillery Division stationed in Stalingrad. Further, in 1957 he graduated from the Voroshilov General Staff Academy and was promoted Major General. In the years 1953‚Äì1955 Alpaidze was commander of the training ground and anti aircraft artillery in the North Caucasus Military District and in 1957‚Äì1959 commander of the 4th Artillery Division. In 1959, due to his knowledge about thermal technology, he was appointed deputy head of the missile test side in Kapustin Yar. At the end of 1962 during the Cuban Crisis he led an expedition for the choice of a new landfill in order to test new missile technology for advanced military purpose. As the chief and organizer of the highly classified research missile and space weapons test range, Alpaidze was responsible for the development of ballistic and anti- ballistic rocket systems. Under his leadership, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome was constructed and extended, making it the largest Soviet test site and the busiest in the world. That area's launch facilities were to be the first to execute launches or react to preemptive strikes in case of sudden outbreak of war and thus were on constant alert status. Alpaidze had to be always at the ready to receive direct order for such action. Even though the silos were not constantly armed with nuclear warheads, primary targets in the US were maintained, such as Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. From 1963 to 1975 Lieutenant General Alpaidze would personally supervise about 700 launches of missiles and spacecraft as head of the State Scientific Research Center until his retirement in 1975. Post-war From 1975 to 1992 Alpaizde worked as deputy director and chief designer in the Moscow Institute of Heat Engineering, before he died in May 2006 at the age of 89. His body was interred at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

Initially the main purpose of the Yasme Foundation was to help raise money for Weil's expeditions and to organize the distribution of his QSL cards. He was one of the first to travel to more than one location to operate, and to travel from place to place, often solo in a sailboat and lugging hundreds of pounds of radio equipment, specifically to provide DXers with a ‚Äònew one‚Äô. When he retired from amateur radio, the foundation closely cooperated with the radio expeditions of Lloyd and Iris Colvin. The Colvins perfected the DXpedition and took it into the modern age in the 1970s and 1980s, with operations from more than 100 countries, using modern transport methods and state of the art radio equipment.

It is the 178th episode of the show, and the first episode without former lead Charlie Sheen as Charlie Harper. The episode was watched by 28.74 million people on its original air date, making it the most watched episode of Two and a Half Men. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, mostly for its cast replacement and poor improv, though Sheen was reported to have enjoyed the episode and praised Kutcher's performance. Plot Picking up where \\"That Darn Priest\\" left off, it is revealed that Charlie Harper (Charlie Sheen) is dead, having been killed in an accident, offscreen, while on his weekend getaway to Paris with Rose (Melanie Lynskey). The episode opens with Alan (Jon Cryer) delivering the eulogy at Charlie's funeral. Several of Charlie's ex- girlfriends are in attendance, such as Mia, Courtney, Isabella, Chelsea and even Miss Pasternak (now played again by Missi Pyle). They heckle Alan while he attempts to speak and Courtney (Jenny McCarthy) expresses dismay about it not being an open-casket ceremony. Alan yields the pulpit to Rose, who reveals that Charlie proposed to her in Paris. A few days later, however, Rose caught him in the shower with another woman, something everyone murmurs Charlie would do while Berta (Conchata Ferrell) announces the thought with a laugh. Rose then goes on to explain she forgave him and was greatly saddened when Charlie \\"accidentally\\" fell in front of a moving train the following day. Alan suspects that Rose might have had something to do with Charlie's death, but keeps silent while Berta quietly states \\"Never cross a crazy woman\\" and Jake (Angus T. Jones) claiming he is hungry after hearing Rose's gruesome yet oddly appetizing description of how Charlie's body was demolished (describing it as a \\"balloon full of meat\\"). Discovering that Charlie's house has three mortgages and that Alan is unable to afford the payments, Evelyn (Holland Taylor) puts the house up for sale. Several people consider buying the house, but eventually decide against it for one reason or another. First, John Stamos (appearing as himself), decides against it because he said that the place has bad memories. One bad memory includes John and Charlie having sex with a prostitute in the house one night; when the prostitute passed out, they kept going because Charlie said to. Second, the house is not purchased by Dharma & Greg (Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson), who decide against it because Greg said it was not \\"practical\\" and that the commute downtown would \\"kill\\" him. Some time later, Alan receives Charlie's cremated remains, and shares a heartfelt goodbye with his late brother, telling him how much he loves him and will truly miss him. Given the impossibility of fulfilling Charlie's wish to have his ashes be swallowed by Pamela Anderson (he also turns down taking him to live at Evelyn's, claiming \\"That's how horror movies start\\"), Alan decides to sprinkle the remains on the beach. As he goes to do so, he is startled by a young man (Ashton Kutcher) standing on the deck, causing him to spill Charlie's ashes all over the living room. Berta quips her classic line, \\"I ain't cleaning him up.\\" The stranger asks to use the phone, and reveals that he was attempting suicide because his wife had left him. After phoning his wife and being rejected again, the stranger introduces himself to Alan as Walden Schmidt, a billionaire who made his money by selling out to Microsoft. After Walden asks for a wetsuit so that he can try to drown himself again, Alan offers to take him to Pavlov's bar. The two pick up a pair of women who are sympathetic towards Walden. The four return to Charlie's house, which is now Alan's, where Alan offers to make drinks. While he is away, the two women lead Walden upstairs where they have sex with him in Charlie's room, leaving Alan downstairs and alone. Annoyed, Alan tells Charlie's ashes (which are in a Black & Decker DustBuster) to shut up because of the irony and puts them in the garbage. The next morning, a naked Walden goes into the kitchen, meets Berta, who is impressed by his endowment and tells Alan about what happened the night before. Walden also announces his intent to buy the house. As Judith (Marin Hinkle) comes by to drop Jake off for the weekend, they walk in on Walden hugging Alan out of gratitude for his friendship. Judith says \\"I like him.\\" and then the episode ends with a \\"To be continued\\" message. Production This episode was written by series regulars Chuck Lorre, Lee Aronsohn, Eddie Gorodetsky, and Jim Patterson, directed by series regular James Widdoes, and was taped on August 5, 2011 to a full and enthusiastic audience, long after the conclusion of the eighth production season, which was put to an end in February because of Sheen's comments on Lorre. Kutcher was announced as Sheen's replacement for the series on May 13, 2011, after Sheen was fired on March 7, 2011. This is the second sitcom Kutcher has starred in, after his career-debut role in That '70s Show, which was beginning its sixth season when Two and a Half Men premiered in 2003. Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson reprised their roles as Dharma and Greg Montgomery for the first time in nearly a decade. Elfman previously played a different character on Two and a Half Men. However, Elfman and Gibson were only credited as an unnamed couple. The couple's chemistry is noticeably darker than in Dharma & Greg, with Gibson's character making sarcastic mentions of divorce and suicide. Elfman and Gibson's co-star, Joel Murray, guest starred as a mail delivery guy in the episode. This is the first episode on the show to feature full nudity (albeit censored by pixelation). The Chuck Lorre Productions vanity card is just a picture of three tin cans, but one of them is placed sideways. Denise Richards reportedly turned down the chance to appear in the episode out of respect for Sheen. Reception =Ratings= With 28.74 million viewers in its original airing, the episode was the most watched in the history of the show. It scored a 10.7/25 rating/share in the 18-49 age group. At one point, the audience peaked at 31 million viewers with an 11.4/26 rating/share. Including DVR ratings, which added 4.09 million viewers, the episode was watched by a total of 32.83 million viewers with a 12.5 18-49 rating. In Canada, the show was watched by approximately 5 million viewers, with 6.7 million watching some of it. In Australia, the show was watched by an average of 2.3 million viewers in the five major capital cities, peaking at 2.6 million, which gave the show its highest ever ratings figure for an episode broadcast in Australia. It was also the most watched show on Australian television that night, beating third placed drama hit Packed to the Rafters by 655,000 viewers. In the United Kingdom, the episode aired on September 20 on digital channel Comedy Central and brought in a total of 803,000 viewers, the most watched programme in the channel's history. =Critical reception= The episode received mixed reviews from numerous critics. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter noted; \\"I couldn't quite figure out if Kutcher was going for vacant, na√Øve, nerdy or astonishingly dumb (for a character who is a billionaire), because I'll never watch this show by choice again.\\" However, he believes Sheen would have the last laugh given \\"his new show ‚Äì if it ever happens ‚Äì will be exponentially funnier than the laugh-free 22 minutes from last night.\\" Richard Lawson of Gawker Media was displeased with how the show dealt with both Charlie Harper's death/funeral and the introduction of Walden Schmidt in one episode. Lawson noted that Kutcher \\"ought to fit in just fine\\", but that viewers would still miss Sheen's \\"teetering-on-the-brink-of-oblivion verve\\" complementing the show's \\"tit jokes and dick jokes and fart jokes occasionally peppered by quips delivered by determinedly non-sexual women characters\\". Lori Rackl of Chicago Sun-Times gave the episode a positive review, stating, \\"Filling the void left by a well established character isn‚Äôt easy, but Kutcher mostly succeeded\\". =Charlie Sheen's reaction= Sheen watched the episode and was extremely pleased. He reportedly felt Charlie Harper's funeral was \\"eerie but fun\\". Sheen also felt that the reveal of Kutcher's character in a cloud of his own character's ashes was particularly enjoyable.

The bark on the lowest of the trunk is hard, rough, dark grey to black then abruptly changes above to smooth, white to grey bark. The leaves on young plants and coppice regrowth are egg-shaped, long and wide and dull bluish grey. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, sometimes curved, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel usually long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between July and September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to funnel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus cambageana was first formally described in 1913 by Joseph Maiden described from a specimen collected in 1912 from Mirtna Station near Charters Towers. The specific epithet (cambageana) honours surveyor and botanist Richard Hind Cambage. Distribution and habitat Dawson River blackbutt is found from near Charleville, Charters Towers and Jericho to the coast of Queensland. It grows in scrubland or open woodland with brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), belah (Casuarina cristata), and wilga (Geijera parviflora). These open woodland communities where it is co-dominant with brigalow are found on clay, alluvial, or sedimentary soils. The presence of E. cambageana is an indicator of sodic soil, which has implications for agriculture in the region.

They assign the right of way to road users by the use of lights in standard colors (red - amber/yellow - green), using a universal color code.  Features  Solar-energy-powered school traffic light Solar Panel Battery Enclosure on Traffic Light Most solar traffic lights use LED lamps as they are more reliable and have more advantages over other lighting devices like CFL lamps as they are more energy efficient, have a longer life span and turn on and turn off quickly. Solar traffic lights contain enclosures which house the batteries and the control panel circuitry. Existing traffic lights can also be upgraded with an auxiliary power source using solar panels for use during power failures. The other parts in a solar traffic light include a charge controller to control the charging and discharging of the battery and a countdown timer which displays the amount of time left before the battery discharges fully. Friday, 20 July 2018  As an auxiliary system  Auxiliary solar traffic lights, in addition to the existing street lights, can be attached near the primary street lights. They are useful in regulating traffic when the primary system fails. The control system in the auxiliary traffic light monitors the primary system and when the primary system fails, it switches to the auxiliary system. Switching from primary system to the auxiliary system and vice versa can also be achieved using a hand-held transmitter unit.  During natural disasters  Portable, solar-powered, traffic light used when construction workers must narrow a 2-way street to a single lane and must emplace traffic controls for safety. Solar traffic lights can also be used during periods following natural disasters, when the existing street lights may not function due to power outages and the traffic is uncontrollable. Street lights used in such scenarios are designed to be portable enough to be carried and operated by police and relief workers wherever traffic needs to be regulated.  Advantages  * Solar traffic lights are self-sufficient as they do not require external power sources. * They are easy to set up and operate. * They require very little to no maintenance as they have no moving parts. Disadvantage * Risk of theft is higher as equipment costs are comparatively higher. * Snow or dust, combined with moisture can accumulate on horizontal PV-panels and reduce or even stop energy production. * Rechargeable batteries will need to be replaced several times over the lifetime of the fixtures adding to the total lifetime cost of the light. The charge and discharge cycles of the battery are important considering the overall cost of the project.

Her official name was Vijayalakshmi Keshav Khambadkone (). Sheila Khambadkone was born on 11 January 1932 in a Chitrapur Saraswat (BhƒÅnap) family in Mangalore (). She was the daughter of Ramrao Katre (). Early life and education Khambadkone lost her mother when she was three months old. Under the tutelage of her aunt Kilpady Sundaribai (), who was a teacher and social worker, she did her schooling from Mangalore and matriculated (SSLC) in 1948. Her aunt was a major influence on her, drawing her towards literature. She shifted to Bombay in 1948 after the demise of her aunt. Khambadkone was married at 16 after which, under the active encouragement of her husband, she graduated in English literature and German. Literary career Since her schooldays, Khambadkone wrote songs, poems and small skits. These were sung and read and enacted respectively with a small group of friends and neighbours. She used to write for the college magazine too. She has also read some of her poems on the Konkani section at the Mumbai station of All India Radio. Khambadkone wrote two noteworthy dramas, a one-act play enacted at Santacruz Saraswat Colony, Mumbai in the Diwali of 1983 and a two-act play hƒÅs ƒÅjjƒì hƒÅs () enacted in 1984 at the ko·πÖka·πái nƒÅ·π≠ya mah≈çtsava.

The Buffett Rule is part of a tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011.Carrie Budoff Brown. \\"Obama's 'Buffett Rule' to call for higher tax rate for millionaires\\". Politico, September 17, 2011. The tax plan would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than one million dollars a year. According to a White House official, the new tax rate would directly affect 0.3 percent of taxpayers.  History  Distribution of average tax rates including individual income tax and employee payroll tax. The Buffett Rule is named after American investor Warren Buffett, who publicly stated in early 2011 that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy. The rule would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket, to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans. In October 2011, Senate leader Harry Reid (D‚ÄìNev.) proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on everyone making over a million dollars a year to pay for new stimulus provisions, but the change did not go through.Jake Tapper. \\"Buffett rule tax set at 30 percent: Obama speech‚Äô\\". Yahoo News, January 25, 2012. A White House statement released in January 2012 defined the rule as part of \\"measures to ensure everyone making over a million dollars a year pays a minimum effective tax rate of at least 30 percent ... implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions.\\" The White House also stated that \\"no household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays.\\" The Buffett Rule was not in the President's 2012 budget proposal and the White House initially stressed it as a guideline rather than a legislative initiative.Annie Lowrey. \\"The Buffett Tax Rule Is Really More of a Guideline\\". The New York Times, February 16, 2012. The rule, however, was later submitted for deliberation as US Senate Bill S. 2059, Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012. On April 16, 2012, the bill received 51 affirmative votes, but was stopped by a Republican filibuster that required 60 votes to proceed to debate and a vote on final passage. Possible effects If enacted, the rule change would result in $36.7 billion per year in additional tax revenue ($367 billion over the next decade), according to a January 2012 analysis by the Tax Foundation, a think tank. These figures assume that the 2001/2003/2010 tax cuts are not extended. If the 2001-2010 tax cuts do not expire as scheduled, estimated Buffett Rule revenues would total $162 billion over the decade. An alternative study released that same month by the Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank which favors the change, stated that the change would add $50 billion per year in tax revenue ($500 billion over the decade). The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation released a letter in March 2012 estimating that the Buffett Rule would raise $46.7 billion over the next decade. The divergent estimates come about because of different assumptions about the details of the Buffett Rule. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation assumes that many high-income taxpayers would reduce the amount of capital gains realized in one year to fall beneath the Buffett Rule threshold. The estimated $47 billion would offset by 0.7% the $6.4 trillion increase in spending over the next decade estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, based on President Obama's 2013 budget plan. Using the higher estimate from the Tax Foundation, the estimated $367 billion would offset by 5.7% the $6.4 trillion spending over the next decade. The 2013 budget proposed by the Obama administration stated that the Buffett Rule should replace the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that the Buffett Rule plus the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax would increase the deficit by $793.3 billion in the next decade. The $793.3 billion loss projected did not take into account additional proposed measures, such as incremental increases in retirement age and payroll tax lifetime contributions raised to $190,000 by 2020, about $22,000 higher than it would be under current law. Part of the reason for the inequality in taxation is that revenue from long-term capital gains is taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%. It's not entirely clear how many individuals would be affected by the change. An October 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service found that a 30% minimum tax rate rule would mean up to 200,000 taxpayers, equivalent to 0.06% of all U.S. citizens, paying more. Reactions and public opinion =Support= Paul Krugman, The New York Times columnist and Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist, wrote in January 2012 that \\"such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible\\". He stated that \\"the economic record certainly doesn‚Äôt support the notion that superlow taxes on the superrich are the key to prosperity\\" asserting that since the U.S. economy added 11.5 million jobs during President Bill Clinton's first term, when the capital gains tax rate was over 29 percent, he thinks there's no real reason to keep from raising the tax rate. A CBS News/The New York Times poll released in January 2012 found that 52 percent of Americans agreed that investments should be taxed at the same rate as income. A Gallup poll released in April 2012 also found that 60 percent of Americans support the rule. A similar poll released later that month by CNN found that 72 percent of Americans support the idea. =Opposition= Representative Paul Ryan (R‚ÄìWis.), who was the chairman of the House Budget Committee, criticized the new tax provisions. He labeled it as class warfare and also stated that it would negatively impact job creation and investment. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R‚ÄìKen.) said the conditions of the U.S. economy were ill-disposed to raising taxes. House Speaker John Boehner (R‚ÄìOhio) has spoken against the proposed rule and said that, \\"there's a reason we have low rates on capital gains ... because it spurs new investment in our economy and allows capital to move more quickly.\\" Dana Milbank from The Washington Post criticized the proposed tax as a gimmick, stating that President Obama was prioritizing the Buffett Rule over the alternative minimum tax for political, not economic reasons.

The fort after which the area was named was built early (1853) in the Salt Lake Valley's post-1847 history at a strategic point where escarpments on either side of the Little Cottonwood Creek valley create a narrow gateway to the upper valley and Little Cottonwood Canyon beyond. The effects of geography on travel through the area have also contributed to the area's much more recent success as a retail and employment destination. History The community of Union was first settled in 1849 by Jehu Cox. There were 8 families in the settlement that year. Silas Richards was appointed Bishop and organized a ward. By the following year the little settlement doubled in number. 1850 Silas Richards taught the first school of 30 to 35 scholars and he continued to do so for several winters. Union was first called Little Cottonwood, then South Cottonwood. The defensive Union Fort was founded to help secure the area for the early farmers living nearby, and it also provided security for shipments of granite (or quartz monzonite) from the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon for the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. 1853, in consequence of Indian depredations and trouble, it was thought to be expedient to build a fortification and live inside the walls. The elected site for the village was four rods square. The wall which had port holes was built of rock, clay and adobe twelve feet high around the sides. Twenty-three families lived inside in an adobe house. \\"We called our town Union.\\" It was laid off in lots and streets. The cost was great. A large adobe school house was built in the center of Union to be used for school and meetings. Around noon July 24th, 1857 news was reported that troops were coming from the states, sent by the general government. \\"It was the first tidings of war.\\" The week of November 16th 1857, Twenty [men] from Union (joined about 1500 in the mountains) to, \\"check the advance of our enemies who were threatening to exterminate us from the earth.\\" February 1858 a great portion of the inhabitants of Union were plagued with a violent cough and cold, or influenza. Reportedly the disease prevailed in Salt Lake City and throughout the country. March 22nd 1858 orders were given to move South because of the advancing army. By May 27th an encampment of some 40 families from Union formed four miles south of Payson (about 43 miles south of Union). By July an agreement of peace had been entered into and families returned to Union. The fort was located near the modern intersection of North Union Avenue and 1000 East Street. The most visible remnants of this era are the old preserved Jehu Cox house (moved from its original location and now used as a shop), about a block north of North Union Avenue in an area that is now a large parking lot, and a historic marker at the site of the fort. The pioneer cemetery for the settlement is also preserved, but it is about a half mile southeast along Creek Road. Until the late 20th century, the Union Fort area remained a local center, but never had a large population and remained nearly rural. The name eventually was altered to \\"Fort Union\\". Transportation Midvale Fort Union station The three most important roads in Fort Union are Utah State Route 71, 1300 East Street, and Fort Union Boulevard. For most of their length (they both run nearly the full length of the Salt Lake Valley), State Route 71 and 1300 East are parallel north-south roads running more than half a mile apart. In Fort Union, however, they swing closer together: 1300 East swings west to follow the ridge line of the escarpment south of Little Cottonwood Creek and State Route 71 swings east (from 700 East to 900 East) following the East Jordan Canal's curve into the lowlands around Little Cottonwood Creek. Fort Union Boulevard is an east-west road that curves around the northern Fort Union area on its way from Interstate 15 to Big Cottonwood Canyon. Other roads around Fort Union include 1000 East Street, Creek Road, Union Park Avenue, and (nearby) Interstate 215. 1000 East runs due south between State Route 71 and 1300 East, Creek Road is the historically important route along the bottom of the Little Cottonwood Creek Valley, and Union Park Avenue was built to connect Fort Union to its exit on I-215 (about a third of a mile north of Fort Union Boulevard). Unlike most of the Salt Lake Valley, which uses a loose grid system, the roads entering the Fort Union are essentially radial; clockwise, starting from the north, the locally-radial roads are: Union Park Avenue, 1300 East, Creek Road, 1300 East, 1000 East, State Route 71, Fort Union Boulevard, and State Route 71. The Utah Transit Authority and Wasatch Front Regional Council have proposed bus rapid transit lines connecting Fort Union to the TRAX light rail system to the west as well as north-to-south along the full length of 1300 East, but there are no concrete plans and ordinary bus lines are the only public transportation available. Development Suburban development in the surrounding areas started to affect Fort Union in the mid to late 20th century, but the largest surge of development occurred in the 1990s after the nearby portion of I-215 opened. The area bounded by State Route 71, Fort Union Boulevard, North Union Avenue, and the western slopes of the plateau on the north side of Little Cottonwood Creek has been filled with almost nothing but big-box store developments (containing some smaller-scale retail) and office towers, with associated parking facilities; previously, development had occurred mostly along the main roads through the area leaving big gaps of open fields that were quickly filled-in during the 1990s. The largest-scale development since the 1990s has been south along 1300 East in the small portion of Fort Union within Sandy. Office development in this area has increased the total number of major (4-6 story) office towers in Fort Union to about a dozen. Government The Fort Union area is split between three municipalities: Midvale includes the historic fort site and everything to the west of it, Cottonwood Heights includes almost everything east of the fort site, and Sandy includes a narrow corridor running north-to-south along 1300 East and the ridge line that it follows (all to the south of the fort site). Cottonwood Heights is the only city of the three to have its city hall in the area. There is no other area in Cottonwood Heights that has both major retail development and major office developments in close proximity, so the location is a natural choice even though it is in the northwest corner of the city. Education All of Fort Union is in the Canyons School District. Hillcrest High School is on the west side of State Route 71 near South Union Avenue. Mountview elementary school, which had not been in use for years, was torn down in 2011 to make room for a new park at the northeast corner of the Fort Union commercial district.

The Maine Legislature chartered the company in 1854. The company's stated objective was to build a telegraph system extending from the East Coast to the West Coast. In 1869 A&P; leased telegraph lines from the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and the Central Pacific Railroad, in exchange for shares of stock. Subsequently, the UP attempted to retake control of the lines in order to lease them to an additional, competing telegraph company, the American Union Telegraph Company. In 1880 the A&P; obtained a court injunction to prevent the UP action. Through several complex transactions, which included patent negotiations with inventor Thomas Edison, financier Jay Gould acquired sufficient shares of A&P; stock to obtain control of the company by 1875. (During this time, Gould was also increasing his ownership in the UP, which he ended up controlling by 1880.) Gould's takeover was contested in litigation; meanwhile, Gould initiated a rate war with competing telegraph companies, most notably Western Union, the largest company in the industry. By 1878, Gould had sold the A&P; to Western Union at a handsome profit.

Early years and education G√≥mez was born in Puerto Plata Province in the Dominican Republic. His father, Eugenio G√≥mez, was a fisherman and his mother, Margarita Matos, was a housewife. In 1991, Franklin's father died as a consequence of medical malpractice. As a result, his mother decided to move to Puerto Rico, along with Franklin and her other two sons: Emanuel and Abel. During childhood, G√≥mez played basketball and baseball. He began wrestling when he was 12 years old, training at Club Sparta in San Juan. He came to New Jersey his freshman year of high school where he stayed with a host family, Bill and Diane McGrath, in Hammonton, New Jersey. He attended St. Augustine Prep in Richland, New Jersey. Aside of wrestling, G√≥mez completed a Bachelor's degree in Human Resources, with a major in Psychology from Michigan State, as well as a Master's degree in Business Administration from Penn State University.  Wrestling career  While studying at St. Augustine Prep in New Jersey, G√≥mez won district and regional titles at 103 and 112 lbs. He wrestled at Brandon High School in Brandon, Florida and won a state title at 119 lb his senior year. G√≥mez also wrestled for Michigan State and won an NCAA Division I title at 133 pounds in 2009. After graduation, he was recruited to Penn State University and trains freestyle wrestling at the Nittany Lion Wrestling Club. During the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, G√≥mez won the first gold medal in the sport of wrestling for Puerto Rico. He has won his last three tournaments in Romania, Italy and Germany. In his last performance, he defeated the current world champion in the 60 kg, the Russian wrestler Besik Kudukhov, claiming the gold medal in the Grand Prix of Germany. After becoming the sub-champion and winning a Silver medal in the 2011 World Championships, Gomez also won his country a spot at the 2012 London Olympics. At the 2012 Olympics in London, G√≥mez faced Besik Kudukhov of Russia again but this time in the first round. Kudukhov defeated Gomez 3-1 and made the final but was defeated by Toghrul Asgarov of Azerbaijan. With Kudukhov making the final, Gomez was made eligible to wrestle for a medal in the repechage rounds. G√≥mez fought against Yogeshwar Dutt in the repechage rounds, but lost again 0-3, and Dutt eventually claimed the Bronze medal. At the 2014 World Wrestling Championships in the round of 16 he lost to Soslan Ramonov (by fall) of Russia and in the repechage round 2 he lost again to Ganzorigiin Mandakhnaran of Mongolia (4-7) At the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, G√≥mez faced Ikhtiyor Navruzov of Uzbekistan. G√≥mez and Navruzov were tied 5-5 in the second round. As the match was about to end, G√≥mez made a move that took Navruzov outside of the ring, initially warranting two points for G√≥mez. However, one of the officers argued that the move favored Navruzov, forcing G√≥mez' corner to challenge the call. When the officers decided against him, the bout ended 8-5 against G√≥mez. The decision was controversial from the beginning, with various experts and sources calling the decision \\"insane\\", and saying that G√≥mez was \\"robbed\\" on Twitter. Some notable wrestlers and coaches that tweeted in support of G√≥mez were Eric Thompson, Jake Varner, Cael Sanderson, Mark Hemauer, and Ben Askren. Former Governor of Puerto Rico An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° tweeted using the hashtag \\"#GomezGotRobbed\\". Meanwhile, current Governor Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla vowed to protest what he called a \\"theft\\" to the sport. Shortly after the match, the three officers in charge of the match were suspended by United World Wrestling because of \\"suspicious officiating\\". They also claimed that an investigation would be done, but their decision couldn't be overturned. In September 3, 2016, it was announced that the three officers were officially expelled from the UWW, without offering the reasons for the expulsion.

Youth sports includes school sports at primary and secondary level, as well as sports played outside the education system, whether informally or organized. In sports studies and public policy contexts, an age limit of 18 (the age of majority) is usual in discussing \\"youth sport\\". Not all sports governing bodies define \\"youth\\" as \\"under-18\\": while the Youth Olympic Games and the FA Youth Cup are for under-18s, the LEN Junior Water Polo European Championship is for under-17s. Many youth sport programmes have multiple age levels, for example under-8, under-10, under-12, etc. It is not, however, only underage sport that may be considered as \\"youth\\" sport; for example, the existence of the World Rowing U23 Championships recognises that adults aged 18‚Äì22 have not yet reached peak condition. Sport is one of the most popular activities among youth all over the world. The most popular sports are association football and swimming. In 2008, a United Nations-sponsored report on \\"Sport for Development and Peace\\" stated: :Sport can contribute significantly to international, national and local efforts to give children a healthy start. Sport can help those who haven‚Äôt received a good start, and equip youth with the information, skills, personal and social resources, and support needed to make key life transitions successfully. According to WinterGreen Research, the size of the U.S. youth sports market has grown 55 percent since 2010 and is a $15.3 billion market in 2017. Benefits of sport Participation in organized sports during childhood and adolescence has important benefits for physical, psychological, and social health. Sport-based youth development programs outside of school promote a wide range of learning and life skill development. Involvement in youth athletics encourages youth to live a healthy and happy lifestyle, foregoing the common issues many youth face such as obesity and depression. However, sport involvement goes beyond health, other benefits allow them to form and strengthen affective relationships, teach youth to value self-improvement over winning, how to be competitive in a competitive society, and to work culturally with different peers and authorities. In the classroom, high school student-athletes are far less likely to drop out of school and 15% more likely to attend college.http://www.atyourownrisk.org/benefits-of-sports/ At Your Own Risk The practice of sport fosters young people's physical and emotional health and builds valuable social connections. It also offers opportunities for play and self-expression especially for those young people with few other opportunities. Sport also acts as a healthy alternative to harmful actions such as drug abuse, and involvement in crime. Beyond the individual, sport involvement cuts barriers that divide societies, making it a powerful tool to support conflict prevention both symbolically on the global level and practically within communities. Concerns in sport participation The number of dropouts reaches a peak in the adolescent years. The most important reason for not playing sport are ‚Äúnot having enough time,‚Äù ‚Äúno interest anymore,‚Äù and ‚Äúother leisure activities‚Äù. = Negative experiences = Negative experiences can be created through a sport that is overly focused on competition and winning at all costs or that fails to place the healthy development of youth at the center of the experience. Such negative experiences may result in a young person's low self-esteem, involve them in negative relationships, encourage poor sportsmanship, permit aggression and violence, allow racism, perpetuate gender discrimination, or expose them to psychological, sexual and commercial exploitation and abuse. Many of these negative experiences can be avoided when parents and coaches are chosen carefully, ensuring that programs offer a positive development experience for youth. In response to the evidence of negative experiences in sport for many youth, especially low-income youth, youth of color, overweight youth, and LGBTQ youth, sports-based youth development (SBYD) emerged. Sports-based youth development is a theory and practice model for programs to place the mental and physical health of a youth over their athletic success.Perkins, Daniel F. & Gil G Noam. Characteristics of sports-based youth development programs. New Directions for Youth Development, No 115. Fall 2007. Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Programs that use SBYD to define program activities and train staff members generally provide free or reduced-cost programming to reduce the barriers low-income youth face when playing sports. These programs are typically found in low-income and under- served neighborhoods, but any sports coach or sports program can apply SBYD principles. = Injuries = Injuries have always been of concern in terms of sport but youth are much more susceptible to injury considering both their immature musculoskeletal system and increasingly high intensity training. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, participation in organized sports is on the rise. Nearly 30 million children and adolescents participate in youth sports just in the United States. This high rise in sport participation has led to some startling statistics, high school athletes account for an estimated 2 million injuries, 500,000 doctor visits, and 30,000 hospitalizations each year. The most common types of sports-related injuries among youth are sprains, muscle strains, bone or growth plate injuries, and overuse injuries. Early sports specialization has long been typical among children and teenagers in gymnastics, swimming, diving and figure skating, especially if they have aspirations of being competitive at elite levels. Undeniably, the main purpose for athletes to specialize in sport is to become a better player in order to increase their chances of making it to the big leagues or to become an elite athlete. Unfortunately, the data does not prove that specializing as a youth will be enough to make a child into a successful athlete later on (Latorre-Roman, Pinillos, & Robles, 2018). Youth athletes that are considered less specialized have been found to exhibit more all around athleticism and other advantages that specialized athletes do not benefit. (Rugg, Kador, Feley, & Pandya, 2018). Studies have supported that decreasing specialization at a young age will lower the rates of injuries for the players while increasing playing times and length of careers compared to athletes who specialized as a youth (Rugg, Kador, Feley, & Pandya, 2018). Still, sport specializers tend to dramatically outweigh those who stayed multi sport athletes because of the standards people place on sports and how valuable a sports career can be. As youth athletes exhibit skills at higher levels than there peers at a young age, parents, coaches, and the athletes themselves tend to focus on that sport in order to take advantage of their natural skills. parents, coaches, and athletes should know that showing promise in sport from a young age does not guarantee future success as competition levels rise and the athlete develops as a person (Latorre-Roman, Pinillos, & Robles, 2018). Noting that specializing in a sport at a young age by no means guarantees success, it is most important understand that sport specialization in youth can lead to higher injury rates throughout ones sports career (Mcguine et al., 2017). Research has found that high school athletes that specialize in one sport are more likely to be injured than athletes that play multiple sports (Mcguine et al., 2017). Further, students who were classified to play moderate amount of sports were found to have less injuries than those who specialized in only one (McGuine et al., 2017) This helps to emphasize the importance of sport diversity in youth athletes and its impact on preventing injuries. Looking at sport specialization more in depth, researchers have suggested that athletes, coaches, and parents monitor the weekly, monthly, and yearly participation rates for youth athletes in a single sport (Post et al., 2017) It is generally recognized that athletes should not participate in more than 8 months worth of intense sport practice and no more than an athletes age in hours of practice a week (post et al., 2017). Also, experts recommend that all athletes engage in a wide variety of athletic activities, including unstructured athletic activities such as playing outside, until at least the age of 15.' = Over-involvement = Teenage athletes have been pushed by parents and sport programmes to train excessively and to dedicate an enormous amounts of time and money to sport. Some youth report playing up to eight football games per week, sometimes in the hope of earning one of a few university scholarships. Sleep, schoolwork, family time, and other normal activities are sacrificed to sport. A few countries are beginning to regulate sport programmes to reduce this problem. Finland, which has a strong track record in the Olympics Games, is seen as a model. In 2018, after the death of an apparently healthy but exhausted teenage athlete, the government of Puerto Rico required that all youth sport programmes be regulated. Under the initial rules in Puerto Rico, children under the age of 9 cannot play in tournaments or officially keep score, and youth under the age of 16 cannot play more than three games per week. As of 2020, there is widespread sentiment that the overall system must change, but programmes in each of the regulated sports, and the coaches and other staff whose pay depends upon operating these lucrative tournaments and expensive travel teams, are lobbying for exemptions that will permit their own businesses to continue as before. Inequalities in sport =Social class= Global South nations tend to have less access to organized sports because the politics of their countries do not have the resources to have leisure and entertainment influence their lives. Children in Global South nations have less opportunity to attend school where majority of organized sport takes place. Sport programs within the community provide children marginalized by poverty, gender, disability, family dissolution, ethno-cultural background and conflict with family, crime and other lack of opportunity. In Global North nations, the evolving and complex youth sport system requires significant resources such as time, access, and money to develop as an athlete and play competitively. The financial costs involved in facilitating organized sport at an elite level ranges from an average of a few thousand dollars per year, to more than 20,000 dollars per year in some sports. For these financial reasons, participation is not feasible for a majority of kids growing up in lower income families. In recent years, youth sports have become more expensive in the United States. The financial burden of organized sports has grown, and children from low- income families are less likely to participate. The single greatest predictor of whether a child will start playing organized sports young, is whether their household income exceeds $100,000 per year. =Gender= Women's volleyball team of a U.S. university. Gender conditioning often starts at an early age where boys and girls are taught behave differently and participate in certain activities. While there is no doubt that girls' sport participation has skyrocketed in recent decades, a gender inequality in youth sports still exists. The \\"separate but equal\\" ideal of gender in youth sports is very much prevalent in society and its contradictions inherent a strategy that pushes for both individual equal opportunity and categorical separation of the sexes. Team sport participation peaks at age 11 and participation in sport by girls are high and continuing to increase. However, frequent participation by both boys and girls in team sports is declining. Girls are more likely to enter sport later than boys and are more likely to take part in cheerleading, dance, competitive jump roping and volleyball while boys tend to stick with more traditional sports such as baseball, basketball and football. No matter the sport, the benefits of participating remain. With this said, the gender gap in the global south is much larger than that of the global north based on significant power relations and religious beliefs, specifically within Muslim communities in countries like Bosnia, Egypt, Morocco, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. For many, religion is a way of life in which sporting and educational institutions are culturally constructed by cultural and religious dynamics, as well as political, social, and economic factors. =Spatial divisions= The gap between participation in sport in the global south and the global north can be due to a shortage of physical education, a lack of financing, few sport facilities and little equipment and no capacity to host major sporting event in the global south. Other limitations for people living in certain countries may include a lack of accessible transportation, education and lack of understanding of the sport. There are also several social and cultural barriers faced by youth living in the global south that impact sport participation. A few of these are religion, culture and language. Youth sports programs Game of one of the youth divisions of the Borregos Salvages American football associated with Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City. There are typically two types of youth sport programs. One is sponsored by schools and the other is sponsored by city recreational departments and agencies. Generally school sponsored programs have qualified coaches and dedicated facilities for their sports but that is not always the case. Requirements for coaches for school sponsored programs vary from state to state, but the standard for the head coach of a major sport is usually a teaching certificate, with some coaching experience and training. Non-school youth sports programs operate in a different way and use volunteers as coaches. They have to find places to practice such as open gyms. Youths in these programs are assigned or drafted to different teams depending on the program. The Sport for Development and Peace organization was found in research by Simon Darnell to have positive outcomes on the twelve-year-old boys participating in the program by promoting time management and personal responsibility. This helped the boys fit into the goals of self-regulation required in neoliberal societies. The nature of sport in itself also showcased leaders and those willing to make sacrifices for the sake of their team and also their families. The Culture, Education, Sport and Ethics program (CESEP) is an international outreach initiative to engage teachers and student from different countries and cultures in the dialogue of healthy sport. This program seeks to create collaboration among teachers, students under 18, and counselors to exchange ideas about sports and culture in an educational program. The International Olympic Committee's Sports for Hope program, located in Lusaka, Zambia, enhances national sports development through organized sports competitions, camps and clinics. They organize seminars for coaches and sports administrators as well as community development services. The program has an educational component about important societal issues, including girls‚Äô empowerment, civic participation, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other health issues for athletes and the general public. The center offers indoor and outdoor sports fields, lockers, a gym, a boxing hall, classrooms and a variety of sports.  History of youth athletics in 20th-century America  Youth Athletics were played and were popular in 20th-century America. In an attempt to ‚Äúenergize America‚Äôs youth and transform its fledgling bodies into healthy future citizens‚Äù recreation facilities for youth were created. Muscular Christianity was based on the philosophy of sports and exercise strengthening the body which was the shelter of the soul. This philosophy shaped the creation of YMCA programs across America. This led to the invention of basketball and volleyball in the late 19th century. Also, the YMCA had a female counterpart, the YWCA. The social gospel movement, ‚Äúfound sports to be a useful tool to draw inner-city youth to their churches, which often housed gymnasiums.‚Äù The social gospel movement lead to the creation of settlement houses, where middle-class men and women would study the social problems of the neighbourhood and attempt to fix them. The best known settlement house was Hull house in Chicago which had a community institution which attempted to Americanize immigrants. At Hull house, ‚Äúthey also provided a gym and sponsored athletic teams for both boys and girls, both as part of the acculturation process and the broader goal of improving the social, mental and physical well-being of inner-city residents. Social agencies such as the YMCA and YWCA, as well as Boys and Girls Clubs, and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, provided most of the organized sports to youth in America prior to 1954. While athletics was encouraged by the social gospel movement, youth sports were often organized by youth themselves through the social agencies. This shifted to adults organizing youth sports programs, which was exemplified with the advent of Little League Baseball by Carl Stotz. Little League Baseball was formed in 1939, with a three team league, while in 1954, there were 70,000 participants. Evidently, organized youth athletics grew rapidly throughout the 20th century in America. There were multiple reasons to support youth athletics programs, but one that was mostly agreed upon was ‚Äúthe notion of providing wholesome, character-building activities to occupy the leisure time of children and youth, to enable them to make the transition from childhood to adulthood.‚Äù Within the 20th century, youth athletics were supported for their many believed positive aspects on youth culture. This included the fact that many believed participation in youth athletics would decrease delinquency. In 1965 Coleman wrote, ‚Äúif it were not for inter-scholastic athletics or something like it, the rebellion against school, the rate of drop-out, and the delinquency of boys might be far worse than they presently are.‚Äù Also, youth athletics were a way for Jewish immigrants to disprove the stereotypes that they were bookish and weak in the early 20th century. Some Jews pursued professional careers in sports, which provided young Jewish Americans with role models who showed, ‚Äúthe possibility and benefits of assimilation,‚Äù which encouraged more participation in youth athletics. Catholic youths were interested in youth sports to, ‚Äúdemonstrate patriotism and morality.‚Äù Overall, both Catholics and Jews were attracted to youth athletics, to ‚Äúdemonstrate American-ness and experience a sense of belonging in the United States.‚Äù As well as physical fitness, sports were also seen as a way to increase social and moral development in youth. However, there remained some believed negative aspects of youth athletics. This included the fact that, ‚Äúpremature sports insolvent may result in undesirable emotional consequences for children.‚Äù The stress placed on youths during sports could lead to frustration, discouragement and low self-esteem. = Race and Sports =  African Americans  Race has played a role within youth sports as it has enforced racial segregation, but it has also given opportunities to racial minorities. In some ways, youth sports perpetrated segregation, as schools were segregated in the early 20th century. Within African American neighbourhoods in America, there was not the same level of public and private sports facilities as in other neighbourhoods. However, the streets and vacant lots became centres for youth sports. Segregation and prejudice kept African Americans out of sports facilities, but sports also played a positive role. While schools and subsequently sports teams were created out of segregation, athletics could bring success and accomplishment to schools. Sports were ways that members of the African- American community could gain self- esteem and a sense of community.  Native Americans  Youth sports were an important way of life for Native Americans within boarding schools. Sports for Native Americans living in boarding schools were so important that they were on a similar level of importance as work and teaching. School sports such as track and field, basketball, and wrestling were activities that some Native Americans felt pride in when they participated. This pride was created by the appeal of competition and success, especially against white teams. Former resident of a boarding school for Native Americans, Jeff McCloud's experiences in sports, \\"helped him to critically read the pain and degradation of contemporary life on and off Indian reservations as something other than a flaw in Native American character or the inevitable outcome of historical progress.\\" Through these experiences, sport could be a positive aspect of the lives of Native Americans. = Gender and Sports =  Female  Female youth athletics was advocated for in the early 20th century because it was, ‚Äúbelieved that sports improved young women‚Äôs health and beauty, promoted self-confidence, and offered a source of enjoyment.‚Äù However, girls' sports was not supported by all Americans as some believed it would lead to injuries and girls acting too aggressive and manly. During the early parts of the 20th century, some people felt that sport might reduce a girl's femininity and produce too much competitiveness. Some sports, such as basketball, were modified for girls' play. These modifications included eliminating physical contact and playing half-court games to limit exhaustion. American girls participated in more organized sports after the passage of Title IX in 1972 as they gained more opportunities to do so. It has been stated that, ‚Äúamong the many forms of sexism in sports, perhaps the most pervasive and devastating is the lack of equal opportunities for girls to compete in programs similar to those offered for boys.‚Äù Girls' participation remained much lower than that of boys, but it increased ‚Äúfrom 32 percent of the male‚Äôs participation in 1973-74 to 63 percent in 1994-95.‚Äù While there are barriers to girls' participation in sports, it grew sizeably in the 20th century.  Male  Youth athletics also affected the lives of boys as it could be used to define masculinity. Sports were a way to promote bravery, and were tied to masculinity through Muscular Christianity. Sports were even thought to reduce degeneracy as boys were thought to be becoming less brave than their forefathers by some. Betty DeBerg believes that gender divisions increased as some feared that industrialization and city life were changing gender roles. Sports were thought to be a way to increase masculinity in boys and to perpetrate social divisions. Furthermore, the masculine aspect of sports perpetrated through the 20th century, has continued an idea of homophobia. Eric Anderson states, \\"in a time of greatly decreasing cultural and institutional homophobia, institutions of sport have remained steadfast in their production of a homophobic and conservative gender ideology.\\" In 1997, a high school football player wrote that he faced, \\"victimization and personal distress over the profusion of homophobia within his sport...\\" This homophobic environment lead to depression for the victim. The heightened idea of masculinity has allowed homophobia to also permeate sports. Youth sports within the 20th century enforced masculinity on boys, as well as created an environment filled with homophobia.

Plot The game takes place in a world called \\"Skylands\\", a realm filled with adventure and floating islands. It is the center of the universe where it is constantly threatened by evil forces who seek to rule Skylands and gain access to all worlds.Skylanders: The Machine of Doom, page 43 A band of heroes called the Skylanders use their abilities and machinery to defend their world from various threats, which they have done for generations. They have worked with the Portal Masters in keeping peace and balance in Skylands, battling the forces of evil, and protecting the Core of Light. Kaos, the main antagonist, has destroyed the Core of Light and Skylands is in his hands. It is up to the player to send the Skylanders into the game and stop Kaos. The Skylanders have an unbreakable bond with their Portal Masters. Though they are not servants, the Skylanders chose to serve their Portal Master and do so eagerly. Each Skylander is associated with one of the ten elements of Skylands: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Magic, Tech, Life, Undead, Light, and Dark. The main plot is the Skylanders going through levels to defeat Kaos, and stop him from ruling over Skylands.

It is housed in the Galleria nazionale di Parma, northern Italy. The title of \\"Turkish Slave\\" derives from the misinterpretation of the sitter's headwear as a turban. It is in fact a typical headdress of noblewomen of the time called a balzo, with examples appearing in numerous contemporary portraits.20,000 Years of Fashion, page 219-220Balzo on clothing website She is wearing a chemise under her elaborately sleeved dress called a guimp and is holding a feather fan used as a flywhisk. History The work was in the Uffizi Gallery until 1928, when it was exchanged for two 13th century panels and a portrait thought to be of Philip, Duke of Parma by Giuseppe Baldrighi and later recognized as a self-portrait.Page at Uffizi's website It had arrived in Florence through Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, who owned it as early as 1675 and left it to the Medici Cabinet after his death. It is mentioned in the Uffizi inventories of 1704 and 1890, being listed in the latter as \\"Portrait of a Young Woman with a turban on her head, with the left she holds a plume, by Parmigianino's hand\\". The work was restored in 1968, at which time the dark background was removed and a uniform, earth-like color was discovered. The intervention, however, has been criticized, since several art historians consider the black background as a later intervention by Parmigianino himself. Description The subject is a young woman with brown hair and eyes, portrayed as a half-figure. She wears a white silk dress or bodice striped with gold. Her over-dress of indigo blue satin has large puffed sleeves and is worn low around the shoulders, revealing the bodice. She also wears a soft embroidered apron on her belly of a type also represented in the painting Antea by the same artist. On the head she wears a doughnut-shaped headdress sewn with gilt thread and decorated by a medallion portraying Pegasus, perhaps a metaphor of love or a heraldic reference to the Cavalli family. This style of headwear was fashionable for women of the time, invented for Isabella d'Este and featured in numerous female portraits from the Lombard and Padan area in the early 16th century. On the hand, whose slender fingers are typical of Parmigianino art, she wears a small ring, perhaps a reference to a recent marriage. She holds a plume used to fan herself, depicted with highly detailed brushstrokes. The proposed identifications of the woman include Giulia Gonzaga at the time of her marriage to Vespasiano Gonzaga.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed September 17, 2011 stream originating on the east slope of Kings Mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains, in San Mateo County, California, United States. It flows easterly down to the valley formed by the San Andreas Rift where it turns near the Phleger Estate to flow southeasterly on an unusually level course (for a mountain stream) to Adobe Corner in the town of Woodside where it joins Bear Gulch Creek, which in turn flows to San Francisquito Creek and ultimately, San Francisco Bay. History In August 1840, the Governor of Spanish California granted the land, later called Rancho Ca√±ada de Raymundo, to John Coppinger, an Irishman who had become a naturalized Mexican citizen. This rancho contained the which are now Huddart County Park. The area redwoods were an important source of lumber exports. According to Mexican government records of 1841, 100,000 board feet of wood were ready at the embarcadero near Mission Santa Clara for export to the Hawaiian Islands, presumably the source of this timber was Coppinger's Rancho. Willard Whipple was one of many area lumbermen who dragged logs to the port at Redwood City. His Whipple's Mill Road has come to be known as Whipple Avenue. He was a Union sympathizer in the American Civil War and named the creek on which his mills operated West Union Creek. Whipple built his steam-powered Upper Mill in late 1852 at the site of today‚Äôs Phleger House (now occupied by Intel founder, Gordon E. Moore) on the Phleger Estate. Watershed The watershed drains about . Numerous steep gulches draining the eastern slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains to nourish West Union Creek. Named tributaries include McGarvey Gulch, Squealer Gulch, Tripp Gulch, and Appletree Gulch. McGarvey Gulch joins West Union Creek at Huddart County Park. Although West Union Creek runs dry most summers, it has perennial pools that provide refugia for steelhead trout, the anadromous form of rainbow trout. Ecology Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) migrate from the Bay to spawn in Bear Creek and its West Union and Bear Gulch Creeks tributaries. They are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Steelhead smolt spend the first two years of their lives in freshwater, requiring perennial streams, or at least pools, to survive. The anomalously low gradient of the channel of West Union Creek is related to its course along the San Andreas Fault and creates high quality steelhead habitat, as do the numerous seeps and springs along the fault. The permanent pools created by these seeps and springs are crucial to the survival of steelhead young. In a 2001 report thirty four barriers to trout migration were identified within Bear Creek and its West Union Creek, Bear Gulch, Squealer Gulch, and McGarvey Gulch tributaries. That report identified the culvert for McGarvey Gulch creek at the Richards Road crossing in Huddart County Park as a significant migration barrier for adult and juvenile steelhead and was reconstructed with funds from the State Department of Transportation‚Äôs San Francisco Bay Salmonid Habitat Restoration Fund. Recreation Hiking trails along West Union Creek include the Miramontes Trail which originates in Huddart County Park. It can also be accessed by the Crystal Springs Trail from Edgewood County Park.

In the past it was an important addition on the everyday menu as rose hip is very rich in vitamin C and can be harvested in winter. Hagebuttenmark is used as a spread on bread, as sweetener in beverages and as condiment in dessert and pastry. It is for example the filling for Krapfen in Franconia. Food law aspects In the European Union commercially produced Hagebuttenmark has to be declared as \\"Hagebuttenkonfit√ºre extra\\" or \\"Konfit√ºre einfach\\" (fruit preserve onefold). Since the \\"Hagebuttenkonfit√ºre extra\\" with kernels is not edible, there's a special provision that allows declaration of the Hagebuttenmark (without kernels) as \\"Konfit√ºre extra\\". If it is produced in raw processing (see Preparation), it mustn't be named \\"Konfit√ºre\\" as it doesn't contain the required anhydrous mass of 60%. Preparation Generally there are two ways of prepare Hagebuttenmark: #In the most common method used by big companies, firstly the rose hips are seeded, then the seeds are cooked with little water or wine, than drained, the liquid so obtained together with the pulp is then let to brew for few hours to a few days. Then the pulp is cooked and pur√©ed, mixed with sugar in a one-to-one rate, cooked again and then filled hot in jars. This kind of preparation guarantees a long shelf life but, as Vitamin C is not heat-resistant, only traces of it remain in the finished product. #In the traditional Swabian method the rose hips are cut open and stored until they are soft (that takes for about 5 days in a temperature of 12 ¬∞C). Then they are filtered through a sieve without being cooked. This pulp is then heated with sugar to a temperature between 65 ¬∞C and 75 ¬∞C (but it can also be mixed cool with honey) and than flavoured with wine, orange juice or apple juice. With the second method, the preserve is very rich in Vitamin C. It is the typical preparation in Auendorf, a village that belongs to Bad Ditzenbach that is called \\"H√§genmarkdorf\\" (\\"dorf\\" being the German word for \\"village\\") and is the only village in Germany that features rose hips in their coat of arms. Composition and ingredients As the rose hip contains much Vitamin C (100 g of the edible parts contain 1045 mg) the fruit preserves is considered a vitamin bomb. For comparison, 100 g of the edible parts of lemons contain only 51 mg Vitamin C. Additionally a study from the University of Jena proved that rose hips contain also lycopene that protects the cells against aggressive radicals and therefore reduces the risk for cancer, arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, heart attacks and strokes. In the skin it protects the cells from harmful UV radiation and prevents sunburns.

A 2014 survey by the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives (HRCM) estimated there were 1,139 female prostitutes on the islands. Some women enter the country posing as tourists but then engage in sex work. Sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country. Closure of spas Following complaints that sexual services were being offered in spas in hotels, and a protest in the capital, Mal√©, by the opposition Adhaalath Party, the government ordered the closure of the spas in 1,000 hotels in late December 2011. Following pressure from the country's tourism industry, president Mohamed Nasheed lifted the ban a few days later. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a problem in the country, especially in Mal√© and in the Laamu Atoll region. According to Psychologist Dr Aishath Ali Naaz, it is so common in some areas that its regarded as 'normal'. Often the prostitution is arranged by family members. The HRCM estimate 8% of female prostitutes on the island are underage. Legal situation Article 88(a) of the Maldivian Penal Code 1967 includes Sharia Law into the country's legislation. Sex outside marriage is outlawed under Sharia Law, as are other forms of 'immorality', therefore prostitution is forbidden. Public order and immigration laws are also used against sex workers. Foreigners who engage in prostitution can expect to be deported and Maldivians can expect a prison sentence. Whilst condoms are allowed to be sold to married couples, they cannot be sold to single people. Condoms and lubricants are sometimes confiscated by the police and used as evidence of prostitution. Sex trafficking The Maldives are a destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking, and a source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. A small number of women from Asia, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe, as well as girls from Bangladesh and Maldives, are subjected to sex trafficking in the Maldives. Maldivian women may be subjected to sex trafficking in Sri Lanka. A Thai hotelier reported in 2013 that Thai women were being recruited with offers for good jobs in the Maldives, but on arrival being forced into prostitution. The Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (PHTA) criminalises some, but not all forms, of sex trafficking. For the first time, in 2016, the government secured a conviction under the PHTA. Three foreign nationals were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in a sex trafficking case. In November 2016, the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) arrested 2 men in connection with trafficking Sri Lankan women to the Maldives, where they worked in brothels. More than 100 women were thought to be involved. A Maldivian man was also being sought.

History The Late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari described a Circumcision of Jesus by Parmigianino. However, his description does not match the Detroit painting: he described a series of characters holding torches and walking which do not appear in this work. Detail of a rabbit. The painting is known with certainty only starting from the 1830s, when it was part of the Russian imperial collection and was copied in an 1851 etching by J.W. Muxel. In 1917 it was acquired at Stockholm by A.B. Nordiska Kompaniet, which, a few years later, sold it to the American Axel Beskow. In 1936 he donated the work to the Detroit museum. The painting was not unanimously attributed to Parmigianino until 1991 The dating from around 1523 is based on comparison with early other works by the artist and by a preparatory drawing at the Cabinet des Dessins (inv. 6390) of the Louvre museum. Description The work shows the circumcision of Jesus as described in the Gospel of Luke;Luke, 2, 22-32 the two sacrifice doves refer to the connected act of the purification of Mary. The young Jesus, well illuminated, is the child Jesus, surrounded by a crowd of characters. At the left is a very young Madonna, with blonde hair, similar to the Saint Barbara at the Museo del Prado. Also on the left, behind her, are two characters confabulating on a background with the rising sun. At the right are two rows of figures, as well as the priest who holds Jesus on the altar and, in the other hand, the ritual knife. Below, between the offers, are two small rabbits, which resembles similar details in the arch of the first chapel frescoed by Parmigianino in the church of San Giovanni Evangelista at Parma.

The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights reported in 2007 that there were more than 13,500 prostitutes in the country and that the number was rising. Sex trafficking is a problem in the country. Overview Prostitution is common, especially in Manama. Most of the prostitution occurs in bars and hotels, but some prostitutes, mainly Russian, attract customers in the malls. There is also some street prostitution. Most of the prostitutes are foreign: Russian, Thai, Filipino, Ethiopian, Bangladeshi, and Chinese. Each hotel or bar tends to have one nationality of prostitutes. In some hotels the women will knock on guests doors late at night looking for customers. Hotels and bars tolerate the prostitutes as it brings in male customers and increases alcohol sales. Many of the customers are Saudis who drive to Bahrain where the laws are far less strict than in their homeland, especially where sex and alcohol are concerned. =Sin city= In 2009, Manama was placed at number 8 in the top 10 \\"sin cities\\" of the world by AskMen magazine. This prompted a clampdown during which 300 prostitutes and pimps were arrested within the first week, and the Al Asalah parliamentary bloc proposing that the country should stop issuing visas to Russian, Thai, Ethiopian, and Chinese women to stop prostitutes from entering the country. The proposal was not adopted. Legal situation Prostitution and related activities are prohibited by the Bahrain Criminal Code: Chapter 3 - Immorality & Prostitution * Article 324 - Entices or assists another to commit an act of immorality or prostitution (unspecified prison sentence, max 5 years if the victim is under 18) * Article 325 - Forcing a person to commit acts of immorality or prostitution by coercion, threat or deceit (2 - 7 years imprisonment, or 3 - 10 if the victim is under 18) * Article 326 - :1.

If they are suffering from a venereal disease, a court will order them to a medical institute for treatment. * Article 331 - Any foreigner convicted of immorality or prostitution may be deported, either totally or for a period of not less than 3 years The Ministry of Interior Criminal Investigation Directorate and the Capital Governante's Municipal Council raid flats or hotels if there are complaints of \\"unlawful activities\\" by neighbours. The courts may issue deportation orders against foreign prostitutes on conviction or if it is in the \\"public interest\\". In 2016 MP Jamal Dawood proposed that non-Bahrainis caught in cases involved in cases of prostitution should be deported immediately and banned from the country for life. The proposal was rejected as it would be contradictory to human rights. Bahrain's Aliens Act allows immigration officials to deny entry to people convicted of crimes elsewhere, including prostitution. They can also be denied entry for unspecified \\"health reasons\\". History Prostitution has been practised in Bahrain for many years. After WW1, many foreign workers, especially from Persia, Iraq and India, came to the country fuelling demand for prostitution. There were two areas designated for brothels, one in Gulba, west Manama and the other in Muharraq. Both male and female prostitutes worked in the brothels. In 1937 it was decreed prostitutes could only live and work in these areas, any operating outside these areas were to be deported. Most of the female prostitutes were from Persia, Iraq and Oman, and were known as \\"daughters of the wind\\" or \\"daughters of love\\" The Persians charged the highest prices. The male prostitutes were mainly Omani boys. The two areas declined in the 1970s with the building of hotels and prostitution spreading to the hotels. After independence from Britain in 1961, British citizens could enter the country for 3 months without a visa. Some British prostitutes came to work on the islands for short periods. Some of them alternated their time between Bahrain and the UAE. The visa waiver was later scrapped in 1996. After the Saudi causeway was opened in 1986, many Saudis came to the country because of its more relaxed attitude to sex and alcohol. The Saudi visitors who wanted to \\"party\\", greatly increased the demand for prostitution. Prostitutes of different nationalities have come to the country at different times. In the 1980s & 1990s it was mainly Filipinos and Sri Lankans. Following the collapse of communism, Russian prostitutes came to the country, and 1996 saw the arrival of Bosnians. Sex trafficking Bahrain is a destination country for women subjected to sex trafficking, primarily from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Nepal, Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, Thailand, Syria, and Kenya. In 2015, the government convicted 17 sex traffickers and imposed 10-year prison terms plus fines and deportation. At the close of the reporting period, five trafficking cases, and four from the previous year, remained ongoing. Officials reported three government employees were allegedly complicit in potential trafficking crimes. Two of these cases remained under investigation and one was in the trial phase at the conclusion of the reporting period. The media reported the arrest of two police officers‚Äîone former and one current‚Äîfor their role in the sex trafficking of foreign women; however, it was unclear if the government and media were reporting the same two cases. Two Russian women were deported from Bahrain to Russia in 2016 for their involvement in a sex trafficking ring. They lured women from the Urals to Bahrain between 2011 and 2016 with promises of work. Once there they were forced into prostitution. One of the women was given a six-year jail term for trafficking 23 women to Bahrain for prostitution, by the Russian courts in June 2017. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Bahrain as a 'Tier 1' country.

He was baptised at Mount Hermon Wesleyan Reform Church, as it was then known, in July 1873. He was educated at Addingham National School, leaving at 15 to work for a Burnely firm. After studying in London, he returned to Addingham as pastor of Mount Hermon. In September 1908, he left for Madagascar with his wife and children, to serve as a missionary with the London Missionary Society. Some of the locals were initially hostile, and met him armed with spears and axes. He also suffered malaria, black water fever and dysentery. Kendall Gale and his family returned to England every five years and his work gained a following. In 1918 he published a report of his journey to the Marofotsy, Sihanaka and Bezanozano peoples. He established over 250 village churches in Madagascar, plus schools for training teachers. He had intended to retire in 1937, hoping to have established 300 churches. However, he suffered complications from an operation and died in 1935 in Anjozorobe, Tananarive. He is thought to have founded more churches than any other LMS missionary.Adiel J.

Originally a lieutenant in Paul Kelly's Five Points Gang, where he was the immediate boss of Johnny Torrio , Sirocco defected to the rival Eastman Gang, which he led in its last days. Biography Sirocco, known as the main rival of gangster \\"Dopey\\" Benny Fein, was an early member of the Five Points Gang, but later defected to the Monk Eastman Gang during the gang war in the mid-1900s. Sirocco remained with the gang as manager of the Pearl House dance hall with Johnny Torrio and the satellite James Street Gang, until 1911 when he and Chick Tricker left wounded Eastman leader Jack Zelig behind during a failed robbery. Attempting to gain control of the gang both he and Tricker refused to post bail for Zelig. However, due to Zelig's political connections, the charges against him were later dropped. Upon Zelig's release Sirocco and Tricker planned Zelig's death, sending Eastman member Jules Morrello (or Julie Morrell) to murder Zelig. Zelig, however, was informed of the attempt by Ike the Plug and killed Morrello during a party at the Stuyvesant Casino Hall on December 2, 1911 . This would begin a civil war between the two Eastman factions that would last for nearly a year until Zelig's death in 1912. Sirocco and Tricker tried to lead the Eastman Gang after Monk Eastman briefly returned to lead the Eastmans, but by that time the civil war had destroyed what was left of the gang. Sirocco later formed another gang, hiring out to strikebreakers and labor sluggers, competing with rival \\"Dopey\\" Benny Fein as the two struggled for control of labor slugging in New York's East Side during the early 1910s. In November 1913 the two gangs clashed as Sirocco's gang, hired by the Feldman Hat Company as strikebreakers against union workers protected by Benny Fein's gang, quickly escalated into a major gunfight in which Fein lieutenant Max Greenwalt was killed (most likely by Sirocco member Red Murray although other sources state that Greenwalt was killed by Johnnie Dike in a gunfight on Broome Street). Benny Fein planned an ambush to eliminate the Sirocco gang as they were attending a local dance at Arlington Hall on January 9, 1914. However the ambush turned into a major battle lasting several hours and, while neither gang suffered any casualties, Deputy Court Clerk Frederick Strauss, apparently investigating the battle, was killed in the crossfire . In the ensuing scandal and the police crackdown, Sirocco disappeared from New York's underworld soon after the incident. Further reading *Fried, Albert.

The subject was Count of San Secondo, and the painting forms a pair with a group portrait of his Countess and their children, Portrait of Camilla Gonzaga and Her Three Sons, although the latter is not unanimously attributed to Parmigianino. History It is mentioned in a 1686 inventory of the collections of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, as the portrait of count of San Sigundo. The subject has been identified with Pier Maria III de' Rossi basing on this note, and by another from 1630 by one of his descendants about the existence of a portrait of him by Parmigianino. The painting arrived in Spain in 1664, after King Philip IV had supported the Rossi family in a dispute with the Farnese of Parma about some territories. It has been dated from around 1535 to 1539, based on the age of Pier Maria (born in 1508) in the portrait, and a statement by Parmigianino's contemporary, the art historian Giorgio Vasari, that the artist took refuge at Pier Maria's court in the period in question. Description The count is portrayed standing in front of a precious damask cloth background. He wears a long and wide, fur-lined black jacket, a waistcoat in the same color, a white shirt and white trousers with contemporary \\"French\\" cuts and padded codpiece. His austere posture and the hand at the sword's hilt refer to Pier Maria's military career. He looks to the right, ideally towards his wife's portrait. At the right is a landscape with a city rich of monuments, perhaps Rome. The objects are also references to the count's life and personal interests: a statue of Mars, the Roman war god, an ancient bas-relief (symbol of his collector attitude), and some books, hinting to his love for literature (he was in correspondence of poet Pietro Aretino). One of the books has the inscription \\"Imperio\\", referring to Pier Maria's commitment with emperor Charles V at the time in which the work was painted.

The Global Fund for Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and Malaria estimated there were about 19,000 sex workers in the country in 2006. Many women in Mongolia turn to prostitution through poverty. Sex trafficking and child prostitution, including child sex tourism, are problems in the country. Overview Although illegal, prostitution in Mongolia is on the rise, partially due to the growing mining industry. In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, prostitution was previously centred on the park in front of the Ulaanbaatar Hotel, where most wealthy westerners stayed when in the country. In recent years it has moved into karaoke bars, hotels, saunas and massage parlours. Women's activists claim there are hundreds of these establishments in the city. Whilst there are occasional raids by the police, they establishments generally operate untroubled by law enforcement. The number of men employed at the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine and the Tavan Tolgoi coal fields has led to a great rise in the number of sex workers in these areas. Along the main highways leading to the Chinese border, truck drivers will exchange diesel for sex. The prostitutes along the highways are known as \\"diesel girls\\" Mongolian women in China work as prostitutes in bars in Beijing, such as Maggie's. Mongolian women also work in the brothels of the Chinese free-trade town of Erenhot, on the China- Mongolia border. Because Mongolian citizens can stay in China for thirty days without registration or need for a visa, many of the prostitutes have been there for many years and return to Mongolia once a month. Sexual Health As sex work in the country is underground due to the legal situation, sex workers have little access to sexual health services. STIs are high amongst sex workers with 30% having syphilis. The National AIDS Foundation fear an accelerated HIV spread. Sex tourism Sex tourism occurs in the country. Police report that 1,500 women and adolescents are working in bars, massage parlours and hotels catering to foreigners and tourists. Japanese and South Korean tourists engage in child sex tourism in the country. There is often familial complicity of the children involved.

Traffickers sometimes use drugs, fraudulent social networking, online job opportunities, or English language programs to lure Mongolian victims into sex trafficking. A significant number of Mongolian victims from rural and poor economic areas are subjected to sex trafficking in Ulaanbaatar and border areas. Article 113 of the criminal code prohibits all forms of human trafficking, however, authorities frequently charged suspected sex traffickers under article 124, which criminalises inducing others into and organising prostitution but does not require the element of force, fraud, or coercion that defines a trafficking crime. Authorities prosecuted 37 defendants and convicted eight under article 124 in 2016; however, it was unclear how many of these cases had direct links to sex trafficking. The continued development of the mining industry in southern Mongolia led to an increase in internal and international migration, increasing the risk of trafficking, particularly along the China-Mongolian border. Young women are at risk of being exploited in prostitution by truck drivers transporting coal who are awaiting border crossing. Some Mongolian children sometimes subjected to sex trafficking, often with familial complicity. Previous reports allege corruption among Mongolian officials impedes the government's anti-trafficking efforts. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Mongolia as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.

Before the war seven other Australians had held the title. Life and racing Felton was born in Walker Street, North Sydney, on 28 August 1889. After he grew up he was employed as a blacksmith's striker which helped develop his handsome physique and strength for rowing. By eighteen years of age he stood six feet two inches tall and weighed thirteen and a half stone. He became a pupil of former world champion Peter Kemp. Felton was involved in the normal smaller regattas and match races that were the bread and butter of the professional scullers. His first races of note were those held at Foxton, New Zealand when he was chosen as one of nine men from Australia to represent their country at the Foxton Handicap Races held on 2 and 3 December 1909. Eight New Zealand men made up the field and Felton was successful in beating all to take the ¬£150 first prize and a cup valued at ¬£25. From these races Felton gained the reputation of a dashing sprinter and there was some doubt about his stamina in races longer than two miles. In June 1911 he raced Frank Hagney over the full length of the Parramatta course of about three and a quarter miles. He won easily. In April 1912 he beat William (Billy) Fogwell for the Northern Rivers (NSW) Championship. However he was criticised for delaying the start of the race by over an hour. Felton was involved in an unpleasant affair at the end of 1912. Harry Pearce had been the Australian Champion since 1909 and had challenged Ernest Barry for the world title. Not long before Pearce's departure for England, Felton, Charles Towns, and Jim Paddon all challenged Pearce for his Australian Championship. The lateness of the challenges was intended to force Pearce to forfeit his domestic title so that the challengers could decide among themselves who should be the new champion. Rather than jeopardise his World Title chances Pearce forfeited his title which was then claimed by Felton. Felton and Towns raced in January 1913 and the match was described as a midget verses a giant. Towns was much smaller and weighed less than Felton who won the race by four lengths. Yet because of high winds which blew Towns off course the question of whom was the better was not really answered. It was somewhat answered when Jim Paddon handsomely beat Felton by two minutes in a race held in February 1913. Thus Felton lost the local championship. Pearce and Felton had an actual race in Sydney in September 1914 for ¬£200 a side but no championship was involved. Pearce initially led by after one mile Felton took the advantage and won comfortably in a time of 20m.30s. See Also Australian Sculling Championship. In another race in February 1915 Felton was again criticized when he delayed by about half an hour a race against Robert Ford. The delay allowed Felton to take advantage of the change in the tide and wind as he was heavier and able to make better progress than his opponent. Felton announced his retirement from professional sculling in March 1915 but indicated that before retiring he would be prepared to row Charles Towns for ¬£250 a side on the Parramatta River. It was supposed to be a sportsman's chance to reverse the 1913 result. The very high stake for an ordinary sculler's match not involving any title was unusual and likely indicated that Felton was not all that keen on a race. Nevertheless, the Towns camp raised the money and the match was set down for 26 June 1915. Once again Felton prevaricated at the start and nearly refused to race, disregarding the instructions of umpire Bill Beach. When the race finally got underway Towns won and it was a popular win as it was felt that Felton had behaved badly. World War I By October 1915 Felton had joined the Engineers‚Äô Division of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and served in Europe until the end of the war. The war put all professional sculling on hold and no title matches were held during that time. During the latter part of Felton's service he had participated in war-service regattas on the Thames and also at the International Regatta in Paris in July 1919 which inspired him to challenge for the World Sculling Championship after the armistice. The World Title Match Ernest Barry had been the title holder before the war and had not retired so was still the champion. Barry had also served in the war but had been invalided in 1918 after suffering shell shock and shrapnel wounds. He suggested that he would need at least six months to get back to full fitness for a match. Barry at thirty-seven years of age knew he was nearing the end of his sculling career. The agreed date for the match was 27 October 1919. The course was to be the famous Championship Course on the Thames in London which was about four and a quarter miles long. The stake was to be ¬£500 a side. There was some disquiet in Australia over this challenge as many felt that Jim Paddon was a better sculler and as a previous world title challenger he had more right to a race than Felton did. However, Felton was on the spot as he had not yet been repatriated home, and the cost of his challenge was only about half of what it would have cost to send an Australian to England. Felton also had the advantage of being acclimatised to the Northern conditions. There was some difficulty in Felton raising the stake and expenses but eventually the Australian Prime Minister and the general public who were both keen to see the title return to Australia came to his aide and provided the cash. The day of the race suited the Australian. Felton chose the sheltered Middlesex shore side of the course which proved an advantage on a cold blustery day. Being heavier he was able to build a lead in the calmer water. Barry on the other had hand had the rougher conditions and he shipped much water during the race. Felton easily won by about six lengths although he could have made it more had he been so inclined, in a time of 25m.40s and thus became the Sculling Champion of the World, the eighth Australian to hold the title. The Return Match As was common at the time Felton offered Barry a return match but with the proviso that it was to be raced in Sydney. Felton returned home to a hero's welcome and after the usual festivities found himself challenged by Jim Paddon for a race on the Parramatta. The local rowing fraternity felt that Paddon had the right to a challenge but Felton declined and announced the agreement with Barry. It would appear that the two had made the arrangement with a view to maximising their financial returns. For example, motion picture rights, gate money, paid speaking engagements, and exhibitions were some of the ways the Champion and ex-Champion could reward themselves. The Sydney rowing people found that Barry had strong financial support from England and as they were keen to see the contest, support for the Paddon challenge evaporated. Felton and Barry met on 28 August 1920 over the full course on the Parramatta and for a stake of ¬£500 a side. A crowd estimated between one hundred and one hundred and fifty thousand persons lined all vantage points to see the first Championship race held in Sydney since 1907. A number were also on board steamers that followed the race. Unfortunately the race did not live up to expectations. Felton led for the first mile and a half and then Barry fouled him. Both men appealed to the umpire. Felton stopped rowing believing he had won on the foul but the umpire, Bill Beach ordered the men to continue rather than making a ruling. He later said that they were in neutral water and the foul in no way affected the result of the race. It was likely he believed the foul was accidental as an intentional foul would have cost the perpetrator the race. The umpire's decision was final. Felton did not continue to scull on at speed but Barry did and he crossed the line about twelve lengths ahead and thus regained the World Title. His time was 24m.32s. Felton's trainer was Richard Arnst, a former world champion, who believed his man should have got the decision as be believed that Barry had intentionally fouled Felton. Felton accused Beach of partiality and applied for a Supreme Court injunction to stop the stake money being paid to Barry. Felton was desirous of a re-match for the money only rather than the money and the title but eventually he withdrew his claim so the case did not proceed and Barry received his cash. Richard Arnst had issued a newspaper challenge before the race to the winner of the Felton/Barry match. It looks as if he had expected Barry to win and as Arnst and Barry had previously raced twice and the score was one each they needed a further race to decide who was the better. Barry declined to race and because three months passed without him accepting the challenge Arnst claimed the title by forfeit. This was within the rules, such as they were, at the time. Barry had returned to England and had announced his retirement from the sport. Arnst held the Title for one race, lost it in the next to Darcy Hadfield who in turn lost it to Jim Paddon. Paddon held off two challenges before accepting one from Alf Felton in 1924. Before this occurred Felton was involved in another race. The Australasian Championship (Australasian is Australia and New Zealand.) Before having another chance at the world title Felton travelled to New Zealand after arranging a race with Pat Hannan which was billed as the Australasian Championship. This was a manufactured title based on Hannan's claim to the New Zealand Title which he had actually lost but only by forfeit, and the highly dubious claim that Felton was the Australian Champion. His reasoning was that as Paddon was now the World Champion, he (Paddon) was ineligible to hold the domestic title. Because he had been the previous holder, Felton argued that the title reverted to him. This argument was not accepted by many of the Sydney scullers and previously a number of world champions had simultaneously held national titles. The match was raced on 28 April 1923 and was held on Nelson Harbour for a purse of ¬£500. Felton crossed the line first but was disqualified for cutting Hannan off. This race was notable in that it was the first New Zealand sports event broadcast on radio. The Third World Title Match Alf Felton had his third World Title match after he had challenged Jim Paddon. Felton had persuaded a group of Brisbane promoters to stage a world championship match as part of the Brisbane Centennial celebrations. The match was unusual in that it was held on the Brisbane River ‚Äì the first such match on the river. The date was 12 August 1924 and the course was slightly shorter than normal at about three miles. Felton had claimed to be the Queensland Champion which was considered cheeky. He further caused controversy when he refused to row with Bill Beach as umpire. Paddon as Champion had the right to nominate most of the terms, but in order to secure the match agreed to Felton's demands and another umpire was found. A very large crowd was on hand to witness the race but it was not much of a race. Felton had the reputation of a fast sprinter but he showed none of his old form when Paddon took the lead after only one hundred yards and the result was never in doubt. Paddon easily defeated Felton in a time of 17m.55s. After this defeat Felton retired from professional sculling. He died in 1951. See also World Sculling Championship.

It is regarded as a form of illegality. An applicant may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires ‚Äì beyond the decision-maker's powers ‚Äì and grant the applicant a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision. It is not wrong for a public authority to develop policies to guide its decision-making. Neither will it necessarily be considered to have fettered its discretion by adhering to such policies, as long as it approaches decisions with an open mind and is willing to give genuine consideration to each case at hand. It has been noted that by endorsing its application in this manner, the High Court has given legal effect to informal rules or policies, which therefore amount to \\"soft law\\". Where a statute gives a decision-maker a discretionary power, it is generally unlawful for the decision-maker to delegate that power to another person or body unless the statute itself expressly provides that this may be done. Thus, it is illegal for a decision- maker to abdicate its responsibility of exercising power by taking orders from other bodies. The Carltona doctrine of English administrative law (which Singapore inherited at independence) allows a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of a minister, even where the statute confers discretion on the minister. The Interpretation Act of Singapore provides that the exercise of a minister's power may be done under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or by any public officer authorized in writing by the minister. In addition, ministers are permitted to depute other persons to exercise certain powers or perform certain duties on their behalf. Introduction In the context of Westminster systems of government, all legal power conferred on the executive by legislation is \\"inevitably discretionary to a greater or lesser extent\\".. When exercising judicial review of such discretionary powers, the courts are concerned with whether they have been exercised in a lawful manner in accordance with Parliament's presumed intentions in conferring such powers.. Over time, the courts have developed various grounds upon which discretionary powers may be reviewed, holding that Parliament must be assumed not to have intended for decision-makers to exercise powers in such improper ways. The wrongful exercise of discretion may refer to \\"not exercising it at all or being subject to external influences in its exercise, as well as abusing conferred discretion\\".. When a public authority fetters its discretion, it can either be said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997),Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board [1997] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 56, High Court (Singapore). two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority.Lines International, p. 86, paras. 97‚Äì98. These two forms of fettering of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion in administrative law ‚Äì the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.. It has been observed that in Singapore administrative law, \\"extensive reference is made to the landmark English cases\\",. Specific reference was made to Lines International in which the High Court, in its formulation of a set of conditions regulating an authority's exercise of administrative decision, drew on the principles of fettering of discretion from a number of English administrative cases. and in particular English administrative law has largely influenced the adoption of the doctrine of fettering of discretion in Singapore. One exception is that although a contractual fetter on discretion has been established in English law to be a separate ground of review, this has yet to be recognized by the Singapore courts. In Birkdale District Electricity Supply Co. v. Southport Corporation (1926),Birkdale District Electricity Supply Co. v. Southport Corporation [1926] A.C. 355, House of Lords (UK). the House of Lords held that if legislation entrusts a public authority with certain powers and duties to be exercised for public purposes, it is illegal for the authority to enter into a contract that prevents itself from exercising its powers.Birkdale District Electricity Supply Co., p. 364. Fettering discretion by rigid adherence to a policy Public authorities given discretion under statute to make certain decisions often adopt non-statutory policies to guide them in their exercise of such discretionary powers.. In Lines International, Justice Judith Prakash noted that were it the case that statutory bodies could not formulate policies or guidelines except through duly promulgated regulations, \\"then everything would come to a grinding halt while policy decisions had to be communicated to the Attorney-General's Chambers, then drafted into regulations and then the drafts approved by the organisation concerned before being sent on to Parliament and effected by gazette notification. That is not the way the executive arm of any common law country functions.\\"Lines International, p. 77, para. 73. The principle of not fettering one's discretion \\"directs attention to the attitude of the decision-maker, preventing him from rigidly excluding the possibility of any exception to that rule or policy in a deserving case\\".\\"Procedural Fairness: Fettering of Discretion\\", De Smith's Judicial Review, pp. 479‚Äì498 at 480, para. 9-004. A decision-maker must not \\"shut his ears\\" to exceptional cases because of such a policy.Leyland & Anthony, p. 259. The ground of fettering discretion on this basis is distinct from the right to a fair hearing. The latter relates to a separate ground of judicial review, namely, procedural impropriety, and particularly the audi alteram partem (\\"hear the other side\\") principle.De Smith's Judicial Review, p. 480, para. 9-004. =English position= The English courts have held that there is nothing wrong with a public authority adopting a policy to base its decisions on as long as the authority does not refuse to listen at all to anyone who has something new to say. Both the English and Singapore positions are similar in that they both regard consideration of exceptional cases as the benchmark for whether discretion has been fettered. In R. v. Port of London Authority, ex parte Kynoch, Ltd. (1918),R. v. Port of London Authority, ex parte Kynoch, Ltd. [1919] 1 K.B. 176, Court of Appeal (England and Wales). the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that:Ex parte Kynoch, p. 184. The House of Lords agreed with ex parte Kynoch in British Oxygen Co. Ltd. v Minister of Technology (1970).. The court held that there was nothing to stop the Minister from requiring the operation of some limiting rule if that is what policy or good administration requires. It also reiterated that for discretion to be unfettered, consideration must be given to exceptional cases. \\"What the authority must not do is to refuse to listen at all. There can be no objection to [the formulation of the rule], provided the authority is always willing to listen to anyone with something new to say.\\"British Oxygen, pp. 624‚Äì625. This position was further buttressed in Re Findlay (1984),Re Findlay [1985] A.C. 318, H.L. (UK). where four prisoners contended that the Home Secretary's new policy of refusing parole in all but exceptional cases was a fetter upon his discretion. The House of Lords rejected the argument that the relevant statutory provisions required \\"individual consideration of individual cases in every instance, free of presumptions or policies\\", and held that it would be difficult to understand how a Secretary of State could properly manage the complexities of his statutory duty without a policy.Findlay, pp. 334‚Äì335. =Singapore position= Lines International conditions A ship berthed at the Singapore Cruise Centre in December 2010. In a 1997 case, the High Court held, among other things, that the Port of Singapore Authority had not fettered its discretion by rigidly applying a policy to restrict the number of \\"cruises-to-nowhere\\", which were mainly for gambling purposes. In Lines International, the plaintiff, a cruise operator, challenged the adoption by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (\\"STPB\\") and the Port of Singapore Authority (\\"PSA\\") of a general policy in the form of non-statutory guidelines regulating cruises-to-nowhere (\\"CNWs\\"), which were mainly operated for gambling purposes. The guidelines had been read out to cruise operators at a meeting. One condition was that berths might not be allocated for CNWs if operators scheduled more than 30% of their cruises as CNWs over a three-month period. The plaintiff argued that the PSA's power to control the use of its berths had to be exercised through subsidiary legislation. The High Court held that the PSA had discretion in deciding which vessels could use which berths, and went on to consider whether the PSA had fettered its discretion in enforcing the guidelines. Justice Prakash laid out a set of conditions by which the adoption of a policy by an authority exercising discretionary power would be valid. The conditions were that such a general policy will be valid if:Lines International, p. 79, para. 78. #the policy is not Wednesbury unreasonable in the sense used in Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947),. that is, it is not \\"a decision that is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it or that no reasonable person could have come to such a view\\";Lines International, p. 79, para. 78, citing . #in considering what constitutes \\"reasonableness\\", the courts are not to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, and the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the policy or guideline is illegal or ultra vires; #the guidelines must be made known to the persons affected; and #the authority must not fetter its \\"discretion in the future and is prepared to hear out individual cases or is prepared to deal with exceptional cases\\". In the formulation of this condition, the judge referred to the English cases of British Oxygen (1970) and Re Findlay (1984), and accepted that a decision- maker cannot fetter its discretion by rigid adherence to a policy. On the facts of Lines International, the judge held that the policy satisfied all four conditions and that the adoption of the guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering of discretion, the judge found that the PSA and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as they had made it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a number of such concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy.Lines International, p. 86, para. 97. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).. Non-statutory rules or policies are \\"often drafted in a more flexible and less formalistic and precise way than statutory rules, thus leaving more leeway in their application\\". Such policies are often referred to as \\"soft law\\". Such soft law \\"may be understood as a descriptive umbrella for non- binding instruments containing recommendations or hortatory, programmatic statements, taking the form of informal rules like circulars, self-regulating codes of conduct or government white papers. These soft law instruments co- exist with 'hard' law and may have legal impact.\\". It has been commented that the High Court's formulation of the Lines International conditions has given legal effect to informal rules or policies issued by public authorities.. Application of the conditions The Lines International conditions were applied by a different High Court judge in the case of Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009).. The plaintiff argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (\\"URA\\") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. The Court held that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to the plaintiff the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the plaintiff had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the Court held that the URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.Borissik, p. 103, para. 41. The issue in the High Court decision Komoco Motors Pte. Ltd. v. Registrar of Vehicles (2007) (\\"Komoco Motors (H.C.)\\"). and the appeal to the Court of Appeal from that decision, Registrar of Vehicles v. Komoco Motors Pte. Ltd. (2008), (\\"Komoco Motors (C.A.)\\"). was whether the Registrar of Vehicles had acted correctly in relying on the open market value (\\"OMV\\") of vehicles determined by the Singapore Customs to calculate the additional registration fee (\\"ARF\\") payable on such vehicles. This practice, referred to as the \\"administrative convention\\" in the case, had existed for over 40 years.Komoco Motors (C.A.), pp. 344‚Äì345, paras. 4‚Äì6. In the High Court, the judge found that the Registrar had fettered her discretion in relation to the valuation of the cars because, having instituted a policy of adopting the Customs' valuation of the OMV, she had not been prepared to hear out with an open mind Komoco's case that the ARF was incorrect.Komoco Motors (H.C.), p. 164, paras. 51‚Äì52. The judge dismissed the fact that the Registrar had held meetings with her senior officers and had taken extended periods of time to make a decision, holding that these did not show she had given genuine consideration to Komoco's case as \\"the passing of time [did] not by itself indicate how the time was used\\".Komoco Motors (H.C.), p. 161, para. 44. The judge also found that the absence of the Registrar's comments on Komoco's arguments, especially on some which the judge found credible, strengthened the case that genuine consideration had not been given. Lastly, the judge held the Registrar had indicated that she had dealt with Komoco's representations with a predisposed frame of mind as her reply to Komoco was that \\"the policy was very clear\\" and that the ARF had been \\"computed based on the OMVs as assessed by Customs\\".Komoco Motors (H.C.), p. 162, para. 45; and p. 164, para. 51. The High Court's decision was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court held that the Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had been shown to be incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any compelling reason for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.Komoco Motors (C.A.), pp. 359‚Äì360, paras. 36‚Äì38; and p. 362, para. 43. The principle against a public authority fettering its discretion by rigid adherence to a policy also applies to the exercise of discretionary police powers, as indicated by obiter dicta in the High Court case of Chee Soon Juan v. Public Prosecutor (2011).. Although the case did not involve judicial review and did not specifically cite Lines International, Justice Woo Bih Li discussed the validity of a general police policy in the context of judicial review, opining that the adoption of a policy \\"determining that political activities as a class posed a greater threat to public order than commercial activities ... was not in itself offensive for the purposes of administrative law provided that the police do not fetter their discretion and remain prepared to consider the facts of each case\\".Chee Soon Juan, p. 64, para. 40. Fettering discretion by wrongful delegation of responsibility or powers Where a statute gives a decision-maker a discretionary power, whether of a judicial, legislative or administrative nature, it is generally unlawful for the decision-maker to delegate that power to another person or body unless the statute itself expressly provides that this may be done.Leyland & Anthony, p. 270. In exercising his discretionary powers, a government official is expected to \\"apply his own mind in the matter\\". =English position= Delegation of authority to an absolute body The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921)Ellis v. Dubowski [1921] 3 K.B. 621, High Court (Divisional Court) (England and Wales). lays down the principle that there can be no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.Ellis, pp. 625‚Äì626. Nature of function delegated The nature of the function delegated by a public authority is crucial in determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975),R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1686, C.A. (England and Wales). it was accepted that the Board could establish a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, and that it was not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task.Ex parte Selvarajan, pp. 1695‚Äì1696. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or quasi-judicial functions such as disciplinary powers.Vine v. National Dock Labour Board [1957] A.C. 488 at 492, H.L. (UK). Delegation by minister In the case of ministerial discretion, it has been established in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943)Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works [1943] 2 All E.R. 560, C.A. (England and Wales). that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.Leyland & Anthony, pp. 270‚Äì271. Although ministers are entitled to obtain views from other departments or ministries when making decisions, they must consider objections and not disable themselves from exercising their discretion. In H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government (1969),H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government [1970] 1 W.L.R. 1231 at 1236‚Äì1238, H.C. (Queen's Bench) (England and Wales). the Housing Minister's decision was quashed because he had, by his stated policy, delegated to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the effective decision on any appeal where the latter had an objection.H. Lavender and Son Ltd., p. 1241. =Singapore position= Abdication of responsibility and delegation of powers to another agency The English common law position that a public body cannot fetter its discretion by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International.Lines International, pp. 86‚Äì93, paras. 98‚Äì124. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated in the case are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise discretion by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy that appeared to be a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch (\\"GSB\\") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of discretion and was held to be invalid.Lines International, p. 86, para. 99. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its discretion. The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB on the basis of the invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter.Lines International, p. 86, para. 100. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.The evidence included a letter from the STPB to the plaintiff's solicitors informing it that the PSA would be denying berthing rights to Nautican on 11 November 1995. The letter asked the solicitors to \\"convey PSA's decision\\" to the plaintiffs so that necessary arrangements could be made: Lines International, p. 86, paras. 113‚Äì118. The headquarters of the Land Transport Authority at 1 Hampshire Road, Singapore. In a 2008 case, the Court of Appeal found that the Registrar of Vehicles had not fettered her discretion by abdicating her statutory power. In Komoco Motors, the Court of Appeal held that the Registrar of Vehicles had not abdicated to the Customs her discretionary power. Expressing the view of the Court, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong held that the Lines International conditions \\"although correct in law, [were] inapplicable to the factual context of the appeal\\". The Court distinguished the factual context in Lines International from the present case on two bases. First, it found that the Registrar had made the decision in the lawful exercise of her power and for practical reasons, which included the Customs' reliability in assessing the OMV of vehicles. In any case, an aggrieved importer had a statutory rightUnder the , ss. 22B(1) and 22B(5). to object to and be heard on the Customs' determination of OMVs. Secondly, while Lines International involved a determination of whether a vessel should be given berthing space, the PSA had to exercise its judgment as to how to weigh up various relevant factors. However, in Komoco Motors, once the Registrar had decided to adopt the Customs' OMV of a motor vehicle as its \\"value\\" for the purposes of the ARF Scheme, no further exercise of judgment was required of the Registrar. The Court held that the calculation of the ARF was simply an arithmetical exercise of applying the percentage stated in subsidiary legislation to the Customs' OMVs, and hence did not involve the taking of instructions by the Registrar from another statutory agency.Komoco Motors (C.A.), p. 355, para. 31. While the Court found that there was a suggestion that the Registrar could only decide whether to reconsider the ARF imposed on cars if she received Customs' further advice, she nevertheless had not abdicated her power as she could determine the value of vehicles, \\"after making such enquiries, if any, as [she] thinks fit\\".Komoco Motors (C.A.), pp. 369‚Äì370, paras. 58‚Äì59. Thus, the Registrar did not need to make any inquiries at all as she had a reliable means of determining each vehicle's value. Furthermore, her statutory discretion was so wide that she could exercise it to determine the appropriate value of a motor vehicle in every case by relying on the Customs' OMV.Komoco Motors (C.A.), p. 370, para. 60. The plaintiff in Lines International argued that the guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee set up by the PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.Lines International, pp. 84‚Äì85, paras. 92‚Äì93. Delegation by minister Under section 35 of the Interpretation Act, if written law confers power on a minister to give a direction, issue an order or authorize something to be done, exercise of the power may be done (unless the law states otherwise) under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or of any public officer authorized in writing by the minister. (\\"IA\\"). Section 36 of the Act permits a minister empowered to exercise a power or perform a duty to, in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, depute another person to exercise the power or perform the duty on his or her behalf. The delegation must be approved by the President (acting on Cabinet's advice);, Art. 21(1). may be made subject to conditions, exceptions and qualifications; and must be published in the Government Gazette.IA, ss. 36(1) and (2). The minister remains capable of exercising the power or performing the duty personally.IA, s. 36(4). The power to make subsidiary legislation cannot be delegated.IA, s. 36(3). =Relevance of delegatus non potest delegare maxim= The doctrine of wrongful delegation is sometimes said to be a reflection of the Latin maxim delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot appoint another), which means that a body to which or person to whom power was delegated by Parliament cannot further delegate the power to another. Academics have submitted that the maxim does not state a rule of law, but is \\"at most a rule of construction\\" and in applying it to a statute \\"there, of course must be a consideration of the language of the whole enactment and of its purposes and objects\\".. Thus, in reality, there is no such principle as delegatus non potest delegare; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of cases but is sometimes used as a convenient label. Consequently, in most cases the courts have adopted such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern governmental agencies.Willis, p. 264. For statutory powers, the important question is whether it is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A's authority by B. The maxim is merely the pencil with which the court is able to draw the line between authorized and unauthorized sub-delegation,. and the courts must then ask whether statutory discretion remains in the hands of the proper authority, or whether some other person purports to exercise it.Wade & Forsyth, p. 260. Thus where an Act said that an inspector of nuisances \\"may procure any sample\\" of goods for analysis, it was held that the inspector might validly send his assistant to buy a sample of coffee, as he had in no way authorized his assistant to exercise the discretion legally reposed in himself.R. v. Commission for Racial Equality, ex parte Cottrell & Rothon [1980] 1 W.L.R. 1580 at 1588‚Äì1589, H.C. (Q.B.) (England and Wales). Ultimately, the courts must decide the issue based on what Parliament has authorized according to what may be summarized as the language, scope and objects of the empowering statute.Thorp, p. 99.

While outdoor sports are most affected, those played indoors can still be impacted by adverse or advantageous weather conditions. Temperature Temperature has a significant impact on the performance of athletes. High temperature can cause various heat illnesses such as heat cramps and heatstroke, while very low temperatures may lead to hypothermia. Training regimes may include methods of heat acclimatization, and regulations in some sports stipulate the intensity of some schedules.

Tang court ladies from the tomb of Princess Yongtai in the Qianling Mausoleum, near Xi'an in Shaanxi, China. 706 AD. In China, women had different kinds of clothes in ancient times. Those clothes changed with the dynasty. For examples, in the 1920s, the Cheongsam was fashionable among socialites and upperclass women; during the 1960s, very austere clothing styles were prevalent; today, a wide variety of fashions are worn. Different provinces and regions of China also have different clothing styles. In Qin and Han dynasties, women usually wore loose clothes with long, large, sleeves. Under the long skirt was a pair of high-heeled clogs, usually with some embroidery on them. There was usually a scarf called Jinguo (Â∑æÂ∏º) wrapped on the arm of a noble woman, while ordinary or poor women had no decoration on their arms. As time passed by, the coat tended to be shorter and the skirt became longer. Noble women even needed maids‚Äô help to lift up the skirts, to avoid the skirts being stained by the ground. In Sui and Tang dynasties, women‚Äôs clothes had a trend of being more open. Small-sleeved coats, usually made of yarn, skirts that were still long, wide and long scarves were what was often worn. They could bare the part of their body above their chests. This sort of cloth could show the beauty of the women better. Another kind of clothes that were popular at that time were things with big sleeves, short breasted shirts and long and light skirts. The attire of women during the Song dynasty (960 - 1279) was distinguished from men's clothing by being fastened on the left, not on the right. Women wore long dresses or blouses that came down almost to the ankle. They also wore skirts and jackets with short or long sleeves. When strolling about outside and along the road, women of wealth chose to wear square purple scarves around their shoulders. Traditional clothing styles =Banbi= Portrait from China's Ming dynasty. The woman is wearing a Banbi Banbi (ÂçäËáÇ, lit. \\"half arm\\") also known as Banxiu (ÂçäË¢ñ), is a form of waistcoat or outerwear that was worn over ruqun, and had half-length sleeves. The style of its collar varied, but it could be secured at the front either with ties or a metal button. According to Chinese records, the banbi clothing style was invented from the short jacket (Áü≠Ë•¶) that the Chinese wear. It was first designated as a waistcoat for palace maids, but soon became popular amongst the commoners. In the \\"Legend of Huo Xiao Yu\\" (Â¥îÂ∞èÁéâ‰º†), written during the Tang Dynasty, the main female character Huo Xiaoyu wears this style most of the time.Information on Civilian Clothings ‰∏çÊãò‰∏ÄÊ†ºËØ¥‰æøÊúç oldbeijing.org Retrieved 2010-02-10 =Beizi= A beizi (Ë§ôÂ≠ê) is an item of traditional Chinese attire common to both men and women, similar to a cloak. Most popular during the Ming dynasty, beizi also known as banbi during the Tang dynasty) is believed to have been adopted from Central Asia during the Tang dynasty through the Silk Road, when cultural exchange was frequent.Yoon, Ji-Won.

However, it is also believed to have been derived from banbi during the Song dynasty, where the sleeves and the garment lengthened. =Chang'ao= Chang-ao (Èï∑Ë•ñ) - formal wear for women Chang-ao () is a traditional Chinese style of attire for women. It is a form of formal wear, and is often perceived as a longer version of ruqun. However, it was actually developed from zhiduo during the Ming Dynasty, and is worn over a skirt. It is wide-sleeved, shorter than zhiduo, and has no side panels (ÊöóÊì∫) at the side slits (thus showing the skirt worn underneath). There is often an optional detachable protective huling (Ë≠∑È†ò, lit. \\"protect collar\\") sewn to the collar. The huling can be white or any other (often dark) colours. The collar is of the same colour as the clothing. =Daxiushan= A painting of court ladies and one man on horseback, dressed in upper class outing apparel, a 12th-century painting by Li Gonglin, as well as a remake of an 8th- century original by Tang artist Zhang Xuan. Daxiushan (Â§ßË¢ñË°´), translated as \\"Large Sleeve Gown\\", is a traditional Chinese attire for women and was most popular during the Tang dynasty amongst the royal family. After the golden age of the Tang Dynasty ended, the influence of Hufu (ËÉ°Êúç), or clothing styles from Central and Western Asia, gradually weakened and Tang royal women's clothing styles began to make its transformation.Âîê‰ª£Â§ßË¢ñË°´ yonglian.gov.cn retrieved 2010-01-07 It was not until the Mid-Late Tang period (‰∏≠ÊôöÂîêÊó∂Êúü) that the distinctions between Royal women's clothing and other styles became increasingly obvious.

It features a distinctive rode that covers from the ground to just above the chest with a knot wrapped around the waist, a light and sometimes see-through outer coat that ties together at the bottom and often goes along with a long scarf wrapped around the arm. The clothing often only covered half of women's breast, and so it was restricted to people of a certain status, like a princess or gƒìjƒ´. It has come to be known as Da-Xiu-Shan but has been called Dian-Chai-Li-Yi (ÈíøÈíóÁ§ºË°£) at various times. The clothing was mainly worn for special ceremonial occasions and had different variations, which were mainly the result of different collar formations (e.g., parallel or cross collar or those with no collar).\\"Âîê¬∑ÊúçÈ•∞\\" ÊÖ¢ÊùüÁΩóË£ôÂçäÈú≤ËÉ∏ ‚ÄúÈíøÈíóÁ§ºË°£‚ÄùÂ§ßË¢ñË°´‚Äî‚ÄîÂîê‰ª£Â•≥Â≠êÊúç wenhua.eco.gov.cn retrieved 2010-01-07 Thursday, 20 September 2018 =Diyi= Diyi (ÁøüË°£) is the traditional Chinese attire worn by empresses and crown princesses (the wife of the crown prince) in the Ming Dynasty. It was a formal wear meant only for ceremonial purposes. It was a form of shenyi, and was embroidered with long-tailed pheasants (Áøü, Di) and circular flowers (Â∞èËº™Ëä±). It was worn with a phoenix crown (without the dangling strings of pearls by the sides). Diyi was worn by empresses and other royal noblewomen (differed according during different dynasties) since the Zhou dynasty, under various names like huiyi (Ë§òË°£) in Zhou and Song dynasty, and miaofu (Â∫ôÊúç) in Han dynasty.ÂéÜ‰ª£ÁöáÂêéÊúÄÂÖ∏ÂûãÁöÑÁøüË°£, XICI.net, Retrieved 2009-12-08 =Lotus shoes= Lotus shoes Lotus shoes (ËìÆÂ±• / Ëé≤Â±•, lianl«ö) were footwear that were worn by women in China who had bound feet. The shoes were cone or sheath- shaped, intended to resemble a lotus bud. They were delicately constructed from cotton or silk, and small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. Some designs had heels or wedge-shaped soles. They were made in different styles and colors, and were typically ornately decorated, with embroidered designs of animals or flowers that could continue on the sole of the shoe. Some designs only fit over the tip of the foot, giving the illusion of a small bound foot when worn under a long skirt. Though foot binding is no longer practised, many lotus shoes survive as artefacts in museums or private collections. =Phoenix crown= A Phoenix crown (kao) was a Chinese traditional headgear for women. It was worn by noblewomen in the Ming dynasty on ceremonies or official occasions. It was also the traditional headwear for brides. It was adorned with gold dragons, phoenixes made with kingfisher feathers, beaded pheasants, pearls and gemstones. The number of pearls used ranged from 3426 to 5449 pieces, while the number of gemstones used ranged from 95 to 128 pieces. These pearls, gemstones and kingfisher feathers are made into ornamental flowers, leaves, clouds, and bobin (ÂçöÈ¨¢, the 'wings' at the side/back of the crown). The weight of the entire crown ranged from 2 to 3 kilograms. =Ruqun= Ruqun (Ë•¶Ë£ô) is an item of traditional Chinese attire (Hanfu) primarily for women. It consists of a blouse (Ë•¶, ru) and a wrap-around skirt (Ë£ô, qun). It has a long history, and has been worn by women since the Warring States period. Generally, the blouse was tucked into the skirt. The popularity of ruqun declined during the Han dynasty, but increased again during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the skirts were tied higher and higher up the waist, until they were eventually tied above the breasts, and worn with short blouses. In addition to the normal crossed-collar blouses, parallel/straight-collar (Â∞çË•ü) blouses were also worn in this period, thus exposing the cleavage of the breasts. During the Song dynasty, the skirts were eventually lowered from the breast level back to the normal waistline. By the Ming Dynasty, ruqun became the most common form of attire for women. The sleeves of the blouse were mostly curved with a narrow sleeve cuff (ÁêµÁê∂Ë¢ñ, pipa sleeve). There is often an optional detachable protective huling (Ë≠∑È†ò, lit. \\"protect collar\\") sewn to the collar. The huling can be white or any other dark colour. The collar is of the same colour as the clothing. Towards the start of the Qing dynasty, the skirt was mostly baizhequn (ÁôæÊë∫Ë£ô, lit. \\"hundred pleats skirt\\") or mamianqun (È¶¨Èù¢Ë£ô, lit. \\"horse face skirt\\"). =Yuan lingshan= Ming Dynasty portrait of a noblewoman wearing yuanlingshan, phoenix crown and xiapei Yuanlingshan (ÂúìÈ†òË°´) was the most common form of attire for both male and female officials and nobles during the Ming Dynasty. The difference between civilian's and officials'/nobles' yuanlingshan is that officials'/nobles' yuanlingshan had a mandarin square (Ë£úÂ≠ê) on it. The sleeves of the yuanlingshan were mostly curved with a narrow sleeve cuff (ÁêµÁê∂Ë¢ñ, pipa sleeve). It had a round collar and side slits. Officials'/nobles' yuanlingshan were also wedding attire for commoners. The groom wears a wusha hat (ÁÉèÁ¥óÂ∏Ω) and the yuanlingshan of a 9th rank official robe. The bride wears a phoenix crown (È≥≥ÂÜ†) and a red yuanlingshan with the xiapei (ÈúûÂ∏î) of a noblewoman. More recent styles =Cheongsam= Two women wearing cheongsam in a 1930s Shanghai advertisement. The cheongsam is a body-hugging (modified in Shanghai) one-piece Chinese dress for women; the male version is the changshan. It is known in Mandarin Chinese as the q√≠p√°o (; Wade-Giles ch'i-p'ao), and is also known in English as a mandarin gown. The stylish and often tight-fitting cheongsam or qipao (chipao) that is most often associated with today was created in the 1920s in Shanghai and was made fashionable by socialites and upperclass women. =1960s= During the Cultural Revolution, almost anything seen as part of traditional culture would lead to problems with the Communist Red Guards. Items that attracted dangerous attention if seen in public included jeans, high heels, Western-style coats, ties, jewelry, cheongsams, and long hair.Law, Kam-yee. [2003] (2003). The Chinese Cultural Revolution Reconsidered: beyond purge and Holocaust. These items were regarded as symbols of the bourgeois lifestyle, which represented wealth. Citizens had to avoid them or suffer serious consequences such as torture or beatings by the guards. A number of these items were thrown into the streets to embarrass the citizens.Wen, Chihua. Madsen, Richard P. [1995] (1995). The Red Mirror: Children of China's Cultural Revolution. Westview Press. =Modern era= Following the relaxation of communist clothing standards in the late 70s, the way the Chinese dressed and the fashion trends of the country changed drastically. Contemporary urban clothing seems to have developed a focus on brand names. In major urban centers, especially Shanghai, an increasingly western look is preferred, and there is an emphasis on formal wear over casual wear for adults on the streets. Teenagers prefer brand names and western clothing. Children usually wear clothes decorated with cartoon characters. However, there is also an effort to revive traditional clothing forms such as the hanfu by the hanfu movement. At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Shanghai in 2001, the host presented silk-embroidered tangzhuang jackets as the Chinese traditional national costume. As smartphones and tablet computers have become increasingly popular, they are some of the most popular ways people gain access to fashion information, along with the Internet and fashion magazines. As for buying clothing, brick-and-mortar stores are still the predominant choice, taking up more than half of the market share.

The EMN also serves to provide the wider public with such information. The EMN was established by the Council of the European Union Decision 2008/381/EC adopted on 14 May 2008.  Objectives  The need for Member States to exchange information on all aspects of migration, and to contribute to a common asylum and immigration policy was initially proposed by the Laeken European Council in 2001 and reinforced through the Thessaloniki European Council in 2003, the year the EMN was launched as a pilot project. The Hague Programme reinforced the need for common analysis of migratory phenomena, and the successor Stockholm Programme contains many elements for the better comparability and exchange of information between Member States across the wide range of asylum and migration policy developments. Within this context, the EMN was established in 2008.  Network structure and organisation  The EMN is co-ordinated by the European Commission under the responsibility of the Directorate for Migration and Home Affairs, and in co- operation with National Contact Points (EMN NCPs) appointed in each Member State, and Norway, by their national government. The EMN NCPs consist of Ministries of Interior and of Justice, plus Research Institutes, Non- Governmental Organisations, and the national offices of an International Organisation. Each EMN NCP in turn co-ordinates a national network of relevant stakeholder organisations. The EMN is overseen by a Steering Board, chaired by the Commission and including one representative from the Member States participating in the adoption of Council Decision 2008/381/EC plus, with observer status, representatives from the European Parliament, Frontex, Fundamental Rights Agency, European Asylum Support Office and the EU Anti- Trafficking Coordinator.  Reports, studies and other outputs  The EMN produces Annual Policy Reports and Studies and Policy Briefs (EMN Informs) on policy-relevant asylum and migration themes. The Reports and Studies are based on information held or collected by network members in the Member States, rather than primary research, which is then synthesised to provide a comparative perspective at the EU level. The EMN also has an Ad Hoc Query system for use by EMN members and has developed an EMN Asylum and Migration Glossary with the aim to incorporate this into the Inter-Active Terminology for Europe (IATE). The EMN also provides regular updates on political developments at EU level and in Member States, latest available migration and international protection statistics; and news of its own and other relevant outputs through its regular EMN Bulletin. Since 2009, the EMN has contributed to the European Commission's Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum- and as of 2014 the EMN has been commissioned to develop the Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum at EU level, providing an EU overview on Immigration and Asylum. Also its work regularly contributes to EU debates on specific aspects of migration and asylum policy, for example, labour demand, irregular migration, family reunification and international students. The EMN works closely with other relevant entities, both within EU institutions and elsewhere, particularly in relation to specific studies and policy themes. These include the Commission's Eurostat and Directorate-General for Research (European Commission), the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), Frontex, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator and Eurocities.  Recent developments  According to the Council Decision (2008/381/EC) establishing the EMN, an external and independent evaluation, on the development of the EMN, should be presented by the Commission to the European Parliament every three years. Therefore, a second independent evaluation of the EMN was undertaken in 2015. In general, the EMN received again a positive assessment and its relevance and coherence were considered as increasingly relevant under the policy-making framework. EMN outputs and activities proved to be of high quality and aligned to the main EMN objectives. Regarding the EMN impact, while the evaluation found that this might vary across Member States, it was however highlighted that the EMN has achieved a commendable level of impact at the EU level. Finally, the evaluation also noted that the EMN demonstrated to be highly reactive to the findings and conclusions of the first external evaluation. First EMN external evaluation: after the EMN establishment, an independent External Evaluation on the development of the EMN commenced in 2010 was completed at the end of 2011. An overall positive assessment was given with a number of areas identified where the EMN could improve further its support for policymaking, notably in terms of adapting its functioning and outputs to be better suited to the needs of policymakers; to increase further its flexibility, so that the EMN can develop further its capacity to respond to short-term information needs, as well as provide a longer-term perspective; and to have better coherence/co- operation with other entities. These elements were taken on board in the EMN's Work Programmes for 2012 and 2013 with a number of innovations from previous years, to better respond to the information needs of policymakers. Following on from this evaluation, the Commission has published a Development Report on the EMN and its future, (COM (2012) 427 final) on 1 August 2012.

It differs from traditional testing methods in that the testing is carried out by a number of different testers from different places, and not by hired consultants and professionals. The software is put to test under diverse realistic platforms which makes it more reliable, cost-effective, and can be fast. In addition, crowdsource testing can allow for remote usability testing because specific target groups can be recruited through the crowd. This method of testing is considered when the software is more user-centric: i.e., software whose success is determined by its user feedback and which has a diverse user space. It is frequently implemented with gaming, mobile applications, when experts who may be difficult to find in one place are required for specific testing, or when the company lacks the resources or time to carry out the testing internally. System Crowdsource testing companies provide the platform for the testing cycles, generally free of charge to the companies whose products are being tested. They then crowdsource the product to a community of testers, who register for testing the software voluntarily. These testers are generally paid either by time, per action, or per bug, depending upon the type of bug and its market price. The crowdsourced testing team can be in addition to the in-house quality assurance team, or a replacement. Depending on the platform and provider, the method of access varies. The most common are: * Self-service, where the customer directly interact with testers * Managed, where the customer interacts with a dedicated person, rather than directly with testers * API, where the customer requests tests to run via an API, and does not directly interact with testers * Mixed, where it is a combination of the above. Advantages of crowdsource testing There are several advantages to crowdsourced testing: * It's possible, and generally easier than hiring, to get 24x7 coverage and be able to test at anytime. * The internal testing team may not have the needed setup or hardware to test the software in different environments and in different situations. e.g. different Internet bandwidths, devices, etc. * If paid per bug, it is can be cost effective, as the product company pays only for the valid bugs reported. * Testers performing the work are unbiased from knowing much about the software under test. This can help them notice things that may otherwise be missed, but does require more detailed test cases. * Crowdsourcing can find testers with diverse languages as well as locales. This helps in testing applications which require localization testing. * Most platforms let you scale from a team of zero to the number you need on demand. This is a benefit to the customer as the more testers testing software simultaneously, the quicker testing can be done. * Testers performing tests of different applications will identify common anti-patterns. Disadvantages of crowdsource testing There are several disadvantages to crowdsource testing: * Confidentiality must be managed closely as the number of non-internal individuals looking at the system under test increases. This can increase the risk of innovation and new features being leaked to competitors. Some companies require testers to sign a Non-disclosure_agreement. * Immediate and prompt communication with a group of crowdsource testers can be difficult, or impossible depending on the method of management. * Crowdsourced testers who are compensated by the number of bugs detected may find a larger number of less impactful bugs, creating noise for the customer, whilst skipping over more harder to replicate bugs. This is due to the principal-agent problem. * If directly managing a crowd, crowdsourced testing will result in increased need for management oversight due to differences in testers' time zones and locations, languages, and cultures. This can be mitigated by managed, or API based services, as the customer does not directly manage testers. * Ensuring test coverage in crowdsource testing can be difficult, as some platforms do not support good reporting. This means testing is not planned or tracked the same way as traditional waterfall or Agile test efforts.  Crowdsourced testing vs. Outsourced testing  Crowdsourced testing may be considered to be a sub-type of software testing outsourcing. While for some projects it may be possible to get away with only using one approach or the other, a more thorough approach would use a more diverse software testing method, which uses both a dedicated testing team in addition to the crowd. Crowdsource testing is best for things like beta and compatibility testing, which are necessary final steps for testing; however, most software is far too complex for late-stage testing like this to cover all of the possible issues. A dedicated outsourced or in-house testing team will give a better idea of the software's possible defects, but will not give anywhere near the scope of crowdtesting. Therefore, a good solution is to integrate multiple test teams into any development project (and also to develop with the principles of testability in mind from the very beginning.) Crowdsourcing alone may not give the best feedback on applications. A diverse testing approach that pools both crowdsource testing and a dedicated testing team may be favorable. \\"Having this diversity of staffing allows you to scale your resources up and down in a fluid manner, meeting tight deadlines during peak periods of development and testing, while controlling costs during slow periods.\\"  References  * Category:Crowdsourcing Category:Software testing ","title":"Crowdsourced testing"},{"id":"33125229","text":"Mixed Koƒçevje subdialects (Smole, Vera. 1998. \\"Slovenska nareƒçja.\\" Enciklopedija Slovenije vol. 12, pp. 1‚Äì5.

Prostitution has increased within the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Poverty is one of the reasons women have turned to prostitution, sometimes under pressure from family members. Prostitutes frequent bars, casinos and nightclubs, some are addicted to heroin. In Da≈üoguz, a major truck stop, many 'night butterflies' service the truck drivers in the overnight truck parks. Law enforcement is corrupt. Police target foreigners who are with prostitutes, telling them it is illegal for two unmarried people of opposite sexes to be in the same hotel room, and then asking for a \\"fine\\". During police crack-downs, any single woman in a nightclub when raided is likely to be arrested as a prostitute. Sex trafficking is a problem in Turkmenistan. Legislation Turkmenistan's Criminal Code contains the following articles criminalising prostitution and related activities: Article 138. The practice of prostitution :The repeated practice of prostitution in the course of a year after an administrative penalty has been imposed shall be punished by a fine amounting to 40 average monthly wages or corrective labour for a term of up to 2 years, or deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 2 years. Article 139. Enticement into prostitution :(1) Enticement into prostitution shall be punished by corrective labour for a term of up to 2 years or deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 2 years. :(2) This act if carried out: ::(a) Repeatedly; ::(b) By a group of conspirators; ::(c) In relation to a minor; ::(d) With the use of physical violence or the threat of its use; ::(e) With the use of blackmail or deceit; :shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of between 3 and 8 years. Article 140. Setting up or keeping of a brothel : (1) The setting up or keeping of a brothel shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 5 years, with or without the confiscation of property, with or without the imposition of a compulsory residence order for a term of between 2 and 5 years. : (2) These acts if committed repeatedly shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of between 3 and 8 years, with or without the confiscation of property, with or without the imposition of a compulsory residence order for a term of between 2 and 5 years. Article 141. Procuring : (1) Procuring for debauchery or prostitution shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to 5 years, with or without the confiscation of property. : (2) This act if committed repeatedly shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of between 3 and 8 years, with or without the confiscation of property. Article 142. Pimping : (1) Pimping for profit- seeking motives, that is to say employing prostitutes for the purpose of their sexual exploitation, shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of between 2 and 5 years, with or without the confiscation of property. : (2) This act if committed repeatedly shall be punished by deprivation of liberty for a term of between 3 and 8 years, with or without the confiscation of property. VIP entertainment Under the presidency of Saparmurat Niyazov, a form of state prostitution was introduced. Good looking high school and university students were sent from the provinces to the capital, Ashgabat, to be trained to 'entertain' high-ranking officials and VIPs. The students were chosen by local female officials. They had to be between 17 and 20, be tall, slim and have good hair and teeth. Once chosen, there was no refusing the 'honour'. Originally they could be of any ethnicity, but later only ‚Äúpure- blood‚Äù Turkmen females were chosen. Once in Ashgabat, they were trained in etiquette, polite manners, to set tableware and serve dishes. Those who didn't make it as a \\"body\\" were used to service lower ranking officials at functions. Sex trafficking Turkmenistan is a source country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Turkmen women are subjected to sex trafficking abroad. Turkey, Russia, and India are the most frequent destinations of Turkmen victims, followed by other countries in the Middle East, South and Central Asia, and Europe. Residents of rural areas in Turkmenistan are most at risk of becoming trafficking victims, both within the country and abroad. Article 129/1 of the criminal code, as amended in November 2016, defines trafficking in persons as acts done by force, fraud, or coercion, but it does not appear to include in its definition the purpose of the crime, which is exploitation. It also exempts trafficking victims from criminal responsibility for acts committed as a result of being trafficked. Article 129/1 prescribes penalties of four to 25 years imprisonment. Women under 35 are restricted from flying to Turkey or United Arab Emirates (UAE) in case prostitution is involved. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Turkmenistan as a 'Tier 3' country.

It was banned and subsequently released only in 1972. Plot 1950\\\\. After being arrested in a police raid, the two young prostitutes Lotte and Emmi are sent to the mines in Wismut. There, Germans and Soviets work together to extract Uranium for the use of the USSR. Two men fall in love with Lotte: the director Beier, a former SS man who tries to compensate for his past with hard work, and the Soviet engineer Sergei, whose wife was murdered by the Germans in the war. In the meantime, Jupp K√∂nig, a veteran communist whom Emmi once harbored from the Gestapo, leads the miners as they attempt to replace their harsh and incompetent party boss, Weihrauch. Eventually, K√∂nig is given Weihrauch's office. Lotte marries Beier, although she later realizes that she loves Sergei. When her husband is badly injured in an accident, he confides to the Soviet engineer that soldiers from his battalion murdered the latter's wife; Sergei replies that he knew it all along. Lotte and her baby son leave the mines and return to Berlin. Cast * Ulrike Germer: Lotte Lutz * G√ºnther Simon: Frank Beier * Erwin Geschonneck: Jupp K√∂nig * Manja Behrens: Emmi Jahnke * Viktor Avdyushko: Sergei Melnikov * Willi Schrade: G√ºnter Holleck * Erich Franz: Weihrauch * Norbert Christian: Josef Stein * Brigitte Krause: Berta Mattusche * Horst Kube: Wenzel * Rimma Shorokhova: Vera * Vladimir Eemelyanov: Colonel Fedoseev Production Konrad Wolf conceived the film during the early stage of the Khrushchev Thaw, when the political climate seemed to be liberalizing. The script was inspired by the real conditions of Wismut: thousands of prostitutes were arrested and forced to work in the mines during the late 1940s, while many other miners were former servicemen of the Wehrmacht, the SS or ex-members of the Nazi Party. The film was intended to be ready for release already in 1958, but the DEFA Commission and functionaries in the Ministry of Culture disapproved of the negative portrayal of party boss Weihrauch and the less than pristine conduct of the workers. The film's supporters pointed out its committed Socialist-Realist narrative, its positive depiction of Soviet-German cooperation and its artistic merits; actor Erwin Geschonneck used his influence to promote it. On 24 June 1959, after many deliberations, Sun Seekers was shown to the entire Politburo, including Walter Ulbricht. Although they requested to make several alterations, the members praised the film. It was authorized to be released on 5 October.Sabine Brummel. Die Werkt√§tigen in DEFA-Spielfilmen: Propaganda in den Filmen der DDR. Diplomica Verlag (2010). . Pages 45‚Äì47. Very shortly before it was to be released, the Soviet embassy in Berlin intervened and demanded to ban the film. While the exact details of the request are unknown, the Soviets were worried that presenting a Uranium mine and its contribution to the nuclear arms race - in the film, the main motivation of the miners was to insure peace by breaking the American monopoly on atomic weapons - would undermine their position in the diplomatic struggle against the West. Although a publicity campaign took place in the months before, the film was denied release. On 5 October, a small article in Neues Deutschland declared that the producers decided to withdraw Sun Seekers. The ban was seen as an achievement for the film's opponents in the Ministry of Culture, who viewed it as overly liberal. Mira and Antonin Liehm wrote that many interpreted it as caused by an intervention of those officials, rather than only of the Soviets.Miera Liehm, Antonin J. Liehm . The Most Important Art: Soviet and Eastern European Film After 1945. . Page 259. According to Dagmar Schittly, East German directors were strongly influenced by the picture's withdrawal, and avoided presenting any \\"real conflict\\" in their films. In 1972, after Erich Honecker rose to power, Wolf convinced him to allow the picture in cinemas.Ingrid Poss. Spur der Filme: Zeitzeugen √ºber die DEFA. . Pages 130‚Äì131.

Anke Pinkert also noted a feminist agenda, common in East German cinema, with the lone woman Lutz as the chief protagonist.Anke Pinkert. Film and memory in East Germany. Indiana University Press (2008). . Page 89. Stephen Brockmann wrote that the picture's main motif was the sun - denied to the miners, working underground, and often hidden by smoke and soot. While the sun alternatively served as an allegory to the Uranium in the earth or to the workers' own elusive personal happiness, Brockmann stated that above all it symbolized the promised, Utopian society which communism sought to establish, and for which the miners had to toil hard in the conditions of first post-war years.Stephen Brockmann.

The body is then eviscerated with the esophagus and trachea removed, the anus is cleared out, and then the carcass is soaked in water to be cleaned then drained.

From the late 1950s, the venue was associated with Liverpool's growing Merseybeat scene.  History  The institute was founded in the 1890s by Sir William Pickles Hartley. In an initial meeting in 1892, Hartley offered ¬£1,000 (approximately ¬£60,000 in 2005Calculated using The National Archives' Currency Converter) towards a project that would see \\"all the Churches, from the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England down to the very smallest mission room ... enter into a Christlike compact to fight against evil in every form.\\" After the institute's establishment, the hall was used by the Aintree Photographic Society as a club house and exhibition venue. During the Second World War, black people were prohibited from entering the hall. This was the result of a shooting and stabbing incident involving drunken black GIs. In the early 1960s, promoter Bill Kelly (also of Lathom Hall) hosted concerts at the Institute billed as \\"sensational jive dances\\". The Beatles headlined a number of these evenings, billed as \\"The Dynamic Beatles\\" or the \\"Great Boppin' Beatles\\". The Beatles performed a total of 31 shows at the venue between 7 January 1961 and 27 January 1962. While at the club, it was common for some concertgoers to throw chairs at each other and at the band. The Beatles' final concert at the venue paid ¬£15 (approximately ¬£230 in 2005), but Brian Epstein was furious when Kelly paid the group in loose change. Epstein felt this was an insult to the band, and never booked the band with Kelly again. The Aintree was demolished in 2007.

Initially, the ship was due to reach Australia in early 2013 to begin final fitout and superstructure installation at BAE Systems Australia facilities in Victoria, but this did not occur. The hull was loaded onto Blue Marlin on 10 December 2013 in Vigo Bay. Blue Marlin and Adelaide arrived at Williamstown on 7 February 2014. On 17 June 2015, Adelaide departed from Williamstown to commence sea trials, which included sailing to Sydney for docking at Garden Island, before returning to Williamstown on 11 July. A second set of trials ran from 19 to 28 August, and the ship was delivered to Fleet Base East two days later. Entry into RAN service was originally planned for mid-2015, but as of July 2011, this had been pushed back to sometime in 2016. Fitting out of the ship progressed at a faster rate than expected, which brought the predicted commissioning date back to September 2015, although this did not eventuate. The ship was formally handed over to the ADF on 22 October, and was commissioned into the RAN on 4 December. Although identified as \\"LHD02\\" during construction, Adelaide received the pennant number \\"L01\\" on commissioning; the number corresponding to that used by the frigate of the same name. Operational history Adelaide at Fleet Base East In early 2016, Adelaide undertook post-commissioning trials and other activities as the ship was worked up to full operational status. In September 2016, Adelaide took part in Exercise Kakadu 2016, based at Darwin, Northern Territory. On 12 December 2016, Adelaide intercepted the 50m former Japanese whaling vessel Kaiyo Maru No. 8 in international waters in the Southern Ocean south east of Tasmania. The vessel had attracted the attention of Maritime Border Command after loitering and circling more than 200 nautical miles off the southern coast of Australia. Tactical Assault Group personnel boarded the vessel and located suspected illicit drugs after which the vessel was escorted to Hobart with approximately 186 kilograms of cocaine located on board. The vessel was loitering after a botched rendezvous 300 nautical miles off the coast of Port Fairy in Victoria. In September 2017, Adelaide sailed as part of the largest Australian task group to deploy since the early 1980s on Exercise Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2017. This was planned as a series of exercises with nations around the Pacific Rim testing communications, disaster relief plans and regional security. Adelaide was accompanied by fleet oiler and a varying number of escorts, with a total of four frigates (, , and ) sailing from Sydney on 4 September 2017. The last time such a large deployment of Australian warships went to sea was September 1980, led by the aircraft carrier . On 5 January 2020, Adelaide sailed as part of Operation Bushfire Assist, assisting with the Royal Australian Navy's ongoing efforts to help evacuate people from bushfire zones that have become cut off by road and air due to conditions.

In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possibly final season between AMC and Sony Pictures Television, the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of thirteen) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made. On August 14, 2011, a deal was made in which AMC renewed the series for a final 16-episode season. Filming began for the season on March 26, 2012. Then in April 2012 Bryan Cranston revealed that the final season would be split into two halves, with the first half airing in 2012 and the second in 2013. After a four-month break, filming for the second half of the season began on December 7, 2012, during which AMC sent the cast and crew cupcakes decorated with characters and props used throughout the show's run. Vince Gilligan explained that the season was split at his request in order to have more time to write the final episodes. Thomas Schnauz revealed that the writers initially tried to conceive a 16-episode arc in advance of completing the first eight episodes, but that most of these plans were scrapped as new plot points emerged \\"that threw everything into a little bit of chaos.\\" Dean Norris had asked Gilligan to kill off Hank during the first half of the season after being cast in a comedy pilot. However, Gilligan declined his request, citing the importance of Hank in the final eight episodes. Gilligan stated that the introduction of the M60 machine gun in the season's pilot episode created several problems down the line in writing. When the premiere script was developed, the machine gun was written in as a thought-provoking idea to suggest to the audience that something significant was going to happen later in the season and draw them in. However, at that time, they did not plan out how the gun would be used, and Gilligan believed that with sixteen episodes, they'd be able to figure something out. As Gilligan started writing the last four to five episodes, his staff reminded him about the machine gun. Gilligan was of a mind to simply drop the machine gun but realized this wouldn't work. He eventually had a eureka moment where Walter would need to use the machine gun to kill multiple people at once rather than a single individual, leading to developing the character of Jack Welker and the white supremacist gang to be the target of Walter's wrath. =Talking Bad= After the success of the live talk show Talking Dead, which aired immediately following new episodes of The Walking Dead, AMC decided to create a similar series, titled Talking Bad, for the remaining episodes of Breaking Bad. Chris Hardwick, host of Talking Dead, also hosted this series; Talking Bad also had a similar logo and theme music to Talking Dead. Talking Bad featured crew members, actors, producers, and television enthusiasts, recapping the most recent episode, and taking questions and comments from viewers.  Reception  = Critical response = On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the fifth season has an approval rating of 97% based on 97 reviews, with an average rating of 9.45/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Breaking Bads final season cements its status as one of television's great series, propelling its narrative to an explosive conclusion with sharp direction and assured storytelling.\\" On Metacritic, it holds a 99 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, making it the highest-rated season of any show on the site. In his review of the second half of the season, Seth Amitin of IGN stated, \\"Whether you call it a 'half-season' or consider these final eight episodes its own season, this final batch of Breaking Bad is one of the best runs of episodes TV has ever offered.\\" \\"Ozymandias\\" in particular was widely praised and has since been called one of the greatest television episodes ever broadcast. =Ratings= The fifth season had six separate episodes that became the most watched episodes in the series up to date, in order: \\"Live Free or Die\\" (2.93 million), \\"Say My Name\\" (2.98), \\"Blood Money\\" (5.92), \\"Ozymandias\\" (6.37), \\"Granite State\\" (6.58), and \\"Felina\\" (10.28).

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on October 2, 2011\\\\. GQ, and Salon.com named \\"End Times\\" as one of the best episodes in all of television in 2011. Plot After receiving an anonymous warning from Saul Goodman about Hank Schrader having been targeted by a drug cartel, the DEA dispatches a squad of agents to guard Hank and Marie Schrader's house. The White family is also brought to the Schrader household for protection, but Walter White convinces Skyler White to let him stay behind at their own house, ready to face the consequences of his actions. Walt sits nervously in the backyard, spinning a gun on the table that keeps pointing at him, but takes note when it points at a potted plant. Hank deduces that his investigation of Gus Fring is the reason for the threat on his life, so he asks Gomez to search the industrial laundromat for him. Gomez and an officer with a drug-sniffing dog later check out the laundromat but don't find anything, although Jesse Pinkman and Tyrus Kitt were below them in the hidden meth lab. Gus, in a phone call to Jesse, implies the police attention is Walter's fault, and Walter must be killed to protect themselves, but Jesse again refuses to cook if Walter is killed. Saul later hands Jesse's entire share of the meth profits to Jesse, since Saul is planning to temporarily flee Albuquerque until the feud between Walter and Gus is over. Saul reveals that Gus took Walter to the desert and threatened his family, a revelation by which Jesse is taken aback. Jesse later receives a call from Andrea Cantillo that her son, Brock Cantillo, has become seriously ill and is in the hospital. Jesse discovers the ricin cigarette, which he kept handy to poison Gus, is missing and concludes that Brock somehow ingested the ricin. Jesse confronts a paranoid Walter at the Whites' house. Jesse grabs Walter's gun and points it at him, accusing him of poisoning Brock out of spite. Walter claims that Gus must have planned Brock's poisoning and framed Walter for it in order to manipulate Jesse into killing him; the cameras around the lab probably spotted the cigarette, and Tyrus must have taken it out of Jesse's locker, tracked down Brock, and poisoned him. Walter and Jesse know Gus is not above killing children, after the death of Andrea's younger brother, Tom√°s Cantillo, and Jesse ultimately decides that Walter is innocent. The two team up to kill Gus. Jesse visits the hospital daily, but Andrea will not let him see Brock after he divulges knowledge about the ricin poisoning. Jesse refuses to leave the hospital, which ruins the latest meth cook, and says he will only leave if Gus orders him to in person. When Gus arrives at the hospital, Walter plants a homemade car bomb under Gus' car and watches from a nearby rooftop for the right moment to detonate it. As Gus and his bodyguards return to the car, Gus senses something is amiss and leaves the area, leaving Walter distraught about missing his chance. Production On the Breaking Bad Insider Podcast, director Vince Gilligan reveals that the crew faced time constraints during this episode's production. Consequently, Gilligan decided during filming to cut a scripted scene wherein Walt and Jesse formulate a plan to kill Gus. In addition, the episode was filmed concurrently with the following episode, \\"Face Off\\", in order to save time. \\"End Times\\" is the only episode in the series that Gilligan directed without having written. Reception The episode received critical acclaim and it is regarded as one of Season 4's best episodes. Critics praised Aaron Paul's performance, the intense ending with Walt and Gus and the revelation in the episode that Brock is poisoned. Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 9 out of 10.https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/03/breaking-bad-end-times-review In 2019 The Ringer ranked \\"End Times\\" as the 29th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on October 9, 2011\\\\. It was directed and written by series creator and executive producer Vince Gilligan. The episode marks the culmination of the arc concerning the conflict between Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) which served as the focus of the fourth season. The episode marks Esposito's final appearance as Fring, as well as the final appearances of recurring characters Hector Salamanca and Tyrus Kitt, played by Mark Margolis and Ray Campbell, respectively. The episode received widespread critical acclaim on its initial airing and was named by TV Guide as one of the best episodes in all of television in 2011. Plot After failing to kill Gus via a car bomb, Walter removes the bomb and asks Jesse if he knows of a place Gus frequents that does not have security cameras. Before Jesse can think of one, he is then approached by Detectives Kalanchoe and Munn, and taken to the police station, where they proceed to question him about Brock's poisoning. Saul has gone into hiding, so Walter breaks into his office for his help, where Saul's secretary Francesca asks for $25,000 in exchange for Saul's contact information. Walter goes home to retrieve the cash but suspects hitmen may be waiting for him. After asking his neighbor to check on the house, he spots two men fleeing from the backyard, confirming his suspicions. Walter retrieves the money before the hitmen can spot him. Jesse is interrogated about the ricin, but he claims it was a lucky guess. Having been contacted by Walter, Saul finally arrives. Jesse tells Saul that Gus often visits Hector to taunt him, which Saul relays to Walter. Upon learning that Gus and Hector are longtime enemies, Walter visits Hector and offers him a chance to kill Gus. Hector contacts the DEA and insists upon talking directly to Hank, but at the meeting, Hector just curses at Hank through his interpreter and is quickly returned to the nursing home. Tyrus observes Hector's arrival at the DEA, assumes he is turning informant, and phones Gus, who decides to kill Hector, just as Walt anticipated. Tyrus inspects Hector's room for anything suspicious but finds it safe for Gus' visit, failing to spot Walter just outside. Meanwhile, Jesse is released from police custody after Brock's diagnosis reveals that he was not poisoned by ricin. He is immediately kidnapped by Gus' thugs and brought to the lab to cook the next batch of meth. Gus enters Hector's room and berates him for supposedly being a coward and asks Hector to finally look at him, which is something Hector had always refused to do during Gus' taunting visits. As Gus prepares to inject Hector with a syringe of poison, Hector finally looks at him for the first time in years; first remorsefully, and then with rage in his eyes before ringing his bell numerous times. At first Gus and Tyrus are confused, but Gus then realizes the bell is connected to the bomb that has been fitted under Hector's wheelchair. The explosion instantly kills Hector and Tyrus, while Gus walks out of the room seemingly unharmed and calmly adjusts his tie. Gus is then revealed to have had half his face and scalp completely torn off before he falls to the floor and dies. Walter hears the news of the explosion on the radio and is relieved that his plan has worked. He then heads to the lab, kills Gus' two henchmen stationed there, and frees Jesse. Knowing that Hank is closing in on the lab, Walt and Jesse burn it down. Later, Jesse tells Walter that Brock will live, and that he was poisoned by lily of the valley berries, which children sometimes eat because of their sweet taste. Although Jesse questions killing Gus, since Gus never poisoned Brock after all, Walter assures Jesse that it had to be done. Walter calls Skyler, who‚Äîalong with the rest of the family‚Äîis learning of the explosion from the news. Skyler asks Walt if he had caused the explosion and what happened, to which Walt replies that he has \\"won\\". The season ends with a shot of Walter's backyard, which contains a potted lily of the valley plant, towards which Walter's gun was pointed in the previous episode, implying that he indeed poisoned Brock and expected Jesse to react as he did, turning against Gus instead. Production The special effect of Gus Fring's face having been blasted away took months of preparation The episode was written and directed by series creator Vince Gilligan. It marked Gilligan's final directorial credit on the series before the series finale. This episode marks the final appearance in the series of Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring, and recurring actors Mark Margolis as Hector Salamanca and Ray Campbell as Tyrus Kitt. Esposito, Campbell and Margolis would reprise their respective roles in Breaking Bad's spin-off series Better Call Saul, beginning with the latter show's third and second season respectively. The plot wrapup was planned by the series' production team since the beginning of the season, partly because they were not certain at the time whether the series was going to be renewed for another season. The visual effect of Gus Fring's massive facial wounds took months to prepare, with assistance from Greg Nicotero and the special effects team from fellow AMC drama The Walking Dead. The effect was produced using elaborate makeup on Giancarlo Esposito's face, combined with computer-generated imagery that combined two separate shots. The episode's title \\"Face Off\\" was also meant to be a reference to Gus losing half of his face in the explosion. The songs playing throughout the episode were \\"Black\\" by Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi featuring Norah Jones, \\"Goodbye\\" by Apparat, and \\"Freestyle\\" by Taalbi Brothers. The use of \\"Black\\" was included as among the series's greatest musical choices by Complex and Uproxx. Reception =Critical reception= Vince Gilligan received acclaim for his direction and writing of the episode. The episode received unanimous acclaim from television critics. Seth Amitin of IGN awarded the episode 9.5 out of 10, describing it as \\"the perfect blend of Breaking Bad\\". Alan Sepinwall, reviewing for HitFix, said the episode was \\"fantastic, from beginning to end\\". Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic awarded the episode a 4.8 out of 5 and described Breaking Bad as \\"the best show on television\\". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\". James Poniewozik of TIME magazine described the finale as \\"stunning, morally searing and, well, explosive ... with a few holy- crap moments for the ages\\", while Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter reckoned that the episode \\"did a lot of things right, course-correcting most ... worries and giving viewers not only an action-packed, satisfying episode but putting the show on the path to finish ... in a nearly perfect dramatic state.\\" In 2019 The Ringer ranked \\"Face Off\\" as the third best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes. =Awards= Giancarlo Esposito made his final appearance as Gus Fring in Breaking Bad before reprising the role in Better Call Saul. The episode was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards at the 64th ceremony, including Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for Vince Gilligan; Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Mark Margolis; Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series; Outstanding Single- Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series; Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series; Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One-Hour); and Outstanding Special Visual Effects in a Supporting Role.

By 1850 there were more than 106 paper mills in New York, more than in any other state.Valente, A. J. (2010). Rag Paper Manufacture in the United States, 1801‚Äì1900: A History, with directories of mills and owners. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland. p. 61. A landmark in the history of papermaking in the United States was the installation of the first Fourdrinier machine in the country at a mill in Saugerties, New York, in 1827.Valente (2010), p. 8. Papermaking from ground-wood pulp began in New York in 1869, with the establishment of the Hudson River Pulp & Paper Company in Corinth and also with the work of Illustrious Remington and his sons in Watertown. The innovation and success of the Remingtons spurred further development of the industry in the state. Early paper mills There is documentation that the New York merchant John Keating opened a paper mill in Manhattan in 1768, although no watermarks have been attributed to that mill.Bidwell, John (2013). American Paper Mills, 1690‚Äì1832: A Directory of the Paper Trade, with notes on products, watermarks, distribution methods, and manufacturing techniques. Hanover, N.H.: Dartmouth College Press. p. 196. In 1772 Keating moved his mill to Continental Village, in Putnam County, NY, where it operated for a few years, until it was set afire by British troops in 1777, during the American Revolution. In 1773, the Manhattan-based printer and bookseller Hugh Gaine, in partnership with Hendrick Onderdonk and Henry Remsen, established a paper mill at Hempstead Harbor (later called Roslyn), on Long Island. Watermarks of this consortium, based on a combination of the partners' initials, appear on printings of New York state laws in 1775.Bidwell (2013), p. 198. First groundwood papermaking The first mechanical invention to revolutionize paper making was the fourdrinier machine invented in 1799, in France, by Nicholas Louis Robert and perfected by Henry Fourdrinier and his brother, Sealey. The second was the Keller-Voelter grinders for turning wood into wood pulp. In 1866, Albrecht Pagenstecher, a German immigrant living in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, together with his brother Rudolf, bought two German-made Keller-Voelter grinders. As stated by Albrecht Pagenstecher himself:\\"Groundwood.\\" A. Pagenstrecher. Paper Trade Journal. Oct. 16, 1897. page 19. Also Paper Trade Journal, March 19, 1942, page 22.Recknagel, A.B.(Forestry Consultant, St. Regis Paper Company), \\"The Pulp and Paper Industry in Northern and Central New York\\", The Northeastern Logger (Old Forge), page 16, May 1960. on March 5, 1867, in nearby Curtisville, he was the first in the United States to manufacture commercially viable 'groundwood' wood pulp. He sold the pulp to the Smith Paper Company which on March 8, 1867 produced commercial newsprint paper.Hunter, Dard (1947). Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft (2nd edition) Knopf, New York, page 378, (republished in 1978 in facsimile by Dover, New York) Pagenstecher made his pulp out of aspen or \\"popple\\" and soon the supply of available popple ran out.Recknagel, A.B.(Forestry Consultant, St. Regis Paper Company), \\"The Pulp and Paper Industry in Northern and Central New York\\", The Northeastern Logger (Old Forge), page 16, May 1960 The New York World reluctantly cancelled its contract for the newsprint, which the Smith Paper Company of Lee, Massachusetts was making from this new woodpulp. In despair, Pagenstecher returned to Saxony and asked Heinrich Voelter what he could do.Recknagel, A.B.(Forestry Consultant, St. Regis Paper Company), \\"The Pulp and Paper Industry in Northern and Central New York\\", The Northeastern Logger (Old Forge), May 1960. Also retold in Thomas, Howard, 1963, Black River in the North Country, p.98-100; Prospect Books, Prospect, NY. \\"We too have run out of popple,\\" was the reply, \\"but we are using spruce. Have you any spruce in America?\\" To this Pagenstecher could only reply, \\"I do not know, but I'll find out.\\" Early visions of wood-based papermaking in New York Cornell Professor of Forest Management, and a leader and consultant to the pulp and paper industry, Arthur Bernhard Recknagelhttp://www.foresthistory.org/ead/Cornell_Forestry_School_Field_Trips.pdf (1906 graduate of Yale forestry school; at Cornell from 1913‚Äì1943; forester and executive secretary of Empire State Forest Products Association from 1917‚Äì1948), used to tell how his uncle, Albrecht Pagenstecher returned home from Saxony and, fortunately, asked his friend, Senator Warren Miller, who suggested that they go to Saratoga Springs and make inquiries there for spruce. From Saratoga they drove to Luzerne, at the confluence of the Hudson and Sacandaga Rivers, and learned that spruce was abundantly available in these watersheds. It all started for the Paine family in 1885. Several years before, Augustus G. Paine Sr. had sold the Champlain Fiber and Pulp Co., of Willsboro,_New_York, an 'evaporator' to recover and reuse the expensive chemicals used in ‚Äúcooking‚Äù wood chips. Like many equipment dealers, Paine not only marketed his product but financed it as well. When Champlain Fiber went bellyup, Paine's note made him the proud owner of his very own pulp mill. https://www.aarch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/040917aVLPWillsboroPoint.pdf A.G.Paine Sr. summoned his bachelor son home from studies in England to run the plant. His son, Augustus G. Paine, Jr., moved to Willsboro,_New_York in 1885 to take over management of the local pulp mill. With his good management, the mill prospered and became part of the New York and Pennsylvania Paper Company, one of the country's leading paper manufacturers which would operate until the mid-1960s, supplying paper to Ladies‚Äô Home Journal and the Saturday Evening Post. http://www.adirondacklifemag.com/blogs/2017/09/14/peter- paine/https://www.essexonlakechamplain.com/vintage-postcard-willsboro-paper- mill/ The J. & J. Rogers Company put Au Sable Forks on the map and employed the community for over a century. Making paper from wood pulp was its second business. Iron was its first. \\"The J. & J. Rogers Company was a big part of why we have an Adirondack Park,\\" acknowledges Jim Rogers (James Rogers III), a descendant of one of the company's founders who lives in Lake Placid. At the time, James Rogers Jr. controlled roughly 75,000 acres of timberland on which much of the hardwood had been cut for charcoal to make iron. A business opportunity occurred to him: harvest the remaining softwood, mostly spruce, for wood pulp, the new way of making paper!

By 1870, the Remingtons, seeing a future for wood pulp, built three mills on Sewall's Island in Watertown. These mills used the Voelter process allowing a low-cost, high-quality Remington newsprint to be made of 75% rags and 25% wood pulp instead of all-rag content paper costing five times more.Thomas, Howard. 1963. Black River in the North Country. Prospect, NY: Prospect Books, pp. 98‚Äì100. A third invention caught the imagination of the Remingtons. In 1867, Benjamin Tilghman, an American chemist, discovered that sulphurous acid (H2SO3) dissolved the lignin in wood, leaving a residue of cellulose fibers. Nought came of this discovery. However, Alfred D. Remington learned that a Swede, Carl Daniel Ekman, was teaching papermakers in Sweden to make paper entirely out of wood pulp by using a sulphite process (SO3). Remington went to Sweden to see \\"This Miracle\\" for himself. He was so impressed that he imported Swedish chemical fiber for several years and later developed the \\"sulphite process\\" in his own plant on Sewall's Island. The Remingtons were selling newsprint to the New York Times. They received an order for ten tons stipulating that the newsprint contain no wood pulp! A. D. Remington, proud of his new product, sent it to the Times along with a note, asking them to try it. The reply was, \\"come and get your paper\\", which he did. It wasn't long before the Times was eager and willing to buy this new and cheaper newsprint. The revolution in paper-making in the Black River region was complete: fourdrinier machines became bigger and bigger and faster and faster; the demand for spruce was insatiable and the lumbermen practically denuded the virgin forests; the unpleasant odor of the sulphite mills replaced the equally unpleasant odor of the tanneries. Other paper-makers, emulating the success of the Remingtons embarked on a costly program of mass-production of wood pulp newsprint.\\"Fifty Years of the Empire State Forest Products Association,\\" by Nelson C.

It is notable for its massive defensive walls which have a roughly triangular plan and enclosed an area of more than 40 hectares (app. 10 acres). The stone walls are fortified with 17 U-shaped towers. There are two gates, one to the west and one to the north-east. The city is located on a flat terrain, naturally protected by rivers. The strong 3.20 m thick walls were built between 308 and 324 AD during the joint reign of Roman Emperors Constantine I the Great and Licinius after the Gothic Wars of 250-269.

Also, 1-bit central processing unit (CPU) and arithmetic logic unit (ALU) architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 1-bit A serial computer processes data a single bit at a time. For example, the PDP-8/S was a 12-bit computer using a 1-bit ALU, processing the 12 bits serially. An example of a 1-bit computer built from discrete logic SSI chips is the Wang 500 (1970/1971) calculator as well as the Wang 1200 (1971/1972) word processor series of Wang Laboratories. An example of a 1-bit architecture that was marketed as a CPU is the Motorola MC14500B Industrial Control Unit (ICU), introduced in 1977 and manufactured at least up into the mid 1990s. One of the computers known to be based on this CPU was the WDR 1-bit computer. A typical sequence of instructions from a program for a 1-bit architecture might be: * load digital input 1 into a 1-bit register; * OR the value in the 1-bit register with input 2, leaving the result in the register; * write the value in the 1-bit register to output 1. This architecture was considered superior for programs making decisions rather than performing arithmetic computations, for ladder logic as well as for serial data processing. There are also several design studies for 1-bit architectures in academia, and corresponding 1-bit logic can also be found in programming. Other examples of 1-bit architectures are programmable logic controllers (PLCs), programmed in instruction list (IL). Several early massively parallel computers used 1-bit architectures for the processors as well. Examples include the Goodyear MPP and the Connection Machine. By using a 1-bit architecture for the individual processors a very large array (e.g. the Connection Machine had 65,536 processors) could be constructed with the chip technology available at the time. In this case the slow computation of a 1-bit processor was traded off against the large number of processors. 1-bit CPUs can now be considered obsolete; not many kinds have ever been produced, still many MC14500B chips are available from brokers for obsolete parts.

A person exhibits social preferences if he/she not only cares about his/her own material payoff, but also the reference group's payoff or/and the intention that leads to the payoff. Types of social preferences include altruism, fairness, reciprocity, and inequity aversion. The field of economics was predicated on humans being rational economic actors, and as it became apparent that this was never true, the entire field went into a crisis from which it has yet to recover. The research of social preferences in economics started with lab experiments in 1980, where experimental economists found subjects' behavior deviated systematically from self-interest behavior in economic games such as ultimatum game and dictator game. These experimental findings then inspired various new economic models to characterize agent's altruism, fairness and reciprocity concern between 1990 and 2010. More recently, there are growing amounts of field experiments that study the shaping of social preference and its applications in the workplace and other economic settings.  Formation of social preferences  Biologists, social psychologists, and economists have proposed theories and documented evidence on the formation of social preferences over both the long run and the short run. = Biological evolution =  Kin selection  Kin selection is an evolutionary strategy where some specific behavioral traits are favored to benefit close relatives' reproduction. Hence, behavior that appears altruistic can align with the theory of the selfish gene. Kin selection can explain altruistic behavior towards close relatives even at the cost of their own's survival, as long as one's sacrifice can help preserve a greater amount of the same genes in close relatives. For example, worker bees can die from attacking their predators in order to help preserve other bees' genes.  Reciprocity selection  Reciprocity selection suggests that one's altruistic act may evolve from the anticipation of future reciprocal altruistic behavior from others. An application of reciprocity selection in game theory is the Tit-For-Tat strategy in prisoner's dilemma, which is the strategy that the player cooperate at the initial encounter, and then follow the opponent's behavior on the previous encounter. Robert Axelrod and W. D. Hamilton showed that Tit-For- Tat strategy can be an evolutionary stable strategy in a population where the probability of repeated encounters between two persons in a population is above a certain threshold. = Social learning = Psychologist Albert Bandura proposed that children learn about pro-social and moral behavior by imitating other pro-social models, including parents, other adults, and peers. There are also economic models proposing that parents transmit their social preferences to their children by demonstrating their own pro-social behavior. However, empirical support for parents' role in fostering pro-social behavior is mixed. For example, some researchers found a positive relation between the parent's use of induction and children's pro-social behavior, and others found no correlation between parent's adoption of punitive techniques and children's pro-social behavior. Regarding other sources of social learning, recent field experiments have provided causal evidences for positive effects of school program and mentoring program on forming social preferences, and these research suggested that social interaction, prosocial role models as well as cultural transmission from family and school are potential mechanisms. = Cognitive factors = Psychologist Jean Piaget was among the first to propose that cognitive development is a pre-requisite in moral judgment and behavior. He argued for the importance of social interaction with others rather than learning in moral development, which requires the understanding of both rules and others' behavior. Other important cognitive skills in fostering pro-social behavior include perspective taking and moral reasoning, which are supported by most empirical evidence.  Evidences of social preferences  = Experimental evidences = Many initial evidences of social preferences came from lab experiments where subjects play economic games with others. However, many research found that subjects' behavior robustly and systematically deviated from the prediction from self-interest hypothesis, but could be explained by social preferences including altruism, inequity aversion and reciprocity. Ultimatum game is one of the first experiments that shows self- interest hypothesis fails to predict people's behavior. In this game, the first mover proposes a split of a fixed amount, and the second mover decides to accept or reject the offer. If the second mover accepts the offer, the final payoff is exactly determined by the offer. However, if the second mover rejects the offer, both subjects will have zero payoff. Contrary to the self- interest hypothesis's prediction that the first mover will propose zero amount and the second mover will accept the offer, experimenters found proposers will typically offer 25%-50% of the fixed amount, and responders tend to reject the offer when the split is below 20%. A relevant game is dictator game, where one subject proposes the split of a fixed amount and the other subject is only allowed to accept the offer. The dictator game helps to isolate pure altruism from the strategic concern of the first mover (i.e. the first mover proposes a larger share to second mover to avoid second mover's rejection) in the ultimatum game. In this game, the average share decreases to 20% of the fixed amount, however, more than 60% of the subjects still propose a positive offer. Two other games, trust game (also called investment game) and gift-exchange game provide evidence for reciprocal behavior. In the trust game, the first mover is endowed with a fixed amount c, and decides the amount of money b to pass on to the second mover. This amount is multiplied by a factor of k when it reaches the second mover, and then the second mover decides how much of this amount (kb) is returned to the first mover. While self-interest model predicts no transfer and no return, experimenters found that first mover typically transfers roughly 50% of endowment and responder's return increases with the transfer. In gift exchange game, the first mover proposes some offer to the second mover and asks for certain effort level from the second mover, and then the second mover decides his/her effort that is costly but can increase first mover's payoff. Also contrary to the self-interest prediction, first mover's offer in experiments is usually greater than zero, and the second mover's effort level increases with offer. Prisoner's dilemma and its generalized game, public goods game also provide indirect evidence for social preference, and there are many evidences of conditional cooperation among subjects. = Field evidences = Many field evidences documented agent's fairness and reciprocal concern. For example, Daniel Kahneman, Jack Knetsch and Richard Thaler found that the concern for fairness constrains firm's profit seeking behavior (e.g. raise price after an increase in demand). There are also evidences that perceived fairness of the tax system and law affects tax compliance and law enforcement. Many field experiments examine relative pay concerns and reciprocity in work settings. For example, economists Uri Gneezy and John List conducted field experiments where subjects were hired for a typing job and for door-to-door fundraising and found subjects exerted larger effort level in group with a higher wage. However, this positive reciprocity was short lived. Researchers have also found that positive reciprocity is smaller than negative reciprocity. In another study, job applicants were hired to catalog books for 6 hours with a pronounced wage, but applicants were later informed with either wage increase or wage cut. Researchers found the decrease in effort in wage cut group was larger than the increase in effort in wage increase group. However, positive reciprocity did not extend to other activities (volunteering to work for one more hour). One study also documented decrease in worker's effort when workers experienced wage cuts, but this effort level change was affected by the perceived justification for wage cuts.  Economic models of social preferences  Existing models of social preferences can be divided into two types: distributive preferences and reciprocal preferences. Distributive preferences are the preferences over the distribution and total magnitude of the payoff among the reference groups, including altruism and spitefulness, fairness and inequity aversion, and efficiency concern; while reciprocal preferences reflect agent's concern over the intention of other's behavior and agent's motivation to reciprocate positively or negatively depending on the kindness and fairness of other's behavior. = Pure altruism, warm glow, and spitefulness = Pure altruism in economic models represents an agent's concern on other's well-being. A person exhibits altruistic preference if this person's utility increases with other's payoff. A related economic model is impure altruism, or warm-glow, where individuals feel good (i.e. gain a \\"warm- glow\\" utility) from doing something good without caring about other's payoff. Spitefulness or envy preference is the opposite of pure altruism, where an agent's utility decreases with other's payoff. = Fairness and inequity aversion = Fairness and inequity aversion models capture the agent's concern on the fair distribution of payoffs across agents and especially the aversion to payoff differences. In the Fehr-Schmidt model, an agent compares his payoff to each other opponents in the group. However, the agent's utility decreases with both positive and negative payoff differences between self and each other opponent in the reference group. Moreover, the agent dislikes payoff disadvantage more than payoff advantage. Hence, the agent presents altruistic behavior towards others when agent is better off than others, and displays spiteful behavior when agent is worse off than others. In a related model by Bolton and Ockenfels (1999), inequity aversion is modeled with a more general functional form, where agent also cares about fair share but is only concerned about the average payoff of the reference group, rather than each individual's payoff in the reference group. = Efficiency concern and quasi-maximin preferences = Economists Gary Charness and Matthew Rabin found that in some cases, agents prefer more efficient outcomes (i.e. outcome with larger social welfare) than more equal outcomes and they developed a model where agents' utility is a convex combination of own's material payoff and the social welfare. Moreover, they assumed agents have quasi-maximin preferences, meaning that agents' care on social welfare includes the minimum payoff among agents as well as the total payoff for all agents in the group. However, the agent will care less about others' payoff if other is better off than self. = Reciprocity = Agent has the motivation to reciprocate towards both kind and unfair behavior. Rabin (1993)'s model is one of the earliest model that characterizes reciprocal behavior. In this model, the agent's payoff depends on the other opponent, and agent forms belief of the other opponent's kindness, which is based on the difference between the actual payoff that agent receives and the fair payoff. Agents will reciprocate positively if he/she perceives the other individual's behavior as kind and fair and respond negatively if he/she perceives it as unfair. Other researchers further generalize Rabin (1993)'s model by studying repeated interactions in N-person extensive form games, and also by including inequity aversion into agent's preference. Charness and Rabin also augmented their quasi-maximin preference with reciprocity concern. However, this type of reciprocity models usually has multiple equilibria and suffers from model complexity, which makes it hard to empirically test for the model.  Economic applications  Researchers have argued that the failure of recognizing social preference will lead to a biased understanding of much important economic behavior. = Understanding cooperation = Research on social preferences showed that reciprocal and inequity averse individuals can cooperate if they are sure that others will cooperate too and can punish the free riders. This has implications for designing proper social mechanisms to solve the free-riding problem. = Design of economic incentive = Accounting employee's reciprocity and fairness concerns can help design better contracts (e.g. trust contract, bonus contract) to enhance employee's effort and to solve firm's agency problems. Moreover, the design of relative pay in the workplace can affect employee's job satisfaction and well-being.Card, David; Mas, Alexandre; Moretti, Enrico; Saez, Emmanuel (2012). \\"Inequality at Work: The Effect of Peer Salaries on Job Satisfaction\\". American Economic Review. 102 (6): 2981‚Äì3003. doi:10.1257/aer.102.6.2981. Research on social preference has also facilitated the understanding of monetary incentives' crowding-out effect. = Design of social policies = Accounting individual's fairness concerns can affect the design of the social policies, especially for redistributive policies. In addition, reciprocal preferences can affect people's evaluation of different policies towards the poor depending on the individual's belief that whether the poor are deserving or undeserving.

It is located east of Murzuk and Zizau. A good high road is said to link Traghan to Zizau in the west, with frequent incrustations of salt. History Traghan by the 13th century was dominated by the Saifawa dynasty, a remarkable feat as Traghan lies 1380 kilometres from Njimi, the Saifawa capital. The Saifawa were said to have \\"gained control of the Fezzan by establishing a post in the oasis of Traghan about twenty miles east of modern Murzuk and some seventy miles west-south-west of ancient Zawila.\\" Traghan was approached by western explorers on 29 November 1822. In the late 1820s, Traghan was described as was formerly as considerable a place as Murzuk; and was, about sixty years ago, the residence of a sultan, who governed eastern Fezzan. It was described as being in a flat, desert plain, with gardens and date groves. It contained four mosques with small mud minarets and the houses were mostly large but in ruin. The population in the late 1820s was estimated to be 500-600 but it had previously been far more populous. Major Denham noted that the people of Traghan were exceptionally skilled in carpet making and their carpets rivaled those of Constantinople. Hugh Murray later noted its fine carpets in the early 1850s. The town was the site of a battle between the Libyan National Army and Chadian militants in 2018 during the Second Libyan Civil War.

A lone Palestinian sniper, 22-year-old Tha'ir Kayid Hamad (), a member of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades from the village of Silwad carried out the attack. He had acquired an old Second World War Mauser rifle and 30 rounds of ammunition and had done target practice in the valleys around Silwad. Hamad managed to kill seven Israeli soldiers and three civilians before escaping. He was arrested two years later and sentenced to life imprisonment, and is currently imprisoned in Israel. The incident Wadi al-Haramiya (), meaning 'Valley of the Thieves'Sonia Nimr,\\"A Nation in a hero, in Mark Andrew LeVine, Gershon Shafir (eds.)Struggle and Survival in Palestine/Israel, University of California Press, 2012 pp.141-142 is a valley between Ramallah and Nablus on the West Bank. The IDF was maintaining a checkpoint at Uyoun al-Haramiya (the Wells of Haramiya), near the Israeli settlement Ofra, manned by a reserve company. Before dawn on the morning of 3 March 2002 the sniper positioned himself under some olive trees on a hilltop overlooking the checkpoint. At 6:40 he opened fire at the three soldiers manning the checkpoint and the driver of a civilian car, which had stopped at the checkpoint. All four were killed within minutes. Nine Israeli soldiers were inside a barracks building. Platoon commander Lieutenant David Damelin and the unit's medic Yochai Porat emerged from the building to locate the shooter and assist the casualties. Both were shot dead. The remaining soldiers decided to stay inside the building and called for reinforcements. A patrol jeep that arrived with reinforcements immediately came under fire. The reserve company's sergeant, Avraham Ezra, was killed and several of his men were injured. The rest of the casualties occurred when randomly arriving civilian cars stopped at the checkpoint. Three Israeli civilians and an IDF officer were killed. Tha'ir Hamad claimed in an interview (obtained by unknown means from prison) that the Israelis were armed and that one of them took aim at him but that he shot first. He also claimed that he refrained from harming an Israeli woman and her children, shouting at her in Hebrew and Arabic to leave the area. Two of the Israeli civilians killed, Sergei Birmov, 33, and Vadim Balagula, 32, were killed when they stopped their car at the checkpoint, as they made their way to work at a candy factory in Jerusalem. The Israelis never succeeded in locating the sniper's hiding place even after dispatching a helicopter. He had intended to continue shooting but when he fired his 25th bullet the old rifle exploded, making it useless. He was therefore forced to give up and returned to his village. Seven soldiers, two of them officers, and three civilians were killed in the 25-minute attack. Another six Israelis were wounded, four of them seriously. The al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of the Fatah movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti praised the attack. \\"Blessed be the fighting hands of the heroes, who dealt these blows to the army of occupation,\\" he said. The Israeli authorities assumed that the shooter was a highly trained marksman from an elite unit, such as Force 17. The average Palestinian militant could not be expected to hit 14 people with 25 bullets. Mossad also contacted European and American security agencies to help identify the killer. Mossad suspected that a member of the Irish Republican Army could be responsible for the act. The sniper became a hero among local residents. Haaretz veteran military correspondent Ze'ev Schiff called the incident \\"[o]ne of most stinging and bizarre fiascoes\\" of the IDF in the Second Intifada: \\"the entire incident can only be described as a massive blunder and a disgrace for the IDF. No excuse can be accepted. This sort of incident cannot be blamed on the lower ranks.\\" A series of investigations were carried out with the apparent purpose of exonerating the senior officers and putting the full blame on the soldiers at the checkpoint. The scandal led to a major overhaul of rules for IDF probes. Capture and imprisonment On the night of October 3, 2004, following a manhunt by the IDF and Shin Bet, Tha'ir Kayid Hamad was arrested by an IDF force of the Duchifat Battalion.https://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1004284 He was trialed, convicted, and given 11 life sentences.

Gaddafi abolished the post-1951 Libyan Constitution and introduced his own political philosophy, based on his Green Book published in the 1970s. Gaddafi's system was known as Jamahiriya and was notionally legally based on the legislative General People's Congress (GPC), consisting of 2,700 representatives of Basic People's Congresses, and the executive General People's Committee, headed by a General Secretary. The \\"Jamahiriya sector\\" was overseen by the \\"revolutionary sector.\\" This was headed by Muammar Gaddafi as \\"Brotherly Leader of the Revolution\\", the Revolutionary Committees, and the surviving members of the 12-person Revolutionary Command Council established in 1969. This \\"revolutionary sector\\" held office by virtue of having led the revolution and therefore was not subject to election. As a consequence, although Gaddafi held no governmental post after 1980, he maintained absolute control over the country until the collapse of his regime during the Libyan Civil War. History of Libyan politics under Gaddafi For the first seven years following the 1969 revolution, Colonel Gaddafi and 12 fellow army officers, the Revolutionary Command Council, began a complete overhaul of Libya's political system, society, and economy. On 2 March 1977, Gaddafi convened a General People's Congress (GPC) to proclaim the establishment of \\"people's power,\\" change the country's name to the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and to vest, theoretically, primary authority in the GPC. Gaddafi remained the de facto chief of state and secretary general of the GPC until 1980, when he gave up his office. He continued to control all aspects of the Libyan government through direct appeals to the masses, a pervasive security apparatus, and powerful revolutionary committees. Although he held no formal office, Gaddafi exercised absolute power with the assistance of a small group of trusted advisers, who included relatives from his home base in the Sirte region, which lies between the rival provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. During his rule, Gaddafi took increasing control of the government, but he also attempted to achieve greater popular participation in local government. In 1973, he announced the start of a \\"people's revolution\\" in schools, businesses, industries, and public institutions to oversee administration of those organizations in the public interest. The March 1977 establishment of \\"people's power\\" ‚Äîwith mandatory popular participation in the selection of representatives to the GPC‚Äî was the culmination of this process. In the 1980s, competition grew between the official Libyan Government and military hierarchies and the revolutionary committees. An abortive coup attempt in May 1984 apparently mounted by Libyan exiles with internal support, led to a short-lived reign of terror in which thousands were imprisoned and interrogated. An unknown number were executed. Gaddafi used the revolutionary committees to search out alleged internal opponents following the coup attempt, thereby accelerating the rise of more radical elements inside the Libyan power hierarchy. After the 1986 bombing of Libya by the United States Air Force, Gaddafi decreed that the word \\"Great\\" should be appended to the beginning of the name, rendering its official name Al Jumahiriyah al Arabiyah al Libiyah ash Shabiyah al Ishtirakiyah al Uzma, or Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In 1988, faced with rising public dissatisfaction with shortages in consumer goods and setbacks in Libya's war with Chad, Gaddafi began to curb the power of the revolutionary committees and to institute some domestic reforms. The regime released many political prisoners and eased restrictions on foreign travel by Libyans. Private businesses were again permitted to operate. Around the same time, Gaddafi began to pursue an anti- fundamentalist Islamic policy domestically, viewing fundamentalism as a potential rallying point for opponents of the regime. Ministerial positions and military commanders are frequently shuffled or placed under temporary house arrest to diffuse potential threats to Gaddafi's authority. Despite these measures, internal dissent continued. Gaddafi's security forces launched a preemptive strike at alleged coup plotters in the military and among the Warfalla tribe in October 1993. Widespread arrests and government reshufflings followed, accompanied by public \\"confessions\\" from regime opponents and allegations of torture and executions. The military, once Gaddafi's strongest supporters, became a potential threat in the 1990s. In 1993, following a failed coup attempt that implicated senior military officers, Gaddafi began to purge the military periodically, eliminating potential rivals and inserting his own loyal followers in their place. Political sectors under Gaddafi =Revolutionary sector= Organs of a military junta were first put into place in 1969. These organs were never dissolved throughout the period of Gaddafi's rule, though after the proclamation of the jamahiriya, they were reorganised. The \\"revolutionary sector\\" of Gaddafi's jamahiriya was officially under the control of \\"Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution\\" Muammar Gaddafi after 1979. Beginning in 1977, Gaddafi had introduced \\"revolutionary committees\\" assigned the task of \\"absolute revolutionary supervision of people's power\\"; that is, they were to guide the people's committees and \\"raise the general level of political consciousness and devotion to revolutionary ideals\\". In reality, Gaddafi's revolutionary committees were used to survey the population and repress any political opposition to Gaddafi's autocratic rule. Reportedly 10 to 20 percent of Libyans worked in surveillance for these committees, a proportion of informants on par with Saddam Hussein's Iraq or Kim Jong Il's North Korea. Prominent members of the regime Mutassim Gaddafi with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2009 Until the Libyan Civil War, General Abdul Fatah Younis may have been second to Gaddafi in the government hierarchy and was also interior minister. He resigned on 22 February 2011. On 1 March 2011, Quryna reported Gaddafi sacked his right-hand man, information chief Abdullah Senussi, who was responsible for the brutality against the protestors.Libya uprising continues ‚Äì live updates, Ian Black, The Guardian, 1 March 2011 Interpol on 4 March 2011 issued a security alert concerning the \\"possible movement of dangerous individuals and assets\\" based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 (travel bans and assets freeze).

It is intended to describe a state following the political philosophy expounded by Gaddafi in his Green Book. The term does not occur in this sense in Gaddafi's Green Book itself, although the text does dwell on the concept of the \\"masses\\" ().The nisba-adjective (\\"mass-, \\"of the masses\\") occurs only in the third part, published in 1981, in the phrase , translated in the English edition as \\"Historic movements are mass movements\\". The concept was presented as the materialization of the Third International Theory, proposed by Gaddafi to be applied to the entire Third World. The term in practice has only been applied to the Libyan state, of which Gaddafi was the Caid (translated Leader; strict transliteration '). Although Gaddafi no longer held public office or title after 1980, he was accorded the honorifics \\"Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\\" or \\"Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution\\" in government statements and the official press. The government of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya officially stated that Libya is a direct democracy without any political parties, governed by its populace through local popular councils and communes (named Basic People's Congresses). Making up the legislative branch of government, this sector comprised Local People's Congresses in each of the 1,500 urban wards, 32 Sha‚Äôbiyat People's Congresses for the regions, and the National General People's Congress. These legislative bodies were represented by corresponding executive bodies (Local People's Committees, Sha'biyat People's Committees and the National General People's Committee/Cabinet). Every four years the membership of the Local People's Congresses elected by acclamation both their own leadership and secretaries for the People's Committees, sometimes after many debates and a critical vote. The leadership of the Local People's Congress represented the local congress at the People's Congress of the next level and has an imperative mandate. The members of the National General People's Congress elected the members of the National General People's Committee (the Cabinet) by acclamation at their annual meeting. While there was discussion regarding who would run for executive offices, only those approved by the revolutionary leadership were actually elected. The government administration was effective as long as it operated within the directives of the revolutionary leadership. The revolutionary leadership had absolute veto power despite the constitutionally established people's democracy and alleged rule of the people. The government controlled both state-run and semi- autonomous media, and any articles critical of current policies were requested and intentionally placed by the revolutionary leadership itself, for example, as a means of initiating reforms. In cases involving a violation of \\"these taboos\\", the private press, like The Tripoli Post, was censored. There was no separate defense ministry in Gaddafi's Libya; all defence activities are centralised under the presidency. Arms production was limited, due to extensive imports from the Soviet Union, and manufacturers were state-owned. Legislative branch The General People's Congress (Mu'tammar al-sha'ab al '√¢mm) consisted of 2,700 indirectly elected representatives of the Basis People's Congresses. The GPC was the legislative forum that interacted with the General People's Committee, whose members were secretaries of Libyan ministries. It served as the intermediary between the masses and the leadership and was composed of the secretariats of some 600 local \\"basic popular congresses.\\" The GPC secretariat and the cabinet secretaries were appointed by the GPC secretary general and confirmed by the annual GPC congress. These cabinet secretaries were responsible for the routine operation of their ministries. Judicial system The Libyan court system consisted of four levels: summary courts, which try petty offenses, the courts of first instance, which tried more serious crimes; the courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court, which was the final appellate level. The GPC appointed justices to the Supreme Court. Special \\"revolutionary courts\\" and military courts operated outside the court system to try political offenses and crimes against the state. Libya's justice system was nominally based on Sunni law. =Political parties and elections= Political parties were banned by the Prohibition of Party Politics Act Number 71 of 1972, including Hizb ut-Tahrir. The establishment of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was allowed under the Association Act of 1971. As they are required to conform to the goals of the revolution, however, the number of NGOs in Libya was small in comparison with neighboring countries. Unions did not exist as such. However, the numerous professional associations were integrated into the state structure as a third pillar, along with the People's Congresses and Committees, though they did not have the right to strike. Professional associations sent delegates to the General People's Congress, where they have a representative mandate. The General People's Congress (Mu'tammar al-sha'ab al '√¢mm) consisted out of circa 2700 representatives of the Basis People's Congresses. Before Gaddafi's coup, general elections were held in the 1950s and 1960s. Although political parties contested the 1952 elections, they were subsequently banned and all other elections were carried out on a non-partisan basis.

The final product, a sinter, is a small, irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals. The process, called sintering, causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical properties of the ingredients. The purpose of sinter are to be used converting iron into steel. Sinter plants, in combination with blast furnaces, are also used in non-ferrous smelting.

History Sinter plant at JSW Ispat Steel Ltd, India. Many countries, including India, France and Germany, have underground deposits of iron ore in dust form (blue dust). Such iron ore cannot be directly charged in a blast furnace. In the early 20th century, sinter technology was developed for converting ore fines into lumpy material chargeable in blast furnaces. Sinter technology took 30 years to gain acceptance in the iron-making domain, but now plays an important role. Initially developed to generate steel, it is now a means of using metallurgical waste generated in steel plants to enhance blast furnace operation and reducing waste. The largest sinter plant is located in Chennai, India, and employs 10,000 people. http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/1994/9312094.pdf Process =Preparation of the ores= Main feed into a sinter plant is base mix, which consists of iron ore fines, coke fines and flux (limestone) fines. In addition to base mix, coke fines, flux fines, sinter fines, iron dust (collected from plant de-dusting system & ESP) and plant waste are mixed in proportion (by weight) in a rotary drum, often called mixing and nodulizing drum. Calcined lime is used as binder of the mixed material along with water (all in particular proportion by weight) to form feed-sinter of about 5 to 7 mm in size. This sinter globules are fed to sintering machine and burnt there-in to produce blast furnace feed sinter. =Sintering the material= Circle cooler for cooling hot sinter Material is put on a sinter machine in two layers. The bottom layer may vary in thickness from . A 12 to 20 mm sinter fraction is used, also referred to as the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of . The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine . The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/annealing) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked from the bottom of the bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but sinter in smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several temperature measuring instrument placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (< 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth layer in sinter machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters. The temperature is typically maintained between in the ignition zone and between 900 and 1000 ¬∞C in the soaking zone to prevent sudden quenching of the sintered layer. The top 5 mm from screens goes to the conveyor carrying the sinter for the blast furnace and, along with blast furnace grade sinter, either goes to sinter storage bunkers or to BF bunkers. Blast furnace-grade sinter consists of particles sized 5 to 12 mm as well as 20 mm and above. Advantages There are certain advantages of using sinters as opposed to using other materials which include recycling the fines and other waste products, to include flue dust, mill scale, lime dust and sludge. Processing sinter helps eliminate raw flux, which is a binding material used to agglomerate materials, which saves the heating material, coke, and improves furnace productivity. Improvements and efficiency can be gained from higher softening temperature and narrower softening in the melting zone, which increases the volume of the granular zone and shrinks the width of the cohesive zone. A lower silica content and higher hot metal temperature contributes to more sulphur removal.

The Litigators is about a two-partner Chicago law firm attempting to strike it rich in a class action lawsuit over a cholesterol reduction drug by a major pharmaceutical drug company. The protagonist is a Harvard Law School grad big law firm burnout who stumbles upon the boutique and joins it only to find himself litigating against his old law firm in this case. The book is regarded as more humorous than most of Grisham's prior novels. The theme of a young lawyer being fed up with a giant law firm and bolting away to a less lucrative but more satisfying career is shared with The Associate. The theme of a lawsuit against a giant corporation appeared in The Runaway Jury, but in the present book, the corporation is vindicated and proven to have been unjustly maligned (at least on the specific drug which is the subject of the lawsuit) and the mass tort lawyers are seen as greedy and unscrupulous, ultimately bolting and leaving the protagonist's tiny Chicago firm in the lurch. Critical reviews were mixed for the book, with several opinions noting a lack of suspense. Nonetheless, the book has achieved both hardcover and ebook #1 best seller status on various lists, including both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. However, since some services do not separate fiction and non-fiction books, it did not debut as a #1 bestseller on certain lists, such as the USA Today. Some reviewers noted that this story would lend itself to an adapted screenplay. Background Having sold 250 million copies of his previous 24 novels in 29 languages, Grisham had produced an international bestseller with each prior book. Including the release of The Litigators, Grisham has produced 23 adult fiction novels and 2 children's fiction novels as well as a short story collection. In addition, he has produced one non-fiction book. In the first of a two-part interview with The Wall Street Journal, Grisham claimed that although he usually attempts to include humor in his submitted drafts, it is usually removed during the editorial process. However, in this case much of the humor survived editing. In the second part of the interview the following week, Grisham noted that his inspirations for the book included television advertisements and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Plot Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are ambulance chasers at a small law firm in the South Side of Chicago. Their constant bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, their highly competent African-American secretary. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a Harvard Law School graduate , is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing ‚Äì though well-paid ‚Äì life of an associate in the high-powered law firm of Rogan Rothberg. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office, where he willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers. Wally gets involved in a new scheme, finding claimants for a federal class action lawsuit against Krayoxx, a cholesterol- lowering drug developed by the fictional pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Users across the country, both dead and alive, appear to have developed toxic reactions to the drug. Though the firm is out of its depth, Wally gains the assurance of a South Florida lawyer, Jerry Alisandros, that Alisandros will handle the case and reach an out-of-court settlement, and everybody will get rich. However, complications that no one anticipated arise, including Varrick's hiring of Nadine Karros, Rogan Rothberg's ace litigator who never loses a case, and the growing evidence that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, has no ill effects, and is unjustly maligned. Varrick pushes to have the case tried in the jurisdiction of Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has ties. The case is expedited on Seawright's docket, with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants. Alisandros pulls out as co-counsel, leaving Finley & Figg to litigate the case themselves. The resulting trial brings the firm's usual cast of shady witnesses to the stand in a desperate attempt to get through the trial and avoid being sued for legal malpractice and saddled with frivolous lawsuit sanctions. In a subsidiary plot, David Zinc stumbles on a lead poisoning brain damage case involving the child of Burmese immigrants. His efforts to identify the American company which imported the child's toxic toys from China, and reach a settlement with the importer, help him survive the demise of Finley & Figg and open his own successful law firm with Rochelle as his legal secretary. Publication Leading book retailers such as Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, and Walmart released the book in hardcover format in the United States as a Doubleday publication on October 25, 2011. In the United Kingdom, the book was published with different cover art by Hodder & Stoughton on the same date. Random House published the paperback version on June 26, 2012. The book is also available as an audiobook, narrated by Dennis Boutsikaris, and in ebook format. Other formats available on October 25, included large-print, compact disc and abridged compact disc. A limited edition will be available on November 22, 2011. An excerpt from the book was included in some editions including the iTunes Store edition of The Confession, which was his prior adult novel. Critical review The Litigators is said to be \\"an amusing and appalling look into the machinations of a nationwide class-action suit,\\" according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. The Wall Street Journal's Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a \\"bitingly farcical look at lawyers at the bottom of the food chain\\". CNN described the book as an original perspective of \\"the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer\\". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of Grisham. Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a \\"heartier meal\\" than Grisham's usual \\"potato-chip fiction\\". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. The book has been derided for its lack of suspense. Carol Memmott of USA Today says that Grisham's latest attempt to capture the spirit of the legal David and Goliath story is missing \\"the ratcheting-up of suspense\\" that he has employed successfully in recent adult and youth novels. Harshaw claims that the book is lacking in the suspense that made The Firm so successful. Arthur finds elements of the plot implausible and the story unsuspenseful as well as unsatisfying. Although the book is somewhat predictable, Bayard notes that \\"Grisham swerves clear of the usual melodramatic devices. Corporations aren‚Äôt intrinsically venal; plaintiffs aren‚Äôt lambent with goodness. And best of all, no one is murdered for stumbling Too Close to the Truth.\\" Some sources noted that the book has potential to become an adapted screenplay. Irish Independent describes Grisham's new book as \\"following his usual route to the bestsellers list\\" and projects it as a candidate to be his next Hollywood film. Although it is standard Grisham fare, Independent noted that it provides the usual thrills in Grisham's comfortable legal world and should be a gripping read for his usual fans. The Sunday Express noted that the book could be readily converted to a screenplay, but its critic, Robin Callender Smith, viewed the \\"ambulance chasing\\" ethos as a foreign thing that Brits might have to worry about in the near future. Simakis praised the book for having more depth of character than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says that most of the claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's The Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from. Commercial success According to The Huffington Post, this book is the ninth best-selling fiction book of the year in 2011, while according to the USA Today this was the 16th best selling book overall in 2011. According to Amazon.com the book was the number eight overall best seller. =Hardcover= It immediately was listed as the Publishers Weekly #1 best- seller among fiction hardcover books according to Reuters. It was also listed as the #1 best-seller by The New York Times in the November 13, 2011 book review section for the week ending October 29, 2011 for Hardcover Fiction, E-Book Fiction, Combined Hardcover & Paperback Fiction, and the Combined Print and E-Book Fiction. It dropped from the #1 position in its second week on the list. It remained on the Combined Hardcover & Paperback Fiction list until the February 19, 2012 list (15 weeks) for the week ending February 4. It remained on both the Hardcover Fiction list and the Combined Print and E-Book Fiction list until the February 26 list (16 weeks) for the week ending February 11. It remained on the E-Book Fiction list until the March 11 list (18 weeks) for the week ending February 25. The Wall Street Journal announced that on Saturday October 29, it would begin incorporating digital book sales in its best seller lists. When the book debuted in The Wall Street Journal list on November 5 for the week ending October 30, it was listed first in Hardcover Fiction, Fiction E-Books and Fiction Combined. It retained the hardcover lead the following week, but lost the other leads. After two weeks it was surpassed on the hardcover list as well. It remained on The Wall Street Journal Hardcover Fiction, Fiction E-Books and Fiction Combined best seller lists until the January 7 listing for the week ended on January 1, 2012. The book was released the day after Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, entitled Steve Jobs, was released by Simon & Schuster. Jobs had died on October 5 and the release date was moved forward. The Jobs book's release had been moved forward twice; It had been moved from spring 2012 to November 21 after Jobs stepped down and then to the October 24 date after his death. When The Litigators debuted on November 3 on the USA Today best-seller list, which does not separate fiction and non-fiction, it debuted at number 2 behind the Jobs book. =Paperback= It debuted at #1 on the New York Times Paperback Mass-Market Fiction Best Sellers list on July 15, 2012 (reflecting sales for the week ending June 30, 2012). The book remained at #1 until the August 12 list (reflecting sales of the week ending July 28, 2012), making a five-week run. It continued to appear on the list until the January 13, 2013 list (reflecting sales for the week ending December 29, 2012). On the USA Today list, which include fiction and non-fiction as well as hardcover and paperback, it debuted at #10 in the week of July 5, following its paperback release.

Virology It is an icosahedrally symmetric virus with a unique triangulation number (T) of 31. At the 12 fivefold symmetrical positions of the icosahedron protrude 'turrets' that extend 13 nanometers (nm) above the capsid surface. The turrets have an average diameter of 24 nm. The center of each turret contains a ~3-nm channel. The function of this channel is not known but it may provide access between the interior and exterior of the virion. There appears to be a density at each end of the channel indicating that the channel may be blocked and suggesting a possible regulatory role associated with this density. There are five structural proteins: a major protein of 37 kiloDaltons (kDa) and several minor proteins with estimated masses of 75, 25, 12.5 and 10 kDa. The major capsid protein is predominantly Œ≤-sheeted. The genome is circular double stranded DNA 17.663 kilobases in length with 36 open reading frames. The genome has a G+C content of 36%.

While Tricker was recuperating in a local hospital, McManus was ambushed and knocked unconscious by Sardinia Frank only a day later. Tricker eventually survived the gang wars of the last decade and had become a prominent member under Eastman leader \\"Big\\" Jack Zelig, who was awarded control of one of the three factions of the Eastman gang. By 1910, Tricker had headed his faction based from the old Stag Cafe on West Twenty- eighth Street near Broadway, renaming it the Maryland Cafe. The club had a long history of violence connected to it as, only the previous year, three men had been killed in a dispute over a woman. During the so-called \\"Ida the Goose War\\", several members of his gang were killed in a confrontation with the Gopher Gang when Ida the Goose was abducted (or ran off with) a member of Tricker's gang. Leaving the gangs to settle the matter themselves, the Gophers eventually took her back to Hell's Kitchen after a brief gunfight in the Maryland Cafe leaving six members dead . Following a failed armed robbery in 1911, Tricker and Sirocco left behind Zelig who had been injured during the hold up and arrested. Instead of bailing him out however, the two decided to assume control of the Eastmans. Zelig was eventually released in part to his political connections in Tammany Hall. A later attempt to murder Zelig failed when, after being informed by Ike the Plug, Zelig lured Eastman member and assassin Jules Morell into his club where was killed . By 1912, Tricker and Sirocco were using Little Rock's pool room, at 396 Broome Street, as their headquarters. In 1914, he was one of several gangsters arrested for the murder of gambler Herman \\"Beansie\\" Rosenthal. Further reading *Pietrusza, David.

The construction of the library, which opened in 1902, was funded by industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, whose uncle lived in East Liverpool. Along with the Steubenville, Ohio library, it was the first library in Ohio funded by Carnegie. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 1980. Background In 1899 T.Y. Travis and M.E. Miskall contacted Andrew Carnegie asking him for a donation of a library for East Liverpool. Carnegie pledged $50,000 for the building of the library on the stipulation that the city would provide land and $3,000 a year for maintenance. In August 1899 the Bradshaw Farm property was purchased by a group of citizens of East Liverpool and held in trust until the city could purchase it. Construction of the library began in 1900. It was built with Roman mottled buff-brown brick trimmed with white tile. The lobby is of ceramic mosaic, the wainscoting of Italian marble and the solid brass hardware. Charles Henry Owsley, a British architect who had immigrated to Youngstown, Ohio, designed the building. As the library neared completion donations of good, worthwhile books were requested. The first librarian hired to run the library was Gertrude A. Baker of Mt. Vernon, Ohio. On May 8, 1902, the library was dedicated and officially opened to the public. At this time the 2,505 volumes from the other city library were transferred to the Carnegie Library. A year after the opening, the librarian reported that there were 5,992 volumes and 2,081 members. In the first year, according to the librarian, the library was so popular with patrons that it loaned more books each month than were actually in the library. Early years Until 1931, the library experienced financial difficulties. In that year, however, the library became eligible for county funds. Since then the library has operated through state and county funds. In 1907 the local historical society established a museum in the West Room of the second floor and then later expanded to include pottery displays in the East Room displaying works from over 50 local potteries. The museum and pottery displays remained in the library until the Museum of Ceramics was opened in the 1970s. The upper East Room of the library was used by the Red Cross for project work such as rolling bandages during World War I. The library possessed 25,000 volumes by 1940, but none were catalogued. Kenneth Emerick was hired in 1950 to perform the cataloguing duties when the library holdings had reached 36,000 volumes. He worked until 1955 when the work was taken over by Beatrice Davidson. The library collection was increasing at a rate of approximately 4,000 volumes per year. By the mid-1960s there were 75,000 volumes, all catalogued. By 1975, the library held 120,000 volumes. The library took part in the Ohio Victory Book Campaign during World War II. The goal of the campaign was to provide good reading material to the servicemen. In six weeks more than 3,000 books were collected. In 1946 a summer reading program for children was initiated. In 1956 the library received a donation of 250 microfilms of the local newspaper dating back to 1885. Renovations A number of renovation projects took place during the 1950s and early 1960s. Over 12 years the cost was approximately $75,000. As part of the renovations, the custodian's home was removed and replaced by a Trustee Meeting Room (the Board Room), and a historical display area. A stack room was created in an excavated portion of the basement. New shelving was installed for the growing collection and furniture for the reading room was purchased. A new circulation desk and circulation system were also installed. In 1961 the rear entrance was remodeled. The administrative offices were moved to the basement replacing the area previously occupied by the historical displays. A teen area was created on the main floor where the offices had been. The library also underwent renovations in the 1990s. In order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act an elevator and handicap accessibility were installed. Shelving was replaced and the nonfiction and Reference collections were moved to vacant rooms on the second floor. All the furniture from the renovations of the 1950s was replaced. Oak tables were refinished and new lighting was installed throughout the library. Additionally, a new circulation desk and computerized circulation and catalogue system were installed. Approximately $1,300,000 were spent over a three-year span for renovations.''

He is honoured as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Catholic Church and his feast day is 28 May. Life The main primary source for the life of Senator are the writings of Ennodius, bishop of Pavia in early 6th-century, who describes Senator as a man of great eloquence and wit, and attributes to him commentaries to the Prophets. Senator was born in Settala, about 15 km east of Milan. His ecclesiastical career was immediately linked to his spiritual guide, Saint Abundius bishop of Como. In summer 450 Senator, still a priest, was part of a deputation led by Abundius that took some letters of Pope Leo the Great to Constantinople. These letters, dated 17 June 450, were addressed to the Emperor Theodosius II, to the Empress Pulcheria and to the Patriarch of Constantinople Anatolius, and were issued to denounce their support to the doctrines of Eutyches, deemed to be heretic. The deputation returned to Rome before June 451, and Abundius and Senator returned to Milan with papal letters to the Bishop of Milan Eusebius. In September 451 Abundius and Senator assisted to a local synod in Milan, attended by 18 bishops from all over northern Italy, where they gave an account of their journey to the East. The next month, the doctrines of Eutyches were formally condemned by the Council of Chalcedon. Senator became bishop of Milan in 472. As bishop he was actively involved in spiritual and material care of the diocese. In 472 Senator founded the Basilica of Saint Euphemia in Milan, which he dedicated to the martyr Euphemia, and that today is dedicate to both Saint Euphemia and him. In fact Euphemia was strictly connected to the condemnation of the Eutychian doctrine, because the Council of Chalcedon was held in a church dedicated to her and a miracle by her caused the condemnation. Senator died on 29 May 475 and he was buried in the basilica he founded. His feast day is celebrated in the Catholic Church on 28 May because 29 May was already occupied with another memory of saints.

Built in 1862‚Äì63 to defend Winyah Bay on the South Carolina coast, the battery was strongly situated and constructed; however, it was inadequately manned, and was captured without resistance during the final months of the war. The battery is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is located on private land, but is open to the public. Island fortifications Even before the outbreak of the Civil War, the secessionist government of South Carolina was concerned with the possibility of attack by sea in Georgetown County. Shortly after the December 20, 1860, passage of the Ordinance of Secession, an aide-de-camp to governor Francis Pickens urged Lowcountry planters to \\"aid in the erection of Batteries to protect and defend the entrance of Winyah Bay and the Santee River\\". The area offered a tempting target to Union forces. Winyah Bay would furnish a sheltered anchorage large enough for the entire United States Navy of 1861. The city of Georgetown on the bay was the largest on the South Carolina coast north of Charleston. Georgetown County produced nearly half of the rice grown in the United States, amounting to some 54 million pounds () in 1860; Georgetown exported more rice than any other port in the world. This production and shipping could be disrupted by gunboats moving up the Black, the Pee Dee, the Waccamaw, and the Sampit rivers, which flow into the bay; and the two distributary channels of the Santee River, whose mouths lie just below the bay. Curtailing rice production would not only damage the local economy, but would impair the Confederacy's ability to feed its armies. Winyah Bay, including locations of Battery White and sunken In May 1861, General P. G. T. Beauregard ordered the development of coastal defenses for South Carolina, including batteries situated on three islands flanking the mouth of Winyah Bay: North Island, South Island, and Cat Island. The Federal capture of Port Royal in November 1861 lent urgency to the construction and improvement of these works, which was done under Robert E. Lee, the newly appointed commander of the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and East Florida, with Colonel Arthur Middleton Manigault in charge of the district that included Georgetown and Horry counties. The island fortifications were never tested against a major Union attack. However, they served a useful purpose in dealing with grounded ships, both Confederate and Federal; in protecting the entrance to the bay; and in maintaining Confederate possession of the islands. John C. Pemberton Withdrawal Matters changed in early 1862. In March of that year, Lee was recalled to Richmond as military advisor to President Jefferson Davis. He was replaced by General John C. Pemberton, who ordered the withdrawal of troops and artillery from the positions around Georgetown, apparently in order to concentrate his limited manpower on shorter defensive lines. Union naval forces were quick to take advantage of this new vulnerability. In May 1862, the gunboats and noted that the island forts were unoccupied. They landed troops to occupy North Island, which became the principal local Union base for much of the war; and they destroyed the fortifications on South and Cat Islands. They also sailed some up the Waccamaw River, where they raided a mill and carried off 80 slaves. Settled on North Island, these freed slaves formed the nucleus of a colony of \\"contrabands\\" that grew to more than a thousand before being removed to Port Royal for fear of Confederate raids leading to their recapture or massacre. The Federal forces made no attempt to seize territory up the rivers, and their expeditions were limited by the draft of their vessels. Nevertheless, they conducted a number of raids in which they damaged facilities, seized rice, and released slaves; and these raids severely disrupted the region's economy. Rice production in particular suffered, since it depended on a labor force of skilled slaves performing carefully timed tasks. Pemberton still refused to move artillery and men to the Georgetown area, maintaining that all of his resources were necessary for the protection of Charleston. However, his superiors ordered him to construct new fortifications at Winyah Bay. Since the Union now controlled the islands, it was necessary to find sites further up the bay. On August 3, 1862, Pemberton visited the area and selected Mayrant's Bluff and Frazier's Point as the sites for the new batteries. Battery White Later in August 1862, Pemberton was promoted to lieutenant general and sent to the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, where he would eventually surrender Vicksburg. He was replaced in the Department of South Carolina and Georgia by Beauregard, who assumed command on September 24, 1862. The new commander supported the fortification of Winyah Bay: on October 8, 1862, he assured Governor Pickens that he had ordered the construction of a battery of five or six pieces of artillery at Mayrant's Bluff; on November 10, he wrote Colonel James Chesnut, Jr. that the battery was \\"armed and completed\\", and that he had sent a new regiment of the State Reserves to General James H. Trapier, in command of the Georgetown District. James H. Trapier Trapier was less than pleased with the troops and artillery that he had been given. The new regiment, he noted, arrived at the battery without arms and ammunition; and as Reserves, would only be in service for 90 days, not enough time to make effective soldiers of them even had they been armed. He had also been given fairly light guns; what he wanted was Columbiads, suitable for defending the battery and the bay against incursions by ironclads. Despite the paucity of men and weaponry, the new battery proved effective. On November 11, 1862, two Union gunboats entered Winyah Bay and began firing on the Mayrant's Bluff works. The Second South Carolina Artillery, which had set up nine guns in the fortification, responded; and within a few minutes, the Federal vessels were forced to retire. In February 1863, Trapier reported that the Mayrant's Bluff fortification, now named Battery White, was occupied by only 53 men and nine guns. Even this small force sufficed to stop Federal incursions up the rivers of Winyah Bay. However, rice production in the Georgetown area did not recover: the raids had destroyed too much of the physical plant, carried off too many of the slaves, and created too much uncertainty for planters to return to anything near full production. The battery continued to lose manpower, despite Trapier's ongoing calls for more troops and guns. In October 1864, a body of eleven deserters from the Confederate German Artillery reached the gunboat ; they reported that there was great discontent among the troops, and that many would desert were they not so strongly guarded. They also reported that there were ten guns at the battery; the captain of Potomska concluded that the bay was too well defended for him to render aid to prospective deserters. Capture In November 1864, Trapier was ordered to bring most of his forces to Mount Pleasant, just north of Charleston. Only a company of the German Artillery was left to defend the Georgetown district. By the end of January 1865, only a small crew commanded by a lieutenant remained at Battery White. In January and early February 1865, Union forces under General William Tecumseh Sherman moved northward from Georgia into South Carolina. On February 2 and 3, they defeated a Confederate force in the Battle of Rivers' Bridge, clearing their pathway into the state. After a feint at Charleston, they marched to Columbia, which they entered on February 17; on the same day, Charleston was evacuated, and on the 18th, it was surrendered. Columbiad at Battery White From Charleston, Union naval forces under Admiral John A. Dahlgren moved up the coast to Georgetown, which Dahlgren thought might be a useful point of communication with Sherman's land forces. On February 23, deserters told the captain of the gunboat that Battery White had been or would soon be evacuated. Mingoe fired four rounds into the battery. When no response was made, a party was sent ashore; they found the battery abandoned and its guns spiked. The sloop-of-war and the gunboat continued up the bay and landed a party of Marines to take possession of Georgetown; the intendant and wardens of the city formally surrendered it on February 25. Soon thereafter, Dahlgren inspected the battery, and was impressed. The fortification, he wrote, was well situated and designed, laid out to defend against both shipborne bombardment and attack by landing parties. Eleven guns bore on the channel: two Columbiads, three banded rifled 32-pounders, four smoothbore 24-pounders, and two banded rifled 12-pounders. A 6-pound smoothbore flanked the ditch. The rear was defended by a \\"formidable\\" rampart and ditch, with a 24-pound smoothbore at either end; in the fort were numerous traverses and magazines. The approach along the beach to the battery's right flank was covered by a 24-pound and a 12-pound smoothbore. \\"If the works had been sufficiently manned\\", wrote Dahlgren, \\"it would have required good troops to take the work.\\" =Sinking of USS Harvest Moon= By the fall of 1864, the Union fleet had effectively closed Winyah Bay to blockade runners. Accordingly, the Confederate command had elected to lay mines, at the time known as \\"torpedoes\\", in the bay. Eighteen mines had been constructed in Georgetown by Captain Thomas West Daggett and Stephen W. Rouquie and placed strategically in the bay. As early as January 1865, Union sympathizers in Georgetown had warned Dahlgren's forces about the existence of mines in the channel. While approaching Battery White, Mingoe had sent its boats out to sweep for such devices. However, their efforts may have been perfunctory: according to Dahlgren's report, \\"...so much has been said in ridicule of torpedoes that very little precautions are deemed necessary, and if resorted to are probably taken with less care than if due weight was attached to the existence of these mischievous things.\\" United Daughters of the Confederacy monument On the morning of March 1, 1865, Dahlgren's flagship, the side-wheel steamer , sailed from Georgetown toward Battery White, which Dahlgren intended to inspect. En route, the vessel struck one of Daggett and Rouquie's mines, which blew a large hole in it, killing one sailor; the boat quickly sank in two and a half fathoms of water. Battery White postbellum For over a century after the Civil War, the grounds on which Battery White stood were part of the Belle Isle Plantation. During the late 19th century, extensive landscaping was undertaken on the plantation. The United Daughters of the Confederacy erected a memorial stone on the site in 1929. In about 1946, the plantation gardens, including the battery, were opened to the public, and remained thus until 1974. In the 1970s, the plantation was developed as a condominium complex. Portions of the complex of fortifications were lost to construction. However, the owners elected to preserve Battery White itself. In 1977, a area encompassing the battery was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008, the site was re-opened to the public. The battery's earthworks are for the most part well preserved. The powder magazines have deteriorated, owing to collapse of the earth mounds following decay of their wooden interior shoring. The two Columbiads have been re-mounted and once again point out over Winyah Bay. U.S. Navy divers survey Harvest Moon, 1963 Three of the battery's guns have been placed in Georgetown. A 24-pound gun has been mounted in front of the National Guard Armory, and two cannon are displayed in Constitution Park on the Georgetown waterfront. Harvest Moon was never salvaged, and has gradually sunk deeper into the mud of the bay. In the mid-1960s, the top deck lay under an estimated six feet () of mud. A Georgetown group attempted to salvage and restore the vessel as a tourist attraction, and in 1964 the U.S. Navy formally abandoned it, rendering it eligible for private salvage; but the attempt failed for lack of funds. As of 2011, the ship's boiler stack was still visible at low tide. Notes The Albatross is described as a \\"378-ton (burden) wooden screw gunboat\\" at \\"USS Albatross (1861‚Äì1865)\\".

Dr Quinn was appointed to the role by Archbishop Polding in 1865 and served until his death in 1885. Early years and background The youngest son of Matthew Quinn, a farmer, and his wife, Mary, Quinn was educated in Dublin before entering the Propaganda College in Rome in 1837, studying for the priesthood before transferring to the Pontifical Irish College in 1839 where he graduated with a doctorate in sacred theology in 1845. Ordained a priest in 1847 in the Church of St John Lateran in Rome, Quinn worked as a missionary in Hyderabad with Bishop Daniel Murphy for eight years; returning to Ireland and became vice-president of St. Laurence O'Toole's Seminary, Dublin; where his brother James was President. Quinn succeeded as President in 1859 on James' appointment as Bishop of Queensland. For the next six years, Quinn supported James through the organisation of shiploads of Irish migrants to Queensland. Roman Catholic Bishop of Bathurst Consecrated by Archbishop Cullen together with his cousin, James Murray, the 2nd Bishop of Maitland, Quinn arrived in Australia aboard Empress on 21 October 1866 with Murray, nine priests (including Joseph Byrne) and sixteen nuns. Quinn, together with his brother in Brisbane and his cousin in Maitland, were a powerful Irish troika against the monasticism of Archbishop Polding; crafting the rise of the Irish Catholic church in Australia. Although Quinn opposed the appointment of Vaughan, another English Benedictine, as co-adjutor archbishop of Sydney in 1872, it was his position of influence and the success of his schools that won him the support of Vaughan, other bishops, and the laity. Quinn was widely renowned for the establishment of a system of Catholic schools principally run by religious orders, including St Stanislaus' College and the congregation of Sisters of St. Joseph, both in the Diocese of Bathurst, and St. Charles Seminary and introduced the Vincentian Fathers into Australia.B.J. Sweeney, Bishop Matthew Quinn and the Development of Catholic Education in New South Wales: 1865-1885, Catholic Diocese of Bathurst, 2016. Quinn was often at the forefront of battles with the colonial government following the Public Instruction Act of 1880 which withdrew all government aid from denominational schools. Sectarian tensions intensified after the promulgation of the Public Schools Act of 1866, coinciding with the waning influence of English Benedictine Catholicism and the increasing influence of Quinn and other Irish prelates. In 1879, Quinn instructed one of his flock, Richard Kenna, to withdraw his son from Sydney Grammar School. When Kenna refused, Quinn decided that he could neither take the sacraments nor be buried in consecrated ground. Prominent Irish Catholics in the town supported Quinn, including the Principal of St. Stanislaus' College, Dr Joseph Byrne, and store owner John Meagher. This has been described as 'the most notorious sectarian episode in the history of Bathurst'.; A. Cunningham, Richard Kenna and the bishop, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 20 (1999), 41-50. After the 1875 establishment of the Institute of St Joseph by Mary MacKillop, following the 1877 death of Sr. Teresa MacDonald, the Provincial of Bathurst, Quinn would not allow another Provincial to be appointed that did not report to him. He instructed the Sisters to leave Bathurst as he refused to accept MacKillop's central government of the Institute, where she held the role of Superior General.K. Burford, Kath, 'Tried and true': a foundress responds to episcopal fears: Mary Mackillop and the Bishops James and Matthew Quinn, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, 11 (1989), 4-17. After a trip to Europe during 1883 and 1884, Quinn returned to Bathurst, where he died at St. Stanislaus' College and was buried in Sts. Michael and John's Cathedral, in Bathurst.

The hijab ban lead to protests by some religious activists and to their subsequent arrests, due to their opposition to the new laws. Islamic Human Rights Commission PressTV EURASIANET.ORG  Background  The two main factors in the protests were Azerbaijan's hijab ban and the arrests of religious activists. = Hijab ban in schools = On December 10, 2010, Misir Mardanov, from the Azerbaijan's Education Ministry, announced the ban on hijab. According to the new law, students are forbidden from wearing hijabs in schools and universities. The government also brought Soviet-era uniforms back into schools. The Republic of Azerbaijan is a secular state. The hijab was effectively banned in schools by rules defining what kind of uniforms pupils should wear in this mainly Shiite Muslim country, which emerged as one of the most secular in the Islamic world after decades of Soviet rule.  Arrest of religious activists  The government of Azerbaijan arrested several leaders of the religious opposition and this caused a new round of protest by their supporters which led to them being arrested. The Parties involved included: the Popular Front, Musavat Party and Islamic Party. Leaders of these parties face long prison terms. Movsum Samadov, leader of the banned Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was charged with preparing an act of terror.  Protests and further arrests Several demonstrations and rallies took place in different cities of Azerbaijan to protest against the policies of the Azerbaijan government, which resulted in a new arrest wave. Anti-government activists used social media to call for street protests inspired by the Arab uprisings on Friday March 11, 2011. Activists inspired by the overthrow of autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt by pro-democracy protests vowed to stage more demonstrations as they were being arrested by police outside Baku's Oil Academy. Azerbaijan security forces detained 43 people in the event. On Saturday the 2nd of April 2011, another protest took place. Riot police seized protesters near the Fountains Square in Baku, where the opposition had wanted to hold a rally but failed to receive approval from the authorities. One of the opposition leaders said after the protest that about 1,000 people had taken part and more than 200 were arrested. On 6 May 2011, some protesters in Baku, chanted \\"God is great\\" and \\"Freedom to hijab\\", before being arrested by the police.  International reactions  There were international protests against the government's actions. =Europe= The European Union criticized Azerbaijan for \\"lack of respect of fundamental freedoms\\" after the 2 April rally was broken up by security forces. The supranational body called on authorities to allow for freedom of speech, free assembly, and freedom of the press, rights it suggested the government's response disrespected. On 13 April, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov summoned the head of the EU delegation to Azerbaijan to express his government's displeasure over the statement. =Human rights organizations= Amnesty International has also called upon the government to allow peaceful protests. In a letter published in British daily The Guardian on 20 April, its UK affiliate called for the release of Eynulla Fatullayev and other detained journalists and insisted the government should \\"comply with international standards on human rights ‚Äì specifically the right to assembly and the right to free expression\\". The International Press Institute echoed Amnesty's criticisms, condemning the Azerbaijani government's deportation of three Swedish journalists for reporting on the 17 April demonstration in Fountain Square. =Other countries= United States Ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza expressed concern over the Azerbaijani government's response to protests in March. The Iranian Ayatollahs have criticized Azerbaijan's decision to ban the hijab.

Background Parliamentary elections were held in late 2010 and were followed by controversy and repression as well as accusations of fraud. Following similar events in Tunisia during the Arab Spring, Egyptian activists called for protesters to turn up in cities around Egypt on various specially-designated days of rages. Though violence was reported at some points, protests were largely peaceful with the army staying quiet until 10 February 2011, when calls for Hosni Mubarak to resign were at their peak. The following day, Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation from the presidency while turning power over to the military.

The elections were held in two stages; a first stage on 29 and 30 January, with run-offs on 5 and 6 February, and a second stage on 14 and 15 February, with run-offs on 21 and 22 February. There were originally plans to hold the elections in three stages, with the third stage taking place on 4‚Äì5 March and run-offs on 11‚Äì12 March, but in early January 2012, the election process was sped up to shorten the transition period. Campaign The liberal Free Egyptians Party announced a boycott of the elections, complaining about irregularities during the preceding parliamentary elections and denouncing the Shura Council elections as a \\"waste of time\\". Results =First phase= The first phase included the governorates of Alexandria, Asyut, Cairo, Dakahlia, Damietta, Faiyum, Gharbia, Monufia, New Valley, North Sinai, Qena, Red Sea and South Sinai. Voter turnout for the first phase was at 15%, while turnout for its run-off was down to 6%. =Second phase= The polls of the second phase were held in Giza, Sharqiya, Kafr el-Sheikh, Qalyubia, Aswan, Sohag, Luxor, Beni Suef, Minya, Matrouh, Beheira, Suez, Ismailia and Port Said. The turnout in the second phase on 14‚Äì15 February was at 12.2%. According to the Higher Elections Commission, 3 million out of around 25 million eligible voters cast their votes. The number of invalid votes was 252,899. Aftermath During the first Shura Council session on 28 February 2012, FJP member Ahmed Fahmy was elected speaker.

She bought the property and associated title after the former castle and stronghold was destroyed by the French in the rampjaar 1672. History The castle was built in 1681 on the foundations of an earlier castle, by the architect Adriaan Dortsman (who also designed the new Lutheran church in Amsterdam.Dutch Rijksmonument site 508234 The castle grounds had been home to two previous constructions; a 14th-century castle named after Gysbrecht Gunter was destroyed in 1511. After being rebuilt by Gunter descendants, it changed hands several times and belonged for a short time to Johan van Oldenbarnevelt until he was beheaded in 1619. That building was later burned by the French in 1672 along with nearby Castle Nijenrode.Website on Utrecht castles The wealthy Amsterdam widow Magdalena Poulle bought the castle in 1680 and called herself Lady Gunterstein from then onwards. It is her family shield which is above the windows. She planned to leave the house to her nephew Pieter and had him lay the first stone at age three. Her portrait was made along with her nephew holding Dortsman's groundplan by the Amsterdam portrait painter David van der Plas, himself the son-in-law of the architect. This portrait still hangs above the mantelpiece where it was installed in 1683. Magdalena Poulle became an avid gardener and amateur botanist commissioning a book of etchings called Veues de Gunterstein, dedicated to Madame de Gunterstein et de Thienhoven. This book contains one of the earliest pictures of a Dutch orangerie with hothouses, and was highly influential on later botanists and wealthy garden owners such as Agnes Block and George Clifford III, who also sought to grow unusual plants and record them in albums.Nature and art: Dutch garden and landscape architecture, 1650-1740, Erik de Jong, Haarlem, 1995 on Google books Today, Gunterstein is still a home to descendants of Magdalena Poulle.

The telescope's aim is to catch the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). REM is triggered by a signal from a high-energy satellite such as Swift and rapidly points to the detected location in the sky. It is operated for the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics since 2002.  Telescope  The REM telescope and its instruments in daylight The telescope has been designed to be a fast pointing instrument, and its relatively small size is in fact balanced by a 10¬∞/s accurate fast pointing. This velocity makes REM suitable for immediate response to random alerts. The telescope hosts two instruments: REMIR, an infrared imaging camera, and ROSS, a visible imager and slitless spectrograph. The two cameras can observe simultaneously thanks to a dichroic placed before telescope focus the same field of view of 10√ó10 arc minutes. In the infrared range from 1 to 2.3 ¬µm REMIR can use a (z‚Ä≤, J, H, K‚Ä≤) filter set. ROSS is equipped with a standard filter set (V, R, I) and an slitless Amici prism. The observing procedure is completely robotic and the nightly schedule is optimized for the observation of scheduled targets but it is immediately overdriven by GRB (or other) alerts. Typically REM can observe the new target after 30 seconds from notification. REM has been installed in its place during June 2003 and has been gathering data on GRB and other sources since then. Also it is a bench for experimental instrumentation and equipment. In 2006 a wide-field camera parallel to the REM telescope, the TORTORA camera (Telescopio Ottimizzato per la Ricerca dei Transienti Ottici RApidi) was installed. TORTORA has a field of view of 24¬∞x32¬∞ through an objective of 120 mm diameter. The instrument was optimized for photometry of fast transients with a best time resolution of about 0.1 s. The observatory is operated for the Instituto Nazionale di Astrofisica by the REM Team. Main results Since its installation and commissioning at ESO, REM rapid and multi-band observations allowed to contribute to several important discoveries in some cases widely reported by ESO press releases; for instance, the observations a few seconds after its discovery of GRB060418, GRB06067A and GRB080319B. In addition, a larger set of observations of targets different from GRBs has been performed, securing long time series of data for variable stars, AGNs, etc. References External links * INAF REM site * ESO press release about GRB060418 and GRB060607A * ESO press release about GRB080319B * REM and TORTORA See also * TAROT- South robotic observatory, an even smaller and faster-moving telescope also at La Silla Category:Astronomical instruments Category:Robotic telescopes ","title":"Rapid Eye Mount telescope"},{"id":"33127129","text":"Os Verdes Anos is a 1963 Portuguese drama film directed by Paulo Rocha.

As of Q1 (the first quarter of) 2018, UK debt amounted to ¬£1.78 trillion, or 86.58% of total GDP, at which time the annual cost of servicing (paying the interest) the public debt amounted to around ¬£48 billion (which is roughly 4% of GDP or 8% of UK government tax income). Approximately a third of this debt is owned by the British government due to the Bank of England's quantitative easing programme, so approximately 1/3 of the cost of servicing the debt is paid by the government to itself, reducing the annual servicing cost to approximately ¬£30 billion (approx 2% of GDP, approx 5% of UK government tax income). Due to the Government's current budget deficit (PSNCR), the national debt is increasing (by ¬£46 billion in 2017). The Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition government in 2010 planned that they would eliminate the deficit by the 2015/16 financial year. However, by 2014 they admitted that the structural deficit would not be eliminated until the financial year 2017/18. This forecast was pushed back to 2018/19 in March 2015, and to 2019/20 in July 2015, before the target of a return to surplus at any particular time was finally abandoned by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in July 2016. Definition The UK national debt is the total quantity of money borrowed by the Government of the United Kingdom at any time through the issue of securities by the British Treasury and other government agencies. Debt versus deficit Pie chart of UK central government expenditure, 2016‚Äì17. Debt interest is shown in dark green. Social protection includes Pensions and Welfare. The UK national debt is often confused with the government budget deficit (officially known as the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement (PSNCR)). For example, the then Prime Minister David Cameron was reprimanded in February 2013 by the UK Statistics Authority for creating confusion between the two, by stating in a political broadcast that his administration was \\"paying down Britain's debts\\". In fact, his administration had been attempting to reduce the deficit, not the overall debt; which continued to rise even as the deficit was reduced. =UK budget= The public debt increases or decreases as a result of the annual budget deficit or surplus. The British government budget deficit or surplus is the cash difference between government receipts and spending. The British government debt is rising due to a gap between revenue and expenditure. Total government revenue in the fiscal year 2015/16 was projected to be ¬£673 billion, whereas total expenditure was estimated at ¬£742 billion. Therefore, the total deficit was ¬£69 billion. This represented a rate of borrowing of a little over ¬£1.3 billion per week. =Gilts= The British government finances its debt by issuing gilts, or Government securities. These securities are the simplest form of government bond and make up the largest share of British government debt. A conventional gilt is a bond issued by the British government that pays the holder a fixed cash payment (or coupon) every six months until maturity, at which point the holder receives the final coupon payment and the return of the principal. Cost of servicing the debt Interest payments on UK national debt as percentage of GDP from 1900 Distinct from both the national debt and the PSNCR is the interest that the government must pay to service the existing national debt. In 2012, the annual cost of servicing the public debt amounted to around ¬£43bn, or roughly 3% of GDP. In 2012, the British population numbered around 64 million, and the debt therefore amounted to a little over ¬£15,000 for each individual Briton, or around ¬£33,000 per person in employment. Each household in Britain pays an average of around ¬£2,000 per year in taxes to finance the interest. By international standards, Britain enjoys very low borrowing costs. Credit rating Like other sovereign debt, the British national debt is rated by various ratings agencies. On 23 February 2013, it was reported that Moody's had downgraded UK debt from Aaa to Aa1, the first time since 1978 that the country has not had an AAA credit rating. This was described as a \\"humiliating blow\\" by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. George Osborne, the Chancellor, said that it was \\"a stark reminder of the debt problems facing our country\\", adding that \\"we will go on delivering the plan that has cut the deficit by a quarter\\". France and the United States of America had each lost their AAA credit status in 2012. The agency Fitch also downgraded its credit rating for British government debt from AAA to AA+ in April 2013. Further downgrades were made by Fitch and Standard & Poor's in June 2016, following the UK's vote in the referendum of that month to leave the European Union. Standard & Poor's had hitherto maintained the UK's AAA status. Remedies for indebtedness All the main political parties in Britain agree that the national debt is too high, but disagree on the best policy to deal with it, with Conservative Party politicians advocating a larger role for cuts to public spending. By contrast, the Labour Party tends to advocate fewer cuts and more emphasis on economic stimulus, higher rates of taxation and new taxes. Another body of opinion that the \\"consensus\\" regarding the problematic nature of the national debt is incorrect. The view proposed by economists such as Professor Stephanie Kelton of Stony Brook University in New York is that there is often too much emphasis in political discussions on 'balancing the books'. History The sealing of the Bank of England Charter (1694) The origins of the British national debt can be found during the reign of William III, who engaged a syndicate of City traders and merchants to offer for sale an issue of government debt. This syndicate soon evolved into the Bank of England, eventually financing the wars of the Duke of Marlborough and later Imperial conquests. The national debt increased dramatically during and after the Napoleonic Wars, rising to around 200% of GDP. Over the course of the 19th century the national debt gradually fell, only to see large increases again during World War I and World War II. After the war, the national debt once again slowly fell as a proportion of GDP. History of the UK government debt as a proportion of GDP =Modern era= In 1976, the British Government led by James Callaghan faced a Sterling crisis during which the value of the pound tumbled and the government found it difficult to raise sufficient funds to maintain its spending commitments. The Prime Minister was forced to apply to the International Monetary Fund for a ¬£2.3 billion rescue package; the largest-ever call on IMF resources up to that point. In November 1976, the IMF announced its conditions for a loan, including deep cuts in public expenditure, in effect taking control of UK domestic policy.\\"Good-bye Great Britain\\": 1976 IMF Crisis, K Burk, The crisis was seen as a national humiliation, with Callaghan being forced to go \\"cap in hand\\" to the IMF. =Recent history= In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the national debt dropped in relative terms, falling to 29% of GDP by 2002. In 1997, the Labour Government of Tony Blair had inherited a PSNCR of approximately ¬£5 billion per annum, but by sticking to the parsimonious spending plans of the outgoing Conservative Government, this was gradually turned into a modest budget surplus. During the Spending Review of 2000, Labour began to pursue a looser fiscal policy, and by 2002 annual borrowing had reached ¬£20 billion. The national debt continued to increase, together with sustained economic growth, increasing to 37% of GDP in 2007. This was due to extra government borrowing, largely caused by increased spending on health, education, and social security benefits. Between 2008 and 2013, when the British economy slowed sharply and fell into recession, the national debt rose dramatically, mainly caused by increased spending on social security benefits, financial bailouts for banks, and a significant drop in receipts from stamp duty, corporate tax, and income tax. In the 20-year period from 1986/87 to 2006/07 government spending in the United Kingdom averaged around 40% of GDP. As a result of the 2007‚Äì2010 financial crisis and the late-2000s global recession government spending increased to a historically high level of 48% of GDP in 2009/10, partly as a result of the cost of a series of bank bailouts. In July 2007, Britain had government debt at 35.5% of GDP. This figure rose to 56.8% of GDP by July 2009. The national debt today UK balance sheet compared with the Eurozone in 2014 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, national debt had reached ¬£2.004 trillion for the first time due to government spending on virus measures, such as a furlough scheme and the \\"Eat Out to Help Out\\" scheme. The national debt stood at ¬£1.786 trillion at the calendar year end 2018, or 85.2% of GDP; as published by the Office for National Statistics. The annual amount that the government must borrow to plug the gap in its finances used to be known as the Public sector borrowing requirement, but is now called the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement (PSNCR). The PSNCR figure for the financial year end 2017 was ¬£46 billion, total British GDP in 2017 was ¬£1.959 trillion. By historic peacetime standards, the national debt is large and growing in overall terms though now falling as a percentage of GDP. It is currently nowhere near its historical peaks after the Napoleonic and World War eras. However, there is concern that official calculations of national debt omit many 'off-book' liabilities which mask the true nature of the debt: for example, Nick Silver of the Institute of Economic Affairs estimated the current British liabilities, including state & public pensions, as well as other commitments by the government, to be near ¬£5 trillion, compared with the Government's estimate of ¬£845 billion (as of 17 November 2010) These liabilities can be compared to total net assets (2010 figures) of ¬£7.3 trillion, which equates to approximately a net worth of ¬£120,000 per head of the population. Based on such a method of calculation, UK national debt would be equivalent to, or potentially exceed, historic highs. The British Government's debt is owned by a wide variety of investors, most notably pension funds. These funds are on deposit, mainly in the form of Treasury bonds at the Bank of England. The pension funds, therefore, have an asset which has to be offset by a liability, or a debt, of the government. As of the end of 2016, 27.6% of the national debt was owed to overseas governments and investors. International comparisons Global public debt as a percent of GDP (2009/2010) In 2011, Britain's volume of debt was ranked 18th internationally according to the CIA World Factbook. Many other countries had larger debt burdens. For example, Japan had a National debt of around 194% of GDP, whilst that of Italy was more than 100%. The National debt of the United States reached 100% of GDP in November 2011.

Additionally, it was the inspiration for the 1948 English film, Blanche Fury. The victims, Isaac Jermy and his son Isaac Jermy Jermy were shot and killed on the porch and in the hallway of their mansion, Stanfield Hall, Norwich. The perpetrator, James Bloomfield Rush (1800‚Äì1849), their delinquent tenant- farmer, who had conducted a complex, devious scheme to defraud them of their property and their lives, was hanged at Norwich Castle on 21 April 1849. The unwitting accomplice to the attempted fraud was Emily Sandford, whom Rush had employed as a governess but who was also his mistress. Scenario Norwich Castle in 1845; Rush was hanged here in 1849 In 1848, Isaac Jermy and his son Isaac Jermy Jermy were shot and killed on the porch and in the hallway of their mansion, Stanfield Hall, Wymondham, near Norwich, by James Bloomfield Rush. Rush had been their tenant for nearly a decade, and he had mortgaged and remortgaged his farm, ostensibly to raise money for improvements, but without any resultant improvement in the farm's output. The deadline to pay off the mortgages was approaching; otherwise foreclosure and eviction would follow, which would adversely affect both his children and his pregnant mistress, their governess Emily Sandford. Death mask of James Bloomfield Rush. Paint on plaster, circa 1849 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London The Jermys had problems with relatives over the title claim to their estate. However, Isaac Jermy was the Recorder of Norwich, a prominent local man with legal connections; thus, it was unlikely that he would lose the property. Rush's plan was to kill both Jermys, their servant, and the younger Jermy's pregnant wife while disguised and blame the massacre on the rival claimants to the estate.Murders at Stanfield hall by John MillmanThe Stanfield Hall Murders by Orfield SutherlandThe Stanfield hall Assassinations. An authentic report of the Trial, Conviction and Extraordinary defence of James Bloomfield Rush. (Contemporary account) Rush's plan called for Sandford to provide an alibi by stating that he was at the farm during the hour or so that the crime was committed. Rush wore a false wig and whiskers, but failed to hide his body sufficiently, so that the wounded Mrs. Jermy and the servant, Elizabeth Chestney, who both survived, would later identify him. Sandford also refused to support his alibi. Evidence on forgeries involved in the case was given by Alfred Smee, creator of the Bank of England‚Äôs official ‚ÄúBank Black‚Äù ink. Tried in 1849, Rush defended himself and was convicted. He was hanged and buried in the grounds of Norwich Castle.

One uses appreciative listening when listening to music, poetry or the stirring words of a speech. It involves listening to music that one enjoys, people the listener likes to listen to because of their style and the choices the listener make in the films and television he/she watches, radio programmes and plays and musicals in the theatre. Unlike informative listening or relationship listening, appreciative listening does not rely on the message from the speaker it is how one responds as a listener. Our appreciation of what we hear will vary depending on our individual tastes, but will also be affected by three different factors:  Presentation  There are many different factors that encompass presentation including the medium, the setting and the style and personality of a presenter. Of course this works both ways and equally you will have been entranced by others because of the force of their personality and their delivery style. The environment can also impact your appreciation of the presentation. Seating, temperature, clarity and volume of sound will all impact on whether it‚Äôs a good or poor experience.  Perception  Perception is an important factor in appreciative listening. As one is exposed to different experiences his/her perceptions can change. For example: individual's taste in music. We need to listen to various types of music to have a preference over other types and appreciate them. An individual's expectations also affects our perception. An individual's perception and expectations are driven by his/her attitudes which determine how he/she reacts to and interact to the world in which he/she lives.  Previous experience  Some of our perceptions are clearly influenced by our previous experience and impact on whether or not we enjoy listening to something, or whether we are even willing to listen. Whether our memories evoke pleasant or unpleasant reminders will affect our appreciation. However, it‚Äôs important to remain open to new experiences. We can develop our appreciative listening skills.

Its size was rarely enlarged for hundreds of years until Dong Qichang, a Chinese painter, calligrapher of the later period of the Ming Dynasty, built several more ancient architectural complex on its original basis. In 1797, the garden began to be used as a foundling hospital until it was well repaired and reopened to the public in 1959. The garden's name lies in the famous Chinese poet Li Bai.

It is located over north-east of the massive cluster R136 in the Tarantula Nebula. It is 150 times the mass of the sun and 3.2 million times more luminous which makes it one of the most massive and most luminous stars known. Discovery VFTS 682 is a prominent infrared source in the Large Magellanic Cloud and has been catalogued numerous times. In 1992 it was identified as entry 153 in a list of possible protostars. In 2009 it was again classified as a probable young stellar object on account of its exceptional infrared luminosity. The VLT- FLAMES Tarantula survey (VFTS) examined 800 massive stars in detail and determined a spectral type of WN5h for VFTS 682. It is heavily reddened and visually several magnitudes fainter than other stars of similar luminosity and temperature in the 30 Doradus region. Runaway VFTS 682 is in the large star-forming region of the Tarantula Nebula, but is not within a dense massive cluster. The existence of an extremely massive and extremely young star in some isolation is unexpected since these stars are expected to form only from the most massive and dense molecular clouds and hence to form in large groups such as R136 as the result of competitive accretion or stellar mergers. The formation of isolated massive star would require different models to allow monolithic disk accretion of very massive stars. VFTS 682 is close enough to R136 that it might have formed there and been ejected. No bow shock has been detected and it has a space velocity lower than most runaways, but large enough and in the right direction that it could be from R136. Properties The star's high mass of compresses its core to a high temperature and causes very rapid fusion via the CNO cycle, leading to the extremely high luminosity of . The star is 22 times the radius of the sun but because of its high temperature it emits 3.2 million times more energy, mostly at ultraviolet wavelengths so it is only 43,000 times as bright as the sun visually. Nearly 99% (AV = 4.5) of the ultraviolet and visual radiation is then blocked by intervening interstellar material. The luminosity, intense UV radiation, and chemical makeup of the star's surface layers results in a stellar wind with a speed up to . Evolution Stars as massive as VFTS 682 with metallicity typical of the Large Magellanic Cloud will maintain near-homogeneous chemical structure due to strong convection and rotational mixing. This produces strong helium and nitrogen surface abundance enhancement even during core hydrogen burning. Their rotation rates will also decrease significantly due to mass loss and envelope inflation, so that gamma-ray bursts are unlikely when this type of star reaches core collapse. Very massive stars are expected to develop directly from hydrogen-rich young stars showing an Of or WNh spectrum into classical hydrogen-poor Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, possibly with a short period as a luminous blue variable They will continue to lose mass rapidly, passing through WN, WC, and WO stages before exploding as a type Ic supernova and leaving behind a black hole. It is unclear whether the resulting supernova would be under-luminous, or even invisible, as the result of collapsing into the black hole, or over-luminous due to a large mass of ejected radioactive Ni56. The total lifetime would be around 2-3 million years, with the last half million years or so spent as a Wolf Rayet star burning helium at the core and a very short period burning heavier elements.

He operates under the corporate name 'PopbangColour'. Cook became a car enthusiast at an early age and combined his passions of cars, toys and art to create complex and dynamic artworks. Early life Cook studied at Langley Secondary School, Solihull from 1994 to 1999. He then went to Sutton Coldfield College, where he would later teach, to study a BTEC National Diploma, for Illustration. Finally, he attended Winchester School of Art for Fine art where he received a first class BA Honours degree for painting. He studied at the Latvian art academy in Riga, Latvia, and it was there that he started employing vehicles in his works. In particular, while in Latvia he produced photography and collected merchandise in regards to Range Rover. For a short period he became a lecturer in fine art and visual studies at Sutton Coldfield College's design centre. Style To create his unique artworks, Cook spoons acrylic paint and ink onto large 2.5 x 1.5-metre Fabriano Paper and drives the radio-controlled cars over the canvas in short bursts to create the 'brush strokes'. He also uses full-size car tyres for large blocks of colour and small toy car wheels for different prints and textures. He first began using this artwork style when one Christmas he received a radio-controlled Lightning McQueen and was told \\"not to take it down the studio and not to get paint on it\\". With his 'lightbulb' moment Ian took a large canvas, placed it on the floor, and applied some paint to a toy car. Cook has also used a large truck to create the larger solid lines. Cook creates his artworks his studio, at Fargo Village, Coventry, where he is one of the artists in residence. Cook has been seen creating in public places across the United Kingdom for shows or promotions, including Goodwood Festival of Speed, Autosport International, Salon Priv√© and Britcar Famous pieces Cook's artwork has been featured on Blue Peter, Top Gear, The One Show with Chris Evans and Jessie J and painted with Lewis Hamilton on Sky Sports F1.

The lineup consists of singer Matt Drenik, guitarist Austin Kalman and drummer Jake Perlman. Trevor Sutcliffe was Lions' bassist from their formation until his departure in 2009, where he was replaced by Mike Sellman. The band formed following the breakup of The Good Looks, the previous band of both Drenik and Perlman. To date, Lions have released one studio album; No Generation (2007), and two EPs; Volume One (2006) and Let No One Fall (2009). Since 2007, their music has been licensed for television shows (Sons of Anarchy and Californication) as well as video games (Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010). The inclusion of \\"Metal Heavy Lady\\" in Guitar Hero III led to over 3,000 downloads of the song according to Nielsen SoundScan. History =Formation and Volume One EP (2005‚Äì2007)= Matt Drenik and Jake Perlman were both members of the Austin-based rock band The Good Looks. When they later broke up in the middle of a summer tour, Drenik was told by a club owner that he would keep a Fu Manchu support slot if he formed another band. After renting out an open space above a bar, to write and practice, Drenik and Perlman began working with guitarist Austin Kalman and bassist Trevor Sutcliffe whose bands had also broken up. They quickly formed a new group and, following a suggestion from Perlman, named themselves Lions, due to a large lion head that covered a whole wall of open space where they practiced. Lions went on to fulfill the support slots of The Good Looks while their later shows gained the band some notoriety for their high-energy performances. To coincide with their appearance at SXSW '06, Lions recorded and released their debut EP Volume One in 2006. Reviewing the EP for Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia states that Lions \\"boldly attempts to straddle the hard rock decades\\" making comparisons to the bands ZZ Top, Queens of the Stone Age, Nebula and Fu Manchu. He goes on to state that while \\"there's definite room for improvement\\" the EP \\"is a very promising first step [for the band].\\" =No Generation (2007‚Äì2009)= The band soon gained record label attention from Rock Ridge Music and Roadrunner Records. Though Roadrunner helped to fund the recording of their debut album, they decided against signing the band. The band performed at SXSW '07, which led to the song \\"Metal Heavy Lady,\\" from the Volume One EP, being licensed for use on the Activision game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock in 2007. The song's inclusion on the game led to over 3,000 downloads according to Nielsen SoundScan. The band were also contacted by FX to write the theme song for Sons of Anarchy, recording it with producer Matt Hyde. Though \\"This Life\\" was chosen as the theme, Lions music was still used prominently in the show while they would later record a cover of the Bob Dylan song \\"Girl from the North Country\\" for the Sons of Anarchy: North Country - EP released in 2009. The band's music was also licensed for use on the Showtime series Californication. Lions debut album No Generation was released independently on November 14, 2007, with \\"Start Movin'\\" chosen as the first single. The album received generally positive reviews upon release. Allmusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia states that while there are many positives on the album, \\"No Generation unfortunately lacks some of its predecessors' excitement and urgency, leaving listeners already aware of the band's potential hungering for more.\\" Reviewing the album for The Austin Chronicle, Austin Powell states that the album \\"offers tighter production, heavier hooks, and the grooves\\" though he describes the end of the album as \\"a draining experience.\\" Jordan Richardson of Blogcritics made comparisons to Soundgarden and Fu Manchu, stating that Lions \\"have come up with a heavy, bluesy, ultimately rewarding record.\\" In 2008, the band toured in support of the album, playing shows in the US supporting the Toadies and Local H, while \\"Start Movin'\\" was re- released to capitalize on the band's exposure from Guitar Hero III The same year, the band gained some interest from Columbia Records, though no deal went through. =Let No One Fall EP and recent events (2009‚Äìpresent)= In 2009, WWE used \\"Start Movin'\\" in promotional spots for SummerSlam 2009 and later included the song in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 in-game soundtrack. The band began working on new songs after deciding against using previous material. The band entered pre-production of their new album in May and began recording in June with producer Chris \\"Frenchie\\" Smith. It was during this time that bassist Sutcliffe departed the band and was replaced my Mike Sellman for recording. Lions invited Scott Lucas of Local H to write with them, eventually writing the song \\"Screaming Out,\\" while they were sent a demo from Vaden Todd Lewis, of the Toadies, that they reworked into \\"Poster Child.\\" The resulting EP, entitled Let No One Fall, was released on November 23, 2009, in the UK through Maybe Records. The EP received generally positive reviews. Reviewing the EP for Rock Sound, Tim Newbound stated that it was \\"a wicked slab of bare-bones rock.\\" Malcolm Dowe of Metal Hammer states that they \\"prove that grunge can be given a fresh twist, bringing in daubs of Velvet Revolver and [Queens of the Stone Age].\\" Lions later supported Monster Magnet and Karma to Burn on their UK tour in December, making Let No One Fall available for free download to coincide with the tour. Drenik also launched his side project Battleme, contributing the song \\"Burn This Town\\" to the second series finale of Sons of Anarchy as well as the series soundtrack Sons of Anarchy: Shelter - EP. He would later, in 2010, contribute a cover of Neil Young's \\"Hey Hey, My My\\" for the Sons of Anarchy third series finale and soundtrack Sons of Anarchy: The King is Gone. In 2010, Lions performed at SXSW '10, and later performed one show in Austin, Texas in October, with Drenik focusing on his side project Battleme stating \\"I'm guessing we'll do a lot of back-and-forth [between bands].\\" Lions subsequently became inactive as Drenik shifted focus to Battleme. Musical style and influences In an interview with Spinner, Matt Drenik described the band's sound as \\"heavy riff-rock\\" that was \\"more in the hard rock vein than in the metal vein.\\" Guitarist Austin Kalman described Lions sound, in Total Guitar, as \\"the halfway point between straight rock 'n' roll and punk and metal.\\" Jason Bennett, if Nashville Scene, describes that band's music as \\"a ferocious blend of fuzz, sweat and riffs, with a slinky Southern groove holding it all together.\\" In an article for Billboard magazine, Katie Hasty states that Lions \\"[combine] '70s hard rock and psych elements ... with buzzing, stoner guitar rifts and Drenik's strong wail.\\" Houston Press writer Christopher Henderson states that \\"Lions are the Eagles of death metal, had they spent an entire adolescent summer with Black Flag's \\"In My Head,\\" or Wolfmother for people who drink domestic beer.\\" Eric Allen of Real Detroit Weekly has describe the band's sound as \\"a heavy blend of metal, psychedelic and hard rock that would make the former torchbearers of the genre happy.\\" Drenik has cited influences from Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, while guitarist Kalman cites Sonic Youth, Elliott Smith, The Beatles and avant-garde jazz music as influences on his playing. The band have also seen their music compared to Queens of the Stone Age, ZZ Top, Soundgarden, AC/DC, Nebula and Fu Manchu among others.

It was written by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte and produced by Bellotte. Background and release By 1975, Summer had been based in Munich, Germany for several years and had been working with European writers/producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte for some time. They had released her debut album, \\"Lady of the Night\\" in the Netherlands the previous year, and it had spawned two European hit singles‚Äî\\"The Hostage\\" and \\"Lady of the Night\\". Earlier in 1975, a new single called \\"Love to Love You\\" had been released in the Netherlands, and would later be reworked and retitled \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" and be released internationally as Summer's breakthrough hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom. \\"Virgin Mary\\" was released in the Netherlands prior to this, as the follow-up to the original \\"Love To Love You\\". Composition and lyrics Written by Moroder and Bellotte, the song contained slow verses and then sped up for the choruses, before returning to a slow fade out. It also made fairly heavy use of backing vocals. The lyrics told the story of a formerly beautiful woman now in her mid-30s but having aged prematurely due to being abused by the people of the town in which she lived, who disapproved of her wayward lifestyle as a youngster, and who believed gossip about her behaviour with men. As a result of her apparent behaviour, they named her \\"Virgin Mary\\". Impact and legacy The final release before Summer's international breakthrough, \\"Virgin Mary\\" was not a big hit. This coupled with the fact that it was only released in one country has made the single somewhat of a collector's item. Mint copies of it are very hard to find, although used copies can sometimes be found on eBay. The song was featured on two LPs in Europe in the 1970s, being included on the Dutch release of Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" album (replacing \\"Full Of Emptiness,\\" which was originally part of Summer's debut album) and also the Dutch/German-only \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation in 1977.

The series consists of six books: Arrival, Contact, Mutation, Underground, Fallout and Doomsday, the latest being released in Australia on 1 June 2013. A US release followed on 1 July 2013. The books have been well received by critics and gained praise from authors including Michael Grant and have sold thousands of copies in Australia. The Phoenix Files series was released in the UK from September 2011. As of 2016 the books are published in three volumes: Man in the Shadows, Blood in the Ashes and Life in the Flames.  Plot overview  = Arrival = Arrival is told from Luke Hunter's point of view, as he and his recently divorced mother, Emily, move into Phoenix, a town run by the hugely powerful Shackleton Cooperative. Luke discovers that, in Phoenix, they have no access to phones, the internet and or to cars. Emily is impressed; but Luke is suspicious. After they meet Peter Weir, one of the first of Phoenix's citizens and Jordan Burke, Peter's love interest who clearly does not love him back, they discover the town is plotting to wipe out the entire earth. When they discover the town's airport is shut down, Time magazine issues have been published months in advance before their release and Phoenix is trapped behind a large wall ‚Äì and the outside is a barren wasteland, the protagonists discover the plot is indeed real. The final sentence in the novel reveals a ringing mobile phone in the town square. = Contact = Contact switches to Peter's point of view. After he, Jordan and Luke hear the ringing phone in the town square, Peter finds out his dad owns a phone and the employees use them to contact each other for work purposes. They also discover Peter's dad is working for Tabitha as their propaganda specialist. Further information reveals the true capacity of what Tabitha is ‚Äì a biological weapon which boils one's skin clean off, and they find out there is a tunnel network connecting all of Phoenix's major facilities. Luke's mother has been caught with the town's doctor, Dr Montag doing romantic activities and Luke is furious. They talk to Officer Reeve who helped them escape the airport and gave a false account for their appearance at the wall in Arrival, into helping them get into the Shackleton Building so Luke can call his dad to tell him about Tabitha. In the building, they are caught by Noah Shackleton, the cooperative's C.E.O. He tells them Luke's dad will be tracked and killed and instead of killing them, they use Tabitha to execute Reeve and inject suppressors into the three of them so the Cooperative can track their whereabouts 24/7. If they are caught in the wrong places, they will be paralyzed from the waist down as they have now done to Peter's dad. When they leave the building, Jordans Father runs to Dr. Motang and yells \\"There's something wrong with the baby!\\" = Mutation = Mutation comes from Jordan's point of view. She begins to notices strange occurrences happening to the people of Phoenix. Jordan is receiving visions of the past and future, Peter is spiraling out-of-control more than ever, her younger sister is reading minds, her mum's baby is growing rapidly inside and it will be due August 13 ‚Äì the same day Tabitha will eradicate the world outside, and she notices the rest of Phoenix's citizens are becoming super-powered, except for Luke. Peter's old friends, Cathryn, Mike and Tank, have been disappearing each day after school and Jordan, Luke and Peter find out they have been worshiping mysterious overseers who tell them they have a destiny. Soon after, when all of Phoenix has to take a blood test, Peter severely bashes Mr Hanger, one of the high school's most despised teachers. Subsequently, his suppressor is activated. After being sent to the Phoenix Medical Center, Peter is kidnapped by Cat, Mike and Tank. Luke and Jordan set out to rescue him but it backfires when they find an abandoned complex and suppressors are activated. In the complex, they are confronted by a young man and an older woman who have been tracking them their whole lives. = Underground = Underground returns to Luke's point of view. He and Jordan are interrogated by the two people they confronted at the end of Mutation. They believe Luke, Peter and Jordan are working for the Cooperative and demand to know the location of Tobias, whom they have never heard of. The interrogators' names are revealed to be Kara, whose mother established the complex they are living in and Soren, who is Kara's son. They are working to end Tabitha as Luke, Jordan and Peter are, but they still do not give each other their complete trust, despite that they deactivate their suppressors. Peter is being held by their custody as he is too dangerous to be near. Kara and Soren are soon revealed to be Cat, Mike and Tank's overseers. They are angered by the reveal and Luke's dad finally arrives in Phoenix. The people of Phoenix have been growing suspicious and reports of citizens leaving the town have gone around, although they have actually become the latest People to go under the medical center for research. A new security camera network is set up in Phoenix making it harder for the group to enter the town. Luke, Peter and Jordan tell their parents about Tabitha and reactions are mixed. Luke's mum does not believe him, whilst Jordan's and Peter's do. Jordan's mum and sister are arrested and her dad and Peter's parents join forces. Kara and Soren perform the same suppressor deactivation procedure on Peter's dad as they did with Luke, Jordan and Peter. After extensive research, a possible cause for Peter's condition has been discovered. The dense forest surrounding Phoenix was not there 25 years before and the cause of the growth of the forest could be affecting Peter. The group go to the Medical Centre as the town is sent to a mandatory meeting in the Shackleton Building and rescue Jordan's mum and Georgia, Jordan's sister. Much to Emily's dismay, Dr Montag is shot. The day after the rescue mission, it is revealed that the Shackleton Building has become a concentration camp for Phoenix's citizens and Peter's parents and Jordan's dad were caught. Luke and Jordan watch a video of themselves from decades ago where Peter stabs Luke. They are bemused and horrified to know that even if Tabitha is to be overthrown, Luke will die.http://hardiegrant.com.au/Egmont/Books/Book.aspx?isbn=9781921502422 = Fallout = Fallout is told from Jordan's point of view. It starts with Luke, Jordan, Reeve, Luke's dad, Kara, Soren and a girl who is extremely fast named Amy, sneaking into the weapons warehouse to get more weapons and ammo. They find helicopters and Luke's dad and Kara fly out to get someone from the outside to help. Everyone else goes back to the Vattel complex underground. Crazy Bill wakes up and starts digging, but won't tell anyone why. Peter keeps getting worse. Tank has decided that Reeve is his boss and does whatever he wants. Mike still thinks Soren is a powerful overseer and follows him around. Jordan and Luke see Mike sacrifice his life to take out the security system because Soren wanted him to. Crazy Bill tells Luke and Jordan that he is Peter and that he never made it back to the present after killing Luke. And he also says that Jordan is the portal into the past and she blew up the Vattel Complex. Luke, Jordan, Reeve, and a couple others leave to find Tobias in the Shackleton building, but can't. Shackleton doesn't seem to know who or what Tobias even is. When they get back to the complex, they find that Jordan's mom's baby has been born. He was named Abraham, after Jordan's dad, but Georgia reads the baby's mind and he tells her that his name is Tobias. The book ends with an electrified grid stretching out to the wall, completing the final lock-down procedures. = Doomsday = Doomsday is the final book of the series. There are no more days left. After ninety-nine days of lockdown, the annihilation of the human race is right on schedule. Luke and Jordan are fighting a losing battle. Peter has escaped, Bill has disappeared, and Co- operative Security are moments away from storming the Vattel Complex. As the battle rages on in town, an offer of help arrives from the last place anyone could have expected (Calvin). But can it really be trusted, or is this just another one of Shackleton's deceptions? And with the murder still looming over Luke, will he even live long enough to find out (he lives)? One way or another, it's all coming to an end. The clock is still ticking. There are seventeen hours until the end of the world.  Main characters  * Luke Hunter is the main protagonist of the series and he and his mother are the instigator of the Shackleton Cooperative's countdown to the end of the world. Luke is not supposed to be in Phoenix, as it is revealed later in the series.

He slowly becomes more erratic each book until he becomes uncontrollable abusing his telekinetic powers.

He is feared by Luke, Jordan and Peter and they see him as a major threat. * Officer Matthew Reeve is one of few security officers in Phoenix on Luke, Peter and Jordan's side. For this reason he is killed in Contact. He is found alive in Underground. *Dr Robert Montag is the main doctor in Phoenix who starts to date Emily much to Luke's disgust.

In discussing the decision, within this context, to write primarily teenage protagonists, he said: Critical reception The series has been largely well received. susan-whelan.suite101.com described Arrival as \\"a well-written thriller sure to intrigue readers and keep them turning pages then waiting impatiently for the next installment\\".

This temple is located 2 km, away towards North West from the Kumbakonam Railway Station. Vishnu appears in the form of a discus or Chakra to put down the pride of Surya (the Sun), who subsequently became his devotee.Ayyar 1991, p. 325 Like Shiva, Lord Chakrapani has a third eye on His forehead. The temple is one of the most prominent temples in Kumbakonam.South Indian Railway Company 1926, p. 57 Legend left As per Hindu legend, Chakra (also called Sudarshana), the discus, is the most powerful weapon of god Vishnu. He once sent his weapon to nether world to kill king Jalandasura. The weapon is believed to have come out of the nether world through river Kaveri. God Brahma, who was taking bath in the river, got impressed and installed the image of Sudarshana in the place where the temple is now located. Surya, the Sun god, who was glowing in brilliance, had his brightness diminished by the effulgent Sudarshana. Surya worshipped Sudarshana and pleased by his devotion, Sudarshana restored all the powers of Surya.Madhavan 2007, pp. 98-100 Vishnu attained the name Chakrapani from then on. Surya wanted the town to be named after him and pleased by his devotion, Chakrapani named the city as Bhaskara Kshetra. It is believed that Surya worshiped Chakrathazhwar during Masi Magam and every year Masi Magam festival is celebrated during the day, commemorating the event. The temple car is drawn around the streets of the temple during the day. As per another legend, during the great deluge, the pot of nectar came down swirling. The pot of nectar fell down into different pieces as Shiva shot his arrow at the pot. The nectar is believed to have relieved lives in the planet. As per Sarma Sastrigal, the various places where the nectar spilled are Kumbeswara Temple, Sarangapani Temple, Chakrapani Temple, Nageswaran Temple, Someswaran Temple, Abhimukeswarar Temple, Kasi Viswanathar Temple, Kumbakonam, Kambatta Viswanathar, Gauthameswarar Temple, Banapuriswarar Temple, Varaha Perumal temple, Lakshminarayana and Varadaraja. History The temple is one of the prominent Vishnu temples in Kumbakonam. In 1620, when Govinda Dikshitar, divan-administrator for the Nayaks, constructed the Ramaswamy Temple, Kumbakonam, he added a commercial corridor between the new temple and the older Chakrapani temple.Diaspora of the gods: modern Hindu temples in an urban middle-class world .P.246. Joanne Punzo Waghorne Architecture The temple has granite walls enclosing all the shrines and pierced by a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is noted for its exquisite pillars. The presiding deity, Chakrapani is sported with eight arms, each having a weapon and is housed in the central shrine in an elevated structure. Chakrapani is sported with a third eye on his forehead. The Eastern and Western entrances of this temple are known as \\"Thatchinaya Vayil\\" and \\"Utharavana Vayil\\" respectively and outer Prakara of this temple is made in the form of balcony. There is a bronze image of king Serfoji II worshipping the lord as he is said to have been cured an illness by the grace of this God. A panchamukha (five-faced) Hanuman is erected in the prakaram (outer precincts of the temple).Tourist Guide to Tamil Nadu. P.70 Agampara Vinayakar, Panchamuga Aancheneyar and Vijayavalli are the important idols located in this temple. Festivals and religious practices Chakra Padithurai is a famous ghat in Kumbakonam parallel to the shrine of the temple situated across the river Cauvery. Neivethanam (sacred offering) performed every day for the deity is dependent on the smoke emanating from the burning of corpses from the ghat. It is pertinent to an ideology that God performs the chakra (cycle) of life and death. The important and peculiar point about this temple is that Vilva (Bilwa) archana which is normally performed in Shiva temples is also performed here for the Perumal. Five Vishnu temples are connected with Mahamaham festival which happens once in 12 years in Kumbakonam.Mahamaham Festival 2004 (in Tamil), Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, 2004 They are: *Sarangapani Temple, *Chakrapani Temple, *Ramaswamy Temple, *Rajagopalaswamy Temple, and *Varahaperumal Temple.

The massif can be accessed though numerous open valleys which separate the massif's peaks: * From Annecy via the Bluffy col (631 m) or via the recently widened Dingy-Saint-Clair pass, both of which lead to Th√¥nes, * From Bonneville via the Borne gorge which leads to Saint-Jean-de-Sixt, * From the east (Meg√®ve) via the Aravis col (1486 m, with a view of Mont Blanc) which leads to La Clusaz, * From Cluses to the north-east via the col de la Colombi√®re, closed in winter, which leads to Le Grand-Bornand, * From the south (Faverges, Ugine) via the Marais col (843 m) which leads to Th√¥nes. Two important rivers traverse the massif: * The Fier from Mont Charvin in the Aravis at Annecy passing by Th√¥nes, the crossroads of the valleys, * The Borne de la Pointe-Perc√©e at Bonneville which flows into the Arve, passing by le Grand-Bornand and le Petit-Bornand. = Summits = View from the south of the west side of the massif. Main summits of the massif, outside those from the Aravis range: * Pointe Blanche, 2438m, highest point in the Massif, part of the Bargy range * Pic de Jallouvre, 2408m part of the Bargy range * Pointe du midi, 2364m Bargy range * La Tournette, 2351m good view from Annecy lake * Grand Bargy, 2301m * Pointe de Balafrasse, 2296m * Pointe Dz√©rat (or pointe Est du Midi), 2278m * Pointe d'Almet, 2232m * Pointe de la Grande Combe, 2210m * Petit Bargy, 2098m * le Buclon, 2072m * la Cime de F√©vrier, 2056m * Mount Lachat de Ch√¢tillon, 2050m (below le Grand-Bornand) * l'Aiguille verte, 2045m * Pointe de la Beccaz, 2041m * le Cr√™t des Mouches, 2033m * Mont Lachat, 2023m (north Th√¥nes) * Pointe de Deux Heures, 2018m * Pointe de Banc Fleuri, 2009m * la Montagne de Sous-Dine, 2004m * Pointe d'Andey, 1877m On the trail between Mount Veyrier et Mount Baron Summits visible from Annecy (and the massif de la Tournette): * T√™te du Parmelan, 1832m * Dents de Lanfon, 1824m * Mount Veyrier, 1291m * Mount Baron, 1254m (in the Veyrier mountains) As well as its peaks, it has plateaus which are slightly elevated but difficult to access, such as the plateau des Gli√®res tragically famous from the time of the Second World War.  Geology  As with all the prealpine massifs, the Aravis chain is primarily formed of limestone and its derivatives.  Activities  = Tourist station = The massif benefits from exceptional snow considering its moderate altitude. It hosts two stations for the winter sports Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing, with pistes from 900m up to 2000m: * Le Grand- Bornand (Chinaillon) * Le Mont-Saxonnex (pronounced \\"saxxonay\\") * Saint-Jean- de-Sixt Tourist activities are also very popular in summer. The stations are first and foremost mountain villages where there remains significant farming activity. The Gli√®res Plateau is likewise a well-known site for cross-country skiing. = Economy = The massif is the source of reblochon, the famous cheese. Reblochon was first made in Le Grand-Bornand, and is now produced in large quantities using traditional methods in the massif's valleys. Two important markets are held weekly at Th√¥nes and at Le Grand-Bornand. There is also a notable wood industry.

Meltzer, American Artist Robert Hiram Meltzer (1921‚Äì1987) was an American painter and instructor, best known for versatility in the field of watercolors. Early life Robert H. Meltzer was a native of New York, born in New Rochelle, New York on October 18, 1921.[Who's Who In The West, p. 534, 19th Edition (1984),Publisher: Marquis] He began his career in 1932 by apprenticing himself to New York-based illustrators including Hunter Barker, Edward Joseph Dreany, and Charles Ross Kinghan in their studios on Division Street in New Rochelle, NY.[American Artist, January 1981, The Watercolor Page Robert Hiram Meltzer, pp. 54-57; 96-97][Who's Who in American Art (1980 Edition), Publisher: R.R. Bowker, New York] Military service  After volunteering for military service in the U.S. Navy in 1938, Meltzer served in the Pacific Theatre during World War II on various submarines including the Salmon-Class Snapper and Sargo-Class Seadragon. Following World War II, Meltzer was recalled to active duty in the Navy as a combat artist during the Korean Action.[Dictionary of International Biography, p. 553 (1980 Edition), Publisher: Melrose Press Limited] Education and influences Meltzer received a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree from Southern Methodist University (SMU), and a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from University of Hawaii. He also attended the Art Students League of New York and the Jean Morgan School of Art. At the latter, he learned sketching and composition from newspaper and battlefield sketch artist Wallace Morgan. Meltzer also attended the School for Art Studies, where he learned techniques from artists Robert Benney and Sol Wilson. One of the greatest influences in Meltzer's artistic development was muralist-lithographer-painter-art historian Dr. Louis Henri Jean Charlot. Charlot was a master teacher at the University of Hawaii when Meltzer was completing his MFA. Meltzer was impressed by Charlot's emphasis on scholarship, which led to Meltzer's artistic focus on Native American, American Southwest, and rural California landscape subjects. Sports Meltzer was a member of SMU's championship football squads in 1947 and 1948. He was the 1958 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Heavyweight Weightlifting Champion for the then-territory of Hawaii. Meltzer learned weightlifting from both Olympian gold and silver-medal holder and Mr. World and Mr. Universe title-holder Tommy Kono and Dr. Peter T. George, captain of the 1952 (Helsinki) and 1956 (Melbourne) U.S. Olympic Weightlifting teams. Meltzer painted portraits of both Kono and George. The George portrait, which depicted Dr. George in his Olympic jacket and tie, was destroyed in a fire. During his weightlifting period in Hawaii, Meltzer served as a volunteer lifeguard at Ala Moana Beach in Honolulu. Career Meltzer moved from Hawaii to California in 1959. In 1967, Meltzer was elected to the American Watercolor Society. From the mid-1970s until his death in 1987, Meltzer was an important influence in bringing professional watercolor instruction to students throughout the United States. Through Crafton Hills College in Yucaipa, California, Meltzer ran a series of watercolor seminars which included as instructors Phil Dike (1906‚Äì1990), Dong Kingman (1911‚Äì2000), Millard Owen Sheets (1907‚Äì1989), Robert E. Wood (1926‚Äì1999), and other noted American watercolorists. Meltzer's works are included in the collections of the Edward-Dean Museum in Cherry Valley, California; San Bernardino City Hall, San Bernardino, California; and the United States Naval Archives, Washington, D.C. Meltzer's work is also part of the Smithsonian Museum's collection of wooden Easter Eggs commissioned by the White House in 1981.[The San Bernardino Sun, Sunday, April 12, 1981, He was egged on by the White House, John Weeks, Sun Staff Writer with photographs by Record-Gazette photographer Paul Kramer] Meltzer received a telegram informing him that he was among 70 American artists, including Andy Warhol and ‚ÄúPeanuts‚Äù cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, invited to ‚Äúpaint or decorate wooden egg replicas‚Äù for an Easter display at the White House.

A port to the Commodore 64 followed in 1983. The game was re-released by Atari Corporation on cartridge in the style of the Atari XEGS in 1987. The player controls the wizard Illuminar who attempts to grow an army of trees to attack Tetragorn the Necromancer and his evil minions who are attempting to take over a graveyard. The game is divided into three sections with unique gameplay, and the player's success in each affects the one that follows it. Gameplay The first stage, the forest, in the Atari 8-bit original Necromancer consists of three sections, as in a three-act play. In the first, Illuminar stands fixed in the middle of the screen. Moving the joystick controls his \\"wisp\\", a magical boomerang-like device. Pressing the fire button plants a seed that will slowly grow into a tree in several stages to adulthood. Ogres appear from both sides of the screen, walking across it horizontally. If they walk over an immature tree, the tree shrinks back one stage of growth, eventually disappearing. Spiders periodically appear and move randomly about the screen. If they move over a fully grown tree it becomes poisoned, and will eventually die. Both enemies can be vanquished by touching them with the wisp, which will also cure poisoned trees. Eye-Pods containing additional seeds periodically appear and can be picked up with the wisp. The speed of the action increases continually through the level until it becomes quite hectic at the end. Every tree that survives the first level becomes Illuminar's ally in the second. Here the player enters a five-level side-view map of a crypt filled with spider eggs. Using the wisp, the player selects trees and moves them over the coffins where their roots grow into the roof of the coffins and eventually break through to crush the eggs lying below. If they take too long, the spider will hatch and attack the trees until the wisp kills them. Periodically the Hands of Fate descend from the roof, picking up anything below them and sometimes dropping prizes. The player must move through the crypt while all of this takes place, capturing question-mark prizes in order to extend ladders needed to reach lower levels. On this level, moving the joystick normally moves Illuminar, but holding down the fire button freezes him in place and moves the wisp instead. The final confrontation between Illuminar and Tetragorn takes place in a graveyard. Gravestones appear that must be destroyed by walking over them in order to prevent Tetragorn from appearing. When he does - and there are always enough gravestones to ensure this - he shoots off trails of fire that injure Illuminar as he moves about. Any spider eggs that were not destroyed in the crypt also turn into spiders that attack Illuminar. The wisp can be used to banish either enemy, although while it is in use, Illuminar remains fixed in place. Each hit by any enemy on Illuminar reduces his power and eventually kills him, although the periodic appearance of small rings of power will improve his life power again. Reception Hosea Battles Jr reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"This is definitely one of the best games in the Synapse line for the Atari. Even the best arcader will have a difficult time defeating the wizard and reaching level five of Act Three.\\" Necromancer was noted for its oddball concepts and frenetic gameplay.Dick Brudzynski, \\"An Impromptu review of Bill Williams' Necromancer\\", CompuServe Atari SIG A Creative Computing review claimed it \\"is one of the strangest, yet most imaginative, games I have ever played on the Atari computer\\", and \\"Necromancer is well conceived and beautifully implemented.

Born in Kristiania (now Oslo), he established Norway's first correspondence school and his own publishing house. He started new paths in Norwegian publishing business, and published Leo Tolstoy's collected works in twelve volumes. Mortensen also founded new magazines and periodicals, some of which were censored by German occupants during the Second World War. Early and personal life His father was gardener Carl Gustav Mortensen (1850‚Äì1899) and his mother Anna Kristine Solberg (1855‚Äì1930). He grew up in Kristiania and took secondary school exam in 1903 and final exam at Treider College in 1905. He married Anne Marie Damn√¶s (1886‚Äì1960) at an unknown point, with whom he had the son Finn Mortensen (1922‚Äì1983). Career In 1906, he started working at √òrebladet, and, in the following year, for the youth magazine Ekko. After having spent half a year in the United States, Mortensen established Mortensen Norsk Korrespondanseskole (NKS), Norway's first correspondence school. In the first year, NKS had 125 pupils; 15 years later it had 9,000 and during the Second World War it had more than 50,000. In 1928, Mortensen established the publishing house Nasjonalforlaget, where he was director until 1934. He also established the publisher Ernst G. Mortensens forlag and a few magazines which sold well. All of his enterprises were merged into Ernst G. Mortensen & Co A/S in 1958. His publishing house Nasjonalforlaget published inexpensive book series; a novel could cost only with leathered cover. It published many foreign-language book series that had not been translated into Norwegian before, amongst them Tolstoy's collected works in twelve volumes. Apart from novel series, Nasjonalforlaget also published boys' novels, crime literature, classics and encyclopaedias. In 1933, Mortensen started Norsk Ukeblad, but had to sell it along with Nasjonalforlaget one year later. He also had to promise to not start a new publishing house within the next seven years. Magnus Andresen, who acquired Norsk Ukeblad, experienced economic loss with the acquisition, and sold it back half a year later. In 1938, Mortensen founded the Damebladet (\\"Women's Magazine\\"). It and Norsk Ukeblad sold well, with Norsk Ukeblad being the largest magazine in the country with its 100,000 sold issues in 1940. However, the German occupants in Norway during the Second World War censored it in 1943. After the war, Ernst G. Mortensens Forlag became Norway's leading magazine publisher, with Vi Menn (started in 1951) and Det Nye (started in 1957) as its frontline magazines. In 1958, Carl L. Mortensen became managing director of the publishing house, whilst Ernst G. Mortensen continued as chairman until 1965. Mortensen was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1939. He died in October 1966 in Oslo, at age 79.

Concept On March 29, 2011, Phil Lesh posted a statement on the Furthur.net site community message board that he was planning to open a new live music venue in Marin County, north of San Francisco, in the near future. Said Lesh, \\"We're taking the first steps to make a long time dream - a permanent musical home - come true. We are purchasing a building in Marin, and plan on remodeling it to feel like an old barn; we're calling it Terrapin Landing. We will continue with Furthur while making music at Terrapin Landing when we are at home. The music will be varied, featuring: Phil Lesh & Friends (continuing the tradition of revolving lineups, including old as well as new friends); West Coast Rambles, based on (and blessed by) Levon Helm's historic Rambles; Album night - we pick a favorite album or two to play live; Telstar night - we put together a band for free form improvisation; Sing-alongs to monthly Sunday morning gospel music; Trivia nights; Monthly big band night; Seminars with local musicians and artists; Our goal is to create a vibrant community gathering place: beautiful, comfortable, welcoming - for members of the community to commingle and enjoy good music\\". Fairfax proposal In April 2011, Lesh disclosed more details about \\"Terrapin Landing\\", originally planned as a remodel of The Good Earth natural food store in Fairfax, California, which would then be used to host a variety of musical fare. However, in July, 2011, this initial plan was changed from utilizing The Good Earth property to the construction of a brand new structure in the adjacent lot formerly occupied by a gas station and car repair shop. On August 1 (Jerry Garcia's birthday), formal plans for what is now being called \\"Terrapin Crossroads\\" were submitted to the Fairfax Town Council for approval. The building was designed as a three floor, 16500 square foot structure (8250 square foot footprint), that would accommodate about 500 people, and which would host between 50 and 100 performances per year. If approved, construction would begin in the summer of 2012 and would be completed in the summer of 2013. The project was not without controversy, however, particularly among the local residents of Fairfax, who were concerned about the potential traffic, noise, trash, loitering, vagrancy, crime, and drugs that the venue might bring to the small, quiet town of about 7300 people (as of 2011). A Fairfax town council meeting whose agenda was to include a discussion about the venue, including a proposal for a traffic study, was scheduled for Wednesday, August 17, 2011. However, the Leshes pulled the topic from the agenda after someone anonymously posted signs reading, \\"No Terrapin, Please\\", along Phil's normal morning walking route in his home town of Ross a day or two earlier. The Fairfax Chamber of Commerce hosted a Town Hall meeting on the Terrapin Crossroads project on September 1. Town Manager Michael Rock, Planning Director Jim Moore and Bruce Burman of Jazz Builders, the project manager for the proposed Phil Lesh-backed music venue, made presentations and answered questions. Given the ongoing controversy about siting the venue in Fairfax, the Leshes decided to ponder the situation during the month of September, and announce their ultimate decision sometime in October. On November 8, Bruce Burman released a statement from the Leshes: \\"After careful consideration we have decided not to move forward with Terrapin Crossroads in Fairfax. For all of you that have supported our efforts and helped to define the vision, we are extremely grateful. Phil looks forward to making music and creating a community gathering place sooner rather than later.\\" San Rafael location Terrapin Crossroads sign in San Rafael, California Musicians warming up in the bar at Terrapin Crossroads On January 2, 2012 Lesh announced that Terrapin Crossroads will be located at the current location of the Seafood Peddler in San Rafael.

Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/phil-at-80-phil-lesh-talks-terrapin- crossroads-in-2012/ Relix On February 14, 2012, Phil Lesh and Friends performed a live webcast of a one-set performance at the new Terrapin Crossroads location. The venue had a \\"soft opening\\" on March 8, 2012. The first official concerts at Terrapin Crossroads were a run of 12 shows by Phil Lesh and Friends, from March 17 to April 1, 2012. In addition to the music hall, dubbed \\"The Grate Room\\", Terrapin Crossroads consists of a large bar (site of many free bar shows), a lounge, and large dining room on the first floor. The second story consists of another large lounge/VIP area. Terrapin also has outdoor seating and dining outside alongside the canal and docks for those who boat to the restaurant/venue.

Life  Anna was a daughter of Landgrave Philip I of Hesse (1501‚Äì1567) from his marriage to Christine (1505‚Äì1549), a daughter of Duke George of Saxony. She married on 24 February 1544 with Count Palatine Wolfgang of Zweibr√ºcken (1526‚Äì1569). After the death of her husband, Anna and her brother William and Elector Palatine Louis VI jointly acted as guardians for her children. William was also the executor of Wolfgang's testament. Around 1590, Anna founded the St. Anne's churchyard in Heidelberg. In 1596, a stone monument in her honor was erected in this churchyard. When the churchyard was closed in 1845, the monument was moved to the Bergfriedhof churchyard. Anna died in 1591 and was buried in the Lutheran Church of Meisenheim Castle.

According to traditional histories, he was disloyal to Emperor Zhaozong and manipulated the court scene by conspiring with the eunuchs and the warlords Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). After Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) defeated Wang and forced LI Maozhen into submission, Emperor Zhaozong exiled Cui and later had him executed.  Background  It is not known when Cui Zhaowei was born. His biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang both indicated that he was from the prominent Cui clan of Qinghe,Old Book of Tang, vol. 179.New Book of Tang, vol. 223, part 2. which was descended from the Spring and Autumn period state Qi; and the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang further traced him specifically to the \\"Southern Ancestor\\" branch of the clan, which included officials of Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Later Zhao, Liu Song, Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, and Tang Dynasty.New Book of Tang, vol. 72 According to Cui Zhaowei's biography in the Old Book of Tang, his grandfather Cui Bi (Â¥îÂ∫á) served as a county sheriff, while his father Cui Yan (Â¥îÂ∑ò) served as the governor of Eyue Circuit (ÈÑÇÂ≤≥, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), but the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang do not describe Cui Bi and Cui Yan as having those offices, and Cui Zhaowei's biography in the New Book of Tang omitted references to them altogether. Cui Zhaowei had at least two older brothers, Cui Zhaofu (Â¥îÊò≠Á¨¶) and Cui Zhaoyuan (Â¥îÊò≠Âéü), and at least one younger brother, Cui Zhaoju (Â¥îÊò≠Áü©). Apparently at some point prior to the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, Cui Zhaowei passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´) class. During Emperor Zhaozong's reign, he served (unclear if successively or concurrently) as Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng); imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi); and deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang). In 891, in the aftermaths of an imperial defeat in a campaign against the warlord Li Keyong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), the chancellors Zhang Jun and Kong Wei, who were the main proponents of the campaign, were removed from their offices, and Cui, who was at that time the chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi) and deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang), was made a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), along with Xu Yanruo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.  As chancellor  It was said that, as a chancellor, Cui Zhaowei was treacherous and jealous of others with seniority or ability. He formed alliances with eunuchs and nearby warlords to further enhance his power at the imperial court. He was particularly in close communications with Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit, two warlords who were geographically close to the imperial capital Chang'an. Thus, when Emperor Zhaozong began to plan a campaign against Li and Wang in 893 and put the chancellor Du Rangneng in charge of planning the campaign, it was said that whatever Du said in the morning would be found out by the two warlords in the evening. Later in the year, when Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Xu Yanruo as the military governor of Fengxiang to try to replace Li and commissioned Li Sizhou (ÊùéÂó£Âë®) the Prince of Qin as the commander of an imperial army to try to escort Xu to Fengxiang, Li Maozhen and Wang resisted and defeated Li Sizhou. At Cui's instigation, the two military governors then marched on the capital. Cui, who was jealous of Du, informed them that the campaign was Du's idea, and at their insistence Emperor Zhaozong was forced to order Du to commit suicide and kill the eunuchs Ximen Junsui (Ë•øÈñÄÂêõÈÅÇ), Li Zhoutong (ÊùéÂë®ÊΩº), and Duan Xu (ÊÆµË©°), who were also considered proponents of the campaign.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. It was said that from this point on, Emperor Zhaozong could no longer rule independently of Li Maozhen and Wang, due to the close connection between Cui and the two warlords ‚Äî in particular, if there were any proposals by other chancellors that Cui opposed, Cui would have his clansman Cui Ting (Â¥îÈãå), who served on Wang's staff, inform Wang, and have Wang Chao (ÁéãË∂Ö), who served on Li Maozhen's staff, inform Li Maozhen. The two warlords would then submit petitions opposing the proposals, and if Emperor Zhaozong even hesitated at rescinding the proposals, they would next submit petitions threatening the emperor. Meanwhile, in 893, at Cui's recommendation, his distant relative Cui Yin (a son of the deceased chancellor Cui Shenyou) was made a chancellor as well. Later in 893, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), requested that the directorate of the salt and iron monopolies be relocated to his headquarters at Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û). Cui, citing the fact that Zhu had just recently dealt major defeats to Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and arguing that allowing Zhu Quanzhong to hold the directorate would make him impossible to control, opposed. Emperor Zhaozong agreed and issued an edict declining Zhu Quanzhong's proposal. In 894, Emperor Zhaozong was set to make then-chief imperial scholar Li Xi, from whom he learned writing, a chancellor. As the edict naming Li Xi chancellor was being read, the official Liu Chonglu (ÂäâÂ¥áÈ≠Ø), at Cui's instigation ‚Äî as Cui was fearful that Li Xi would divert power from him as co-chancellor ‚Äî stepped out of his place at the imperial meeting, grabbed the edict, and began to weep, claiming that Li Xi was a wicked man who associated with the eunuch Yang Fugong and Ximen. Emperor Zhaozong, faced with this unprecedented display, was forced to put off naming Li Xi chancellor, and in fact for a time demoted Li Xi to the honorary post of advisor to the Crown Prince. However, in 895, Emperor Zhaozong named Li Xi chancellor anyway. Displeased with this development, Cui had Cui Ting, who had become Wang Xingyu's deputy military governor by this point, inform Wang that Li Xi and fellow chancellor Wei Zhaodu were part of the emperor's faction against him and Li Maozhen. Wang and Li Maozhen therefore repeatedly submitted petitions objecting to Li Xi's chancellorship; Emperor Zhaozong was thereafter forced to remove Li Xi again. That, however, did not placate Li Maozhen and Wang, who were also displeased that Emperor Zhaozong was accepting Li Keyong's proposal to have, after the death of Wang Chongying the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Wang Chongying's nephew Wang Ke (Li Keyong's son-in-law) succeed Wang Chongying, rather than Wang Chongying's son Wang Gong, who was allied with Li Maozhen and Wang Xingyu. They marched on the capital again along with a third ally, Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and they executed Li Xi and Wei over Emperor Zhaozong's protest.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. In reaction to Li Xi's and Wei's deaths, Li Keyong launched an army and headed for Chang'an, preparing to attack Li Maozhen, Wang Xingyu, and Han. Subsequently, a rift developed between Li Maozhen and Wang, as both wanted to take Emperor Zhaozong to his circuit. Emperor Zhaozong, knowing that they wanted to seize him, instead fled into the Qinling Mountains. Cui, as well as the other chancellors Xu and Wang Tuan, followed. Meanwhile, Li Keyong defeated Li Maozhen and Wang Xingyu, and subsequently put Wang's capital Bin Prefecture (ÈÇ†Â∑û) under siege. Wang tried to flee out of the siege, but was killed by his own subordinates in flight. In fear, Li Maozhen and Han outward submitted to the imperial government, and Emperor Zhaozong, who also did not want Li Keyong to grow overly strong, ordered Li Keyong to end his campaign against Li Maozhen. Still, for the time being, Cui had lost his warlord allies, and, after Emperor Zhaozong returned to Chang'an, Cui was stripped of his chancellorship and made You Pushe (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), but no longer chancellor.  Exile and death  Shortly after Cui Zhaowei was stripped of his chancellorship, Emperor Zhaozong further exiled him to be the military advisor to the prefect of Wu Prefecture (Ê¢ßÂ∑û, in modern Wuzhou, Guangxi). On the way to exile, Cui wrote Zhu Quanzhong, hoping that Zhu would intercede on his behalf. Instead, Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict ordering Cui to commit suicide. The eunuch delivering the edict intercepted Cui at Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei, not the same circuit that Wang Xingyu ruled) and had him beheaded.

Sinclair Lewis was secretary for several years. Numerous Adventure contributors were club members, including H. Bedford-Jones, H. D. Couzens, Captain Dingle, J. Allan Dunn, Lejaren Hiller, Arthur D. Howden-Smith, Hapsburg Liebe, Gordon MacCreagh and Talbot Mundy. In April 1962, the Club's Board of Governors named Hoffman President Emeritus and Honorary Life Member.The Adventurers' Golden Jubilee 1964, The Adventurers' Club, Inc., 1965. Concerned about the threat of war, Hoffman set up a committee in 1915 designed to secure pledges from former soldiers whose skills could be used in times of need. The committee was named \\"The American Legion\\". The pledges were sent to Washington, where they were used to create two regiments of aircraft mechanics. After the war, the American Legion adopted the name of Hoffman's organisation; Hoffman stated in 1934 that he was \\"delighted\\" to give up his claim to the name.Ebel, Jonathan H. Faith in the Fight: Religion and the American Soldier in the Great War. Princeton University Press, 2010 (p.231) Hoffman also edited a companion pulp magazine to Adventure, Romance (1919-1920). Romance was aimed at female readers and featured writers from Adventure such as Mundy and Stribling, as well as Joseph Conrad, Georgia Wood Pangborn and Beatrice Grimshaw. However, Romance was not successful and was cancelled after a year. Writer Lee Server describes Adventure under Hoffman's editorship as \\"inarguably one of the handful of great pulp publications\\" and magazine historian Mike Ashley states in its that under Hoffman: \\"Adventure, along with Blue Book and Argosy, was one of the top three American pulp magazines to which all such authors aspired to contribute.\\"Ashley, Mike. \\"Adventure\\", in Cult Magazines: A to Z edited by Earl Kemp and Luis Ortiz. NonStop Press, 2009. (pp. 9‚Äì12). Later Years After leaving Adventure, Hoffman worked as the editor of McClure's Magazine before retiring to New York. Hoffman wrote some of the first books on creative writing and how to sell such writing commercially, including Fundamentals of Fiction Writing (1922) and The Writing of Fiction (1934).Stevick, Philip, The Theory of the Novel, Free Press, 1967 (p. 116) Reviewing Hoffman's Fundamentals of Fiction Writing, The Bookman magazine stated \\"we believe Mr. Hoffman has touched the deepest note thus far sounded. An excellent book to serve as a postgraduate course in short story writing\\".\\"Recent Books In Brief Review\\", The Bookman, December 1922, (p. 519). Hoffman died in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania.\\"Hoffman, Arthur Sullivant\\" in Who Was Who In America: VI. Maquis, 1968 (p. 195).

Characters  ; :Credits from :Suguru's younger brother. He plays as a forward. As a sixth grader, and after causing an injury on his friend and teammate Hibino by shooting hard the ball with his left foot, he becomes wary of using it which seriously hinders his ability to score and particularly his confidence, to the point that he seems to be unable to score. As a consequence, he starts to play less and less often and starts working more as assistant manager, to the exasperation of his brother, ace Suguru. Nonetheless, he keeps practicing soccer secretly in the park every night. :Things began to change as his childhood friend and old crush, Mishima Nana, returns to Japan one day and becomes the team's manager. Further, a mysterious masked man appears one night at the park and challenges him to play, which they keep doing every night. This motivates Kakeru to try again at the team, and in a practice match he is the only forward to be able to keep up with Suguru‚Äôs sudden and strong passes, but he fails to score because of his fear of using his left leg. Feeling disappointed he tells his brother he‚Äôll give up on soccer just minutes before they‚Äôre both hit by a truck.

It is hinted in the manga that Suguru might have somehow predicted his own death, as he started having regular nightmares, which ended the day of his death. After hearing his brother's decision to give up on soccer, he's about to tell him about the great dream he had that morning, when both of them are run by a truck whose driver fell asleep. Suguru had the worse part, and it was soon obvious that he was beyond help. Knowing this and also that Kakeru would need a heart transplant to survive, the doctors and the family decide to have his heart transplanted to Kakeru, who accordingly dreams that Suguru is giving him a final pass.

An English translation published by the University of California Press was translated by Chen Shih-hsiang and Harold Acton, K.B.E. with Cyril Birch collaborating. Background In the early Qing dynasty, the rise and fall of the dynasty touched many poets and playwrights, especially intellectuals, which pushed them into thinking of the historical lessons taught by the downfall of the Ming.. These writers, including Kong Shangren, expressed hatred and regret at its collapse through their works and a sense of historical responsibility. Kong said he wanted to make clear what had made the decay happen.Kong Shangren Â≠îÂ∞ö‰ªª, \\"Short introduction\\" (Â∞èÂºï) to the Peach Blossom Fan: \\"Áü•‰∏âÁôæÂπ¥‰πãÂü∫Ê•≠,Èö≥Êñº‰Ωï‰∫∫,ÊïóÊñº‰Ωï‰∫ã,Ê∂àÊñº‰ΩïÂπ¥,Ê≠áÊñº‰ΩïÂú∞„ÄÇ\\" Kong heard stories about the period of Hong Guang (C: Âºò ÂÖâ) from his cousin Kong Fangxun (Â≠îÊñπË®ì), whose tale of Li Xiangjun inspired him into creating a script.ÊçÆ„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±ÊâáÊú¨Êú´„ÄãËÆ∞ËΩΩÔºö‚ÄúÁã¨È¶ôÂß¨Èù¢Ë°ÄÊ∫ÖÊâáÔºåÊù®ÂèãÈæô‰ª•ÁîªÁ¨îÁÇπ‰πã‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ËôΩ‰∏çËßÅËØ∏Âà´Á±çÔºåÂÖ∂‰∫ãÂèòÊñ∞Â•áÂèØ‰º†Ôºå„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±Êâá„Äã‰∏ÄÂâßÊÑüÊ≠§ËÄå‰Ωú‰πü„ÄÇ‚Äù But at that time, it was only a draft because Kong wanted to collect historical details.„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±ÊâáÊú¨Êú´„ÄãÔºö‚ÄúÊØèÊãü‰ΩúÊ≠§‰º†Â•áÔºåÊÅêÈóªËßÅÊú™ÂπøÔºåÊúâ‰πñ‰ø°Âè≤ËÄÖÔºåÂØùÊ≠å‰πã‰ΩôÔºå‰ªÖÁîªÂÖ∂ËΩÆÂªìÔºåÂÆûÊú™È•∞ÂÖ∂ËóªÈáá‰πü„ÄÇ‚Äù So during his three- year stay in the south, where the story took place, Kong got acquainted with Ming loyalists like Mao Xiang (ÂÜíË•Ñ), Deng Hanyi (ÈÑßÊº¢ÂÑÄ), Xu Shuxue (Ë®±Êº±Èõ™), Zong Yuanding (ÂÆóÂÖÉÈºé), She Chacun (Á§æËå∂Êùë) and masters of art like Shitao, Gong Xian, and Cha Shibiao (Êü•Â£´Ê®ô). He also visited historical sites such as Plum Blossom Mountain (Ê¢ÖËä±Â≤≠), Qin Huai River (Áß¶Ê∑ÆÊ≤≥), Swallow Rock (ÁáïÂ≠êÁ£Ø), Imperial Palace, and the Mausoleum of the Ming Emperor (ÊòéÂ≠ùÈôµ).. Composition The play was conceived as a two-part play, as stated in the notes of Liang Qichao.Wang, C. H., p. 10. The play has over 40 total scenes. Birch wrote that this length is \\"not unduly long\\" for a southern-style (Yangtze Valley) Chinese play, citing the 55-scene length of Peony Pavilion.Birch, p. xiv. The main portion of the play includes exactly 40 scenes. The \\"Enquiry\\" (prelude) section is located in the play's beginning. The first portion of the main play forms part one, the upper (‰∏ä) part. The \\"Inter-calary\\" scene is in between the two parts of the main play. The second portion of the main portion of the play forms part two, the lower (‰∏ã) part. The \\"Additional Scene\\" and then the \\"Sequel\\", the epilogue, are the final portions of the play.Wang, C. H., p. 10. =Plot= In the late Ming dynasty, the reformist Donglin movement reinstituted the \\"Restoration Society\\" (C: Âæ©Á§æ, P: f√πsh√®, W: fu-she) in Nanjing to fight corrupt officials. Hou Fangyu, one of the Society's members, falls in love with courtesan Li Xiangjun beside the Qinhuai River. He sends Li Xiangjun a fan as a gift and becomes engaged to her. An official called Ruan Dacheng, delivers trousseau through celebrity Yang Longyou (T: Ê•äÈæçÂèã, S: Êù®ÈæôÂèã, P: Y√°ng L√≥ngy«íu, W: Yang Lung-yu) for Hou in order not to be isolated from the royal court. Hou is persuaded into accepting it, but Li Xiangjun rejects the gift firmly, which wins Hou Fangyu's respect. Because he lacks military provisions, the commander of Wuchang Zuo Liangyu intends to move his army south to Nanjing, which terrifies the court. Considering Hou Fangyu's father had once been Zuo Liangyu's superior, Nanjing officials send Yang to ask Hou for help as a substitute. Hou Fangyu writes a letter to discourage Zuo from moving, but is slandered by Ruan for betraying the country, forcing him to find shelter with Shi Kefa in Yangzhou. Li Xiangjun and Hou Fangyu are separated. At that time, the political situation runs out of control. News comes that Li Zicheng, the leader of peasant rebellion, had captured the capital Beijing, and that the Chongzhen Emperor had hanged himself. Ruan and Ma Shiying, the local governor of Fengyang (È≥≥ÈôΩÁù£Êí´), crowns the Prince of Fu (Á¶èÁéã) Zhu Yousong as new Emperor and changes the title of the reign into Hongguang ÂºòÂÖâ. They persecute Reformists and indulge the Emperor with lust. Governor of Cao (ÊõπÊí´) Tian Yang (Áî∞‰ª∞) covets Li's beauty and wants to take her as concubine. At the marriage ceremony, Li resists with a suicide attempt. She knocks her head on a pillar, leaving blood spots on the fan which was given by Hou Fangyu. After that, Yang draws a branch of peach blossoms with Li Xiangjun's blood on the fan, and it is sent to Hou Fangyu to show Li Xiangjun's determination. Jin Fu, author of Chinese Theatre, wrote that the fan and poem symbolize the integrity and determination of Li Xiangjun.Fu, Jin, p. 59. The Qing's army continues to go south, threatening the Ming government. However, the internal conflicts among four generals, who are in charge of strategic posts in north of the Yangtze River, are fierce, and Shi Kefa himself could not retrieve the defeat. Meanwhile, the new Emperor never cares about politics, only losing himself in song and dance. Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng send Li into the court as a gift, catering to the Emperor. Li Xiangjun scolds the evil officials to their faces and is beaten cruelly. Hou Fangyu flees to Nanjing during the chaotic war but was caught and sent into prison by Ruan Dacheng. Yangzhou falls and Shi Kefa drowns himself into the river. The new Emperor is captured by the Qing army.. The end of the play features a Taoist ceremony mourning the loss of the Ming dynasty. The remaining protagonists decide to seclude themselves instead of serving in the Qing dynasty. Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun meet each other occasionally at Qixia Mountain. When they are telling their affection, Zhang Yaoxing, a Taoist master, criticized them for the affair, asking \\"How laughable to cling to your amorous desires when the world has been turned upside down?\\"K'ung, p. 296. (or: \\"When there are such tremendous changes, you still indulge in love?\\"). This gives them both a realization. Li Xiangjun thus becomes a nun, while Hou Fangyu follows her step to become a Taoist priest. Cyril Birch, who collaborated on a University of California Press translation of The Peach Blossom Fan, wrote that \\"There can be no happy ending, given the historical authenticity of the action\\". Like other Southern-style plays the play incorporates martial scenes and a love affair central to the plot. Birch wrote that the Hou Fangyu-Fragrant Princess love affair \\"is brilliantly integrated with the more weighty matter of the plot\\" and that the martial scenes \\"perfectly reflect the unhappy progress of the Ming cause and depict in vivid terms the gallant but ultimately futile loyalty or generals like Huang Te-kung and Shih-K'o-fa.\\" Characters Portrait of Li Xiangjun by Cui He, circa 1800‚Äì1850 (Metropolitan Museum of Art) The play involves 30 dramatis personae. The protagonists are historical figures. Like many southern Chinese (Yangtze Valley) plays, there are contrasting character groupings. Hou Fangyu and his friends are in one grouping, while the Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng group forms an opposing grouping. Each role-type may control a set of characters.Birch, p. xv. The \\"painted-face\\" (P: jing, W: ching) role controls Ma Shiying, Liu Liangzuo, Su Kunsheng, and Zhang Yanzhu.Birch, p. xv-xvi. The \\"comic\\" (P: chou, W: ch'ou) role type controls Liu Jingting, Cai Yisuo, Zhen Tuoniang, and several attendants and servants.Birch, p. xvi. Birch wrote that the audience is \\"led to a deep respect for Hou Fang-y√º, Liu Ching-t'ing, and Shih K'o-fa, as in their different ways they follow their doomed ideals.\\" =Character list= (in order of appearance) The Master of Ceremonies of the Imperial Temple in Nanjing.

Yet the quality of life revealed in the play is of extraordinary cultivation and sensibility. There is a great poignancy in this contrast\\". C. H. Wang wrote that the play has an intertwining of the motifs of separation and union of people in love, and the motifs of the decline and ascent of political powers, and that \\"The parallel structure is not contained within a single plot only\\" but rather to the entire work. Creation and conception C. H. Wang, author of \\"The Double Plot of T'ao-hua shan,\\" wrote that the author \\"attempted in this work not only to retell for common theatre- goers a romantic love-story but also to arouse scholars-especially Confucian intellectuals-to consider why and how China so easily lost her strength in the national crises of 1644-45.\\"Wang, C. H., p. 9 The play was written fewer than 50 years after the fall of the Ming dynasty, during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty. Stage performance and adaptations As soon as Kong finished the script of The Peach Blossom Fan, it was lent out and spread quickly among scholars and aristocrats. In the autumn of the year Jimao, even the emperor sent servant to Kong's house, asking in haste for the complete script.„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±ÊâáÊú¨Êú´„ÄãÔºö\\"„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±Êâá„ÄãÊú¨ÊàêÔºåÁéãÂÖ¨ËçêÁªÖÔºåËé´‰∏çÂÄüÈíûÔºåÊó∂ÊúâÁ∫∏Ë¥µ‰πãË™â„ÄÇÂ∑±ÂçØÁßãÂ§ïÔºåÂÜÖ‰æçÁ¥¢„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±Êâá„ÄãÊú¨ÁîöÊÄ•Ôºå‰∫à‰πãÁºÆÊú¨ÔºåËé´Áü•ÊµÅ‰º†‰ΩïÊâÄ„ÄÇ‰πÉ‰∫éÂº†Âπ≥Â∑û‰∏≠‰∏ûÂÆ∂ËßÖÂæó‰∏ÄÊú¨ÔºåÂçàÂ§úËøõ‰πãÁõ¥ÈÇ∏ÔºåÈÅÇÂÖ•ÂÜÖÂ∫ú„ÄÇÂ∑±ÂçØÈô§Â§úÔºåÊùéÊú®Â∫µÊÄªÂÆ™ÔºåÈÅ£‰ΩøÈÄÅÂ≤ÅÈáëÔºåÂç≥Á¥¢„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±Êâá„Äã‰∏∫Âõ¥ÁÇâ‰∏ãÈÖí‰πãÁâ©„ÄÇÂºÄÂ≤ÅÁÅØËäÇÔºåÂ∑≤‰π∞‰ºòÊâÆÊºîÁü£„ÄÇÂÖ∂Áè≠Âêç‚ÄòÈáëÊñó‚ÄôÔºåÂá∫‰πãÊùéÁõ∏ÂõΩÊπòÂåóÂÖàÁîüÂÆÖÔºåÂêçÂô™Êó∂ÊµÅ„ÄÇ\\" In the next year, General Li Muan set up a therical troupe called Jin Dou to perform the play, which gained huge fame immediately.

In 1964, playwright Mei Qian (Ê¢ÖÈò°) and Sun Jing (Â≠´Êï¨), using Ou's endding, put the drama into a movie script, starring famous actress Wang Danfeng and actor Feng Zhe. In 2004, the California Institute for the Arts staged a version directed by Chen Shi-Zheng. The text was written by playwright Edward Mast and songs created by Stephin Merritt. Publication The Peach Blossom Fan was printed during Kong Shangren's lifetime. Several variations in the text appear in subsequent editions of the play. There was 1982 edition edited by Wang Chi-ssu and others, published in Beijing. The play is presented in four juan (ch√ºan) rather than the standard two parts. =Translations= One edition published by the University of California Press was translated into English by Chen Shih-hsiang and Harold Acton, K.B.E. with Cyril Birch collaborating.Acton, p. vii. Birch wrote that the University of California Press translation is \\"complete except for a very few places\\". Portions translated included what Birch described as \\"the contrasting low punning and bawdy badinage,\\" the scholars' formal compliments and greetings, \\"high poetry\\" within the songs, and self-introduction speeches and soliloquies described by Birch as \\"sometimes rather stiff\\".Acton, p. xviii. Acton wrote that he and Chen Shih- hsiang hoped that their translation would be published at some point but that they translated the play \\"for its own sake rather than for publication.\\" Chen Shih-hsiang had been researching early Chinese poetry and Acton had suggested translating The Peach Blossom Fan. Chen Shih-hsiang died in May 1971. At that time there was a manuscript draft with all scenes except for the final seven translated. Cyril Birch, who had worked with Chen Shih-hsiang at the University of California Berkeley, translated the final seven scenes and revised the drafts. As a guide Birch used the People's Literature Press edition published in 1959 in Beijing. He used the annotations written by Wang Chi-ssu (C: ÁéãÂ≠£ÊÄù, P: W√°ng J√¨sƒ´, W: Wang Chi-ssu) and Su Huan-chung. Due to the usage of allusions common in plays in the Ming and Qing Dynasties the University of California translation uses footnotes for what Birch described as \\"many\\" of these allusions. Birch wrote \\"many more have been sacrificed to the interests of readability\\". Birch wrote that in the final scenes, if the closest translation \\"would have impossibly retarded the movement of the verse\\" Birch used paraphrasing to follow on the actions of Chen Shih-hsiang and Acton. Birch cited Scene 32 as an example of a place where the translation was abridged. There the Master of Ceremonies' speech's strings of instructions indicating commands such as \\"Kneel! Rise! Kneel!\\" were omitted. Birch wrote that \\"These commands, in performance, would punctuate an elaborate posturing dance, but they make for boring reading.\\"Acton, p. xvii-xviii. Reception Liang Qichao (1873-1929) wrote that this play was \\"a book of utmost desolation, poignant splendor, and utmost turmoil.\\"‚Äú‰∏ÄÈÉ®ÊûÅÂáÑÊÉ®„ÄÅÊûÅÂìÄËâ≥„ÄÅÊûÅÂøô‰π±ÁöÑ‰π¶„ÄÇ‚Äù He further wrote: \\"With the refined strictness of its structure, the magnificence of its style, and the depth of its sentiments, I would venture that Kong Shangren's Peach Blossom Fan surpasses the works of all epochs!\\"‚ÄúÁªìÊûÑ‰πãÁ≤æ‰∏•ÔºåÊñáËóª‰πãÂ£Æ‰∏ΩÔºåÂØÑÊâò‰πãÈÅ•Ê∑±ËÆ∫‰πãÔºåÁ™ÉË∞ìÂ≠î‰∫ë‰∫≠‰πã„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±Êâá„ÄãÂÜ†ÁªùÂçÉÂè§Áü£ÔºÅ‚Äù Scholar Wang Guowei (1877-1927), who held the play in great esteem, compared it to the novel Dream of the Red Chamber.ÁéãÂõΩÁª¥Ôºå„ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶ËØÑËÆ∫„ÄãÔºö‚ÄúÂêæÂõΩ‰πãÊñáÂ≠¶‰∏≠ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÖ∑ÊúâÂéå‰∏ñËß£ËÑ±‰πãÁ≤æÁ•ûËÄÖÔºå‰ªÖ„ÄäÊ°ÉËä±Êâá„Äã‰∏é„ÄäÁ∫¢Ê•ºÊ¢¶„ÄãËÄ≥„ÄÇ‚Äù Harold Acton, who co-wrote an English translation, stated that The Peach Blossom Fan is a \\"highly poetic chronicle play\\" that is \\"a vivid evocation of the downfall of the Ming dynasty\\" that \\"deserves to be better known to students of Chinese literature and history.\\" Dylan Suher of the literary magazine Asymptote described The Peach Blossom Fan as \\"The greatest masterpiece of the literature of political disappointment\\", and the play contains \\"some of the most elegant Chinese ever written‚Äîa density of poetic expression that rivals Shakespeare's.\\" Several modern adaptations of the play has also received acclaim.

The Gli√®res Plateau is a limestone plateau in the Bornes Massif. Distant from La Roche- sur-Foron and Thorens-Gli√®res by 29 km and 15 km respectively, it is located around the communes of Le Petit-Bornand-les-Gli√®res and Thorens-Gli√®res. Etymology In the Francoproven√ßal language, gli√®re means a rocky and sandy plateau without rivers. In the local speech, the word is found only in the singular. Following the events of March 1944, the journalist D√©pollier spoke of Gli√®re, in the singular. It was only after the Second World War that the name took on the majestic plural. Although some Savoyards still refer to the plateau as \\"Gli√®res\\", the majority now call it \\"les Gli√®res\\". Geography The plateau, located between the Auges mountains (1800m) and the Fr√™tes, is in reality a valley. Its mean altitude is 1450m and it is bounded by cliffs of Urgonian limestone. In fact the plateau has several levels. Places include the Lanches wood, the Auges chalets, the Mouilles chalet, the l'Ovine chalet, the Notre-Dame des Neiges chapel, the Gli√®res col, the col de l'Ovine, the maison du plateau, Paccot parking, the pas du Loup, the plaine de Dran, the plan du Loup, and the pointe de Puvat. History Commemoration, following a visit by Nicolas Sarkozy The Gli√®res Plateau was an important site of the French Resistance during the Second World War, its mountainous territory giving rise to a Maquis group of resistance fighters which was organized and led by lieutenant Tom Morel, Compagnon de la Lib√©ration. The plateau was chosen in January 1944 to accept British parachute drops of arms to supply the local resistance, then as a base of operations against the German rear to take place at the moment when the awaited landings by the allies would occur. The plateau was cut off, poorly accessible by road (and therefore by the enemy) but identifiable by allied aircraft through its proximity to Lake Annecy. The \\"battle of Gli√®res\\" (March 1944) left 121 dead from the maquisards against almost 5000 soldiers from the Wehrmacht and the Vichy milice. Although the British managed to carry out three parachute drops onto the plateau (of which a large one on the 10 March may have brought some 45 tonnes of weapons), the reinforcements promised by Captain \\"Cantinier\\" (Jean Rosenthal), the Free French envoy, never arrived. In 1973, the national monument of the Resistance, created by the sculptor √âmile Gilioli, was constructed in memory of the dead of the Resistance on a field offered for this purpose by Jean-Fran√ßois de Roussy de Sales. The monument was inaugurated on 2 September 1973 by Andr√© Malraux. The sculpture showed the sun held by a hand. In 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy made a stop there on the eve of the 2007 French Presidential Election, and declared that he would return each year after he was elected. This visit was followed by a demonstration of 3000 people on 13 May 2007. On 17 March 2008, Sarkozy would return for the first time, to commemorate the resistance. The media influence of this \\"pilgrimage\\" recalled similar high-profile visits by former President Fran√ßois Mitterrand to the Roche de Solutr√©. On 17 May 2009, on the instigation of the CRHA (Citoyens R√©sistants d'Hier et d'Aujourd'hui), a rally was organized on the Gli√®res plateau to commemorate the republic's values of solidarity, fraternity, living together and of justice as expressed in the 15 March 1944 manifesto of the Conseil national de la R√©sistance.Appel √† un rassemblement citoyen par le CRHA St√©phane Hessel, godfather of the association, former resistance fighter and follower of the communist party Raymond Aubrac, former communist resistance fighter Walter Bassan, Colomiers schoolteacher Alain Refalo, and head of general psychiatry in the 8th sector in Essonne and psychoanalyst Dr. Micha√´l Guyader held a discussion on the need to continue the fight of the Resistance and to stand on the pedestal of social advancements which the CNR programme had presented. These demonstrations and discussions became part of the framework of the politics of opposition. Gli√®res Plateau of Algiers An urban area of Algiers, at the time in 1962 the French departement d'Alger, was named the \\"Plateau des Gli√®res\\",AMBIANCE ALGERIENNE, JT NUIT - 24/06/1960 as a result of the presence of the monument to those fallen for France in the two world wars, and particularly in homage to the Savoie maquisards in the Second World War.Description of the Algiers \\"plateau des Gli√®res\\" Tourism Cross-country skiing is today the main activity on the plateau in winter with over 36 km of groomed pistes alternative and skating, as well as now several kilometres of groomed pistes for walking. The plateau is dotted with ancient farms and stables, some of which have been converted into restaurants or g√Ætes. Access is somewhat difficult; two winding roads are in use, neither being closed during winter. A marked itinerary directs walkers around the plateau in summer, with numerous signs telling the visitor about Alpine life at the beginning of the 20th century and about the Battle of Gli√®res, with the monument in honour of the Resistance. Other activities Snowshoeing and cross-country skiing are frequently practiced, and snowkiting is also possible. A luge piste is set up each year for children. Speleological activities are also available, with about 15 caves over 150 metres deep catalogued in les Fr√™tes. The deepest hole currently known on Gli√®res Plateau is the tanne √† Paccot, also called the A2 hole, estimated at 400 metres.

Originally from Portland, Dorset, the family moved during Flew's childhood to Wiltshire and Warwickshire, and then to the suburbs of London. There Flew won a scholarship in 1897 to the independent school Christ's Hospital, followed by a \\"postmastership\\" (scholarship) to Merton College, Oxford, where he read classics and theology. While at Merton, Flew contributed to debates within the university on international affairs.The Oxford Magazine, Vol. 26 (1908), pp. 81 and 133.

Ministry While training for the Wesleyan ministry, Flew taught theology and classics at Handsworth College. He spent five years from 1913 as a circuit minister in Winchmore Hill, North London, during which time he made study visits to Italy and Switzerland and first made close acquaintance with Catholics. He then volunteered as a naval chaplain, although the Armistice had already been signed before he set sail for 18 months in Mesopotamia. He spent a further 18 months at United Theological College, Bangalore, India.

It shows Flew to be one of several Methodist theologians in the mid-20th century to have become critical of the ideas of John Wesley on sinlessness and purity of intention: \\"Flew critiques Wesley's attitude to sin as offering only an inadequate account of moral evil,\\" so that he can \\"posit an over-optimistic instantaneous end to the effects of sin.... The result of these problems is an 'intramundane asceticism', whereby the one assured of sanctification merely endures secular life, allowing a barrier to exist between one's work and worship.\\"George Bailey: Entire sanctification and logical method: a Wesleyan dynamic for discovering good news in every concept. In: New Perspectives for Evangelical Theology. Engaging with God, Scripture and the World (Abingdon: Routledge, 2010), p. 67. For a concise account of Flew's work, see Edgardo Antonio Colon- Emeric: Perfection in Dialogue: An ecumenical encounter between Wesley and Aquinas (D. Phil. dissertation, Department of Religion, Graduate School, Duke University, Durham, NC), pp. 14‚Äì18. In 1927 Flew was appointed Greenhalgh professor of New Testament language and literature at Wesley House, Cambridge, a theological college founded in 1921, of which he was principal from 1937 to 1955. He became a keen contributor to the Cambridge New Testament Seminar, held under the chairmanship up to 1935 of Francis Crawford Burkitt, leaving an account of it in an obituary for Burkett in the Proceedings of the British Academy.His account is quoted at length in Suffering and Martyrdom in the New Testament, ed. William Horbury and Brian McNeill (Cambridge: Cambridge UP), pp. xiii‚Äìxv. He was to remain in Cambridge for the rest of his life. Flew took a prominent part in the 1932 reunion of the Wesleyan Methodists with the United Methodists and the Primitive Methodists as the Methodist Church of Great Britain. On the academic side, one recent scholar concluded, \\"The Idea of Perfection in Christian Theology (1934) was a meticulous piece of scholarship on a theme dear to Methodist hearts, though it was as an ecclesiologist that Flew would exert widest influence on Protestant thought\\"D. Densil Morgan: Barth Reception in Britain (London/New York: T&T; Clark International, 2010), p. 94. This refers to his book Jesus and his Church (1938), based on a lecture delivered to the Methodist Conference in that year, which stated concisely the premise: \\"The Church is old in the sense that it is a continuation of the life of Israel, the People of God. It is new in the sense that it is founded on the revelation made through Jesus Christ of God's final purpose for mankind.\\"Quoted in James E. Tull: The Atoning Gospel (Macon, GA: Mercer UP), p. 183. Particularly relevant at the time was the incisive contribution it made to the then current debate on episcopacy, by showing \\"the early [Christian] communities to have been independent and unstructured.\\"James Tunstead Burtchaell: From Synagogue to Church. Public services and offices in the earliest Christian communities (Cambridge etc.: Cambridge UP, 2004 [1992]), p. 122. Flew's reputation as a scholar and churchman extended far beyond the faculty of divinity in Cambridge. He was elected moderator of the Free Church Federal Council for 1945‚Äì1946 and president of the Methodist Conference in 1946‚Äì1947. He gave strong support to the ecumenical Church of South India. In relation to Anglicanism, he co-edited with Rupert E. Davies a report entitled The Catholicity of Protestantism (1950). Having attended several pre-war preparatory conferences, he was appointed vice-chairman of the provisional committee of the World Council of Churches after the war and took a leading part in its inaugural meeting in Amsterdam in 1948. For a further meeting of the World Council of Churches at Lund in 1952, he edited a volume, The Nature of the Church (1950). In retirement he edited the London Quarterly and Holborn Review and worked on a further book, Jesus and His Way, which was published posthumously in 1963. He gave support to the beginnings of Anglican‚ÄìMethodist dialogue at the Methodist conference in 1955. Flew died in Cambridge on 10 September 1962.

Director Falk Harnack, whose own brother Arvid was executed by the Nazi regime and who in December 1943 escaped from the 999th Penal Battalion to fight with the Greek Resistance, decided to film Staudte's work in 1950.Ingrid Poss.

Bertz Fischer (2003), p. 159. and received positive reviews. The East German political establishment and the Soviet representatives in the country disapproved of the film, which they viewed as promoting sympathy to the perpetrators of Nazi atrocities. The SED politburo denounced it, proclaiming that \\"it did not present the proletariat resistance as heroes, but rather, their executioners.\\" The film was banned after less than a month, although Zweig himself, who wielded considerable influence as the President of the GDR's Academy of Arts, resisted the move.Matthias Braun. Kulturinsel und Machtinstrument: Die Akademie der Kunste, die Partei und die Staatssicherheit, p. 53. Bertolt Brecht offered to write an alternate version, but was rejected. The Axe of Wandsbek was DEFA's first film to be banned.Stephen Brockmann. A Critical History of German Film. Camden House (2010), p. 221. This happened soon after the government established the DEFA commission to regulate the studio and provide political control.Dagmar Schittly. Zwischen Regie und Regime.
