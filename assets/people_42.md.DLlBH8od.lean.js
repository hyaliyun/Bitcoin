The incident was investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and determined to be the result of an incorrect temperature input into the aircraft's flight computer resulting in underperformance at take-off. The area beyond the runway and the terrain beyond were largely unobstructed, and the aircraft eventually climbed away undamaged. The remainder of the flight to Corfu was uneventful. The \\"serious incident\\" at take-off was realized and reported when airport staff subsequently observed minor ground damage. The investigation report concluded that the crew could not reasonably have been expected to recognize the anomalously low speed sooner or intervene more effectively. The report listed several examples of aircraft underperformance at takeoff, reviewed the history of relevant industry efforts, and recommended that a Takeoff Acceleration Monitoring System and associated certification standards should be developed without further delay. Aircraft The incident aircraft was a Boeing 737-86J(WL) serial number 38124, registration C-FWGH. The aircraft was delivered to Air Berlin in 2011 as registration D-ABMC. The aircraft entered Sunwing Airlines fleet in 2017 following the bankruptcy of Air Berlin. During the time of the incident Thomson Airways had leased the aircraft for the summer season from 29 April until 31 October 2017.  Incident details  The outside air temperature was 16¬∞C, but the operating crew entered incorrect figures (variously -47¬∞C and -52¬∞C) for the airport outside air temperature, into the flight management computer, resulting in miscalculation of the required N, the engine fan speed (low-pressure compressor speed) required on the take-off run. (Both incorrect figures appeared as OATs on the flight plan: -47¬∞C at the first waypoint after top-of-climb, -52¬∞C at top-of-climb. Delays around reporting the incident meant that the Cockpit Voice Recorder information was not available for the investigation.) As the aircraft departed Runway 07, the crew noticed unusually slow acceleration as well as a low climb rate, a fact noted by witnesses on the ground. Shortly after lifting off the runway one of the aircraft's landing gear collided with a supplementary runway approach light. The light was knocked loose from its mounting and crushed while the 737 suffered no damage. Crewmembers were not made aware of the incident until ATC personnel at Belfast airport filed an incident report with the AAIB. Map of Belfast International Airport = Analysis = Usage of inaccurate takeoff data can be fatal, as it can lead to runway overruns and possibly collisions with obstructions. One such close call event happened at Melbourne Airport in 2009 when the pilots of an Emirates flight entered incorrect take off data, leading to a too low thrust setting. This led to the aircraft overrunning the runway for some 150m before taking off, and barely clearing the airport perimeter fence. This incident is a case where checklists and other safeguards have failed the pilots. Once airborne the crew checked the take-off performance data: the N level was 81.5%, far below the required level of 92.7%. Thrust was only increased when the aircraft reached 800 feet, about 4 km after becoming airborne. Neither the installed flight management computer software nor the Electronic flight bags (EFBs) in use helped in detecting the data input error. A recent software release had not yet been installed, and the software omitted the cross-check of the pilot input data against the outside air temperature actually measured. The pilot became aware of the aircraft's underperformance late in the take-off run but did not intervene effectively. The Report explored various human-factors aspects of the incident, concluding that the pilots could not reasonably have been expected to respond more quickly to the developing situation, either before or after becoming airborne. It reviews and lists recent incidents of aircraft underperformance at take-off, reviews industry efforts to provide automatic warning in such situations, and calls for closer regulatory attention to pilots' portable computers ('electronic flight bags').  Relevance to aircraft systems  This incident was included in discussions of proposed new aircraft equipment: *Extended duration Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) * Takeoff Performance Monitoring System (TOPMS) or Takeoff Acceleration Monitoring System (TAMS). A 2019 research paper explores the cause of this serious incident, caused by erroneous data entry. The paper \\"summarises a basic takeoff acceleration monitoring system and the effect this would have had on the July 2017 event\\".

The cliffs, which rise to 150 m at Berriedale, provide ideal nesting conditions for breeding seabirds, and are protected by several overlapping conservation designations: *The East Caithness Cliffs Special Area of Conservation (SAC) covers the cliffs from the southern boundary of Caithness (a point about 4 km north of Helmsdale in Sutherland) to just south of Wick, an area of in total. *The East Caithness Cliffs Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area protects the sea up to 2 km from the SAC, an area of in total. *The East Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area (SPA), which covers , includes both the cliffs of the SAC and the seaward area of the MPA. The area is also protected by six separate Sites of Special Scientific Interest SSSI, which overlap wholly or partly with the other designations: *Castle of Old Wick to Craig Hammel SSSI *Craig Hammel to Sgaps Geo SSSI *Dunbeath to Sgaps Geo SSSI *Berriedale Cliffs SSSI, *Ousdale Burn SSSI *Helmsdale Coast SSSI The cliffs are of particular importance for seabirds, hosting up to 300,000 individuals during the breeding season. This is the most important area on the east coast of Scotland for black guillemot, with over 1,500 individuals breeding here each year. There are also important populations of common guillemot, razorbill, herring gull, black-legged kittiwake, shag, great black-backed gull, cormorant and northern fulmar. The cliffs are also important for the plant species they support. The cliffs provide a range of habitats that are typical of northern Scotland, although lacking the extreme exposure of Cape Wrath or island locations. Species of note found on the East Caithness Cliffs include roseroot and Scots lovage, whilst meadowsweet is found in more sheltered areas. There are two small areas of saltmarsh in which can be found saltmarsh rush, and herb species are plentiful in ungrazed grassland and heathland areas on the cliff tops. In the southern parts of the area the climate is more moderate, and scrub has developed in gullies. Here can be found tree species such as willow, juniper, hazel, hawthorn and aspen. The management strategy for the cliffs encourages light grazing of the grass and heathland in order to enables plants to flower and set seed whilst preventing bracken from becoming established. Muirburn is strongly discouraged.

It is served at La M√®re Poulard, her restaurant there, and at many other restaurants on the small island. It has been described as the most famous omelette in the world and, along with the Mont Saint Michel Abbey, is one of the major tourist attractions in Mont-Saint-Michel, the island itself being the second most- visited tourist destination in France after Paris. Those who have eaten it include European and Japanese royalty, United States presidents, British prime ministers, multiple presidents of France, and celebrities from various fields. It is considered the gastronomic emblem of Mont-Saint-Michel.  Creation  The omelette de la m√®re Poulard was created by Annette Boutiaut Poulard, and is a specialty in the Mont-Saint-Michel area of Normandy. In 1873 Poulard and her husband were innkeepers on the island. Because of the changing tides, it was impossible to predict when and how many travellers would arrive, which made planning ahead for service difficult. The omelette was created to solve this problem and was served as an appetizer that could be produced quickly while guests awaited the rest of the meal. The omelette eventually became famous as a gastronomic emblem of the city of Mont-Saint-Michel; a 1932 account described the omelette as being on the menu of all the restaurants in the city.  Preparation  thumb Sources vary on the method of preparation. According to some sources, the yolks and whites are beaten separately, the whites until stiff, and then folded together to form the mixture. According to a contemporary, Poulard told him she \\"took the eggs and beat them as they were.\\" Depending on the source, butter or cr√®me fra√Æche is dropped into a hot long-handled copper pan, the pan is placed into a hot oven until the butter is melted, then the egg mixture is added, and the pan placed over a wood-fired flame to cook. Poulard responded to a request for the recipe with Cookbook writer Felicity Cloake in 2019 gave instructions to whisk whole eggs vigorously for four minutes until \\"almost like a mousse\\", then pour into a hot oiled pan. In an 1897 novel, Stella's Story, the heroine takes a lesson in omelette-making from Poulard, and describes the process as \\"simple in the extreme; [Poulard] broke a dozen eggs into the pan of boiling fat, as fast as she could break them, gave them a shake, and held them over the fire for a minute, shaking them the while; then she took an iron ladle, gave the omelette a couple of folds, and popped it onto a dish.\\"Omelettes cooking on a wood fire at La M√®re Poulard  Serving  The finished omelette is rolled onto a plate and served plain or with a variety of garnishes. It has been described as \\"gently wood-scented\\". In Poulard's time the omelettes were served as part of a meal which was always the same, and included ham, fried sole, saltmarsh lamb cutlets with potatoes, roast chicken, salad, and dessert. Before World War I the meal was priced at 2.50 francs. As of 2017 the omelette was priced at ‚Ç¨34 at La M√®re Poulard, a price described as \\"certainly one of the heftiest tariffs charged for same anywhere in France\\". As of 2018, 450,000 eggs are used each year by the restaurant.  Recognition  150x150px It has been described as the most famous omelette in the world and, along with the Mont Saint Michel Abbey, is one of the major tourist attractions in Mont-Saint- Michel, itself one of the most-visited tourist destinations in the country, second only to Paris. Those who have eaten it include European and Japanese royalty, United States presidents, British prime ministers, presidents of France, and celebrities such as Ernest Hemingway and Yves Saint Laurent. A superstition surrounding the omelette holds that if a French presidential candidate visits Mont-Saint-Michel and does not eat the omelette, the candidate will lose. The story of \\"Omelette tu mangeras, pr√©sident tu seras,\\" roughly \\"If you eat the omelette, you will be president,\\" started with Georges Clemenceau, who visited but did not eat the omelette before his defeat by Paul Deschanel. Charles de Gaulle, Georges Pompidou and Fran√ßois Mitterrand all ate the omelette before their victories; √âdouard Balladur visited Mont-Saint- Michel but due to a late arrival did not eat the omelette and was defeated by Jacques Chirac, who ate the omelette. Nicolas Sarkozy launched his successful 2007 campaign from Mont-Saint-Michel and ate the omelette.

An Isaac Wunder order was made by the court against the husband which states that any legal proceedings against his wife and children will be halted. However, the court did not suspend all legal action from the husband; rather it ruled that further legal action would require a decision by a relevant court.Byrne, R. & Binchy, W. 2015, \\"Isaac Wunder order\\", Annual review of Irish law, pp.429-430 - via Westlaw IE. This decision is significant because the Court established guidelines for when common law principles could be reinterpreted.  Background  = History = The plaintiff (referred to as JMH, the husband) and the defendant (KH, the wife) had three children together and split up in 2001. JMH was suspicious of KH's new partner, and cited concerns over the safety of his children around the partner and his extended family, initiating High Court proceedings on May 22, 2009, having previously been before the Circuit Court eight times and District Court twenty times. On May 11, 2010, MacMenamin J. ruled that the new partner was restrained from entering the former \\"H\\" family home or contacting the children, while JMH and KH were restrained from communicating to the children the circumstances of the case. On April 13, 2011, JMH initiated new proceedings seeking \\"full custody and control of [their] children\\" as well as a further restraining order to the partner to \\"stay away from [JMH] and the children\\". On May 10, 2011, the orders from the judgement of 2010 were discharged and JMH was ordered to refer to the Circuit Court for further legal action pertaining to the case. MacMenamin J. also noted the \\"children have been lost sight of\\" in the case and recommended the \\"parties ... put litigation behind them and get on with the rest of their lives.\\" KH went on to initiate divorce proceedings, which JMH claimed not to be aware of, and married her new partner on May 5, 2015. The marriage ceremony was interrupted by JMH. Bringing the issue to court once again on November 24, 2015, this time in the Supreme Court, JMH complained his concerns for his children laid out in prior cases had come to fruition, but no evidence could be found of this aside from an accidental injury to one of the children. JMH also claimed to ask for an extension to appeal the divorce, though no evidence was found that pointed to that. [2015 IESC 85]  Holding of the Supreme Court  Charleton J. observed that KH merely \\"wished to live an ordinary life free from the continual strain of court appearances\\" and that JMH had \\"abused the processes of the court\\" to the point where the safety of the children was no longer the focus of the proceedings, instead focusing on \\"wrong that [was] more apparent than real\\". Regarding the divorce appeal, Charleton J. stated: > \\"The circumstances under which validly married couple might face a late > appeal claiming that the divorce of one of them was improperly granted are, > perhaps absent fraud on the system by both or one or other of them, > impossible to imagine. No decision is now to be made in that regard.\\" Charleton J. held the appeal was vexatious and restated the order made by MacMenamin J. that JMH should have referred to the Circuit Court, and that in doing so many of the issues surrounding the case would have been avoided.(2015) \\"Judgments: Key cases in brief\\" [online. The Irish Times, 18 December 2015.] JMH's failure to appeal the High Court decision on time was also considered.JMH v KH [2015 IESC 85] (Case Overview) - via LexisNexis. = Decision = An Isaac Wunder order was made by the court, stating all proceedings by JMH relating to KH or the children of their marriage would be stayed. Nevertheless, consideration to JMH's right to litigate was made. Charleton J. stated: > \\"The possibility of a genuine issue arising cannot be totally ruled out. > Furthermore, the right to litigate cannot be left extinguished and without > the possibility of suspending such an order. Consequently, JMH, may by > application grounded on a full affidavit explaining the necessity for any > further litigation apply to the President of the relevant court, or to any > judge nominated by him, for such limited relief as may be proven on that > application to be necessary and not previously litigated. This judgment and > order should be brought to the attention of the judge by JMH. There will be > no need for KH to attend unless she wishes to.\\" The appeal was dismissed.

The court ruled that \\"consent\\" was not undermined where a party to the marriage had concealed misconduct. This case is thus significant for establishing the principles for annulment and clarifying the nature of consent.Annual Review of Irish Law 2006, 20(1), 372-389, *372  Background  The case concerned a request for annulment of marriage. The petitioner claimed that the other party in the marriage had been in another relationship during the engagement, and that this affair continued after the two were married. The petitioner argued that had he known about the affair he would have never consented to the marriage and that this was grounds for annulment because consent requires a person to be \\"free and informed.\\" This petition for a decree of nullity was refused by the High Court. Mr. Justice O'Higgins held that while it had been accepted that the petitioner would not have entered into a marriage with the respondent had he been aware of her affair with another man, the evidence did not consent as to establishing whether his consent to the marriage was not full, free and informed. The petitioner subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.  Holding of the Supreme Court  In dismissing this appeal and the cross-appeal the case of D.B v O'R [1991] 1 I.R 289,D.B v O'R [1991] 1 I.R 289 the Court ruled that these cases illustrate the use of the word \\"informed\\" as not being used in regard to consent, but instead refers to a situation where: > \\"The apparent decision to marry has been caused to such an extent by > external pressure or influence, whether falsely or honestly applied, as to > lose the character of a fully free act of that person's will\\". Due to this context, the Court accepted that the use of \\"informed\\" in other judgements is used in a manner of being informed about the alternatives available to marriage. There was no suggestion that the petitioner should have been informed about either the conduct or character of the respondent prior to the marriage, and that if he was not so informed that the marriage was void.{G. v.

McGuinness. J disagreed.Annual Review of Irish Law [2006] *372 Family Law, 20(1), 372-389 McGuinness held that adultery was a ground for judicial separation but not a ground for annulment. The Court ruled that the definition of informed consent put forward by the petitioner was too broad. It could be used to request annulment in circumstances where any number of things were unknown to a party at the time of the marriage. Annual Review of Irish Law 2009, 23(1), 465-491Annual Review of Irish Law 2006, 20(1), 372-389 The court also ruled that there was a necessity for certainty in marriage, which is enshrined in the Constitution, and an introduction of a ground of nullity which would bring uncertainty to a wide variety of marriages was not only undesirable as a matter of public policy, it was contrary to the clear intention of the Constitution.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and- law/strong-evidence-is-needed-to-support-nullity-petition-1.728415 The Irish Times, Strong evidence is needed to support nullity petition, March 2009 > \\"This, it appears, would apply regardless of whether or not the information > had been deliberately concealed by the respondent.

It addressed whether the decisions of a sport's organizing body should be amenable to judicial review. In deciding that it was, this decision became a useful reminder that it is not only bodies created by statute, which are generally considered to be subject to public law, that are amenable to Judicial Review by the Courts.  Factual background  The Turf club (Respondent) was the Irish regulatory body for horse racing until the end of 2017. It established and enforced the rules of flat racing in Ireland. O‚ÄôConnell (Appellant) was a professional jockey, and his co-appellant (Lambe) was a horse trainer. The Turf Club alleged that O‚ÄôConnell failed to ride a horse called \\"Yachvilli\\" to its maximum ability in Downpatrick (Co Down) in 2011 which was contrary to the Rules of Racing. The Turf club had then carried out an inquiry into an alleged suspicious betting pattern, the allegation being that the horse was prevented from running to its full ability. O'Connell and Anor were respectively interviewed by the respondent who served them with documents detailing their alleged breaches of the Rules of Racing with the possibility of sanctions. O‚ÄôConnell and Lambe then instituted judicial review proceedings in the High Court. O'Connell and Anor did not argue procedural unfairness or the misapplication of the horse racing rules but they challenged the very basis of the rules itself. They alleged that the governing statute, Irish Horse Racing Industry Act 1994 did not set out the principles and policies which outlined the powers of the club as required by Article 15.2.1 of the Irish Constitution. In effect they were seeking a declaration from the courts that the Turf's clubs enforcement of rules of racing were 'ultra vires'. McGovern J, in his ruling had found that since the introduction of the Irish Horse Racing Act in 1994, the Turf club had the statutory duty to enforce the rules within the 32 counties. The High court held that the Turf club did not exercise a delegated legislative function nor did it perform a judicial one. They also found that O'Connell and Lambe had not established any grounds to allow the court to rule in their favor. O'Connell then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court and the Turf Club cross appealed the judgement that its decisions are amenable to judicial review.  Holding of the Supreme Court  Writing on behalf of the majority in the Supreme Court,O'Donnell J, held that the Turf club was amenable to judicial review and proceeded to dismiss the club's cross appeal. His reasoning behind this decision was narrowly expressed and stated that \\"it is clear that in the aftermath of the 1994 Act, the Turf Club as the Racing Regulatory Body is more clearly in the domain of public law than the Institute of Chartered Accountants was in Geoghegan v Institute of Chartered Accountants, and sufficiently within the field of public law and within the public domain, as to have the consequence that judicial review lies\\". The Court had also made reference to the case Hyland v Dundalk Racing [2014] IEHC 60 when reaching their decision stating that \\"given that the Oireachtas has entrusted these functions by statute to those bodies [Racing Regulatory Body] in the public interest, this means that these bodies are, in principle, at least amenable to judicial review‚Äù. The Court also determined that the Horse Racing Industry Act 1994 had not changed the essential legal character of the Turf Club and did not render it a creature of legal statute.The Turf Club's ability to enforce compliance with its rules were grounded on the law of contract.E.G -v- The Society of Actuaries in Ireland [2017] IEHC 392 at 63. The Courts also dismissed the appeal made by O'Connell and Lambe stating that the fundamental premise of which the appellants arguments' was based were false.[2015] IESC 57 at 51.

Child and Family Agency v RD [2014] IESC 47. The case clarified the jurisdiction of Irish courts under Article 20 of the European Union's Council Regulation No 2201/2003 on parental responsibility.  Background  In January 2014, RD and her son, P, moved from Birmingham to Ireland. In February, an order was made by the Birmingham County Court to place P in the care of the Child and Family Agency. A subsequent order by the UK High Court, was made in April, for P to return to England. P was found in Dublin with his father, who authorities believed to be abusive. RD contended that the father had followed them there and she was no longer in a relationship with him. In June 2014, the UK High Court made two orders. The first was a declaration under Article 17 of Regulation 2201/2003Regulation 2201/2003, Art 17. which meant that Ireland did not have jurisdiction to decide matters concerning parental responsibility of P. This declaration was made on the grounds that the courts of England and Wales were first to hold the issue of care and custody of the child. The second order was made pursuant to Article 20 of the Regulation,Regulation 2201/2003, Art 20. and meant that the child would be placed in the care of Birmingham City Council. However, the child would be allowed to finish his school year. RD appealed these orders in the Supreme Court arguing that she had been a victim of domestic violence and wanted to protect her child, who may be at risk of harm if returned to England. RD expressed in a letter that she was appealing against her child's return to England under the care of the Birmingham City Council. She argued that the care order was made in England when she was already living in Ireland and she was therefore, unaware of the order. The Child and Family Agency advised the court that P wished to remain in Ireland with his mother and that he was doing well in care. The court dismissed the appeal against the declaration made by the UK High Court under Article 17. The court adjourned its decision for the appeal against the order pursuant to Article 20.  Holding of the Supreme Court  Justice O'Donnell delivered the only written judgment for the Supreme Court (with which the other judges agreed). = Article 17 = It was decided that the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 17. The consequence of this decision is that, it is for the English and Welsh courts to decide on the care and custody of children whose habitual residence is in England and Wales. = Article 20 = Justice O'Donnell stated that the Irish Supreme Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 20, which is provisional and protective relief. Article 20 provides that Member States may exercise its jurisdiction to grant provisional and protective relief to assist in foreign proceedings. It must appropriate for a court to grant this relief. = Conclusion = The Court dismissed the appeal against the declaration made pursuant to Article 17 and adjourned the court for one week pursuant to Article 20.Child and Family Agency v RD [2014] at par 18.

McD v P.L and B.M [2007 IESC 28], [2008] ILRM 81 is an Irish Supreme Court case the rights of a sperm donor to access a child born through his donation. The Appellant, who was the biological father, questioned whether he could be a guardian of the infant despite never having had a romantic relationship with the first named Respondent who was the mother. The case raised important questions around the Irish legal definition of \\"family.\\" The case is also important because the Supreme Court over-turned a High Court ruling that had relied on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  Facts of the Case  The Respondents in this case were in a same-sex relationship. One became pregnant by way of artificial insemination by a sperm donor, a man who was known to the Respondents. They signed an agreement before the child was born which stated that the child would know who his biological father was and he would view him as a \\"favorite uncle\\". The agreement did not grant the donor guardianship but allowed him to see the child at times that were suitable for both parties. Also it was mentioned that in circumstances where the first named Respondent died, the Appellant could still be in contact with the child and his opinion would be taken in matters concerning the best guardianship arrangements for the child. After the child was born in May 2006, Appellant became increasingly attached to his biological child. He attempted to provide financial assistance with the child's day to day expenses and in others way which was declined by the Respondents. In addition, he lodged money monthly to a trust account that he opened for his child. In September 2006, the Respondents wanted to create a distance with the Appellant and notified him to remain formal with them. After this he met the child twice, once in October and once in November. The Appellant submits that he did maintain a distance from the Respondents after November like they wanted. On hearing that the Respondents intended to move to Australia with the child for a year, from March 2007 till around May 2018, the Appellant brought an action to restrain them from doing so. The first named Respondent was Australian and wanted the infant to meet her family living in Australia. The second named Respondent had gotten a temporary job in Australia for the year and they also rented out their home. In the High Court, the Appellant obtained an interim order and later an interlocutory order. The Respondents appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The Court recognized that the Appellant has a right to apply to the court as section 6 A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 says: \\"(i) Where the father and mother of an infant have not married each other, the Court may on the application of the father, by order appoint him to be guardian of the infant.\\" The Supreme Court ruled that under Irish law the lesbian couple was not a family. Furthermore, the Court stated that the High Court had made a mistake in ruling that they were not a \\"de facto family\\" for the purpose of the law. The court rejected the applicability of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Denham J balanced the convenience between the parties and aimed to take the course involving the \\"least risk of justice\\". It was specified that some cases have special factors and such a special factor in this case was the child. For the same reason, the High Court had taken a child centered approach in its findings, stating that to separate the infant from the biological father with whom he had a relationship would not be in the child's best interests. The Supreme Court agreed with this finding. Additionally, Denham J found that the Applicant had a right under Section 6 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964. This enabled him to apply to the court on this matter and could allow him to become a guardian of the child as he is the biological father of the infant. Fennelly J dissented in this case, stating that the appeal should be allowed. Fennelly described the case as \\"utterly unique and unprecedented.\\" According to Fennelly J, the rights of the biological father in this instance are vastly different to the rights of an unmarried father who has had a committed relationship with the mother of the child. Importance was also attached to the prior agreement which had been made between the Applicant and Respondents. According to Fennelly J, this agreement showed no indication that the Applicant would be the guardian of the child. The High Court had rejected the father's right to access as well as guardianship. The Supreme Court ultimately allowed the Appellant access to the infant but rejected his arguments for guardianship. While keeping the interlocutory order in place, it said that no guardianship of the child would be appointed to the applicant \\"at this time.\\"  See Also  * Interim order * Irish Supreme Court * High Court (Ireland) * Interlocutory order * Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 * Susan Denham * Nial Fennelly  External Links  http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1995/act/26/section/47/enacted/en/html  References  Category:Supreme Court of Ireland cases Category:2007 in Irish law Category:2007 in case law ","title":"J.

The ruling declared that the Supreme Court ‚Äúis no longer a Court for the correction of error but rather a Court which has the principal constitutional task of determining issues of general importance.‚Äù Supreme Court of Ireland, Annual Report 2018  Background  Mr S was charged with the offence of rape alleged to have occurred between 1st of January 1970 and 21st of May 1970. Mr S brought an application before the High Court seeking to prohibit his trial on the grounds of delay. The High Court where McDermott J resided heard and refused the application. Mr S appealed to the Court of Appeal. Sheehan J delivering the majority opinion in the Court of Appeal stated that Mr S had established sufficient prejudice so as to give rise to the risk of an unfair trail. Moreover, Sheehan J concluded that the case before him met the test established in the case of H v DPPH v DPP [2006] IESC 55. the \\"wholly exceptional circumstances category.\\" For those reasons, the appeal was allowed and the trial was prohibited.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The DPP sought leave to appeal the order of prohibition under Article 34 of the Constitution.Irish Constitution Article 34.5.3¬∞. The DPP claimed that the Court of Appeal had departed from the established jurisprudence on delay in the criminal context. In addition, the DPP argued that some of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal based their decision were erroneous. The Court‚Äôs decision offers clear guidance on when a prospective appeal has implications for established principles. In order for the Supreme Court to grant leave, it has to be established that it was either a matter of public importance or \\"that it is otherwise in the interest of justice necessary that there be an appeal to this Court\\".B S v THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS [2017] IESCDET 134 1. The Supreme Court noted that since the enactment of the 33rd Amendment the function of the Supreme Court is no longer an appeal court to remedy errors made by the trial court.B S v THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS para 1. If the High Court has made an error within a case this Amendment now confers the power onto the Court of Appeal to remedy that error. The Supreme Court held it is clear from many decisions since the enactment of the 33rd Amendment to the Constitution and the terms of the Constitution, that in order for the Court to grant leave, the particular case involves a matter of general public importance or that it is otherwise in the interest of justice that it be appealed to the Court.B S v The Director of Public Prosecutions [2017] IESCDET 134 (1). Furthermore, the panel of judges in the Supreme Court agreed that \\"It will rarely be necessary in the interest of justice to permit an appeal to this court simply because it is said that the lower court was in error.\\" The parties would have to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Constitution will not allow parties to leapfrog from the High Court to the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court asserted that they will only hear appeals that are limited to issues that are important for the public or otherwise in the interest of justice to be heard by it. As the Supreme Court stated clearly that the overall approach to leave is clear: > ‚ÄúUnless it can be said that the case has the potential to influence true > matters of principle rather than the application of those matters of > principle to the specific facts of the case in question then the > constitutional threshold will not be met‚Äù. Therefore, the Supreme court is no longer a court for correction of error, but rather a court which has the constitutional task to determine issues of public importance. Therefore, the court decided that the case before them is not an appropriate case to grant leave to appeal.  Subsequent developments  BS v DPP along with the cases Price Waterhouse Coopers v Quinn InsurancePrice Waterhouse Cooper v Quinn Insurance Ltd [2017] IESC 73. and Wansboro v DPPWansboro v Director Of Public Prosecutions [2017] IESCDET 115. set out when and how the Supreme Court will grant leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal or directly from the High Court. The BS and PWC case established that the Supreme Court may grant leave to appeal where \\"a) that the decision involves a matter of general public importance; or (b) that in the interests of justice, it is necessary that there be a Supreme Court appeal.\\" The Wansboro case decided when it may be necessary to leapfrog from the High Court to Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held factors which may be taken into consideration when deciding if this is necessary may be issues such as the cost of two appeals, matters of particular urgency, effect on other cases if they are awaiting the determination of this case and will the issues still be alive. All three decisions were unanimous by the Supreme Court.

The court ruled that an arrest will be thrown out if it is shown that it was unnecessary to place handcuffs on the accused. There are certain circumstances that must be considered. For instance, whether the accused has a tendency for violence whilst intoxicated. The ruling raised the possibility that an invalidation of the arrest will also have an effect on the admissibility of the evidence.  Background On the 21st September 2007, Peter Cullen was driving through Clonee Village in Dublin around 10:30 pm when Garda Sergeant Moyles noticed Mr.Cullen driving in an erratic fashion. He became suspicious that he was under the influence of alcohol and signalled for him to pull over. He requested that Mr.Cullen provide a breath sample under the Road Traffic Act 1994, as amended, which he did so without any objections. The test indicated that his blood alcohol level was above the legal limit. He was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, placed in handcuffs and brought to Blanchardstown Garda Station. After arriving at the Garda Station he then provided two more breath specimens. These specimens indicated 71 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. When cross-examined, Sergeant Moyles admitted that Mr.Cullen had been obliging during the arrest and it was because of personal policy that he had decided to place the accused in handcuffs, rather than belief that it was necessary. This establishes how difficult it is to rely on gut instinct. It may be suggested that Sergeant Moyles was taking the usual precautions whilst arresting someone, in any given circumstance. However, the fact that Mr. Cullen was obliging during the arrest could mean that Mr. Cullen's constitutional rights have been breached which would have made his arrest unlawful. On appeal in the Circuit Court, the Judge was of the opinion that Sergeant Moyles had acted unlawfully in placing handcuffs on the defendant. His Honour Judge O'Sullivan stated a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court on two issues. He asked: # \\"Since the arresting Garda did not believe that the defendant was likely to resist arrest, was it just and lawful to hold that the handcuffing of the respondent following arrest was unjustified? # If the above question was given an affirmative answer, was it correct to conclude that the handcuffing of the defendant was a conscious and deliberate breach of the defendant's constitutional rights which would have rendered his arrest and detention unlawful. Evidence made against the defendant, such as the quantity of alcohol in his system, would be considered admissible.\\"[2014] 3 IR 30 at 30 In the District Court, Sergeant Moyles believed that the arrest was justified because such persons, whilst intoxicated could become abusive and resist arrest.  Supreme Court Decision  The court concluded that the arrest made on the defendant was unjustified. As a result, the Supreme Court also had to consider the admissibility the evidence relating the blood alcohol concentration. The Court held that is was unlawful to place handcuffs on suspects who were being arrested without giving any consideration to the context and, in particular, to the behavior and demeanor of the individual being arrested. The Court held that the Garda√≠ must only use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances. This is of paramount importance. It is for the Garda to make such a judgment and the law allows a generous measure of judgment to be exercised as to whether such force is or is not justified. Fennelly J. relied on the principles established in DPP v Gaffney[1988] ILRM 39 and DPP v McCreesh[1992] 2 IR 239. In DPP v Gaffney, the arresting Garda breached Article 40 of the Constitution. The arresting Garda went into the house of the defendant to arrest him. However, this arrest was held unlawful as the arresting Garda was not given the permission to enter the house. There was a deliberate and conscious breach of the defendant's constitutional rights. For the arrest to be lawful, a warrant should have been made. DPP v McCreesh stated that an arrest may not be valid if the defendant was not aware that an arrest is being made. The defendant must be given clarity, such as words that would expressly state that the defendant is being arrested. Fennelly J., in his judgment, stated that the defendant's arrest was unlawful because the arresting Garda did not give \\"any consideration to the context and in particular to the behavior and demeanor of the individual being arrested\\". In this case, the defendant was shown to have not resisted arrest. Furthermore, he was cordial and sensible whilst being detained. Hardiman J. agreed with this judgment. The Supreme Court seemed to be of agreement that the arresting Garda was acting subjectively. [2014] 3 IR 30 at 45 = Dissent = Interestingly, Clarke J. disagreed in part from the judgment. In his dissent, he noted that while the placing of handcuffs on the defendant was unlawful, it affected the manner of his arrest rather than the entitlement to arrest him, and therefore did not affect the lawfulness of his arrest or custody. Clarke J held that \\"the unlawful handcuffing of the person only rendered the manner of the arrest, not the arrest itself, unlawful\\". The exclusionary rule means that evidence obtained from the defendant would be unlawful, if it was held that the defendant's constitutional rights were breached. Clarke J. believed that \\"whether the certificate of alcohol concentration in Mr. Cullen's case was admissible would, therefore, depend on the view which this court takes on the current status and extent of the exclusionary rule.\\"[2014] 3 IR 30 at 55  Subsequent developments  DPP v Peter Cullen has since been referred to as authority for the lawfulness of arrests in subsequent cases.

The Supreme Court ruled that ‚Äúthe Garda√≠ are under a duty to seek out and preserve all evidence bearing on the guilt and innocence of an accused.‚Äù Daniel Braddish, the applicant, sought a prohibitory injunction against his approaching prosecution for robbery. Video evidence of the alleged crime had been in the possession of the Garda√≠ but was no longer available. The effort to have the prosecution overturned was refused in the High Court. On appeal, the Supreme Court was satisfied that the Applicant was entitled to the relief sought and accordingly made an order to quash the prosecution.  Background of the case  = Facts of case = On the 2 July 1997, a robbery occurred in a shop in Limerick which had been secured by surveillance camera. A Garda examined the tape and he concluded that it demonstrated the robbery in progress, clearly showing Braddish committing the crime. Subsequently, Braddish was arrested and detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. While in custody, Braddish confessed and signed a statement that he had indeed committed the robbery. He was then released from custody and nine months later charged with the robbery. Braddish was first tried before the Limerick Circuit Criminal Court on 24th March 1999 and a retrial was ordered as the jury could not reach an agreement. The retrial was held before Haugh J on 20th April 1999 where he did not allow evidence in stills taken from the video tape while it was with the Garda. Haugh J prohibited the submission of this evidence because the actual video tape was not presented. Hence, the jury was discharged to save Braddish from being in an unfair situation before the Court. On 14 June 1999, he sought for judicial review on the basis that a continuation of his trial would a breach of his constitutional right to fair trial because the prosecution did not produce original evidence to him. = High Court decision = The Garda√≠ had been in possession of a video that showed the alleged crime. However, that evidence was no longer available. The videotape was returned to the shop after Braddish had confessed. Hence, Braddish had sought a prohibitory injunction against his approaching prosecution. Nevertheless, High Court refused such relief because the prosecution was relying on his confession rather than on the videotape. Had prosecution tried to rely on photographic evidence, then there would have been a significant problem as Braddish would not have had the opportunity to contest the evidence put against him. The Judge also took note of when the request for the video tape was made by the Counsel on behalf of Braddish. The issue before the Court was whether or not there is a need to prevent Braddish's further prosecution solely because the video tape was now unavailable. That piece of evidence was vital as it showed Braddish executing the crime and this was the only evidence available which identified him as the perpetrator. No other identification evidence was presented.  Holding of the Supreme Court  While in Garda custody, Braddish made an inculpatory statement by confessing that he was the culprit in the video tape which was also signed by him. The prosecution's case was based wholly on the alleged confession that was made by Braddish, rather than on the video tape evidence. It was settled in this case that evidence admissible in relation to guilt or innocence must be preserved, heretofore necessary and practicable, until the judgment of the trial.[2001] 3 IR 127 at 13 This same rationale was accepted by Lynch J in the case of Robert Murphy v DPP which the Supreme Court cited and agreed to.Robert Murphy v DPP 1989 ILRM 71 Respondents asserted that at core this case was being advanced because of the alleged inculpatory statement made by Braddish. Even if the video tape was produced before the Court, Braddish would not benefit from it anyway and if anything, the only one at a disadvantage with the reintroduction of this tape is the prosecution. Hence, the absence of the video evidence should not be a sufficient ground for him to receive any relief from the Court. In this case, Braddish pleaded not guilty despite his previous confession to the crime. If Braddish wanted to dispute his previous confession on the grounds that his detention was illegal, then it would be difficult to put forward a persuasive argument without the video evidence as his arrest was made solely on the basis of it. The stills presented before the lower court cannot be used for the purposes of identification evidence. Hardiman J disagreed with the contention that video tape had little importance in this case simply because the prosecution was not depending on it. Also, the confession evidence put forward was being highly contested against as well. It is well known that in matters of confession evidences, it should be used as corroborating evidence and a high reliance on it to convict an accused should be avoided. Besides, the video tape can be a tool to inculpate and exculpate Braddish. The Supreme Court concurred that the video tape should not have been returned and disposed of as it was real evidence of the guilt of the accused. Hardiman J writing for the Court noted that \\"it is the duty of the Garda√≠, arising from their unique investigative role, to seek out and preserve all evidence having a bearing or potential bearing on the issue of guilt or innocence.\\" However, it was noted by the Court that this duty is not absolute where the evidence is not directly relevant to the case, and will be mitigated by considerations of practicability, feasibility and the availability of resources. Obiter dictum was created which means that where the evidence was not of direct and manifest relevance, then the duty to preserve and disclose had to be interpreted in a fair and reasonable manner on the facts of the particular case.[2001] 3 IR 127 at 128 Other pieces of evidence cannot be disposed simply because the argument is being made on the grounds of just one evidence. The destruction of any piece of evidence cannot be justified by saying it is not being used in the case. The Judge said this is because an evidence which the prosecution believes to be irrelevant could be considered to be of importance by the defense. This is why any real evidence should be preserved and disclosed to the defense counsel beforehand. In this case the Garda who disposed the video tape had said he believed the man on tape was Braddish. So, it is difficult to understand why then he did not preserve the evidence instead of getting rid of it. The Court also mentioned that a Garda has no right to destroy an evidence as he pleases. With respect to the time when the video was first requested, Hardiman J asserted that Braddish was not charged until nine months after his arrest and the request was made five months after this. He did not think it is reasonable to hold the request made for video tape against Braddish as there is contradicted evidence that Braddish made a formal request for it on the day he was charged as well. It is illogical to assume that he should have made a request before he was charged as there is no reason for the prosecution to present evidence before an accused is charged. Hardiman J also found that Braddish is entitled to apply for judicial review. Supreme Court overturned the High Court judgement and allowed the appeal as the video tape was not presented before the courts.

She served during World War II, escaping to England after the Dutch surrender during the Battle of the Netherlands. She was decommissioned in 1945. Service history Z 5 was the first ship of the s to be built in the Netherlands, with the initial Z 1 to Z 4 being built in Germany. =Pre-war service= The Netherlands stayed neutral in World War I and therefore Z 5 did not see action during that conflict. On 10 June 1925 Z 5 went on a squadron exercise to the Baltic Sea with , , , O 8 and . During this exercise ports in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland were visited before returning on 4 August. Between 9 May and 8 August 1927, Z 5 went on exercises to Norway and the Baltic with , , , , and . From 16 July until 28 July 1928, Z 5 visited Edinburgh together with Hertog Hendrik, O 10, Z 6 and Z 7. Between 8 July and 8 August 1929, Z 5 went on exercises in the Baltic with Jacob van Heemskerck, , O 10 and Z 6. From 28 June until 10 July 1930, Z 5 visited Edinburgh together with Jacob van Heemskerck, O 8, O 9, O 10 and Z 7. Between 1930 and 1931, Z 5 was rebuilt at the Rijkswerf Willemsoord to make her more fitted for duties in the Dutch West Indies. This included her propulsion being changed from three coal and oil stoked boilers to two oil stoked boilers, her torpedo tubes being removed and depth charge throwers and smoke screen machines being fitted. Her seaworthiness was improved as well. Due to all the changes the complement was reduced to 34. Between 4 May and 20 June 1936, Z 5 went on exercises in the Baltic with Hertog Hendrik, O 9, O 10 and O 11. =World War II= During the early hours of 10 May 1940, Germany launched a surprise attack on the Netherlands as part of the operation to conquer France. On the same day, Z 5 was ordered to attack German positions in Rotterdam and did so successfully. Z 5 fired upon multiple enemy machine gun nests on the Maas bridges with her 75 mm guns while also successfully hitting German floatplanes with her 12.7 mm machine guns. On 14 May Z 5 set sail for England to avoid capture by the Germans and arrived on 17 May at Portsmouth. She underwent repairs before returning to service on 16 June. From 16 June Z 5 was assigned to the British 9th Submarine Flotilla, where she was used as an escort for incoming and outgoing submarines and as a target ship. From 18 May 1941 Z 5 performed similar duties for the British 7th and 3rd Submarine flotillas. On 2 March 1942 Z 5 was transferred to the British Royal Navy, while her crew was transferred to the new Dutch destroyer . In British service Z 5 performed all kinds of assistance and escort duties. Because of the striking, sharp bow, the British soon gave Z 5 the nickname \\"Razor Blade\\", before renaming her Blade in May 1943. On 9 April 1945 the Royal Navy returned Blade to the Royal Netherlands Navy, which struck the ship right away. She was sold to the West of Scotland Shipbreaking Company, where she arrived on 23 October. Scrapping was completed on 20 December.

Early life Roger Harold Metford Warner was born in Settle, North Yorkshire, the son of Harold Metford Warner and Marjorie Barrett Sowerby. His engineer father died before Warner was born. One of his grandfathers, Metford Warner, owned Jeffrey and Company the wallpaper manufacturers who printed William Morris papers.  Career  In 1936 Warner founded Roger Warner Antique Dealers in Burford, Oxfordshire, with the help of his mother, Marjorie. He was particularly keen on buying stock that was of little interest to other dealers. This included pieces of vernacular furniture used in servants' rooms and country house offices and obsolete agricultural tools. Many of these items came on to the market as part of the sale and demolition of country houses common just before and after the Second World War. Warner also developed a knowledge of textiles, his interest in fabrics encompassed worsteds and chintzes. During the Second World War Warner closed his shop. In 1946 he joined a Quaker Relief Team in Holland as their leader helping to rehabilitate Dutch citizens after the Nazi occupation. Warner reopened the shop in 1947 and Lawrence Darton, the book historian, joined the business. However Warner's antiquarian book dealing was short lived as he decided that books took too long to handle. As a leading figure in the antiques world, Warner sold to multiple prominent museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum, Temple Newsam in Leeds and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He also had many private clients who included Peter Ustinov, Bruce Chatwin and members of the British royal family such as Princess Margaret. Another high profile customer was Charles Paget Wade of Snowshill Manor. Many items to be seen in the house today were bought from Roger Warner Antique Dealers. Warner often appeared on the antiques quiz show 'Going for a Song' on the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, along with fellow antiques expert Arthur Negus. In 1985 after nearly 50 years in business, Warner retired. The Regional Furniture Society published his autobiography 'Roger Warner, Memoirs of a Twentieth Century Antique Dealer' as their journal in 2003. After his death at the age of 98 in 2008 his extensive antique collection was sold, with much press coverage, over four days at Christies South Kensington and Brightwells in Leominster, grossing over ¬£2,000,000. Personal life Warner married Ruth Ernestine Hurcombe, the South African botanist in 1949. They had a son and two daughters. One daughter is the British director of theatre and opera Deborah Warner. Warner was a Quaker and, during the Second World War, a conscientious objector.

The commonest cyst arising from lateral wall is the nasopharyngeal branchial cyst, whereas the mucus retention cysts are the commonest to arise from the midline. Sometimes nasopharyngeal cyst may directly refer to Tornwaldt cyst. It arises from the midline and lies deep to the pharyngobasilar fascia which helps to distinguish it from a mucous retention cyst. The main difference lies in that nasopharyngeal branchial cyst is congenital whereas the Tornwaldt's cyst is acquired.  Nasopharyngeal Branchial Cyst  These are congenital cysts often arising from the fossa of Rosenm√ºller located in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx. They represent remnants of first branchial cleft. These may extend superiorly to reach the bony confines of eustachian tube even to the skull base. Initially patients are asymptomatic but may present with aural fullness, unilateral conductive hearing loss, and serous otitis media as the cyst mass grows. In even more rare cases, they may be the source for unexplained sinonasal symptoms, such as CSF rhinorrhea, visual disturbances and nasal obstruction.  Diagnosis  In most of the cases incidental diagnosis happens while performing nasal endoscopy. MRI and CT scan can be helpful for further confirmation of diagnosis. On CT scan a low density, well capsulated mass in the roof of nasopharynx is suggestive of Thornwaldt cyst.  Differential Diagnosis  Differential diagnosis of this cyst are branchial cleft cyst, Rathke cleft cyst, neurenteric cyst, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, adenoid retention cyst, meningocele and meningomyelocele.  Treatment Surgery is performed once symptomatic using transplatatine or endonasal route with the help of nasal endoscopy.

For many years, he was best known as a \\"confidant\\", music director, and piano player for Liza Minnelli. Early life and career Stritch was born on February 12, 1962 in Houston, Texas, and raised in Sugar Land, Texas. At the age of 8 or 9, he heard big band music for the first time, and went to the large suburban John Foster Dulles High School (Class of 1979) of Sugar Land, TX that had a \\"great\\" music education program, in which he played in the \\"jazz band\\". He played in a jazz vocal trio while at college that played jazz festivals for nine years. The trio broke up and Stritch moved to New York City. He attended Dulles High School and the University of Houston. Stritch recorded his first album in 1992, the self-styled jazz LP, Billy Stritch. Stritch and Sandy Knox composed the 1994 Grammy Award-winning country song, \\"Does He Love You,\\" which was recorded by Reba McEntire and Linda Davis. The song, about a love triangle, follows a common trope. It peaked as a number one Country music hit in both Canada and the United States, and ended 1993 as the 52nd biggest hit in Canada, and in the top 40 in the United States. The single went on to win the Grammy award for Best Country Vocal Collaboration, and although nominated, Stritch lost the best song Grammy to Mary Chapin Carpenter for Passionate Kisses. Stritch and Knox had written the song when they were part of the trio back in 1982, but until McEntire \\"grabbed it ... in 1993\\" and made a surprise hit with it, nobody had recorded the ballad; even Wynonna Judd rejected it because she \\"didn't like to sing songs about marital problems.\\" In 1996, Minnelli released the song as a duet with Donna Summer, from Minnelli's album, \\"Gently\\". In 1997, it appeared on Patti LaBelle's album, Flame.  Collaboration with Liza Minnelli  For 23 years, Stritch was associated with Liza Minnelli, as her \\"confidant\\", music director, and piano player. They met when Stritch was playing piano in Manhattan, in March 1991; that night, seeing her, he played musical themes from films of Vincent Minnelli, her father, and they hit it off immediately. He arranged the music for her show at Radio City Music Hall and opended her act on a national tour of the United States. In 1999, he arranged music for Liza Minnelli's Broadway one-woman show Minnelli on Minnelli: Live at the Palace, and performed with her in 2008's Liza's at the Palace. Stritch co-wrote, with Brian Lane Green Johnny Rodgers, I Would Never Leave You for Liza's at the Palace..., which was produced by Phil Ramone. In 2008, Minelli praised Stitch for their long collaboration on her Facebook page. They performed together for the 2009 grand re-opening of the Guildhall in Easthampton; Stritch joked that he couldn't afford a \\"cottage\\" in The Hamptons. Mature career In 2001, he performed as Oscar in the 2001 Broadway revival of 42nd Street. In the same year, he issued his third major disc, Jazz Live on Sin-Drome Records, receiving excellent reviews. At that time, he first met Christine Ebersole, who was also in the cast. Stritch performed in a 2003 concert of Amanda Green's original revue Put a Little Love in Your Mouth!, at off-Broadway's Second Stage Theatre in March 2003, which also featured Jessica Molaskey and Mario Cantone.Gans, Andrew (February 20, 2003). \\"Murney, Butz, Testa Plus Mom Newman Celebrate Amanda Green's New CD at March 17 Concert\\".

The New York Times reviewer wrote that \\"Mr. Stritch, who even looks a bit like his idol, exudes a similarly cultivated bonhomie. But he has a bigger, rougher voice.\\" He has taken that show nationally, starting in 2007 and continuing to at least 2013. For Christmas 2006 he played at the Iridium in New York with guest performers Liza Minnelli, Lainie Kazan, Ann Hampton Callaway, and Sally Mayes. He performed with Stephanie J. Block in a concert, Billy Stritch and the Girls at Birdland in 2007. In the Fall of 2007 he teamed with Klea Blackhurst to create Dreaming of a Song: The Music of Hoagy Carmichael, which they debuted at Manhattan‚Äôs Metropolitan Room. Their recording was released in October 2008. He has performed frequently with Linda Lavin, touring nationally with her in 2017 and 2018. He has also performed with duets with Christine Ebersole; Variety called his collaboration with her \\"punctuating the lady's repertoire with vigorous piano and vocal support.\\" Stritch was nominated for an Ovation Award in 2009 for The Best is Yet to Come: The Music of Cy Coleman at the Rubicon Theatre Company. In 2010, he performed as a band leader in Sex and the City 2. He performed at a benefit for Broadway Cares with Luann de Lesseps, of the reality television show, RHONY, whom she called among \\"the best in the business.\\" In 2013, Stritch joined Jim Caruso in a cabaret show in New York. Rex Reed wrote about their show that \\"Every Sunday in December, when the Caf√© Carlyle across the hall is dark, the glamorous Bemelmans Bar is hosting the most enchanting holiday party in town.\\" Stritch returned to his home town for a gig in 2014, where the Sugar Land Auditorium was renamed the \\"Billy Stritch Stage\\" in his honor.

Holdings v Minister for Public Enterprise & ors and Persona Digital Telephony Ltd v Minister for Public Enterprise & ors [2012] IESC 50 is an Irish Supreme Court case which originated from the controversial decision of Michael Lowry, then Minister for Public Enterprise, to grant the second state mobile phone license to ESAT Digiphone. It has been described as \\"an absolutely unique case without any precedent in the ninety year history of the state.\\"  Background  = Facts of the case = In March 1995, Lowry announced a bidding process for the award of the second state mobile phone license. Denis O' Brien's consortium, ESAT Digiphone was the successful candidate in the bidding process and was granted the license the following year. The award of the license was a highly lucrative business venture and made the successful bidder one of the wealthiest entities in the State. The consortium was subsequently sold a short time later for 2.3 billion euro. The tender process for the state mobile phone license was both extremely expensive to participate in and complex in nature. All tenders for the license were to be evaluated by the \\"GSM Project Group\\" which was created by the Public Service to prevent political interference. The government created a complex algorithm to evaluate applicants. The plaintiffs in this case issued legal proceedings on the grounds that the tender process for the license had been corrupted by Michael Lowry, then Minister for Public Enterprise to ensure the award of the license was granted to ESAT. It was also alleged that Michael Lowry had been promised monetary payments from Mr O'Brien if he secured the license. The controversy arising from this decision became the subject of a public inquiry known as the Moriarty Tribunal which was set up to investigate allegations of ministerial corruption and payments made to politicians. It was found by the Tribunal that Michael Lowry through his position as Minister for Public Enterprise at the time had imparted substantive information to Denis O' Brien which was \\"of significant value and assistance to him in securing the license.\\" High Court Judgment The appellants issued legal proceedings to the High Court in 2001. The appellants sought both a declaration from the court that the decision by Michael Lowry to award ESAT the license was null and void and damages. The State filed its own motions seeking an order to dismiss the proceedings against the Minister for delay/ and want of prosecution. It was held by the High Court judge that the delay on the part of the appellants in issuing legal proceedings was inordinate and inexcusable and that there was no justification for it: > \\"I come to the conclusion that where responsibility for inordinate and > inexcusable delay rests with the appellants..... where the appellants have > failed after a late start to advance their proceedings expeditiously, the > balance of justice favors the dismissal of proceedings and I dismiss the > appellants proceedings against the state for want of prosecution.\\" The appellants appealed this judgment to the Supreme Court.  Holding of the Supreme Court  The appeals were presided over by panel of five judges. All five justices agreed that they would allow the appeals of the appellants. In addition, the Court refused to grant the relief sought by the government to strike out the proceedings on the grounds of delay (also called \\"want of prosecution\\"). The Court held that the delay on the part of the appellants in the proceedings was justified. It was also held that the decision by Mr Lowry to award the state mobile phone license to ESAT was \\"unlawful, null void and of no effect.\\" Hardiman J in his judgement stressed the singular nature of the case in that a public administrative process which had been created for the sole purpose of preventing political interference had effectively been corrupted: > \\"The principal relevant unique factor is that Dail √âireann and the > Taoiseach, decided to set up a Tribunal of Inquiry which itself decided to > investigate the very matter which is at the heart of these proceedings, the > award of the second mobile phone licence. Its inquiry was estimated to be > capable of concluding in one year: in fact it took thirteen times that > long.\\" >  Subsequent developments  In November 2019, Mr Justice Senan Allen issued a judgement stating that the documents of correspondence between O'Brien and his associates in relation to the award of the second state mobile phone license to ESAT Digiphone in 1996 must be disclosed as part of the legal action. The case has since been adjourned to allow the parties to consider his decision.

It empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence opposite Anticosti Island. Location The Corneille River is about long. The watershed covers an area of . It lies between the basins of the Ours River to the west and the Piashti River to the east. The river basin covers part of the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me, and parts of the municipalities of Baie- Johan-Beetz and Havre-Saint-Pierre. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Baie-Johan-Beetz in the Minganie Regional County Municipality. The origin of the name is unknown. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the river in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. Description According to the Dictionnaire des rivi√®res et lacs de la province de Qu√©bec (1914), Fishing The La Corneille outfitter has exclusive fishing rights to of the Corneille River. They provide accommodation, and easy access to productive Atlantic salmon pools. There is also plentiful brook trout. The outfitter is based on a granite island at the confluence of the Corneille River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is east of Havre-St-Pierre, accessible by car along Quebec Route 138. The island is in the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve. Only the first of the river is readily accessible to salmon, which cannot pass a waterfall high at the confluence of Lake Tanguay and the Corneille River. In 2014 a program funded by Hydro-Qu√©bec as part of the development of the Romaine River hydroelectric project built a path by which the salmon could pass this obstacle. Controlled blasting in the bedrock created an excavated channel near the left bank that carried about 10% of the river's flow to create a salmon run. This gave the fish access to an additional of the river, and reduced the time they spent at the foot of the falls, where they were at risk of poaching. Follow-up activities include inventories using electrical fishing, a scientific research project to measure the interaction between the salmon and other fish species in the upstream section, including landlocked salmon, and a camera system to monitor several sites where intruders could access the river for illegal fishing. In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec.

It consists of the traditional Spanish escutcheon (the arms of Castile, Le√≥n, Aragon, Navarre and Granada), as well as other heraldic icons such as the Pillars of Hercules. It includes elements adopted from the Catholic Monarchs such as the Eagle of Saint John and the yoke and arrows. See also: Symbols of Francoism. The mottos of Francoism are mottos which encapsulate the ideals of Francoist Spain. Although the regime had many ideological influences (Traditionalism, National Catholicism, Militarism and National syndicalism), it employed Falangism in its popular movements. Falangist ideology was easily incorporated in the creation of mottos as it is believed to demonstrate a certain reluctance towards political agendas, and to favour empiricism, taking action, and the simplification of ideas.Historians have discussed which of the Falange's qualities were most characteristic of the ideology. Stanley Payne maintains it's their vague and confusing ideas, (PAYNE, Stanley (1965) Sobre Falange Espa√±ola. Par√≠s: Ruedo Ib√©rico), while S. Ellwood believes Nationalism, Imperialism and Irrationalism to characterise their ideas, as stated in Prietas las filas. Historia de la Falange Espa√±ola, 1933-1985. Grijalbo (found at ) Although these mottos originated from the activity of different right-wing intellectuals and nationalist political parties during the Second Spanish Republic, their use became widespread and proved to be an effective propaganda tool used by the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) in mobilising public opinion and persuading the population to conform to nationalist ideas. Mottos were also often used as political chants in Francoist Spain (1939‚Äì1975). As well as achieving military victory, the Rebel, or Nationalist, faction successfully used propaganda to link the term \\"national\\" with the concept of Spain itself. This is a result of the extended period of time the regime stayed in power in the absence of any public resistance, despite clandestine opposition.Jos√© √Ålvarez Junco: Mater Dolorosa. La idea de Espa√±a en el siglo XIX (Premio Nacional de Ensayo 2002), conferences on this subject held at the Fundaci√≥n Juan March. Those within the regime did not all blindly support such simplifications as demonstrated in Espa√±a como problema by the Falangist intellectual, Pedro La√≠n Entralgo. Rafael Calvo Serer responded to this with his Espa√±a sin problema, expressing traditional and orthodox beliefs. These beliefs had to be adopted, as assuming a traditional stance and showcasing 'unwavering support' towards Franco was the only way to maintain any semblance of power, as highlighted by Luis Carrero Blanco when referring to Franco and everything the Caudillo represented: > [...] my loyalty to [Franco] and his work is undoubtedly sincere and > completely transparent; it is unconstrained by limitations, nor is it > affected by doubts or reservations [...] During Spain's transition to democracy, not only were Francoism's mottos and symbols abandoned, but there was also a decline in the use of national symbols in general. Even referring to 'Spain' was frequently substituted by other terms (such as 'this country', though this term was already used in the Romantic period by the Spanish author Mariano Jos√© de Lara), while there was an increase in the use of terms relating to regional nationalism. ¬°Una, Grande y Libre! (One, Great and Free)  Una, Grande y Libre (English: One, Great and FreeQuiroga, Alejandro (2015). \\"Spanish Fury: Football and National Identities under Franco\\". European History Quarterly. 45 (3): 523. doi:10.1177/0265691415587686. or United, Great and FreePayne, Stanley (1988). The Franco Regime, 1936-1975. University of Wisconsin Press. p. 620. .) was the Francoist tripartite motto which expressed the nationalist concept of Spain as: * 'indivisible', expressing opposition to any kind of separatism or territorial decentralization; * 'imperial', referring to the part of the Spanish empire established in America, as well as the one that was intended to be built in Africa; * and 'not subject to foreign influences', referring to the international Judeo-Masonic-Communist conspiracy which the Nationalists believed controlled the Soviet Union, the European democracies and the United States (until the agreements of 1953), as well as a large number of threats to the regime which were deemed anti-Spanish, communist, separatist, liberal (see also: White Terror). The motto was created by jonsist student Juan Aparicio L√≥pez (he also created the motto Por la Patria, el Pan y la Justicia; \\"for the Homeland, for Bread and for Justice\\" and was also behind the adoption of the Yoke and the Arrows as symbol of the JONS as well as the red-black flag)Gejo Santos, Mar√≠a Isabel (2015). Tradici√≥n y modernidad.: Dos d√©cadas de m√∫sica en salamanca, 1940-1960. Salamanca: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca. p. 399. ., and was later adopted by Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS along other JONS' symbolsRodr√≠guez Labandeira, Jose (2017). La dial√©ctica de los pu√±os y las pistolas. p. 111. .. Una, Grande y Libre was often used at the end of speeches; The leader would exclaim three times ¬°Espa√±a!, and the public would successively respond to each of these shouts with ¬°Una!, ¬°Grande!, and finally ¬°Libre!. The effect was similar to the way Amen is used in church, as well as to the chant of \\"Sieg Heil!\\" in Nazi Germany. The theatre would continue with an almost choreographed script of ¬°Arriba Espa√±a!, ¬°Arriba! Jos√© Antonio, ¬°Presente!, Ca√≠dos por Dios y por Espa√±a, ¬°Presente!. ¬°Viva Franco!, ¬°Viva!, or just intoning ¬°Franco, Franco, Franco‚Ä¶! In his farewell message to the Spanish people upon his death in 1975, Franco referred to \\"the great task of making Spain united, great and free.\\" The slogan was incorporated into the Falangist anthem, Cara al Sol; it ended with the stanza ¬°Espa√±a una! ¬°Espa√±a grande! ¬°Espa√±a libre! (Spain, one [united]! Spain, great! Spain, free!) Una patria, un estado, un caudillo (one motherland, one state, one leader) Although ¬°Una,Grande y Libre! was the most widespread motto under Francoist Spain, una Patria, un estado, un caudillo is another tripartite motto which was used extensively between 1936 and the beginning of 1940. The motto was spread by the Franco's confidant, founder of the Spanish Legion, Jos√© Mill√°n Astray, who profoundly admired the Caudillo. In the first few months of the Spanish Civil War, when Franco was still a member of the Junta de Defensa, Mill√°n Astray traversed the nationalist-controlled areas, particularly the provinces of Castille and Navarra, serving Franco's personal cause and convincing the troops and officers of Franco's indisputable claim as the leader of Spain. After creating the motto ¬°Viva la muerte! (Long live death!), Mill√°n Astray adapted the National socialist's Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein F√ºhrer (one people, one empire, one leader) in order to create the motto Una patria, un estado, un caudillo. When the Junta de Defensa became the Junta T√©cnica del Estado and Franco was named as the head of state, it became compulsory for all newspapers and postcards in the Nationalist-controlled zones to include this motto in their header. = Significance of the tripartite motto = The Monument of Eugenio D'Ors in Madrid includes descriptions of parts of his work, many of which are references points of Francoist mottos. Many Francoist slogans were purposely designed to be tripartite mottos in clear reference to religious symbolism (the Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit). This implicitly compares Spain to the defining characteristics of the Roman Catholic Church; \\"Catholic\\" (meaning universal), \\"Apostolic\\" (meaning chosen) and \\"Roman\\" (meaning united).Eugenio D'Ors, found on the Puerta de Vel√°zquez in the Prado Museum, in front of the Edificio de los Sindicatos Verticales, now the Ministry of Health: > Todo pasa, vna sola cosa te sera contada y es tv obra bien hecha. Noble es > el qve se exige y hombre, tan solo, qvien cada dia renveva su entvsiasmo, > sabio, al descvbrir el orden del mvndo, que inclvye la ironia. Padre es el > responsable, y patricia mision de servicio la politica. Debe ser catolica, > qve es decir, vniversal, apostolica, es decir escogida, romana es decir, > vna. Vna tambi√©n la cvltvra, estado libre de solidaridad en el espacio y > continvidad en el tiempo qve todo lo qve no es tradicion es plagio. Peca la > natvraleza, son enfermizos ocio y soledad qve cada cval cvltive lo qve de > angelico le agracia, en amistad y dialogo. The text is found at the Monumento a Eugenio d'Ors (Madrid). These comparisons must be viewed in the context of National Catholicism, an essential aspect to the Francoist ideology. Although National Catholicism was not a key component of Falangist ideology (and was sometimes even opposed by the Falangists), it was used by the Falange as a rhetorical device. Throughout history, ideas and concepts have often been incorporated into and expressed as tripartite mottos. It is believed that this occurrence originated with Indo-European populations, who worshipped three gods as one. The social classes of these populations were also split into three categories, in a similar way to those of medieval societies and the Ancien Regime. Other tripartite mottos include \\"Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternite\\" (liberty, equality, fraternity), created during the French Revolution; \\"Dios, Patria y Libertad\\" (God, Motherland and Freedom), used in the Dominican Republic; and \\"Dios, patria, rey\\" (God, Motherland, King) which dates back to Carlism, a traditionalist, right-wing Spanish ideology. In addition to mottos, examples of other tripartite classifications are the Falange's categories of \\"natural units of political life\\" (\\"Family, town council, trade union\\"). Furthermore, in the philosophy of absolute idealism, the dialectical method of Hegelian theory (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) is also composed of three parts. On some occasions, these three- part classifications have been linked to a \\"western\\" or \\"patriarchal\\" way of viewing the world, which contrasts with the two-part \\"eastern\\" or \\"matriarchal\\" point of view (yin and yang). = Opposition to Francoist mottos = As discussed in an opinion piece by Anton Reixa, in Francoist Spain there were those who responded to the above Francoist mottos with parodies such as 'There's only one Spain (because if there were another, we'd all be there.)' People also opposed the regime in more subtle ways such as by chanting the last part of the motto Una, Grande y Libre louder than the others, emphasizing the word \\"Free\\". This form of protest is illustrated in the film Las trece rosas (2007), which focuses on a group of girls awaiting a death sentence in the Ventas Prison in Madrid in 1939. Coincidentally, one of the reasons for their imprisonment is the distribution of propaganda containing a motto opposing Franco: menos Franco y m√°s pan blanco (Less Franco and more white bread). This can be interpreted as a response both to the chants of 'Franco, Franco' as well as a criticism of Francoist slogans like \\"No house without a fireplace nor a Spaniard without bread\\", a motto which was printed on the packages of bread which were used to 'bombard' the Republican rearguard in the final stages of the Civil War in order to showcase the superiority and alleged benevolence of the rebel faction, as well as the hunger which prevailed in the Republican zones. A song written in Catalan by Joan Manuel Serrat (Temps era temps) refers to the postwar period as the \\"time of the ¬°Una, Grande y Libre!\\" ¬°Arriba Espa√±a! (Up with Spain!)  Medal commemorating the Nationalist victory of the Civil War, imprinted with the slogan Arriba Espa√±a. The decision to use 'up' instead of 'long live' was justified on the basis that the term 'live' was insufficient. The word 'up' conveys the idea of Spanish patriots standing at attention, asserting their active willingness to improve Spain. It also resonated with the providential belief that all events are predetermined by God.La historia de Espa√±a contada con sencillez, C√°diz: Escelicer. Si eres espa√±ol, habla espa√±ol (If you're Spanish, speak Spanish)  The motto 'Speak the language of the empire' was also employed, as instructed by a poster once displayed in the courtyard of the University of Barcelona. This motto was possibly inspired by Antonio de Nebrija, who wrote in 1492 that \\"Language was always a companion of the empire\\" in Gram√°tica castellana, the first work dedicated to the Spanish language and its rules. These mottos were used above all in Catalonia in order to discourage the use of Catalan after the region was taken over by Franco's army in the final stage of the Civil War (Barcelona was taken on the 26th of January 1939), and were also used in the postwar period.  Rusia es culpable (Russia is guilty)  This slogan is taken from the speech Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er made on the 23rd of June, 1941, the day after Germany invaded the Soviet Union (known as Operation Barbarossa), in which he blames Stalin's communist Russia for the Spanish Civil War, and encourages the support of Hitler's Nazi Germany in their fight against them.Cited in Alberto Piris: \\"La Operaci√≥n Barbarroja, hoy hace 60 a√±os\\" Archived on the 17th of November, 2007, on the Wayback Machine., on Estrella Digital. Spain, 22 de June, 2001. The quote was printed in newspapers and employed by the anti-Soviet movement which created the Blue Division, formed by volunteers and incorporated into the German army. These volunteers were believed not to affect or compromise Spain's official position of neutrality (although Franco favoured the Axis powers). Eventually, pressure from the Western powers forces Franco's government to withdraw the division. Cliches surrounding Russia often had some truth to them, making the country an easy target that people could blame for their misfortunes. These cliches include \\"the Moscow Gold\\" (which refers to the Republic's transfer of the Bank of Spain's gold reserves during the civil war as payment for Soviet military assistance, which Franco's government demanded be returned to Spain) and the \\"Children of Russia\\" (who were evacuated from the Republican zone and, unlike those who were sent to Franco or other countries, were not allowed to return to Spain).Inmaculada Colomina Limonero (2005) Breve historia de los ni√±os de la Guerra de Espa√±a en Rusia, online library of Moscow's Cervantes Institute The documentary \\"Los Ni√±os de Rusia\\" by Jaime Camino explores this subject.Index and commentary of the film The chance for Spain to take their symbolic revenge arose during the 1964 European Nations' Cup, in which Spain's match against the Soviet Union was won by the legendary goal scored by Marcelino. Spain's use of football as an outlet of social tensions is reflected in the expression \\"Pan y f√∫tbol\\" (\\"Bread and football\\", adapted from the phrase \\"Bread and circuses\\", used to describe a government's attempts at generating public approval through distraction.)  Gibraltar es espa√±ol (Gibraltar is Spanish)  Gibraltar-Spain border, known in Spanish as the 'iron-wrought gate of Gibraltar', was closed by the Francoist regime to exert pressure on the British Government in the hope that negotiations regarding the territory would begin. It was not reopened until the 1980's by Felipe Gonz√°lez's government. Gibraltar's concession to Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 lead to a continuous demand for the territory to be reinstated as a part of Spain. However, the level of this demand varied throughout the years. The Second World War allowed Franco to take advantage of the strategic possibilities brought about by the English colony, using it in his both in negotiations with Hitler as well as his negotiations with the Allied powers, none of whom ended up facing Spain's military. After the defeat of Germany, international pressure on the Francoist regime caused the country to become isolated; this point was employed periodically in efforts to sway public opinion within Spain. Protests, most of which were unplanned, occurred as a result of the country's anti-English sentiments, with those in attendance chanting \\"Spanish Gibraltar!\\" Notable protests are those which occurred in 1955 in reaction to Elizabeth II's visit to the British territory.Planeta De Agostini: \\"Los A√±os del NODO\\" Archived on the 10th of October 2007 on the Wayback Machine. The conversation regarding one of these protests between Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the UK ambassador in Madrid, Sir Samuel Hoare, is a widely known anecdote: when the ambassador was asked if he wanted Spain to send more police officers in order to protect the embassy, he replied, \\"No, I'd rather you sent less protesters.\\"Fernando L√≥pez Agud√≠n: \\"La patera del Pe√±√≥n\\", El Mundo, 18th of December 2004. An official exhibition entitled \\"Spanish Gibraltar\\" was put on at the National Library in 1955. Surprisingly, those living in San Roque, the municipality closest to Gibraltar, avidly opposed sending a painting of the Nazarene, which was going to accompany other images (such as the Virgen Santa Mar√≠a Coronada and the Madre de San Roque) from the town to be displayed at the exhibition. These images were originally worshipped in Gibraltar, and were taken to San Roque by the Gibraltarians when they fled the city during the 18th century. The townspeople of San Roque feared that the painting wouldn't be returned; however, their worries were eventually overcome, and the painting was taken to the exhibition.Photo of the Virgen Coronada [1]; Information regarding the opposition of the townspeople [2](broken link, page available on the Internet Archive; see history and latest version).

She was sold on 17 May 1947 and scrapped at Hayle, Cornwall, in September 1947. HMS Sunflower was the most successful of the Royal Navy Flower-class. She single-handedly sank two U-boats: U-638 on 5 May 1943 and U-631 on 17 October 1943. She shared sinking of U-282 on 29 October 1943.

Service history =Battle of the Atlantic= During work-up Sunflower was deployed as escort for HM Submarine Thunderbolt (Ex HMS Thetis) and the large Free French submarine Surcouf during passage to the Firth of Clyde. In 1941 Western Approaches Command had formed eight escort groups. The 1st Escort Group consisted of six destroyers and four Flower-class corvettes.HMS Alisma (K185), HMS Dianella (K07), HMS Kingcup (K33) & HMS Sunflower (K41) They were soon in action with other groups between 19 July ‚Äì 1 August 1941 with Convoy ON 69 defending 26 merchant ships from 8 U-boats and 2 Italian submarines. In February and March 1942 the original eight escort groups were reorganized into the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF). Corvettes of B7 Group moored in Londonderry. Alisma, Dianella, Sunflower & Kingcup. The white areas are where the official censor has painted out security sensitive material Sunflower was part of Escort Group B7, one of seven such British naval groups which served with the Mid-Ocean Escort Force. It provided convoy protection in the most dangerous midsection of the North Atlantic route. B7's first convoys, in the spring of 1942, were uneventful, and as the pace of the Battle of the Atlantic hotted up in the summer and autumn, the group's charges were escorted without loss. But in December, while escorting ON 153, the convoy came under attack, and three ships were sunk. During this action, on 11 December, Firedrake was torpedoed by the U-boat and sank with the loss of 168 of her crew, including her current commander, and the group's Senior Officer ‚Äì Escort (SOE), Commander Eric Tilden. Initially 35 survived the torpedoing, but only 27 managed to get on board Sunflower, which was under the command of Lieut- Commander John Treasure Jones.Tramp to Queen pp. 77‚Äì78He was promoted to Commander and on 2 June 1943 awarded Mentioned in Despatches. B7 was involved in the battles for convoys ONS 20 and ON 206, ON 207 and ON 208, during which period nine U-boats were destroyed. In February 1943 the command passed to A/Lt.Cdr. James Plomer, RCNVR and during the following nine months they would have a series of notable successes.On 19 October 1943 A/Lt.Cdr. Plomer was awarded the DSC for \\"gallantry and outstanding service in action with enemy submarines\\" after the actions in April and May. He was awarded a Bar to the DSC in Korea in 1951. He retired as a Commodore RCN. Convoy ONS5, comprising 46 merchant ships, departed Liverpool on 21 April 1943. In early May they were under sustained submarine attacks. On 5 May U-638 was sunk by Sunflower. The convoy arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 12 May. This was a major convoy battle which saw the destruction of six U-boats for the loss of thirteen ships.U-266 sank three ships on 5 May but in mid-May was caught on the surface in the Bay of Biscay by an RAF anti-submarine patrol and sunk with depth charges. Convoy N206, comprising 68 merchant ships, departed Liverpool on 11 October 1943. It arrived in New York on 27 October 1943 without loss. On 17 October U-631 was sunk in the North Atlantic, South-east of Cape Farewell, Greenland, by depth charges from Sunflower. On 29 October 1943 U-282, which had been shadowing Convoy ON208, was sunk by Hedgehog attacks carried out together with HMS Duncan and HMS Vidette.During a re-fit in February 1943 she was equipped with an anti-submarine mortar Hedgehog and prototype Sonar 147X which provided an enhanced capability of depth finding. =Normandy 1944= In May 1944 Sunflower was nominated for service in Force L for the Normandy Landings, code name Operation Neptune. She was assigned as part of Escort Group 154 with HM Corvettes Sweetbriar K209 and Oxlip K123.HMS Sweetbriar was a sister-ship from Smith‚Äôs Dock. They were employed in convoy defence during the build-up operations in the English Chanel and then retained in the Channel for convoy defence after termination of Neptune. = English Channel 1944‚Äì45= On 30 August Sunflower was deployed for Channel convoy defence based at Sheerness. By the beginning of October merchant convoys were being detached from joined ocean convoys in Southwestern Approaches and routed through the English Channel for passage to and from London because the air threat from bases in France had been removed by the military advance to Germany. In February 1945 she resumed Channel convoy defence. German submarines and E-Boats were active in Channel area for mine and attacks by snorkel fitted U-boats were being made on assembly points for convoys and coastal traffic in Home waters. In May 1945 she was paid off, de-stored and reduced to 'Reserve' status. Fate HMS Sunflower remained in 'Reserve' at Harwich until placed on the 'Disposal List' in 1947. The ship was sold for demolition by Thos W Ward at Hayle, Cornwall later that year and arrived at the breaker‚Äôs yard in August 1947.

Location  The Gollierplatz extends in an east-west direction between Trappentreustra√üe and Bergmannstra√üe on an area of approx. 10,000 m¬≤.  History  Since 1897, the square has borne the name of a Munich patrician family, presumably extinct since 1318. Located in the heart of the Westend residential district, Gollierplatz is a prominent example of Munich urban planning around 1900. Originally planned as a regular geometric element in net-like alignment, the square and its surroundings were redesigned in 1892 following a city expansion competition. The south side in particular was loosened up and provided with views in the direction of Kiliansplatz. Due to the later development of closed, monumental residential complexes, the square once again developed in a different direction and it was transformed from picturesque into a strict practicality. One of the first buildings in the squares south side was the two-wing school built by Carl Hocheder between 1889 and 1891. From 1901 to 1903, Gabriel von Seidl built the parish church of St. Rupert to the west of the school building in a neo- Romanesque style. It was not until 1926 that Ludwig Naneder added the parsonage with its hipped roof. In 1902 the striking corner house Kiliansplatz 6 with two staggered gables and a corner oriel in Neo-Renaissance style was built. At the beginning of the 20th century, several apartment buildings in late Art Nouveau style followed on the north side of Gollierplatz. After the end of the First World War, the northern side of the square between Ganghoferstra√üe, Geroltstra√üe and Bergmannstra√üe to Naneder was closed off with several monumental apartment blocks. Even larger residential complexes with inner courtyards were built on the south side between Gollierstra√üe, Kazmairstra√üe, Geroltstra√üe and Ganghoferstra√üe in the 1920s style. From 1925 to 1927, Theodor Fischer's Ledigenheim (home for single people), one of Munich's most important buildings in the early New Objectivity style, built in brick construction to the southeast. From 1930 to 1931, German Bestelmeyer oriented his Protestant-Lutheran Church of the Resurrection and the associated vicarage towards the Fischersche Ledigenheim. The Vier-Nymphen-Brunnen (Four Nymphs Fountain ) by Elmar Dietz has been located on the eastern part of the square since 1938. The individual buildings of the square are historically listed, the square is registered as an ensemble of buildings.

Early life  Vera Buch was born on 19 August 1895 Forestville, Connecticut. Her parents were John Casper Buch and Nellie Amelia Louisa Crawford. At an early age, the family moved to the Bronx New York. Buch studied at the Hunter High School and graduated from Hunter College in 1916. Shortly after that, she got tuberculosis and spent a year in a sanatorium. During her stay, she met a woman who inspired her to stury socialist economic theory.  Political activism and union organization  In 1918, Buch moved to Caldwell, New Jersey, where she got involved with the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party. She later joined the Industrial Workers of the World and the Communist Party USA. Under the Leona Smith pseudonym, she helped organizing workers during the 1926 Passaic textile strike, the first mass strike led by communists in the United States. In Passaic, she met her future husband, Albert Weisbord. They moved to Detroit, where Buch edited several left-wing factory newsletters. In 1928, she went to Pennsylvania to help organizing women of the United Mine Workers in a coal miner's strike. She was a union organizer of the Loray Mill strike of 1929 in Gastonia, North Carolina. The National Guard intervened and a local police chief was killed during the confrontation. Buch and 15 other people were arrested and were charged with the murder, but she was released when mistrial was declared. The Loray Mill Strike was the last where Buch acted on behalf of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) or the National Textile Workers Union (NTWU). Albert Weisbord was accused of being a Lovestoneite and was expelled from the CPUSA. In 1931, Buch and Weisbord founded the Communist League of Struggle to provide a Trotskyist alternative to the CPUSA. Buch and Weisbord moved to Chicago in 1935, where they continued unionizing workers, and married in 1938. In the 1940s, she worked with the Congress of Racial Equality and in the following decades she participated in the Civil Rights Movement.  Last years  In 1952, Buch studied in the Art Institute of Chicago and produced more than 200 paintings over the next two decades. In 1977, she published her autobiography A radical life.

This will be the third time police and crime commissioner elections had been held. The election was originally due to take place in May 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Background  Police and crime commissioners (PCCs) are elected representatives with responsibility for policing in each police area in England and Wales. Each police area‚Äîwith the exception of Greater London and Greater Manchester, where the directly elected mayor is the policing authority instead‚Äîelects a commissioner every four years. This is the third set of police and crime commissioner elections to be held, following the creation of the role by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 which led to the holding of the first elections in November 2012. The Policing and Crime Act 2017 amended the above Act and enabled PCCs to take on governance of the local fire and rescue service as the Fire Authority. This has been implemented by the election of Police Fire and Crime commissioners in the following areas: *Staffordshire was legislated for on 1 August 2018. *Essex was legislated for on 1 October 2018. *Northamptonshire was legislated for on 15 November 2018. *North Yorkshire was legislated for on 1 January 2019.  Postponement to 2021  Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the elections due to be held in May 2020 were delayed until May 2021; this applied to the PCC elections as well as those for local authorities and elected mayors. The postponement was implemented by the Coronavirus Act 2020 which was enacted on 25 March 2020. The act stipulates that the postponement is to be ignored in determining the years in which subsequent elections are to be held,Coronavirus Act 2020 60(13) thus the commissioners elected in 2021 will be in office for three years, not the usual four.

Controlling the Blaster Mark II \\"Phoenix\\" starfighter, the player is tasked with wiping out the Bosconian alien race before they destroy Earth. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies and avoiding projectiles ‚Äî power-ups can be collected to increase the player's abilities. It is the third and final game in Namco's Bosconian series. Development of the game was originally by Namco subsidiary N.H. Systemm, however following their bankruptcy earlier in 1990 development was then handed to Japanese developer Nova. Aisystem Tokyo assisted with programming. Final Blaster received mostly favorable reviews, being praised for its colorful graphics, unique gameplay mechanics and soundtrack, although was criticized for being too difficult and for being unable to stick out from other shooters on the system. It was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2008. Gameplay In-game screenshot. Final Blaster is a vertical- scrolling shooter video game. Controlling a starfighter, the Blaster Mark II \\"Phoenix\\", the player is tasked with wiping out the Bosconian forces before they destroy all of mankind. The Blaster starts with a \\"vulcan gun\\" to fire projectiles at enemies ‚Äî collecting red \\"power pods\\" dropped by certain enemies will increase the amount of shots that the player can fire. Blue- colored power pods can also be found, giving the player access to new weapons such as piercing lasers or zig-zagging ring shots. By holding down the fire button, the Blaster can charge up energy and eventually morph into a raging firebird, capable of destroying anything in its path. The game spans seven stages, featuring landscapes such as mechanical bases, asteroid fields and organic-like structures. Each stage also features a boss that must be defeated in order to progress. The player can also control the speed of the stage scrolling by moving up and down, which will respectively increase or decrease the scrolling. A \\"difficulty\\" meter is presented at the end of each stage, which determines how hard the next stage will be. Some of the enemies are taken from other Namco games, such as the invincible Bacura boards from Xevious. Development and release Final Blaster was released for the PC- Engine by Namco in Japan on September 28, 1990. Development was originally being handled by Namco subsidiary N.H. System, who previously developed the arcade game M√§rchen Maze, however development was later transferred to Japanese studio Nova after N.H. System was dissolved earlier in 1990. Aisystem Tokyo, a \\"group company\\" of Aisystem, assisted with programming. It is the third and final entry in Namco's Bosconian series, taking place after the events of the 1989 arcade game Blast Off. Final Blaster was digitally re- released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console on September 8, 2008. The game's soundtrack, compiled with music from M√§rchen Maze and Blast Off, was released by Japanese company Sweep Records on November 30, 2018. Reception Final Blaster received favorable reviews, often being compared to Hudson Soft's Gunhed. Reviewers praised the game's colorful graphics, interesting gameplay mechanics and soundtrack, also some disliked its high difficulty level. ACE favorably compared the game to Gunhed, praising its colorful graphics, gameplay mechanics and variety of enemies. They also praised the game's musical score and sound effects, concluding with \\"it's got the right tactics.\\" Computer + Video Games found the detailed graphics, unique gameplay features and soundtrack to make it \\"pretty damn addictive\\", while German publication Aktueller Software Markt liked its soundtrack, gameplay and graphical style. Computer + Video Games also compared it highly to Gunhed, saying that it made for a worthy competitor to Hudson's title. In their debut issue, Raze magazine briefly noted that the game stuck out from other shooters on the PC-Engine, alongside Sega's later cancelled Space Fantasy Zone. Japanese publication Famitsu praised its colorful graphics and callbacks to other Namco games such as Xevious. German magazine Power Play was more divided on the game, finding its soundtrack to be average and for hardly sticking out among other shooters released for the console. They also disliked the levels for being too short. ACE said that the game's graphics, notably the player's ship, were too small, and that the high difficulty level could put off potential players. In contrast, Computer + Video Games found the game to not have much of a challenge, claiming that hardcore fans of the genre could easily complete it. Famitsu disliked the game for not being able to stick out among other games of its type and for being too difficult, alongside it having very little to do with the original Bosconian outside of cameo appearances and the storyline.
