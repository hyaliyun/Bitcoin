History The Society of Canadian Painter-Etchers and Engravers (CPE) was founded in 1916 as a successor to the short-lived Association of Canadian Etchers, founded in 1885. William W. Alexander was a founding member. He participated in the Society's exhibitions with bookplates based on his sketches and watercolors from northern canoe trips. The CPE was relatively conservative. It favored intaglio and insisted that the artist should be involved in each stage of production including drawing, engraving or etching, and printing the block or plate. The Society began holding annual exhibitions in 1919 at the Art Gallery of Toronto. Usually these were part of larger exhibitions. The Society held exhibitions in other locations in Toronto from 1933 to 1959. The Society was formally incorporated on 1935. From 1943 to 1959 it exhibited at the Royal Ontario Museum. The Canadian Society of Graphic Art (CSGA) was exhibiting serigraphs by the mid-1930. However, the CPE would not accept silkscreen prints until 1946. Even then, it was careful to exclude commercial methods of silkscreen printing. Between 1960 and 1974 the Society's annual exhibitions were each held in a different city in Ontario. Jo Manning, who made prints between 1960 and 1980, was an executive member of the Canadian Society of Graphic Art and a member of the Canadian Society of Painter-etchers and Engravers. In June‚ÄìAugust 1971 the Society held a joint exhibition at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts with the Canadian Society of Graphic Art. The Society merged with the Canadian Society of Graphic Art in 1976 to form the Print and Drawing Council of Canada. Jo Manning was a founding member of the new Council.

The yellow-coloured areas were under the jurisdiction of the police burghs of Bonnyrigg and Lasswade. The parish lies between the rivers North Esk and South Esk, which join about 2 miles north of the parish. At Lasswade the parish reaches the North Esk which at that point forms the boundary on the north-west side, such that the suburb of Westmill on the south-east bank lies in the parish of Cockpen. The South Esk briefly forms the southern boundary of the parish then flows northward through the parish past Dalhousie Castle, exiting in the north‚Äìeast into Newbattle parish. A Parochial Board was established under the Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845. Within the parish of Cockpen a police burgh was created at Bonnyrigg in 1865 (although part lay in the parish of Lasswade). Police burghs were communities over a certain size which were entitled to police many of their own affairs, such as cleansing, street lighting and water supply as well as public order. Police burghs were run by elected commissioners or magistrates.Catalogue of Midlothian Burgh Council archives retrieved April 2016 With the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894 the Parish Council was established, but this only administered the ‚Äúlandward‚Äù part of the parish, i.e. outside Bonnyrigg.

There have been a succession of fortresses at their seat, Dalhousie Castle, which lies on the north bank of the South Esk.

Its men escaped encirclement in October and returned to Soviet lines in good enough shape to avoid disbandment. In the following two and a half years the division slogged through the difficult and costly battles around Rzhev and Smolensk before distinguishing itself by assisting in the liberation of the city of Vitebsk in June, 1944.  Formation  The division began organizing on June 26, 1941, at Kolomna in the Moscow Military District. It was one of a series of rifle divisions numbered in the 240 - 260 range that were built on cadres taken from the NKVD. Its order of battle was as follows: * 919th Rifle Regiment * 923rd Rifle Regiment * 927th Rifle Regiment * 789th Artillery Regiment * 419th Sapper Battalion * 331st Reconnaissance CompanyJack Radey and Charles Sharp, The Defense of Moscow 1941 - The Northern Flank, Pen & Sword Books Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2012, p. 222 Col. Vladimir Filippovich Stenin was named divisional commander, and the division was assigned to 30th Army of Western Front by July 13, less than three weeks after beginning to be formed. On its arrival at the front the unit did not make a favorable impression on the Army commander, Maj. Gen. V.A. Khomenko, who reported on August 5: > ... the division is without equipment... no formed [anti-]chemical > company... artillery didn't arrive until early August on three trains... 400 > NKVD cadre, lots of Party members and Komsomols, but so few and weak horses > that the artillery regiment had to move in relays... very little combat > power.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Order of Battle World War II, > Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 46 30th Army had tried to remedy these faults by assigning a battalion of 21 tanks from the 110th Tank Division to the 251st, but by the date of the above report only one of these tanks remained, and the division had also lost 3,898 officers and men killed, wounded or missing; the 919th and 923rd Rifle Regiments were down to just 247 and 379 men, respectively, due to the heavy fighting around Smolensk.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 46 Beginning on August 25, Western Front began a series of counterattacks known as the Dukhovshchina Offensive against the overstretched forces of German Army Group Center. Along with the rest of its Army, the 251st drove against elements of German Ninth Army, in particular 35th Infantry Division, in and near the village of Gorodno, and while making some minor gains and inflicting losses on the invaders, these attacks were very costly and were shut down by September 10 along the whole front.David M. Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, Helion and Company, Solihull, UK, 2012, pp. 162 - 300 On October 2 the Germans launched their Operation Typhoon in an attempt to drive for Moscow. 30th Army was north of the main German effort, but in spite of this three of its divisions, the 251st, the 162nd and the 242nd Rifles, found themselves encircled south of Rzhev by October 12. Ninth Army could only cordon off the pocket with small detachments, due to being once again overstretched. After holding out for 15 days, the three divisions staged a successful breakout to the north on October 27, and reached the lines of 29th Army before the end of the month, covering some 75 km and causing damage and confusion in the German rear. While the other two divisions were disbanded for replacements, the 251st was not, although at the end of the year its strength was no more than 2,000 men. It was rebuilt over the following months.Radey and Sharp, p. 163  Battles of Rzhev  The 251st Rifle Division remained in Western Front (and its successor, 3rd Belorussian Front) until August, 1944. During this period it participated in the Second Rzhev‚ÄìSychevka Offensive Operation (Operation Mars) in November, 1942. Now in 20th Army, and under the command of Col. B.B. Gorodovikov, the division launched an attack on the Vazuza River sector, supported by 83rd Tank Brigade, on November 25, towards the German-held village of Grediakino. The German forces were very well dug-in and, due to poor visibility, the preparatory artillery bombardment had been relatively ineffective; the attack was repulsed with heavy losses. While the Germans were eventually forced to abandon the village on November 30, the offensive was stalled and the 251st would have to be rebuilt once again;David M. Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 83, 92, 182-86 in the period from November 25 to December 18 the division lost 765 men killed, 1,911 wounded, and 328 missing-in-action, for a total of 3,004 casualties.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p. 89 On August 12, 1943, Lt. Col. A.A. Volkhin was appointed to command the division. Volkhin had an unusual background. He was a pre-war Major General and was appointed to command the 147th Rifle Division in May, 1942. While leading this division in Stalingrad Front in July, defending the Don River near Surovikino, his troops were partially encircled and suffered heavy losses. Volkhin was arrested and condemned to death for having lost control of his unit, but this was commuted in December to 10 years imprisonment to be served after the war. In February, 1943 he was released and returned to the front with the rank of Major, to take up the position of deputy commander of 927th Rifle Regiment. Within a week he was in command of the same regiment, and in March his sentence was annulled. On January 17, 1944, he was restored to the rank of Major General, and he remained in command of the 251st until July 11, when he was moved to command the 45th Rifle Corps.http://www.generals.dk/general/Volkhin/Aleksandr_Alekseevich/Soviet_Union.html  Operation Bagration  By June, 1944 the 251st was serving in 5th Guards Rifle Corps of 39th Army. As part of Operation Bagration, this Army was drive westwards to help pinch off the German-held salient at Vitebsk. Starting on June 23, the Corps, with the 251st in second echelon, smashed through the lines of the German VI Corps, crossing the Dvina River and linking up with 43rd Army the following day and trapping the Third Panzer Army in a pocket. On June 27 the two Soviet armies launched their final assault on Vitebsk, leading to the surrender of most of the German forces. A group of 5,000 Germans attempted to break out, but were soon surrounded and defeated by three rifle divisions, including the 251st.Walter S.

Shaw Sr. (December 20, 1916 in Vineland, New Jersey - July 21, 1996) was an American telecommunications engineer and inventor who clashed with his employer (variously identified as AT&T;, Bell and Southern Bell) over ownership of his inventions. As a result, he quit and eventually ended up supplying the Mafia with black boxes capable of making free and untraceable telephone calls. In 1976, he was convicted of \\"illegal phone usage\\" and sent to prison. Biography He was born on December 20, 1916 in Vineland, New Jersey to Amanda and Edward Shaw. Shaw went to work for AT&T; or Bell or Southern Bell in 1935. In his spare time, he invented things, eventually obtaining 39 patents. His inventions or inventions based on his patents include: the speakerphone, call forwarding, conference calling and the answering machine. In 1954, he was asked by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to create the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline, the \\"red telephone\\" connecting the two superpowers. When his bosses repeatedly tried to get him to sign over the rights to his inventions and patents, he quit after 14 years on the job. Since his former employer enjoyed a telephone monopoly in the United States, he was unsuccessful in reaping any rewards from his inventions, until he became involved with the Mafia. He devised a black box to make free, untraceable long distance telephone calls, which was a boon for bookmaking and other criminal activities. He was called to testify before the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1961 and again in 1971. Shaw was convicted in 1976 on eight counts of \\"illegal phone usage\\". His son, Walter T. Shaw Jr., became embittered by the treatment accorded his father. He left home at the age of 16 and became a prolific jewel thief, credited with over 2000 robberies, before reforming. After serving 11 years in prison, Shaw Jr. reconciled with his father. Walter L. Shaw died of prostate cancer on July 21, 1996 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Legacy Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs built and sold blue boxes which worked like Shaw's black box to provide free telephone calls, which has led some sources to presume a connection. As Jobs would later comment, \\"If it hadn‚Äôt been for the blue boxes, there wouldn‚Äôt have been an Apple\\". In 2002, it was announced that Ben Kingsley would star in All or Nothin, a crime drama about Walter L. Shaw and his son, though nothing seems to have come of the project. Shaw Jr. produced Genius on Hold, a 2013 documentary film about his father.

Wood was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault against a police officer. He was sentenced to death for each murder and received 15-year prison sentences, set to run concurrently, for the aggravated assault convictions.http://www.leagle.com/decision/1994233180Ariz53_1222.xml/STATE%20v.%20WOOD Wood was scheduled to be executed with a combination of midazolam and hydromorphone, which had only been used once previously for the January 2014 execution of Dennis McGuire in Ohio. McGuire's execution had also been described as \\"botched\\", due to McGuire appearing to snort, gasp, and convulse during a procedure that lasted 25 minutes. From 1890 to 2010, the rate of botched lethal injections in the United States was 7.1%, higher than any other form of execution, with firing squads at 0%, the electric chair at 1.9%, hanging at 3.1%, and the gas chamber at 5.4%.  Execution  The execution began at 1:52 p.m. MST and ended at 3:49 p.m. when Wood was pronounced dead. It involved injecting Wood with the drug cocktail of Midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a narcotic, that was supposed to be lethal, 15 times, even though one dose was supposed to be sufficient to kill him. Wood gasped and snorted for well over an hour, and a media witness compared Wood's breathing to a \\"fish gulping for air\\". An Associated Press reporter said Wood gasped more than 600 times. Experts stated that the execution should have taken about ten minutes. Wood's lawyers filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court an hour into the procedure, requesting that the prolonged execution be halted. In the motion, they wrote: \\"He has been gasping and snorting for more than an hour. ... He is still alive.\\" The appeal was denied by Justice Anthony Kennedy, with word coming half an hour after Wood's death. After the execution, Debra Dietz's sister told the Associated Press: \\"What I saw today with him being executed, it is nothing compared to what happened on August 7, 1989,\\" Jeanne Brown said. \\"What's excruciating is seeing your father lying there in a pool of blood, seeing your sister lying in a pool of blood.\\"  Aftermath  Governor Jan Brewer ordered a review of the state's execution procedures, citing concern with the length of time it took Wood to die. Regarding the execution, Brewer said: \\"One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer. This is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims ‚Äì and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family.\\" Charles Ryan, director of Arizona's department of corrections, said in a statement: \\"Once the inmate was sedated, other than sonorous respiration, or snoring, he did not grimace or make any further movement. Throughout this execution, I conferred and collaborated with our IV team members and was assured unequivocally that the inmate was comatose and never in pain or distress.\\" Stephanie Grisham, then a spokeswoman for the Arizona attorney general's office, who was also a witness, said: \\"There was no gasping of air. There was snoring. He just laid there. It was quite peaceful.\\" Maya Foa, of anti-death penalty group Reprieve, said: \\"The state of Arizona had every reason to believe that this procedure would not go smoothly; the experimental execution 'cocktail' had only been used once before, and that execution too was terribly botched. Despite the evidence, the state pushed ahead, jettisoning due process and cloaking the procedure in secrecy. The result was an exercise in torture.\\" Dale Baich, Wood's public defender, decried the execution as a violation of the Constitution's prohibition of \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\", and said it could have been prevented. On July 24, 2014, Arizona temporarily halted executions following the Wood case, pending a review of its procedures.

History In 1937, Fritz Leiber and his college friend Harry Otto Fischer created a wargame set within the world of Nehwon, which Fischer had helped to create. This game initially used the \\"Lahkmar\\" spelling, and was played on a large (five feet by two and a half feet) three-dimensional board made of layers of corrugated colored paper representing various terrains. Gary Gygax, Robert J. Kuntz, and Brad Stock redeveloped the game for publication by TSR in 1976. The game was originally to have been published by Guidon Games. Gameplay The published game is played on a smaller, conventional board, and features elements that had become common in wargames during the intervening years, such as hexagon shaped spaces and randomized combat results (rather than the squares and simple captures of the original version). This is a rare case of a game adaptation written by the creators of the stories the game is based on. The TSR game is for 2-4 players, each of whom takes a hero (Fafhrd, the Gray Mouser, Pulgh, or Movarl) and leads the forces of one of the powers of Nehwon in an effort to capture the opponents' citadels. This oppositional stance is unusual for the series, though there were a few times in the stories where Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser were temporarily committed to opposing sides. The TSR game is simple and includes bits of color from the series, such as geases that send the heroes around the board chasing various goals at the behest of Sheelba, Ningauble, or various gods. Reception Fred Hemmings reviewed Lankhmar for White Dwarf #2 , giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \\"The game has its faults [...] despite these and other minor flaws, Lankhmar is a game well worth playing.\\" Eric Goldberg reviewed Lankhmar in Ares Magazine #1, rating it a 3 out of 9. Goldberg commented that \\"The basic mistake committed in Lankhmar is the design approach: the stories depend on a great degree of uncertainty (or mystery), which is absent in the game.\\" References External links * Category:Board games introduced in 1976 Category:Board wargames Category:Fantasy board games Category:TSR, Inc. games ","title":"Lankhmar (board game)"},{"id":"43379873","text":"The Danville Register & Bee is a daily newspaper serving Danville, Virginia, United States, published seven days a week.

The organization is involved in education, research, and advocacy on behalf of patients and maxillofacial surgeons. American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons  History  The American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons (ASMS) was founded in 1947. Early members were largely dual-trained in dentistry and medicine. Over the ensuing years, a relationship with the American Medical Association and American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (now the American Society of Plastic Surgeons was fostered. After development of formal maxillofacial training programs and later the birth of the field of craniofacial surgery, the scope of training required for ASMS membership broadened to include surgeons with an MD degree and formal maxillofacial training.Cohen SR, Juhala CA, Manson PN, Crawley WA, Jacobs JS. History of the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons: 1947-1997. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. 1997 Sep;100(3):766-801.  Education and research  Education of trainees and peers has been an organizational objective since the inception of the ASMS. The Kazanjian lectureship was initiated in 1966. This now biennial lectureship currently alternates with the Converse lectureship at the ASMS portion of the annual meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The maxillofacial basics workshop was founded in 1979. Fundamentals of maxillofacial surgery and basic techniques for management of maxillofacial trauma and orthognathic conditions are taught to residents and fellows around North America semiannually. In 1998, the ASMS initiated a one-day intensive lecture series preceding the annual meeting of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Each year, the ASMS pre-conference symposium provides multi-disciplinary education on topics in the field of craniomaxillofacial surgery for students, surgeons- in-training, and practicing plastic and maxillofacial surgeons. In 2003, two educational fellowships were established to foster the advanced learning in the field of craniomaxillofacial surgery.Cohen MN, Evans GR, Wexler A, Thaller SR, Sadove AM.

The organization also offers grants for research on maxillofacial conditions.  Maxillofacial conditions  American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons initiatives focus on problems with facial form or function, including congenital craniofacial differences, traumatic facial injuries, reconstruction after head and neck cancer, and problems with bite. Congenital craniofacial differences are conditions affecting the head and face that present at or shortly after birth such as craniosynostosis, cleft lip and palate, hemifacial microsomia (aka craniofacial microsomia, oculoauriculovertebral spectrum, or Goldenhar syndrome), and Treacher Collins syndrome (aka mandibulofacial dysostosis). Traumatic facial injuries include orbital (eye socket) fracture, mandible (jaw) fracture, nasal fracture (broken nose), and dog bite. Treatment of head and neck cancer and skin cancer of the face often results in missing tissue requiring jaw reconstruction, skin reconstruction, and nose reconstruction. Problems with occlusion (bite) may be treated with orthognathic surgery.

According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Rusafa had a population of 1,608 in the 2004 census. Its inhabitants are predominantly Alawites.Honigman, p. 791. It is the site of a former Ismaili fortress. Fortress At the northern edge of the village is the fortress of al-Rusafa, which is situated on a hill 60 meters higher than the village itself. The fortress is largely preserved, although it is mostly covered by trees and vegetation. In the medieval period, it acted as a subsidiary fortress for the main Ismaili fortress of Masyaf. At its largest extent, it measures roughly 75 meters by 30 meters and is oval-shaped. The fortress was constructed from stone from local quarries and it consists of three stories. The entrance in the northwestern section of the fortress is guarded by a tower. The outer walls are dominated by galleries and chambers, which presumably played the role of battlements. The lowest floor contains several storage rooms, a number of which were built 20 meters deep into the ground. The middle area of al- Rusafa is marked by the extensive presence of vaulted rooms. Although ruined, the central towers \\"are still high\\" according to Peter Willey, an authority on Ismaili castles.Peter Willey . The Institute of Ismaili Studies. History Al-Rusafa was taken over by the Nizari Ismailis around 1140 CE along with other fortresses in the vicinity, namely Masyaf, Khawabi, al-Maniqa and Qulay'a.Willey, 2005, p. 44. The fortress was rebuilt by the Ismaili da'i (chief) Rashid ad-Din Sinan in the 1160s.Willey, 2005, p. 46. It is possible that another fortress stood in its place prior to the Ismaili conquest. In May 1271, the Bahri Mamluk sultan Baibars besieged and captured al-Rusafa from the Ismailis.Daftary, 2007, p. 433.

He is also a Professor of Government and Public Policy, and Professor of Sociology in the McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship, at the Eller College of Management. He has published three books, edited five anthologies, authored hundreds of articles, and is cited in numerous fields, such as collective violence, international relations, world-systems analysis, environmental sociology, cultural sociology and organizational sociology. Career Albert Bergesen attended the University of California, Santa Barbara and received a BA in 1964 in History. He went on to attend Stanford University and completed an M.A. in Education in 1966. Continuing his education at Stanford University, Bergesen completed his M.A. in 1971 and his PhD in 1974, both in Sociology. In 1973, Bergesen took a position as Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona. He advanced to Full Professor in 1987. In 1995, Bergesen was a Fellow at the Udall Center for the Study of Public Policy, and in 2003, he was a Visiting Professor of Sociology at Stanford University. Contributions Bergesen's 1980 publication \\"Official Violence During the Watts, Newark, and Detroit Race Riots of the 1960s\\" was awarded an Honorable Mention for the Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. His 1992 article \\"Regime Change in the Semiperiphery: Democratization in Latin America and the Socialists Bloc\\" and his 1995 article \\"The rise of Semiotic Marxism\\" won the Distinguished Contribution Award from the Pacific Sociological Association for best article published in Sociological Perspectives within a two-year period. In 2003, Bergesen co-authored the book God in the Movies with sociologists of religion Andrew Greeley, in which the \\"authors show that the religious imagination is irrepressible, and shows up in our best-known example of popular cultures, movies.\\" The book emerged from a class Greely first taught at the University of Chicago, and then co-taught with Bergesen at the University of Arizona. In the introduction, both sociologists take a unique stance as self-proclaimed theists and argue that it is not sociology's place to argue whether there is a god, but rather what such a god might be like. Reviewer Carl Flynn contends that \\"as a collection, these essays make a substantial contribution to the broadening dialogue in academic circles about the interaction between theology and film in modern society.\\" However, the book was also written for popular appeal as one media piece describes it:\\"\\"God in the Movies,\\" is a treasure map for moviegoers looking for the deeper spiritual significance of today's films, especially in movies where God makes an appearance.\\" In the preface to the first edition, well-known movie critic Roger Ebert states that \\"what is so valuable about...this book [Greeley] has written with Bergesen, is that it reminds readers and students that movies really are about something...They embody our dreams, desires, and aspirations, and give form to them. And if God takes the form of Audrey Hepburn-well, why not?\\" Bergesen, with colleagues Robert Wuthnow, James Davison Hunter, and Edith Kurzweil, is the editor of the anthology Cultural Analysis: The Work of Peter L. Berger, Mary Douglas, Michel Foucault, and J√ºrgen Habermas. First published in 1984, it is now in its fifth edition. In addition to the sociology of culture, Bergesen has made several contributions to world-systems analysis, including editing three anthologies, Studies of the Modern World-System published in 1980; Crisis in the World- System in 1983; and America's Changing Role in the World-System with Terry Boswell published in 1987. He has also been the editor of three special issues of academic journals: on the \\"World-systems and the Environment\\" in 1997 and on \\"Global Inequality\\" in 2002 for the Journal of World-Systems Research; and in 1982 on \\"World-System Studies\\" for the Anthro-Tech: A Journal of Speculative Anthropology. His most recent work focuses on terrorism, collective violence and transnational sociology. He wrote the entry \\"Terrorism\\" in The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization, and an introduction to research terrorism for a special issue of the journal Mobilization, in which he argues for a comparative-historical approach to terrorism studies. He also completed an edited anthology of the work of the radical Islamic scholar Sayyid Qutb, published in 2008.

She studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto and graduated in 1945. She married, and became known as Jo Rothfels. She returned to the OCA in 1960 to study printmaking as a special student. She took up etching in 1962. After a divorce in 1971 she reverted to her maiden name. In 1971 she studied process camera techniques and color separation at George Brown College, Toronto.

Around 1980 she became ill from exposure to chemicals and moved away from etching into ink drawing and oil and watercolor painting. After many years of creating works in different media, culminating in watercolour and graphite grasses and black ink tree trunks as detailed as her early etchings, Manning turned to writing, to document both the early print world in Canada, and her own personal journey as a woman artist. Her first book, A Printmaker's Memoir: A Personal History of an Era, was published in 2009. Manning chronicles \\"the past seventy years of printmaking in Canada\\" through the eyes of a young woman trying to find her place in the Canadian art world as a skilled artist and printmaker. Manning's second book, Etched in Time, published in 2016, expanded on the role of women artists in Canada. Etched in Time is a far more personal book, sharing mysteries within her own family, as well as her passage through the art world during World War II, \\"marriage, betrayal, divorce, and her own artistic career as one of Canada's foremost printmakers.\\" Exhibitions and reception Manning's work has been included in many group shows in North America, Europe and Australia.

He also had a debilitating loss of eyesight. Death and legacy Slaughter died on January 25, 1919 in Dallas, Texas. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Dallas. Shortly after his death, his son Bob Slaughter accused his uncle Bill Slaughter (C.C.'s brother), who managed the Long S Ranch, of trying to sell the Western S Ranch in Hudspeth County, Texas to Mexican ranchers, even though the ranch belonged to his son. As a result, Bob shot his uncle; this resulted in a US$3 million slander suit filed by the uncle against his nephew Bob. By 1921, his heirs divided his Long S Ranch and other land holdings, and sold them. One of his daughters, Nelle (Slaughter) DeLoache, married Ira P. DeLoache (1879-1965), the real estate developer who founded Preston Hollow. Secondary sources *Clarke, Mary Whatley. The Slaughter Ranches and Their Makers. Austin: Jenkins, 1979. *Murrah, David J..

Originally called \\"White Hall\\", the building is a two-and-a-half- story structure made of Flemish brick bond. Nicholas Ridgley inherited the property in 1800.

Samuel Hopkins became the Republican president of the Howard County Commissioners in 1865. Clark was a partner with William Thompson Walters at importing Percheron horses. It is the place where James A. Clark, Jr.'s mother Alda Hopkins was born and raised. The home was renamed to \\"Hickory Ridge\\" after a Hopkins family home in southern Anne Arundel county. A family graveyard is located on the property, which has since been subdivided for residential development. Joel Kline, the real estate investor known for the downfall of Spiro Agnew, held the trust on the 207.56-acre property in 1970. The current estate was reduced to just 22.71 acres.

However israpafant binds far more tightly to the platelet-activating factor receptor, with an IC50 of 0.84nM for inhibiting PAF-induced human platelet aggregation (compared to etizolam's IC50 of 998nM at this target), while it binds only weakly to benzodiazepine receptors, with a Ki of 3680nM.

It was first published in complete form by HarperCollins in 2013. Plot An aerial photographer takes a photograph of a Parsi dakhma, also known as a tower of silence, a structure used to expose the bodies of the dead to carrion birds. This is deeply offensive to the Parsi population of Mumbai, and one of their number sets out to exact revenge for this insult. British detective Sexton Blake matches wits with him, and the two are soon engaged in a cat and mouse game across the city. Background The events of The Tower of Silence are based upon a real life incident: in August 1923 the British illustrated newspaper The Graphic printed an aerial photograph of a dakhma in Pune, taken from an angle that displayed the corpses inside. The photograph caused such outrage that the Secretary of State for India requested that the editor of The Graphic destroy both the photographic plate and negative. Gyan Prakash, a professor of history at Princeton University, came across a portion of the manuscript for The Tower of Silence in the British Library while conducting research in 2001. Having read the first half of the novel, and unable to find any information about the author, Phiroshaw Jamsetjee Chevalier, he began a search for the rest of the text. Despite the book never having been published, Prakash was able to locate a complete version of the manuscript in the Secretariat Library in Mumbai three years later. Mark Hodder, an expert of Sexton Blake, doubts Prakash's claim. Reception Much of the coverage of the release of The Tower of Silence focussed on the unique nature of its discovery and publication. In relation to the novel itself, Mumbai Boss stated that it was only an average detective story, but that \\"it keeps you hooked thanks to the fantastically quirky character that is Beram and the way the book captures the sentiment of the Parsi community at the time.\\" References Category:2013 Indian novels Category:Novels set in India Category:HarperCollins books Category:Sexton Blake Category:Novels set in the 1920s ","title":"The Tower of Silence (novel)"},{"id":"43380558","text":"North/South Convergence is the debut studio album for both American keyboardist/composer-arranger Lee Tomboulian and his Latin jazz ensemble Circo, recorded in September 2000 and released on December 3, 2001 by Circo Records.

History First named Rio Chiquito for the river running through the area, Talpa was settled during the early 18th century during the time that nearby Ranchos de Taos began to be settled. The settlement is on the old Spanish land grant of Don Cristobal de la Sena. The name of the town may have been derived from the town of Talpa in Jalisco, Mexico or it may have been named for Se√±ora Talpa Romero, of a prominent Taos family. About 1820 a private chapel was built for the Duran family in Talpa along the Rio Chiquito.

She also boasted a bronze at the 2003 Asian Wrestling Championships in Delhi, India, but ended the same fate with another silver in a rematch against Yoshida by the following year, repeating their final in the process from the Asian Games. When women's wrestling made its debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Lee qualified for her South Korean squad in the 55 kg class. Earlier in the process, she captured a gold medal over Italy's Diletta Giampiccolo from the inaugural Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tunis, Tunisia, and placed second behind Yoshida at the Asian Championships in Tokyo, Japan to guarantee her spot on South Korea's Olympic wrestling team. In the prelim pool, Lee lost her opening match 2‚Äì5 to France's Anna Gomis, but rallied her campaign to pin and upset Greece's Sofia Poumpouridou in front of the home crowd inside Ano Liossia Olympic Hall. Despite missing a spot for the semifinals, Lee seized her opportunity to determine a fifth spot against China's Sun Dongmei, but fell short in their classification match with a close 3‚Äì4 decision. Lee initially placed eighth in the final standings, but later upgraded to seventh, as Puerto Rico's Mabel Fonseca was disqualified from the tournament after being tested positive for stanozolol.

The Kyrgyz are a Turkic ethnic group and form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. There are 202,500 Kyrgyz in China. They are known in China as Kƒì'ƒõrk√®zƒ´ z√∫ ().  Kyrgyz in Qing China  Kyrgyz leaders requested Qing officials to grant them titles and honors. The Kyrgyz traditional homeland between the expanding Russian and Qing Empires gradually came under attack from external military forces, and was subsequently reduced in size as the Russians and Qing annexed territory. The area, now known as Kyrgyzstan, is part of a much larger geo-political area known as Central Asia which in turn contains a variety of ethnolinguistic groups including Uzbeks, Oirots, Kazakhs, Turkmen, Tajiks, Mongols and Uyghurs. In the case of the Kyrgyz, the area that would become a geographical political entity was demarcated by the Chinese and the Russians. According to Steven Parham in his book ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Borderlands: The Faultline of Central Asia‚Äù, the border that would mark the ends of China and Russia was ‚Äúnot drawn by those it came to divide.‚Äù While it is theorized that the Kyrgyz originated along the Yenisei River in modern-day Siberia, the plains of Central Asia is considered to be the traditional homeland of the Kyrgyz. During the Russian Empire's encroachment into Central Asia, the Kyrgyz were subjugated to a series of atrocities that caused them to cross the border into Qing territory. Historically, the Kyrgyz had moved freely between the then contemporary borders of Russia and China; however, after the Qing push westward under the Qianlong Emperor and the Tsarist push South-Eastward the traditional nomadic lands that the Kyrgyz had inhabited were constricted and eventually swallowed up by the land-hungry dynasties. Kyrgyz attitudes towards Russians was initially neutral as their first interaction with the Russian Empire was in the context of Russo-Kazakh fighting, specifically the Russian attack on the Khan of Kokand in the 1850s. Prior to Russian expansion into traditional Kyrgyz lands, the Kazakhs had begun a series of raids on Kyrgyz settlements in an attempt to increase their authority in the region as well as drum up support and popularity amongst the local inhabitants. Thus upon the arrival of the Cossacks (who had been fighting against the Kazakhs since the 1730s), the Kyrgyz were excited to gain an ally that was militarily superior to the Kazakhs, despite also being militarily superior to themselves. In 1860 Cossacks from the Russian Empire sacked the city of Bishkek, the centre of Kyrgyz life, and annexed the region for the empire. Despite the taking of their capital city, the Kyrgyz were supportive of the Russians. This is due to the fact that the Kyrgyz had grown to dislike their Khan, who had in turn been put in place by the Kazakhs, whom the Tsar hoped to depose. By 1865 the Kyrgyz were fully subordinate to the Russians and by 1895 Turkmenistan had been fully incorporated into the Russian Empire. Kyrgyz attitudes towards the Chinese was considerably more varied. As a tribal union made up of various individual tribal groups each headed by their own chief, to say that the Chinese subjugated all Kyrgyz is false both historically and ethnologically. What can be said; however, is that the Kyrgyz in the eastern part of Turkistan were increasingly subjugated to the expansionist and violent tendencies of the Qing Emperor, while the Kyrgyz in the rest of Turkistan supported the resistance of their brethren in the east. Historically, Kyrgyz peoples had interacted with the Jungars (Dzungars), and other Mongol groups, many of whom had been incorporated into the banner system used by the Manchus during the Ming-Qing transition. The sudden absence of Mongol presence to the north meant that Kyrgyz tribes could relax. However, the Jungar presence in the region was still dominate over Kyrgyz and proved to be adversarial. The Jungars would eventually succumb to Qing expansion into Xinjiang during the Dzungar Genocide of 1757. After the explosion of the Jungars, ethnic Han Chinese poured into Xinjiang essentially replacing the lands that they had dominated. Thus the Kyrgyz had traded one dominant group for another, and the Han would prove to be just as destructive to the Kyrgyz as their predecessors had. Kyrygz life post-Jungar saw the rise of settlement, subjugation to Chinese political and military systems, and the end of self-governance and autonomy. Kyrgyz, and indeed other Central Asian groups), now had to embrace the new Chinese imperial system, it marked ‚Äúthe moment in which Kyrgyz and Pamiri first encountered the political system that was to force local leaders to acknowledge a new logic of interaction based on exclusive loyalty to a state, due to their belonging on territory claimed by that state‚Äù. This theme of settlement and suzerainty would continue to be an aspect of Kyrgyz life into the present. The integration of the Kyrgyz, as well as the other ethnic groups which lived in East Turkistan, into China as Xinjiang marked the beginning of modern China as a multi-ethnic state which stretched well past China proper and the Han-Manchu population. Kyrgyz-Qing relations in the 19th century were decisively more violent as uprising throughout Xinjiang led to attacks on Chinese establishments and individuals by Turkic peoples, including the Kyrgyz. During the Kokand revolt, the Kyrgyz played a secondary role, occasionally aiding the Qing and occasionally revolting. The Kyrgyz took an opportunistic approach to rebelling against the Qing, especially during the 15 year long Dungan Revolt. Led by Siddiq Beg, it was common for Kyrgyz to revolt against the Qing when other Turkic peoples or Chinese Muslims did. It was just as easy for them to support the Qing when the tables would turn, as they would eventually resulting in a Qing victory in Xinjiang. In the 19th century, Russian settlers on traditional Kirghiz land drove a lot of the Kirghiz over the border to China, causing their population to increase in China. Compared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.  Kyrgyz in The People's Republic of China  To escape Russians slaughtering them in 1916, Kyrgyz escaped in the \\"Urkun\\" mass flight to China. The Kirghiz of Xinjiang revolted in the 1932 Kirghiz rebellion, and also participated in the Battle of Kashgar (1933), and the Battle of Kashgar (1934). They are found mainly in the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture in the southwestern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with a smaller remainder found in the neighboring Wushi (Uqturpan), Aksu, Shache (Yarkand), Yingisar, Taxkorgan and Pishan (Guma), and in Tekes, Zhaosu (Monggolkure), Emin (Dorbiljin), Bole (Bortala), Jinghev (Jing) and Gongliu County in northern Xinjiang.\\"The Kyrgyz ‚Äì Children of Manas. –ö—ã—Ä–≥—ã–∑–¥–∞—Ä ‚Äì –ú–∞–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã–Ω –±–∞–ª–¥–∞—Ä—ã\\".

Their language and culture is very similar to the Kazakhs in China. Others live in sedentary towns and villages. The Islam practiced by the Kyrgyz of China incorporates many elements of shamanism and traditional practices. Common dress for Kyrgyz men includes black or blue sleeveless long gowns made out of camel hair, sheep skin, or cotton cloth (in the summer). This robe is usually worn over a white embroidered shirt and leather trousers. Both genders wear leather boots but women's boots are embroidered as well. Kyrgyz women commonly wear a wide collarless jacket and vest over a long dress. Clothing accessories include leather belts which nomadic Kyrgyz tend to hang a flint (to start a fire) or a small knife on. Women routinely wear silver chains in their hair. Both the men and women wear a small corduroy skullcap which is sometimes placed over a high-topped leather hat. Women occasionally wear a bright headscarf over their cap.

It is produced by V. Anand Prasad on Bhavya Creations banner. Kona Venkat and Gopimohan provided the screenplay. Vetri is the cinematographer, S. R. Sekhar is the editor and Anup Rubens is the music director for the film. It was launched formally on 11 April 2014 at Film Nagar in Hyderabad. The film released worldwide on 26 September 2014. The film was successful at the box- office, spurring remakes in Bengali (Besh Korechi Prem Korechi), Kannada (Ram- Leela) and Tamil (Sakka Podu Podu Raja). The film was later dubbed in Hindi as Ek Khiladi in 2015 by Goldmines Telefilms. Plot Loukyam opens with Venky (Gopichand) kidnapping the sister of Babji (Sampath Raj), as she is marrying Bharath (Bharath Reddy) although she is in love with someone else (Anand Ramaraju). He goes to Hyderabad and waits for everything in his home, Warangal to clear. He stays with his friend, Shyamala (Satyam Rajesh). There he falls for Chandrakala (Rakul Preet Singh), the sister of Sathya (Rahul Dev), a don in Hyderabad. Chandrakala rags other students in the college using her brother's power. After her initial rejection, Venky gets her to reciprocate his feelings. Meanwhile, Babji comes to Hyderabad in order to reach Sippy (Brahmanandam), the driver who helped Venky kidnap Babji's sister. Babji, unaware of the fact that he is traveling in Sippy's taxi, goes around Hyderabad with Boiling star Bablu (Prudhviraj), a rising Television star. Meanwhile, Keshava Reddy (Mukesh Rishi), a politician is behind Chandrakala's life. He conducts an attack on her through which Venky comes to know that Chandrakala is actually Babji's second sister and that he had sent her with Sathya to Hyderabad to maintain a low profile. Babji readies Chandrakala to marry Bharath. He also continues to search for whoever (Venky) abducted his sister. Using the help of Nano Shastri (Krishna Bhagavaan), Venky manages to get Babji and Chandrakala into his house. He also comes to know that the reason Kesava Reddy wants to kill Chandrakala is that his younger sister committed suicide because she loved Babji although he did not reciprocate the same. He hires Hamsa Sippy (Hamsa Nandini), Sippy's wife, to act as his father, Meka Papa Rao (Chandra Mohan) a.k.a. Puppy's wife. He tells Babji's elder sister to come back on the engagement day to act as if not married and Babji fixes the marriage of his elder sister with Bharat. But unexpectedly, they all come to know that the girl is pregnant and so Bharat refuses to marry. Then Venky tells Babji that his brother who is actually Babji's sister's husband and is acting as Venky's brother will marry his sister. Babji agrees for the wedding and, in turn, tells Chandrakala that she is to marry Bharat again. Through an attack incident, Venky comes to know that Bharat is Kesava Reddy's son. He tells Kesava Reddy that even Babji is aware of this fact and is planning to kill Bharat on a trip to Srisailam. Kesava Reddy ends up believing him and attacks Babji and the group on the way. He foolishly reveals to Babji that Bharat is his son and that he is aware Babji will kill him. When Kesava Reddy realizes his folly, he kidnaps Chandrakala and Bharat and escapes from the spot. Boiling star Bablu who mistakes it to be a serial shoot stops Kesava Reddy on the way which gives Venky enough time to reach Kesava Reddy.

His life was the basis of the film My Brother‚Ä¶Nikhil (directed by Onir) and the novel The Lost Flamingoes of Bombay by Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi. D'Souza was a frequent blood donor and a worker at the World Wildlife Fund. In 1989, after mandatory blood testing under The Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985, he was found to have contracted HIV, making him Goa's patient zero for the virus. Upon learning he was infected, authorities forcibly quarantined him, keeping him isolated in a tuberculosis ward for 64 days. He legally fought against the quarantine and, following his release, resigned his position at the World Wildlife Fund. Together with his friend Isabel de Santa Rita Vas, he founded the HIV/AIDS non-governmental organization Positive People in April 1992. D'Souza died in a Mumbai hospital in May 1992, a month after registering the new organization.  Early Life  Dominic D'Souza was born in British Colonial Africa. He returned to his ancestral home in Parra, Goa when he was still fairly young. There he lived with his mother, his aunt, and some of his siblings. The D'Souza's were practicing Goan Catholics. As a young man he was one of the first actors to participate in the Mustard Seed Art Company, Goa's most notable English-language theater, founded by Isabel de Santa Rita Vas. He performed in the company's first two shows.Aguiar, Nora. \\"Seagulls Over Goa: The Life and Legacy of Dominic D'Souza\\". May 2020.  Imprisonment and Court Case  On the morning of February 14th, 1989, Dominic was taken from his Parra home which he shared with his mother and aunt by a local police officer who asked him to accompany him to the police station in Mapusa, Goa. Upon arrival to the police station, Dominic was escorted to the local Asilo Hospital in a police van with no indication why he was there. He was familiar with the Asilo Hospital, being a frequent blood donor. He was placed in a room and interrogated about his health. Dominic tried to learn why he was being detained, but none of the doctors would answer his questions. From the room, he caught a glimpse of a doctor recording his name in a register labeled 'AIDS' and this was how he learned of his diagnosis. The police handcuffed him and escorted him to an abandoned tuberculosis sanitorium in Corlim, Goa. He was locked inside with armed guards standing at attention just outside the doors. He spent 64 days in quarantine. While he was isolated, his mother Lucy D'Souza filed a writ petition in the Panaji bench of the Bombay High Court, which presided over Goa even though Bombay was a part of Maharashtra. She and the legal team led by Anand Grover argued that Section 53 of the Goa Public Health Act--a section added in the 1987 amendment to specify restrictions and provisions regarding AIDS--violated articles 14, 19, 21, and 226 of the Indian Constitution, as well as the government-endorsed World Health Organization guidelines. Though the case dragged on for months, the court issued an interim order in mid-April releasing Dominic from the sanitorium and confining him instead to house arrest at his home in Parra. The court came to a decision in December 1989, ruling against Dominic. The court re-inforced the power of the legislature to make such laws at their own discretion. Dominic was released from house arrest that December.  Activism  After being released from house arrest, Dominic was fired from his job at the World Wildlife Fund, and went to work for Norma Alvares, a woman who had contributed to his court case and had much experience with NGOs. He became involved in the global community of people living with AIDS. After attending several conferences in Europe about AIDS, he decided to start his own organization in 1992. Positive People was registered in May of 1992, only weeks before his death. He worked passionately on creating counseling for those who had HIV and those who were at risk for contracting it. He organized awareness campaigns at local schools and colleges. The organization continues to be the largest of its kind in Goa. Positive People still advocates for people living with AIDS today.

It began in 1916 and has been played every year since 1955. The Panthers and Orange were both Eastern football independents for most of their history but have shared the same football conference since 1991 when the Big East Football Conference was formed from Eastern football independents. Pitt is the most played opponent for Syracuse and Syracuse is the third most played opponent for Pitt. Sharing membership in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since 2013, the Panthers and Orange are designated cross-divisional opponents and have played a total of 76 times. Pittsburgh leads the series 41‚Äì31‚Äì3.  History  =Series record= From 1916‚Äì56, Pittsburgh led 8‚Äì2‚Äì2, but Syracuse went 11‚Äì5 to tie the series up. Pittsburgh then went on an 11-year winning streak from 1973‚Äì83. However, Syracuse went 16‚Äì1‚Äì1 from 1984‚Äì2001 to take the series lead (29‚Äì25‚Äì3). Pittsburgh has gone 16‚Äì2 since to retake the lead. =Big East Conference (1991‚Äì2012)= Syracuse was a charter member of the Big East Conference, founded as a basketball prioritized conference in 1979 that did not sponsor football. Pitt joined Syracuse as a member of the Big East Conference in 1982. Both Pitt and Syracuse moved their football teams, both playing as Independents, into the Big East Football Conference in 1991 when they and other football-playing members of the Big East, along with additional Eastern independent teams, decided to form a football conference under the auspices of the existing Big East Conference. Since 1991, Pittsburgh and Syracuse have played twenty-two times while in the Big East until trouble started to rumble through the conference starting in 2005 with the \\"football\\" and \\"non-football\\" schools of the conference, led to instability in the conference. Several schools left the conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The game is set to be published by WaterMelon, which previously developed and published the Sega Genesis title Pier Solar and the Great Architects in 2010. The development of Elysian Shadows has been chronicled in a YouTube series titled Adventures in Game Development. Elysian Shadows has been marketed as a \\"next-gen 2D role-playing game\\" (RPG) due to its hybrid 2D/3D graphical style. Elysian Shadows is being developed for the Sega Dreamcast, as well as the Ouya, iOS, Android, Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. The game received a successful round of crowdfunding via Kickstarter in August 2014. Gameplay Elysian Shadows fuses traditional elements of 2D games with dynamic 2D and 3D perspectives, positional and dynamic audio, rigid body physics, particle simulators, and other modern 3D rendering techniques. This gameplay is intended as a re-invention of the 2D style used in 16-bit RPGs. Planned features for the game, in addition to its hybrid 2D/3D camera and gameplay, include: advanced fluid dynamics, weather and a day/night system, customizable characters with in-depth class/job system, and a cross-platform save system.http://kotaku.com/a-16-bit-rpg-that- promises-a-modern-twist-1626228329 VMU mini games have also been added to the game. Story Elysian Shadows takes place in a world caught in constant conflict between magic and technology. The gift of magic is bestowed upon loyal followers of The Creator, while the nonreligious sects of society are forced to rely upon technological advances in their daily lives. Upon uncovering a mysterious artifact deep within one of the ancient ruins scattered throughout the land, Julien and friends find themselves thrust into the middle of this mounting conflict, and they must now solve the mystery of the ancient civilizations to prevent the destruction of their own. Development Since October 2007, the development of Elysian Shadows has been chronicled in the YouTube web series Adventures in Game Development however Falco Girgis' earliest post on the development forums was in 2004, leading to uncertainty as to when exactly development on the game began. The early years of development were spent on designing original technology and development tools. These tools were simultaneously developed for OS X and Windows. They were later designed to target a host of platforms including Android and Linux, which enabled the developers to design the game without worrying about porting. The team has gone through a large number of member changes, however lead programmer Falco Girgis and lead artist Patryk Kowalik have remained constant since Falco founded the project and Patryk joined. In May 2014, it was announced that WaterMelon Co., developer of Pier Solar and the Great Architects, offered a publishing deal to the Elysian Shadows Team for the Sega Dreamcast platform. In June, lead developer Falco Girgis tendered his resignation at ADTRAN, where he was a software engineer, to work full-time on Elysian Shadows. On June 19, Girgis and co-founder Tyler Rogers were invited to give a presentation of Elysian Shadows at their alumni university, University of Alabama in Huntsville. On 1 August 2014, the development team launched their Kickstarter campaign with a goal of $150,000 and stretch goals that went up to $750,000. In less than 24 hours, the project had attained $30,000 of its target and a couple of days later it had successfully raised over $75,000. On 20 August, Elysian Shadows received national coverage by WHNT News as they interviewed the team and ran a story on Girgis and Rogers quitting their jobs to develop the game.http://whnt.com/2014/08/20/two- madison-county-engineers-leave-jobs-to-make-video-game-close-to-funding-their- dream/ Less than 24 hours later, the game was successfully funded and in the process set a record for the Ouya's Free the Games Fundhttps://twitter.com/playouya/status/503243490722316289 as well as for the most amount of money raised in Alabama through Kickstarter.https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?woe_id=2347559&sort;=most_funded In August 2014, the game received notable press coverage internationally coverage from Asia and Europe, most notably from Russia and Germany respectively.http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/elysian- shadows/news/elysian_shadows,51606,3059372.htmlhttp://igronews.com/news/indie/2315-elysian- shadows.htmlhttp://www.nexgam.de/Dreamcast-Linux/Elysian-Shadows-Das-grosse- Interview.html#sheet1 The project received a great deal of criticism when Girgis created the Misadventures in Kickstarter crowdfunding series, in which he complained of hardships during the project's development. The video's description and Girgis's later commentary suggest it was satire. In 2016, Girgis stated that progress on the game was going well in a post that describes setbacks caused by a former team member. He has also posted news about ElysianVMU, an emulator for the Sega Dreamcast's Visual Memory Unit, allowing non-Dreamcast players to access VMU content on their PCs, smartphones, and other devices.

Robenalt attended Miami University where he majored in political science. During his time at MU he spent one semester in a study abroad program in Luxembourg. In 1978 he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. Robenalt, like his father before him, went to Ohio State University College of Law and graduated in 1981. At the time of his graduation he was Order of the Coif. Law career When Robenalt graduated from Ohio State in 1981 he took a job with Thompson, Hine and Flory. The firm is now known as Thompson Hine LLP. In 1989 he was made partner. The Chambers USA Guide to America's Leading Business Lawyers named Robenalt as one of America's leading lawyers. He focuses on legal issues related to construction, professional malpractice and tax. Robenalt won large verdicts for several clients. He won an $81 million jury verdict for Avery Dennison, who he began to represent in 1997, on an international espionage case. The case drew international attention since it was the first prosecution under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. He also won a $68 million arbitration award for Atlanta-based Solvay Pharmaceuticals on a dispute about drug co-promotion agreements. Robenalt has also been a member of the Court of Nisi Prius, a Cleveland lawyers' humor society that produces an annual show of skits and songs lampooning the local, state, and national political scenes. Robenalt has been both a \\"Serjeant\\" and the \\"Judge\\" of that society, and plays guitar and sings in many of the shows. Watergate CLE Together with John W. Dean, President Richard Nixon's White House Counsel, Robenalt created a continuing education program on the national level called \\"The Watergate CLE.\\" This continuing legal education program, which was launched in Chicago in June 2011, has Robenalt teaching legal ethics and the representation of an organization under new Model Rules 1.13 and 1.6. John Dean plays the role of a fact witness while Watergate is used a case study. Books In June 2004 Robenalt, with the Kent State University Press, published Linking Rings, William W. Durbin, the Magic and Mystery of America. The book is a biography of Robenalt's great-grandfather, W.W.

Robenalt published The Harding Affair: Love and Espionage During the Great War in 2009 under the Palgrave Macmillan Trade publishing company. Robenalt wrote the book using bootleg microfilm copies of letters written by President Harding to his long-time mistress, Carrie Fulton Phillips.

Wade, Vietnam, and the Month that Changed America Forever was published by the Chicago Review Press in May 2015. Robenalt's fourth book, Ballots and Bullets: Black Power Politics and Urban Guerrilla Warfare in 1968 Cleveland was published by Lawrence Hill Books, an imprint of Chicago Review Press Incorporated in 2018.

From February to August 2008, Sas≈ç published an adaptation of Y≈çjir≈ç Takita's film Departures, serialized in twelve instalments in the bi-weekly Big Comic Superior. He agreed to take on the adaptation as he was impressed by Kund≈ç Koyama's script. Sas≈ç had the opportunity to view the film before beginning the adaptation, and came to feel that a too-literal adaptation would not be appropriate. He made changes to the settings and physical appearances of the characters, and increased the focus on the role of music in the story. Later in 2008 the serial was compiled in a 280-page volume released by Shogakukan. Sas≈ç has written a variety of manga, including Toto's World (about a child who is unable to speak) and Fujisan. Toto's World was adapted to film by NHK. In June 2014 he was one of twenty artists to collaborate on a special Godzilla manga, published by Big Comic Original in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the title character. Sas≈ç became a professor at the Department of Manga at Kyoto Seika University in 2006.

The main target groups for products in the be quiet! range are PC enthusiasts and gamers as well as smaller and larger PC integrators. The company's headquarters is in Glinde, close to Hamburg. At present, the firm also has branches in Poland, Taiwan and China. The products of be quiet! are directly sold from Glinde to distributors and resellers worldwide. However, the major market of the be quiet! brand is Europe. History The be quiet! brand was registered in 2002 as a trademark of Listan GmbH. Initially only PC power supplies equipped with noise-minimizing technology were marketed under the brand name. From 2008, it was decided to add products for the cooling of PCs (CPU coolers and case fans) to the be quiet! range in addition to power supplies. In 2014, be quiet! added PC cases to the product portfolio. The readers of the German computer magazine PC Games Hardware elected be quiet! \\"Manufacturer of the Year\\"\\"Leserwahl 2016 Hersteller und Produkte des Jahres\\"http://www.pcgameshardware.de/PC-Games-Hardware- Brands-18366/News/Leserwahl-Hersteller-des-Jahres-2014-1149115/ in the PSU category. Also in the election of the leading German online magazines Hardwareluxx be quiet! was chosen by the readers as \\"Manufacturer of the Year\\" in the PSU category. According to regular studies by the GfK Group, based on the numbers of units sold be quiet! is consistently concluded as market leader in Germany for PC power supplies, from 2006 to their latest study in 2017. Products All the organizational, administrative and logistics work as well as technical development of be quiet! products are performed at the headquarters in Germany. This includes all the necessary inspiration, product conception and design in addition to the final quality control. In tune with the imperative in the brand name, a great deal of attention is paid in the development of all products in the be quiet! range to minimize noise. As a consequence the company has developed its own advanced technology and registered patents . =Power supply units= The main focus of be quiet! PC power supply products is the ATX format. However, the brand now also produces power supplies for SFX and TFX systems. The power supplies manufactured cover a spectrum of power classes from 300W to 1200W. = PC cases= In August 2014, the brand be quiet! introduced its first midi tower PC case Silent Base 800 to the market and since then introduced two further product series (Dark Base and Pure Base). =CPU cooler and case fans= In 2008, be quiet! extended its product palette with CPU coolers in tower, dual tower and top flow architectures. In addition, case fan models were produced with and without the PWM function in mounting sizes from 80 to 140 millimeters. In 2015, the be quiet! Pure Wings 2 case fan series was awarded by the European Hardware Awards, an annual selection of the very best hardware products available in the European market. In 2016, be quiet! extended its CPU cooler range with water coolers. Patents and utility models For the technology it developed itself between 2009 and 2011, the company has lodged several registered designs and patents in diverse regions and countries. These all share the aim: Reduction of noise in addition to optimizing the operation in cooling and power supply components. One example is the \\"technology of aerodynamically optimized surface texture\\" as used in other industrial applications to reduce operational noise and improve airflow. This technology is applied to all be quiet! fans. The case fan series Silent Wings 2 and Shadow Wings have a further example of patented technology known as \\"anti- vibration mounts\\" that not only simplify the fitting and dampen the overall vibration, but also offer a flexible choice of mounting according to application. Another such technology is known as the \\"fan damping assembly\\" that reduces vibration with a rubber seal, simplifies the fitting procedures, and so significantly reduces the assembly time needed. In addition, the company has registered another invention for a \\"device to anchor the fan\\" on the CPU cooler as a utility model. This facilitates the fitting, because the device clamps easily to the exterior of the heat sink. The bracing against the heat sink serves to absorb the fan vibrations well and so inhibits the generation of noise. The company also has a registered utility model for the \\"connector angular setting\\" for the cables of its power supply products. This special technology enables the setting and adjustment of the outlet cable angle, to suit the installation sites in differing PC configurations. This makes for tidy routing of the cables and improves the air circulation in the casing.

The Tournament was the brainchild of Manu Nepia Sutherland and other New Zealanders playing rugby in Sydney.

He now steps aside from the old paths he has trodden for so many centuries, moving ceaselessly across HINEMOANA (Pacific) to a new destiny. Taking with him sublime courage, self-reliance and tenacity in his quest to seek the rising sun and strange stars on far horizons. His cloak is his dignity, culture and traditions. And as long as he wears it, he will always be as his ancestors were, a Maori. So be it.

KIA TUPATO, KIA MANAWANUI, KIA WEHI KI TE ATUA (Take care, take courage, fear God) Carvings Great care has been taken by the artist and carver to convey a feeling of pride and self-respect in the traditions, culture and love for the homeland. The proverbial phrase quoted earlier is indicated in the sun and its far reaching beams. Arising above the horizon are the peaks of Mt Egmont (Taranaki), Ngaruahoe, Tongariro, Ruapehu and Mt Cook (Aorangi) representing New Zealand (Aotearoa) as a whole. The Moana-nui-a-Kiwa lies placid between the mountains and the dipping canoes, both indicative of space, quest and traditions. The old spiritual carvings (Takapau) were borrowed from ancient design such as the marakihau to lock in the canoes, the seas, the mountains and the guiding stars of the heavens. The spiritual powers of our ancestors were powerful and lasting, arising to phenomenal achievements and enduring memorable tales handed down from generation to generation. One side of the lower phrase shows the genealogical tribal and family signs, and the other the guardians of the carving. The series of designs at the bottom edge depict the all important participation of women in social and recreational events. Phase two shows themanaias guarding the central figure and the takarangi designs interlocking the security of the central design. =The central figure= This can be named in so many different ways. It stands out, deliberately, to accept and give challenge to the distorted lines, glaring eyes and protruding tongue, inviting the physical spirit and temper of the beholder to the acknowledged fact in no uncertain terms. The distended mouth space gives room for championship medallions. The space below is separated by a football involving the codes being played. The name TAKI TOA RUGBY CHALLENGE SHIELD fills in the space.

Vidya is not mere intellectual knowledge, for the Vedas demand understanding. Meaning Vidya or vidyƒÅ (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) primarily means \\"correct knowledge\\" in any field of science, learning, philosophy, or any factual knowledge that cannot be disputed or refuted. Its root is vid (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç), which means \\"to reason upon\\", knower, finding, knowing, acquiring or understanding. Relevance In Hindu philosophy, vidyƒÅ refers to the knowledge of the soul or spiritual knowledge; it refers to the study of the six schools of Hindu philosophy: Nyaya, Yoga, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Purvamimamsa and Uttaramimamsa. The process of gaining the knowledge of the Atman cannot commence unless one has explored the PrƒÅnavidya or Agnividya to the full in all its numerous phase; through vidyƒÅ or upasana to jnana was always the eternal order indicated by the Upanishads. JnƒÅna dawns after the completion and perfection of the being through the vidyƒÅs; then, one crosses over beyond birth and death having already destroyed the bonds of death. Concept During the Vedic period, vidyƒÅdƒÅna or the gift for the sake of education was considered to be the best of gifts, possessing a higher religious efficacy than even the gift of land. VidyƒÅ comes from the root vid (\\"to know\\"); it therefore means knowledge, science, learning, lore, scholarship and philosophy. There are basically four Vidyas: # Trayi (triple) which is the study of the Vedas and their auxiliary texts, 2) Anviksiki which is logic and metaphysics, 3) Dandaniti which is the science of government, and 4) Varum, the practical arts such as agriculture, commerce, medicine etc. VidyƒÅ gives insight, in the spiritual sphere it leads to salvation, in the mundane sphere it leads to progress and prosperity. VidyƒÅ illuminates the mind and shatters illusions, increases intelligence, power and efficiency; develops the intellect and makes it more re-fined; it effects a complete transformation as the root of all happiness and as the source of illumination and power. The word, VidyƒÅ, does not occur in the Rig Veda, it occurs in the Atharvaveda and in the Brahmana portions of the Yajurveda and in the Upanishads. Tantra In Hinduism, goddesses are personifications of the deepest level of power and energy. The concept of Shakti, in its most abstract terms, relates to the energetic principle of ultimate reality, the dynamic aspect of the divine. This concept surfaces in the Kena Upanishad as Goddess UmƒÅ bestowing Brahma-vidya on Indra; when linked with shakti and maya, she embodies the power of illusion (maya), encompassing ignorance (avidya) and knowledge (vidyƒÅ) and thereby presented with a dual personality. According to the Saktas, MƒÅyƒÅ is basically a positive, creative, magical energy of the Goddess that brings forth the universe. The ten MahƒÅvidyƒÅs are bestowers or personifications of transcendent and liberating religious knowledge; the term VidyƒÅ in this context refers to power, essence of reality and the mantras. The gentle and motherly forms of Goddess Sri VidyƒÅ are 'right-handed'. When the awareness of the 'exterior' (Shiva) combined with the \\"I\\" encompasses the entire space as \\"I\\" it is called sada-siva-tattva. When later, discarding the abstraction of the Self and the exterior, clear identification with the insentient space takes place, it is called isvara-tattva; the investigation of these two last steps is pure vidyƒÅ (knowledge). MƒÅyƒÅ, which has been identified with Prakrti in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad represents its three gunas; also identified with avidyƒÅ, which term primarily means the dark abyss of non-being and secondarily the mysterious darkness of the unmanifest state, MƒÅyƒÅ binds through avidyƒÅ and releases through vidyƒÅ . Buddhist belief In Mahayana texts, the female divinities are designated grammatically feminine terms DhƒÅrƒÅni and VidyƒÅ. Dharani refers to mantras, the sounds that carry the essence or energy of a deity, which enable contact with the goddess on her plane of reality because the mantras invoke all deities. VidyƒÅ is also synonymous with mantra and refers to the mantric invocation of female deities. In Tibet, the word, rigpa , meaning vidyƒÅ, refers to the non-dualistic awareness or intrinsic awareness. In Theravada Buddhism, vidyƒÅ means 'non-dual awareness' of three marks of existence. Agni VidyƒÅ Agni VidyƒÅ or the science of fire is said to be the greatest discovery of the ancient Indians who gained direct experience of divine fire through continuous research, contemplation, observation and experimentation; their experience led them to discover ways of using this knowledge to heal and nurture the outer and the inner worlds. To them fire is sacred, and because of the pervasive nature of fire all things are sacred. Body and mind which are extensions of the fire that the soul spontaneously emits are also sacred. Within the body the most significant centres of fire are more subtle than those of the sense organs. They are called the chakras which are seven fields of sacred fire. The understanding of the role of fire without and within gives proper self- understanding which understanding is gained through yogic practices. The performance of yajnas is the karma-kƒÅnda aspect of agni vidyƒÅ. All rituals follow set rules and conditions. The main function of the fire ritual is to make an offering to nature's finest forces and divinities that fill the space of inner consciousness; fire carries oblations to these forces and divinities. The fire has seven tongues all having unique qualities. The gods, goddesses, divinities and nature's forces are grouped in seven main categories which match with the qualities of the seven tongues of fire. Atmaikatva Atmaikatva or the absolute oneness of the self is the theme of entire Advaita Vedanta which distinguishes six pramanas or means of valid knowledge, but this vidyƒÅ or knowledge of Brahman is guhahita, gahavareshta i.e. set in the secret place and hidden in its depth, unattainable except through adhyƒÅtma-yoga, the meditation centering upon the nature of the self. Vedanta literature is only preparatory to it, it dispels ignorance and makes the mind receptive but does not reveal the truth therefore it is an indirect means of knowledge. The oneness of the self, which is self-established and self-shining, is called vidyƒÅ in cosmic reference which reveals the true nature of Brahman, the self- shining pure consciousness which is not a visaya ('object matter or content') but the one subject, transcendent of all conventional subjects and objects. The Self or the Atman is to be sought, the Self is to be enquired into, known and understood. Hierarchy of knowledge The sage of the Mundaka Upanishad (Verse I.1.4), more in the context of the ritualistic than of epistemological concerns, states that there are two kinds of knowledge (vidyƒÅ) to be attained, the higher (para) and the lower (apara). Para vidyƒÅ, the higher knowledge, is knowledge of the Absolute (Brahman, Atman); Apara, the lower knowledge, is knowledge of the world ‚Äì of objects, events, means, ends, virtues and vices. Para vidyƒÅ has Reality as its content; Apara vidyƒÅ, the phenomenal world. According to Advaita Vedanta, Para vidyƒÅ, by the nature of its content, possesses a unique quality of ultimacy that annuls any supposed ultimacy that might be attached to any other or form of knowledge, and is intuitively gained as self-certifying. Once Brahman is realized all other modes of knowledge are seen to be touched by avidyƒÅ, the root of ignorance. In this context, VidyƒÅ means true knowledge. However, it is argued that the Advaita Vedanta interpretation does not answer the final question: what is the reality or truth-value of avidyƒÅ or what is the substratum that is the basis or cause of avidyƒÅ? Valid knowledge The Upanishads teach that the knowledge of difference is avidyƒÅ or ignorance, and the knowledge of identity is true knowledge or vidyƒÅ or valid knowledge, which leads to life eternal. For the CƒÅrvƒÅkas, perception is the only means of valid knowledge (pramana). Vadi Deva Suri of the Jaina school defines valid knowledge as determinate cognition which apprehends itself and an object and which is capable of prompting activity which attains a desirable object or rejects an undesirable object; the result of valid knowledge is cessation of ignorance. Vaisheshikas recognized four kinds of valid knowledge ‚Äì Perception, Inference, Recollection and Intuition. The Mimamsa schools introduced the concept of intrinsic validity of knowledge (svatahpramanya) and extrinsic validity of knowledge (parastah-apramana) but agreed that the validity of knowledge cannot be determined by the knowledge of any special excellence in its cause or the knowledge of its harmony with the real nature of its object or the knowledge of a fruitful action. Sankara accepted perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison, presumption and non-apprehension as the six sources of knowledge and concluded that the knowledge which corresponds with the real nature of its object is valid. The Atman is the reality in the empirical self as the ever-present foundational subject-objectless universal consciousness which sustains the empirical self. Significance In upƒÅsanƒÅ the movement starts from the outer extremities and gradually penetrates into the inmost recesses of the soul, and the whole investigation is conducted in two spheres, in the subject as well as in the object, in the individual as well as in the world, in the aham as also in the idam , in the adhyƒÅtma and also in adhidaiva spheres and conducted synthetically as well as analytically, through apti as well as samrddhi, which the Bhagavad Gita calls yoga and vibhooti . The vidyƒÅs do not rest content in knowing the reality simply as a whole but proceed further to comprehend it in all its infinite details too. The higher includes the lower grades and adds something more to it and never rejects it; the lower has its fulfilment in the higher and finds its consummation there but never faces extinction. All forms of contemplation have only one aim: to lead to the Supreme Knowledge and hence they are termed as vidyƒÅs; through vidyƒÅ, which is amrta, one attains immortality (Shvetashvatara Upanishad Verse V.1). Dahara VidyƒÅ, Udgitha VidyƒÅ and Madhu VidyƒÅ are the synthetic way whereas the analytic way is signified by the Sleeping man of the Garga-AjƒÅtsatru episode and by the Five Sheaths, which ways show that the world and the individual spring from the same eternal source.

He was born in Oundle, Northamptonshire and died at Willington, Bedfordshire. Fred Kingston was the eldest of seven brothers who played first-class cricket or other cricket just below first-class level ‚Äì several of them, including Fred, played for Northamptonshire in years before and, in Hubert's case, just after the side's accession to first-class status in 1905. A right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, Fred Kingston's first match while he was a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge, came for an England XI against the university side, and a few weeks later he played for a team calling itself \\"The Gentlemen of England\\" in a 12-a-side first-class match against Oxford University at Oxford in which he scored 61 in the middle order. He then appeared in three matches for the Cambridge University side, the final one of which was the 1878 University Match against Oxford, though he did not keep wicket in this game and batted low in the Cambridge line-up. That was the end of his first-class cricket apart from a single appearance for a \\"Cambridge Past and Present\\" side which played the Australians in 1886, when he batted at No 10 and kept wicket. He continued, however, to play lower grade cricket, mainly for Northamptonshire but also for Devon. In 1882, he captained the Northamptonshire side in their non-first-class match against the Australians. Career outside cricket Kingston was ordained as a Church of England clergyman after he graduated from Cambridge University and served from 1883 to 1886 as curate in a parish at Callington in Cornwall. In 1886, he moved back to Northamptonshire to become headmaster of Guilsborough Grammar School where he remained until 1910, at times combining his scholastic duties with curacies in local parishes. After 1910, he returned full-time to church work, and was vicar of Willington in Bedfordshire from 1913 until his death.

The theatre was designed on request from the city in 1827 by the city architect Pierre Bourla. Construction began in 1829, but was delayed due to the Belgian Revolution. The theatre was finally finished in 1834 and opened under the name, Grand Th√©√¢tre or Th√©√¢tre Royal Fran√ßais, on account of its ownership by a French company. Presently, the Bourla houses the theatre company Het Toneelhuis, which is a merger of the companies, Koninklijke Nederlandse Schouwburg and Blauwe Maandag Compagnie. The Bourla is the last remaining municipal theatre in Europe with original stage machinery, which fill five levels above and below the stage. The building has been named a protected building since 1938, and therefore is regarded among the most important historic buildings in Belgium.

Author show us through the terrorized look of her dog Hooper, how the sun of shell burst has indelibly marked the dog's memory. That nothing may be forgotten. Reception Exceptional reception by the audience in Festival of the First in Zagreb (a competition for artists in which they should represent the works of art, that are not within the domain of their creativity) result that people came every day to watch the film in a gallery in which, among other works, it was exposed all day. This event instigate the author to send film to film festivals. That is how the film Ubojite misli started its journey: through participating in Short Film Corner in Cannes Film Festival, through Toronto (Canada), Film Festival in Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Italy, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, again France, Spain... A member of the International jury at the 5. Mostar Film Festival (2007) when the film won 1st Award, Valentina Mindoljeviƒá commented Award: The decision was unanimous, and all the members of the jury agreed that the film of Stanka Gjuriƒá significantly stands out with its originality.

It preserves fossils dating back to the Silurian period.  Geological History The sandstones and mudstones that form the outcrops along the coast from Cowie to Ruthery Head were mostly laid down by braided rivers crossing a semi-arid low-relief landscape. Rare fossils contained in one particular layer near Cowie Harbour indicate that these rocks are over 428 million years old and belong to the mid- Silurian period. One particularly exciting find was made here in 2003 when a fragment of a fossil millipede was identified as the earliest known air-breathing animal in the world. It is celebrated in a display board on the sea-front at Cowie. One unusual feature of these layered sedimentary rocks is that they have been tilted to the south-east at a very steep angle and therefore are seen edge-on in the outcrops on the foreshore and is formally known as the Strathmore Syncline. When these layers are followed south- eastwards for several kilometres, the degree of tilting towards the SE is seen to decrease until the layers are near horizontal and then steepen again as they begin to tilt towards the NW, thus defining a broad U-shaped fold in the rock strata known as a syncline. The tilting of the strata took place when two regions of the Earth's lithosphere (the relatively rigid outer layer of the planet which includes the Crust and uppermost Mantle) were subjected to strong compressive forces over a long period. This took place between about 500 and 400 million years ago when two plates were in collision, bringing together the ancient continents of Avalonia and Laurentia. One consequence of this collision was the buckling of the thick deposits of sedimentary rocks that had, at that time, recently accumulated in this northern part of the Midland Valley.

Warner & Sons wove the coronation robes for Elizabeth II (photo:Cecil Beaton) Warner & Sons (also Warner and Sons) was a British textile manufacturer specialising in silk for the furnishing industry. It wove the coronation robes for both Edward VII and Elizabeth II and had associations with some of the leading textile designers and artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. History The firm was established in the historic silk weaving neighbourhood of Spitalfields, London in 1870 and was known under a variety of different names ‚Äì including Warner, Sillet & Ramm ‚Äì during its early years. Founder Benjamin Warner, a jacquard weaver, was from a family that had been in the silk industry since at least the 17th century. Warner wove high quality silks using traditional designs and began supplying royalty around 1880. Some five years earlier, the company had diversified into popular fabrics such as worsted, lampas, brocade and velvet ‚Äì the move into velvet production was particularly useful for building its reputation. It acquired the company of Charles Norris & Co in 1885, which meant Warner held a royal warrant as supplier of silks and velvets to the royal households; it also supplied stately homes, palaces and embassies internationally. It became known formally as Warner & Sons in 1891, when Benjamin Warner's sons Alfred and Frank joined the business. Warner & Sons moved to Braintree, Essex in 1895, joining other well known companies located in the town such as Courtaulds, and taking over buildings already used by the silk industry. 20th-century developments By the start of the 20th century, Warner & Sons' reputation for silk furnishing fabric was cemented. It expanded in the early decades, moving into powerweaving in 1919 and operating an office in Paris from 1919 to 1926, as well as taking its products into the United States. To meet demand for both modern and traditional designs, it acquired the textile block printing firm of Dartford Print Works in Dartford, Kent in 1926-7. =1930s designs= In 1928, Frank Warner's son-in-law Ernest Goodale (later Sir Ernest Goodale) joined the board, becoming managing director in 1930. Two years later, Alec Hunter took charge of the design studio and extended the use of freelance designers as well as combining modern weaves with traditional skills, such as brocading. Fabrics for the Royal Institute of British Architects' headquarters and the University of London Senate House were among the major commissions during this period. =Post-war years= After the war, Warner & Sons developed a reputation for innovation, thanks in part to the arrival of leading textile designer Marianne Straub in 1950 and her colleague Frank Davies in 1951. Straub was to remain with Warner until her retirement in 1970. One of her most famous early designs for Warner was Surrey, a textile that featured in the Festival of Britain in 1951 and was used in the Regatta Restaurant. Based on the crystalline structure of afwillite, it was chosen as representative of textiles of the early post-war period. During this era, Warner & Sons was still renowned for its high-quality silks and velvets ‚Äì weaving the coronation robes for Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, as well as the Queensway Coronation Silk that was hung from the balcony of Westminster Abbey during the coronation ceremony. Warner & Sons also created many designs for the Ministry of Works destined for public spaces such as schools and polytechnics. From 1964, Warner & Sons wove designs created by Straub and Davies for Isabel Tisdall's Tamesa Fabrics. Choosing Warner gave Tamesa the flexibility to create short runs, custom die to design briefs and add special finishes such as protective and fireproof coatings. With a focus on the vibrant commercial market, these designs were championed by influential architects of the time such as Milner Gray and Misha Black and were subsequently to appear on everything from seats on BEA's Trident aircraft to the interiors of the QE2. Weaving ceased at the company's Braintree location in 1971, but under the stewardship of John Tibbitts (Frank Warner's grandson), Warner & Sons oversaw production of high-end chintz for London companies such as Colefax & Fowler and US firms such as Lee Jofa and Brunschwig and Fils. Design legacy Warner & Sons closed at the end of March 1990. In the years leading up to this, Tibbitts had worked to save a vast archive of fabric samples, paper designs and other documentation. Archivists were employed in 1976 and various educational activities provided access to the archive. After transfers of the Warner & Sons brand and archive holdings to new ownership, and a threat that the collection might be lost, it was saved by ¬£2.7m funding that included support from local and national government, The Art Fund and the Clothworkers' Foundation, enabling it to pass into the ownership of Braintree District Museum Trust. It is now housed in the original mill building in Braintree as the Warner Textile Archive. Designs in the archive span two centuries and, alongside the work of Marianne Straub, Frank Davies and Alec Hunter, it includes work by artists such as Augustus Pugin, William Morris, Walter Crane, Vanessa Bell, Howard Hodgkin, Edward Bawden, Hans Tisdall, Graham Sutherland and Lynton Lamb.

Origin and variations The first occurrence of the fable about the fastidious heron occurs in a late Mediaeval manuscript of Latin prose fables called Opusculum fabularum (little collection of fables), which claims to have rendered them from the Greek.Francisco Rodr√≠guez Adrados, History of the Graeco-latin Fable: Inventory and documentation of the graeco-latin fable. Volume three, Brill 2003, p.895 A heron stands by the waterside one morning, surrounded by a rich choice of fish which it ignores since it is not ready to eat. During the afternoon it rejects humbler types of fish as unworthy, hoping for better pickings but, by evening, is so hungry that it settles for a snail. The Italian fabulist Laurentius Abstemius seems to have imitated the theme in his story of the Fowler and the Chaffinch (De aucupe et fringilla), included in his Hecatomythium as fable 39.Text online A bird-catcher who has waited all day, hoping for a larger catch, comes away in the end with no more than a chaffinch. Roger L'Estrange included a translation of it in his 1692 fable collection, drawing the moral that '‚ÄòMen are so greedy after what‚Äôs to come, which is uncertain, that they slip present Opportunities, which are never to be recover‚Äôd‚Äô.Aesopica site The fable of the heron was given popularity in France at a slightly earlier date than in England by being included in the second edition of La Fontaine's Fables, (VII.4).See the Elizur Wright translation online There it is given a certain intertextuality when the heron's 'disdainful choice' is compared to that of the town mouse visiting his country cousin in the tale of The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse. La Fontaine is referring to Horace's version of that fable, but then proposes to give a human example of the situation he describes and proceeds straight away to tell the fable of a fastidious beauty (VII.5) who turns down all suitors when she is young and has to take what she can get after her looks fade.Wright's translation In the 18th century there was an English imitation of La Fontaine's fable of the heron in Rowland Rugeley's \\"The Heron: a fable for young maids\\".Miscellaneous poems and translations from La Fontaine and others (1763), pp.123-25 But it was often the later application to human conduct that was preferred by La Fontaine's imitators. Charles Denis gave that a lively recreation as \\"The Old Maid\\" who eventually married her footman in his Selected Fables (1754).Google Books, pp.385-9 It was also included as \\"The Dainty Spinster\\" among Ivan Krylov's fables in Russian.Krylov‚Äôs Fables, trans. Sir Bernard Pares, London 1936, p.32 A question of authorship The fable of the heron is not ascribed to any author in the Opusculum fabularum, although it appears there among others reckoned as Aesop's. It was La Fontaine who was responsible for changing the utilitarian lesson of seizing the opportunity while it is there to an examination of the heron's motives for passing it up. The bird is too fussy and full of self-regard. These qualities were emphasised when the fable first appeared in English during the 19th century as a translation of La Fontaine's version. However, a French version of the fable was put into the mouth of Aesop by Edm√© Boursault in his play Esope √† la Cour at the start of the 18th century, although the telling is placed in the context of making a marriage choice, following La Fontaine.Google Books pp.25/6 When the story appears in the American Aesop for Children (1919), it is still clearly La Fontaine's fable that is being retold.Aesopica site But by the time the fable reappears in Arin Murphy-Hiscock's Birds, A Spiritual Field Guide (2012), she asserts there that it is \\"one of Aesop‚Äôs fables [and] tells of a heron that strolled next to a river in shadow, watching for food. It passed up several small fish and ended up going hungry when the fish moved to cooler water, out of the heron‚Äôs reach\\".Arin Murphy-Hiscock, Birds, A Spiritual Field Guide, Adams Media 2012, , p.96 The telling too has travelled some distance away from the lakeside heron described in the Opusculum fabularum. Other versions for children claim Aesop as original author and spin out the detail of the original pithy fable. They include Tony Payne's \\"The Heron and the Fish\\" (UK 1993),BBC School Radio Graham Percy's \\"The Heron and the Fish\\" (UK 2009),Description at Google Books and Gwen Petreman's \\"The Blue Heron\\".Gwen Petreman, Aesop‚Äôs Fables (US, 2010), pp..2-4 However, the fable is not included as Aesop's in the Perry Index. Artistic interpretations Several artists from the 17th century onwards have provided woodcuts for the whole run of La Fontaine's fables, most of which go little beyond illustrating the bird standing beside the water. The most original was J.J.Grandville's transposition of the characters into contemporary terms. The heron is on the left, gazing askance at the fish which impertinently peep at him from the shallows. To the right, the old maid of La Fontaine's parallel fable hangs on the arm of a bloated individual. To drive the lesson home, the slug soon to be devoured crawls through the grass at the feet of both.Education √† l'Environnement There was also an English set of illustrations of La Fontaine's fables issued on the Staffordshire pottery of Brown, Westhead & Moore in 1880 which included an attractive design of the fable under the title \\"The Proud Heron\\".Aesthetic Movement Transferware Two 19th century painters provided oil panels now in the collection of the Mus√©e Jean de La Fontaine. Both represent the bird standing by the waterside. L√©on Rousseau's was part of a set painted in 1853,Government cultural site while that of Louis-Emile Villa (1836-1900) is undated.Getty Images In the 20th century, the fable was the subject of one of Jean Vernon's medallions. The heron faces right and looks down from the bank at fishes swimming in the water. It is faced by a smaller figure on the right that is about to swallow a snail.Illustrated on the Creighton University site There have also been musical interpretations. Maurice Thiriet included it as the first piece in his Trois fables de La Fontaine for a capella children's voices,Musicanet and in 2014 Eric Saint-Marc set it for women's choir, piano and string quartet.A performance on YouTube In addition it was included in Annie Sellem's ballet project Les fables √† la Fontaine (2004), where it was choreographed by Satchie NoroArchives du Spectacle and included among the four segments in the film version directed by Marie-H√©l√®ne Rebois.Arte TV archives References Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:Fables by Laurentius Abstemius Category:Fictional birds ","title":"The Heron and the Fish"},{"id":"43382479","text":"Air Vice Marshal Michael Keith Adams (born 23 January 1934) is a former senior Royal Air Force officer.

From Aarhus Cathedral, made by Thomas Quellinus. Constantin Marselis, or Constantijn Marselis (28 November 1647 - 16 June 1699), was a nobleman of the wealthy Dutch Marselis family.  Biography  Painting from 1861 of the manor house of Constantinsborg Constantin Marselis was born in Amsterdam as the younger son of Gabriel Marselis (1609‚Äì1673) and Isabeau van Straaten. He had an elder brother Vilhelm Marselis (1643-1683) who was fief baron of G√ºldencrone. In 1667, the King of Denmark Frederik III sent for both Constantin and Vilhelm, to take over two of their father's Danish estates near Aarhus; Stadsg√•rd and Havreballeg√•rd. At the same time, they were appointed as Junkers of the Danish court. In 1668 they were appointed as Kammerjunkers. Shortly after the King's death in February 1670, Constantin Marselis married Sophie Elisabeth Charisius (1647-1706). He and his wife took residence on Stadsg√•rd. After years of neglect from his father and damages from the constant wars with Sweden in the Second Northern War, Constantin renovated Stadsg√•rd extensively. When the manor was finished in 1677, he renamed it to Constantinsborg, a name it retains to the present. In 1680, he became a baron of the Havreballeg√•rd estate just south of Aarhus and at the same time renamed the manor Marselisborg. Constantin died childless in 1699, and the barony of Marselisborg went to the Crown. After his death, his widow Sophie initiated a sepulchral for him, herself and her new husband Peter Rodsteen in the Aarhus Cathedral and a richly decorated epitaph can be seen here today.  Constantinsborg  Constantinsborg Manor house is situated just south of the new lake of √Örslev Engs√∏, a few kilometres west of Aarhus.

Both forts were built in 1842, on the suggestion of Colonel Edward Fanshawe, Royal Engineers, as part of the Bermuda Garrison built up by the British Army to defend the Royal Naval Dockyard and other strategic assets in Bermuda.Defence, Not Defiance: A History Of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, Jennifer M.

The only channel through the reefline surrounding the archipelago that is suitable for large vessels passes the North-East ends of St. David's and St. George's Islands, which are at the East End of the archipelago of Bermuda. For this reason, the bulk of the nearly a hundred forts and gun batteries built in Bermuda between 1612 and 1939 are located on the eastern coasts of these two islands, and on Paget Island and the Castle Islands Fortifications, on smaller islands between St. George's and St. David's, and St. David's and the Main Island respectively.\`Bermuda Forts 1612‚Äì1957, Dr. Edward C.

Fort Victoria is landward of Fort Albert, and the Western Redoubt (also known as Fort William) is behind it. On the coast to the East is Alexandra Battery. The entire North-Eastern end of the island served as St. George's Garrison, the army base that was initially the headquarters for the Bermuda Garrison. After the infantry component of the garrison and the headquarters were moved to Prospect Camp in the 1860s, St. George's Garrison became primarily a Royal Artillery base, serving the various coastal artillery detachments in the East End forts and batteries. Fort Victoria was originally armed with eighteen 32 pounder cannon. As with many forts built in this period, the armament was already becoming obsolete by the time it was completed. In the 20th century, the fort was given two Breech-Loading 9.2 inch gun Mk X (although one appears to have been moved to St. David's Battery on St. David's Island, which received two in 1910).Bermuda Attractions: Fort Albert & Fort Victoria in Bermuda In April 1941 the United States Army Bermuda Garrison was formed under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.

Four 90 mm Anti Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) guns and a pair of 6-inch guns with a casemated magazine between them (called Battery Construction Number 284) were also installed by 1943. The railway guns were withdrawn in 1944.Berhow, p. 225 Forts Victoria and Albert were included in property leased to a succession of hotel operators, which were permitted to damage the structures to create recreational areas for guests. The hotel building itself, after years of sitting vacant, was removed by explosives in 2008, which badly damaged Fort Victoria. The sole 9.2-inch gun that had been remaining at Fort Victoria has now been moved to the Royal Naval Dockyard for installation at the Bermuda Maritime Museum in The Keep, the largest fort in Bermuda.The Royal Gazette: Gun on the move. 20 August, 2009 As a result of their historical significance, with fortifications spanning the full four centuries of English settlement in the New World, the forts at the East End of Bermuda, together with St. George's Town (or the Town of St. George), have been made a UNESCO World Heritage Site (the Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications).

The band is widely considered to be regional pioneers of the heavy metal genre and one of the most important rock bands of Sarajevo and former Yugoslavia pop-rock scene. In almost 40 years since its founding, the band has released 9 studio albums, the latest being 2011 reunion release Kad svira rock 'n' roll, two singles and several compilation albums. History Vatreni Poljubac were formed in 1977 in Sarajevo by a former Kodeksi, Indexi and Bijelo Dugme member Miliƒá Vuka≈°inoviƒá (guitar and vocals). The other two members of the original line-up were former Divlje Jagode member ≈†efƒáet Hod≈æa (bass) and Indexi member Perica Stojanoviƒá (drums). They released their first single in 1978 for Jugoton with songs \\"Doktor za rock and roll\\" and \\"Tvoje usne su bile moj najdra≈æi dar\\". First single album received immediate critical acclaim and popularized Vatreni Poljubac and their song \\"Doktor za rock n' roll\\" in former Yugoslavia. The first album named \\"Oh, ≈°to te volim joj\\" was recorded 1978 in London and Sarajevo for Sarajevo disk, and produced by Richard Whally. Album featured a number of songs inspired by the pioneering sound that was coming out of England at the time epitomized by acts like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Vatreni Poljubac original line-up recorded its last studio album \\"100% Rock and Roll\\" in 1986 with former Bijelo Dugme member Mladen Vojiƒçiƒá Tifa, one of the most popular singers at the time in Yugoslavia. All songs written and composed by Miliƒá Vuka≈°inoviƒá. Album has achieved great reviews and became very popular throughout the country, after which Vuka≈°inoviƒá disbanded the band and devoted himself to his solo career as folk-rock singer.

It was named for Allan McCulloch, a former Curator of Fishes at the Australian Museum, Sydney. Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non- breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male. Description A. mccullochi is dark brown with a pale snout, a white bar on each side of the head (but not connected on top of the head) and a pale tail. Juveniles have two white bars and the edge of the pectoral fins is yellow. They have 10 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 15-17 dorsal soft rays and 13-14 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . =Color variations= Some anemonefish species have color variations based on geographic location, sex and host anemone. A. mccullochi does not show any of these variations. =Similar species= A. mccullochi is similar in appearance to A. melanopus which is distinguished by its reddish chest, belly and dorsal fin, with a yellowish to slightly red tail. The white bars are also connected over the top of the head. Genetic analysis suggested evolutionary connectivity among samples of A. mccullochi and A. akindynos. Historical hybridization and introgression in the evolutionary past resulted in a complex mitochondrial DNA structure. There were two evolutionary groups with individuals of both species detected in both, thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly. There were no shared haplotypes between species.

A. mccullochi is highly specialised, being hosted with only 1 species of anemone: *Entacmaea quadricolor Bubble-tip anemone Conservation status Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. Characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction are small geographic range, small local population and extreme habitat specialisation. The small geographic range, small local population and extreme habitat specialisation (it only associates with Entacmaea quadricolor) are all characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction making A. mccullochi of particular conservation concern. This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List Etymology The specific name honours Whitley's colleague, the Australian ichthyologist Allan Riverstone McCulloch (1885-1925) who collected the type specimen.

It also covers control, a purposeful choice of input sequences. As a rule, it runs under randomness, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. A range of prescriptive theories have been proposed how to make optimal decisions under these conditions. They optimise sequence of decision rules, mappings of the available knowledge on possible actions. This sequence is called strategy or policy. Among various theories, Bayesian DM is broadly accepted axiomatically based theory that solves the design of optimal decision strategy. It describes random, uncertain or incompletely known quantities as random variables, i.e. by their joint probability expressing belief in their possible values. The strategy that minimises expected loss (or equivalently maximises expected reward) expressing decision-maker's goals is then taken as the optimal strategy. While the probabilistic description of beliefs is uniquely and deductively driven by rules for joint probabilities, the composition and decomposition of the loss function have no such universally applicable formal machinery. Fully probabilistic design (of decision strategies or control, FPD) removes the mentioned drawback and expresses also the DM goals of by the \\"ideal\\" probability, which assigns high (small) values to desired (undesired) behaviours of the closed DM loop formed by the influenced world part and by the used strategy.

After a First Stage in a home-and-away system, the first two best placed teams of each league played in two groups of 8 teams in a Second Stage with each league winner earning a promotion to the LigaPro, plus a two-round play-off winner between the two second placed teams. The two group winners then played a Grand Final on neutral ground for the overall Campeonato Nacional title. The remaining 8 clubs from each league from the First Stage played in 8 different groups with the last two placed teams being relegated to the Districts Championships. The 6th placed teams from those leagues then played a two-round play-off with between themselves to decide the remaining four clubs to be relegated.

Earlier the place was known as \\"Kallidapootha\\". http://www.kerala.travel/destination- Neeloor-198.aspx# History Being a rural village, the entire region is covered by different sorts of farming. The historical backdrop of Neeloor is blurred in the pages of history. At the same time 'Sree Dharma Shasta Temple', Ambalabhagam, 2 km away from Neeloor suggests that the place has hundreds of years old legacy. The new history begins with the beginning of the 20th century, when people from other areas came to Neeloor and settled here. In 1924 a chapel was established in the name of Saint Joseph and soon a primary school was started here. Later a parish was established here in the name of St. Francis Xavier in 1925. The parish now comes under the catholic diocese of Palai, Kerala. This parish now constitutes over 550 families and 3015 parishners.http://palaidiocese.com/parish.php?alpha=N In 1959 the primary school was upgraded to Upper Primary School and in 1961 a high school was started. The high school was among the first recognised un-aided schools in Kerala and today it is well known as St. Joseph‚Äôs English Medium High School and has a long history of 100% pass in SSLC Examinations. Currently a CBSE school is also functioning along with it.http://librariandiary.blogspot.in/2014/03/neeloor.html  Economy  Neeloor's economy is mainly dependent on agriculture. The major cultivation is natural rubber. Different crops like coconut, pepper, coco, tapioca, banana, ginger, turmeric, etc. are also cultivated here. Cattle, goat and chicken are commonly domesticated here. A unit of Milma milk producers' society is working here to support the milk production in the region. Politics Neeloor is part of the Kottayam Lok Sabha constituency and Pala Assembly Constituency (Neeloor was part of Poonjar Assembly Constituency till 2011).http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/nri/keral_Delimitation.pdf Main political parties in Neeloor include Indian National Congress, Kerala Congress, CPIM and BJP.

He came to Wisconsin in 1844, and settled in the Town of Greenfield. He had received a common school education, and became a farmer.  Public service  Lavies took over as postmaster of Root Creek in 1864, when his father Peter Lavies retired; but relinquished the office in 1867. He had served one year as assessor for the town, three years as its treasurer, and six years as justice of the peace, when was elected to the Assembly's 11th Milwaukee County district (the Towns of Franklin, Greenfield, Lake and Oak Creek; roughly the same district his father had represented in the 1850s) in 1875, as part of the Reform Party, a short-lived coalition of Democrats, reform and Liberal Republicans, and Grangers formed in 1873, which had secured the election of one Governor of Wisconsin and a number of state legislators. He received 675 votes to 617 for Republican E. S. Estes (Republican incumbent Thomas O'Neill was not a candidate). He was assigned to the standing committee on mining and smelting.Bashford, R.

Political career  He joined Samajwadi Party on 1 October 1998. And now he is Member of Legislative Council (MLC) from Lucknow-Unnao seat. Sunil presents his party as spokesperson also. Sunil contested his first election as student leader and was elected Vice President of KKV College, Lucknow University on 20 April 1999 and later on 9 November 2004 he was elected as President of KKC College, Lucknow University. Later, he was elected as State President of Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha (Student wing of Samajwadi Party) on 26 April 2005. He was elected as National President of Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha on 10 December 2010. Sunil Singh Yadav was part of a delegation as National President of Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha which visited China on 20 September 2011. This delegation had 500 government officials, heads of other youth organizations, social workers, entrepreneurs, college students and rural youth representatives. During the 10-day stay, this delegation participated in cultural exchange activities with young Chinese people and visited to companies, communities, universities and rural areas of People's Republic of China.

Sunil was the architect of the first agitation by the SP against the current Bahujan Samaj Party government, on 8 January 2008, when it sought restoration of the students' union and opposed fee hike. When he was beaten up by the police and jailed for 19 days, Akhilesh sat on his first Dharna, outside the SSP Lucknow's office. Sunil Yadav's position was cemented as police continued to crack down on SP men. While Leader of the Opposition Shivpal Singh Yadav was slapped by a policeman, an SP worker lost his life in police firing. Another committed self-immolation at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. By the time Mulayam Singh Yadav had withdrawn the agitation, Sunil Singh was a known name in the party. Currently national president of the SP's students' wing, Sunil again shot into news when he was pinned down by Lucknow DIG D K Thakur during an SP agitation against price rise in Lucknow on 9 April 2011. He broke his hand and was sent to prison. On 21 May 2013, he was made state minister of dairy and milk in UP CM Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet. On 27 April 2014 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav sent his point man Sunil Singh Sajan to lead a team of 50 party volunteers with the relief material from the state for the needy people in quake hit Kathmandu.

Biography  Born in Algeria, Desplan completed his undergraduate training at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in St. Cloud, France in 1975 and he received a Ph.D. at the Institut National de la Sant√© et de la Recherche M√©dicale (INSERM) in Paris in 1983. His thesis work, done under the guidance of Mohsen Moukhtar and Monique Thomasset, focused on calcium regulation. As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Pat O‚ÄôFarrell at the University of California, San Francisco, Desplan worked on the functional specificity of homeodomain proteins.

Nature, 318, 630-635 (1985). In 1987, he joined the faculty of Rockefeller University and was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Assistant and Associate Investigator.

Description and history The Scranton House is located in a rural setting of northeastern Goshen, on the north side of Brook Road about east of its junction with Province Road. It is a -story Cape-style wooden structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is wide, with a seven-bay facade, with a 20th-century entry one bay left of center. Windows are sash, and a brick chimney rises against the right side. The house framing consists of planking (1.25 to 1.5-inch vs. a more typical 3-inch found in other Goshen plank-frame houses) oriented vertically, with dowels placed horizontally for lateral stability. A 20th-century two-car garage is attached to the left side at a recess, and the property also includes a horse barn. The house was built about 1850, and originally was clad in vertical board-and-batten siding, with a relatively fine Greek Revival entrance surround.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Seavey House is located south of the village center of Goshen, on the west side of NH 10. It is a -story wooden Cape-style house, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its structure is framed out of wooden planking thick, set vertically, with dowels placed horizontally for lateral stability. The main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around an elaborate Greek Revival entrance. The entry is recessed, with sidelight windows immediately flanking the door, and pilasters with peaked lintels outside the recess. The building corners also have pilasters, which rise to an entablature which spans the front. A smaller single-story ell extends to the left at a recess to the main block. The house was built about 1860, most likely by John Chandler, a prolific local builder of plank-frame houses. Local historians believe Chandler built this house for his own use.

It premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival where it was awarded the Golden Lion for Best Film. It was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards but it was not nominated. Its title is a reference to the 1565 painting The Hunters in the Snow by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The painting depicts a rural wintertime scene, with some birds perched on tree branches. Andersson said he imagined that the birds in the scene are watching the people below, wondering what they are doing. He explained the title of the film as a \\"different way of saying 'what are we actually doing', that's what the movie is about.\\" At the Venice Film Festival, Andersson said that the film had been inspired by the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves by Vittorio De Sica.  Plot  The slow cinema movie consists of a series of mostly self-contained tableaux, sometimes connected by recurring themes or characters. The story loosely follows two traveling novelty salesmen, Jonathan and Sam, who live in a desolate flophouse, and their unsuccessful attempts to win customers for their joke articles (vampire teeth, laughing bags and a monster mask). Although there is no main storyline in the traditional sense, all scenes are connected.

On 17 January 1914 at Epsom showgrounds he took New Zealand's first military plane, a Bl√©riot XI-2, for its first flight. Early life Born in Fielding in the Manawatu District of the North Island of New Zealand, on 19 July 1886. he grew up on his family's farm at Rangitikei. He attended Campbell Street School in Palmerston North, then, during 1899‚Äì1901, St Patrick's College, Wellington. At the age of 18 he left New Zealand for Australia in late 1904. After briefly working on a sheep station, he travelled via Hawaii to work as a gold prospector on the Klondike in Canada.Classen, page 23. When gold mining proved unprofitable he trapped animals in Alaska before heading south and spending much of 1905 working on a cattle ranch near Phoenix in Arizona. He left the United States on 20 November, returning to New Zealand for a brief holiday before he returned to the United States via Sydney, Fiji and Hawaii, arriving in Vancouver, Canada on 9 April 1908. He traveled south to the United States and eventually joined William F. Cody, aka Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.Classen, page 24. Cody's final European tour had ended in 1907 and, in 1908, he and Pawnee Bill, another showman, joined forces and created the \\"Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West and Pawnee Bill‚Äôs Great Far East, popularly known as the \\"Two Bill‚Äôs\\" show. After six months with the \\"Two Bill‚Äôs\\" show he left in 1908 and toured much of Europe, apparently using the East Sussex seaside town of Seaford as a base. It was while here that he married Ethelwyn Wilkinson, a local woman in 1909. Enters aviation Excited by the development of aviation Hammond obtained some flying tuition from L√©on Delagrange, probably at Reims. In July 1910 after attending the second of the famous annual Reims flying meetings, Hammond obtained further instruction from Henri Molla at the Sanchez-Besa school at Mourmelon (Camp de Ch√¢lons). As a result, shortly after his marriage Hammond was able to gain from the A√©ro-Club de France his French Aviators Certificate (No.258) on 4 October 1910, flying a Sanchez-Besa Biplane. In so doing he became the first New Zealander to obtain a flying certificate. Returning to England he was granted Royal Aero Club aviators certificate 32 on 22 November 1910, after demonstrating his skill flying a Bristol Boxkite at Salisbury Plain. His new qualifications allowed him to obtain a position as a salesman and demonstration pilot with the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company (later known as the Bristol Aeroplane Company) which was manufacturing the Bristol Boxkite.Classen, page 26. Flights in Australia Bristol Boxkite Replica at RAAF Museum The company sent Hammond (accompanied by his wife, Sydney E. Smith, the company's manager, mechanic/pilot Leslie F. Macdonald and a staff of mechanics as well as two Boxkites to Australia in an attempt to interest the Australian government in purchasing aircraft for military reconnaissance. Had they were successful, the intention was to establish a factory in Melbourne to build the planes. They disembarked from the R.M.S. Omrah in Fremantle on 13 13 December 1910 and transferred to Perth. After assembling machine No. 10 Hammond made the first aircraft flight in West Australia from Perth's Belmont Park Racecourse on 3 January 1911. Hammond made the final of the seven flights he made in Perth on 12 January 1911, after which the aircraft was dismantled and shipped to Melbourne. Setting up their flight headquarters in Altona, a suburb of Melbourne and reassembling an aircraft, Hammond on 18 February 1911, undertook the aircraft aloft for his first flight in Victoria. On 20 February 1911, he flew from Altona to Geelong and landed on the Geelong Racecourse, taking 55 minutes to cover 42 miles (67.6 km). The following day Hammond returned to Altona, having made the first cross-country flights in Australia. On 23 February, also from Altona, Hammond made the first passenger flight in Australia, taking Frank Coles, one of the Bristol mechanics, for a 7¬Ω minute flight. Later that same day he took his wife, Ethelwyn for a 12¬Ω minute flight, making her the first woman to fly in Australia. On 2 March 1911, local businessman, M. H. Baillieu, paid to be taken for a flight. This 11.8 mile (19 km) circular journey was the first paid charter flight and also the first carrying an Australian citizen as a passenger. On 26 March 1911 Hammond flew with both Leslie McDonald and mechanic Coles as passengers to demonstrate the weight carrying performance of the Boxkite. This was the first multiple passenger flight in Australia. Hammond made a total of 40 flights in Melbourne before the team relocated to Sydney. On 18 April 1911 Hammond made the first- ever flight in Sydney, flying from the site of what would become Sydney Airport. This was the first of several aerial displays and flights for fee- paying passengers over in SydneyClassen, pages 26-27. While official observers from the Australian Army had observed these demonstrations and were also taken for flights, in a further attempt to obtain orders from the military Hammond with a Captain Niechy as passenger flew 20 miles on 3 May from Botany Bay at Sydney to a cavalry training camp at Liverpool.Classen, page 28. He landed in the presence of the governor general, Lord Dudley and Brigadier General J. M. Gordon. The following day he flew Lt Colonel Antill on an observation flight of the Liverpool camp. During his five months in Australia Hammond flew over 65 flights (some of them with his wife as passenger).Classen, pages, 24 31. Leslie Macdonald gave further demonstration flights in Sydney before the Bristol tour finished on 9 May 1911. While Hammond was not the first person to fly in Australia, prior to the arrival of the Bristol team the others had only made short hops or flew at very low heights. In comparison, the Boxkite flew higher, further, carried out display flying and took up passengers, all under the complete control of the pilot. McDonald took a photographer from the Daily Telegraph for a 25-minute flight over Sydney on 6 May, making the first aerial photographs to be taken in Australia. By 19 May, 72 flights totalling 765 miles (1231 km) had been made by No. 10\\\\. Machine No. 11, still in its crate, was sold to Parramatta dentist W.E. Hart who was given flying lessons by Leslie McDonald. Hart subsequently used the aircraft to become the first Australian to gain a aviator's certificate.\\"Bristol Flights Abroad\\" Flight 2 December 1911 p1050 When the Bristol team left for home Hammond and his wife remained behind and travelled to New Zealand introducing his wife to family and friends. During the holiday Hammond was admitted to hospital, first with appendicitis, followed by a bout of pneumonia and then blood poisoning in the leg. It was six months before he was well enough to travel back to England. Hammond and his wife returned in May 1912 to England by way of Sydney, Vancouver and New York. Flights in New Zealand Upon his return to England, Hammond continued working for the British and Colonial Aeroplane Co. until August 1912, when he took a position as an instructor at the Eastbourne Aviation Company's school. On 26 February 1913, Hammond joined the Royal Flying Corps Military Wing with the rank of 2nd lieutenant. In February 1913 the privately organised Imperial Air Fleet Committee (I.A.F.C.) presented the New Zealand government with a Bl√©riot XI-2. Prior to being gifted to New Zealand, Hamel, with Frank Dupee as passenger, had already flown the aircraft from Dover to Cologne, covering the 340 miles in four hours and 18 minutes. Thomas Mackenzie, the high commissioner for New Zealand, officially received the gift on behalf of Mew Zealand at Hendon on 22 May 1913 (during which it was christened Britannia by Baroness Ettie Desborough, the wife of the president of the I.A.F.C.). Immediately afterwards former New Zealand premier Joseph Ward, who was present at the presentation, to the disquietude of his wife and daughter was taken for a flight in the machine by Gustav Hamel, followed in a later flight by Baron Desborough before it was disassembled for shipping.Classen, pages 22, 23, 42. Hammond was subsequently hired on 12 November 1913 to travel to New Zealand and demonstrate the Britannia. The airplane was shipped aboard the and arrived at Wellington, New Zealand, on 29 September without its propeller, which was still back in Hendon, England. Hammond had originally proposed to fly the aircraft to Auckland but was turned down, and instead the military shipped it by train. The propeller subsequently arrived in Wellington on 23 December 1913 on the SS Tainui but was not made available until 7 January 1914, when it was railed to Auckland and fitted to the aircraft. Once the aircraft was ready Hammond flew a trial flight over Auckland on 18 January 1914 Classen, page 44. The following day Hammond, with the consent of the military, attempted to take a reporter for a flight, but he had to abort the takeoff and narrowly missed crashing the aircraft into a fence. The next planned flight was to be over the city's Industrial, Agricultural and Mining exhibition on 29 January. However, on the evening of 28 January 1914, on the spur of the moment, he took Australian actress Esme McLennan of the Royal Pantomime Company on a 20-minute-long flight.Classen, page 45. It was like just nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced before, and so it‚Äôs quite hard to tell a real story about it. Mr Hammond is staying at the same hotel, and I expressed a wish to go up if ever he felt inclined to take a passenger. The aviator was not quite sure about the Britannia when it came to carrying a passenger, however, and he would make no promise. On Wednesday I went out with others of our party, after visiting the Exhibition, to see Mr Hammond fly. It was an absolute surprise to me when he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll take a passenger; will you come?‚Äô I didn‚Äôt wait to be asked twice, and at once got into the passenger‚Äôs seat. I honestly didn‚Äôt feel the least wee bit nervous. On the contrary, the feeling I was most conscious of was one of pleasurable excitement. And, do you know, the first feeling, once away, was how simple and safe it was. I‚Äôd somehow pictured aviators as having to be tied in, or having to hold on tight. On the Britannia I never even thought about being frightened, or of being anything else but comfortable and pleased. The machine left the ground so easily, and we mounted into the air so naturally, that it somehow seemed to inspire confidence. It is surprisingly difficult to analyse now what my sensations were. I only know that I was wonderfully elated, and that I just enjoyed every moment of it. From your volcanic cones I have often looked out over Auckland, and thought it the loveliest place in the world, but viewed from an aeroplane, at a height of nearly 2,000ft, it was like a glimpse of something almost unreal. The city itself looked big enough, but the houses, and the people seemed like those Gulliver must have met with on his famous travels. We were travelling faster than I have ever travelled in the fastest express trains, but there was not even the slightest vibration, nor was there any sensation that was other than entirely pleasant. When we can actually journey from one place to another without the fatigue of train travelling or the drawbacks of a sea voyage, how delightful it is going to be. When we descended it was all just equally simple, and apparently equally easy. Coming down the water chute two hours before, my friends had teased me because I was actually scared. Coming down to earth from the skies on the Britannia never gave me one nervous thought. We landed as skilfully and as easily as we went up. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt describe by experience in more graphic terms, but I‚Äôm a woman, and I can best express myself when I use a woman‚Äôs phrase, and simply say it was ‚Äòjust lovely‚Äô. I was more elated while in the air than I think I‚Äôve ever been about any first-night success at the theatre, and I really think I‚Äôm more excited about it now, when it‚Äôs all over, than I was while actually in the air. This unauthorised flight, and especially with an actress instead of a male dignitary, caused consternation among the male politicians and military officials. As a result, no further flights were permitted, and Hammond's contract was terminated for his lapse in protocol. While the aircraft remained on display for the rest of the exhibition, it was later sent back to Wellington and placed in storage in the autumn of 1914. The New Zealand Government offered it for service in World War One, and it returned to the UK in October 1914 with the 1NZEF First Echelon. A replica was built by David Comrie at his home in Dunedin and is now on display in the Air Force Museum of New Zealand at Wigram in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Bleriot is displayed as it would have looked on its exhibition flight, with Hammond in the front and Esme McLennan as his passenger. World War I Hammond returned to England arriving in mid-August 1914 and was attached to the Royal Flying Corp as an instructor. He was posted from 1 Reserve Aeroplane Squadron to France with the Expeditionary Force on 26 February 1915. Less than two months later, on 21 April, he returned to 1 RAS. He also spent another two weeks in France before a posting to 4 RAS in May 1915. There are no records as to whether he saw any action during his time in France. In March 1915 Hammond was confirmed in his rank of 2nd lieutenant, being promoted to lieutenant the next month, which was later backdated to 26 November 1914. In January 1916 he was promoted from flying officer to flight commander with the rank of captain. In December 1915 Hammond was transferred to the Aeronautical Inspection Department and throughout 1916 was involved in testing and evaluating new aircraft, among them the Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier. While his maiden flight in the aircraft was successful, during a subsequent flight on 16 September 1916 the engine caught fire, and, unable to reach the airfield at Lincoln, he crash landed in a lunatic asylum.Classen, page 225. Many onlookers assumed that Hammond had died in the crash, but he was later found having a shave in a barber's shop in Lincoln. During the maiden flight of the second prototype the following year, the aircraft stalled on takeoff and flipped over as it hit the ground, Hammond's life being saved by the size of the tail section. In 1918 he was attached to the British Aviation Mission which left from Liverpool on 27 March 19818 arrived in New York in April 1918 to advise and promote aviation in the United States. Believing he had a better job in England, Hammond was unhappy with the appointment as his work basically involved giving exhibition flights as part of a joint American-British Liberty Bonds team. In late May 1918 Hammond had a narrow escape when evaluating a US-designed Standard M-Defence (prototype for the Standard E-I). The machine had previously been test-flown at Mineola, New York, on 21 May by, Lt. C.F Soulier a member of the French Military Mission, who suggested several minor modifications be made to the aircraft. After the modifications had been completed, Hammond attempted to fly the machine from Mineola Field to Washington, D.C., but the engine seized, resulting in it crashing in New Jersey. Hammond walked away from the crash with minor injuries. An investigation later found that Hammond had apparently taken off without checking the oil, and the flight had not been officially authorized. After giving a flying display during the Fourth Liberty Loan War Bond Drive air display at Greenfield, Hammond was returning to the mission's base at an airfield in Indianapolis on 22 September 1918 in a Bristol Fighter F.2B. In return for the hospitality he had been shown at the air display, he offered a ride to Indianapolis to Lt Roy W. Pickett of the US Army Air Service (who was home on leave) and local businessman John Lawrence Kinder. As the aircraft approached the airfield at about 5:30 pm, it went into a right-hand spin from 600 feet (183 m), its left wing striking a tree before crashing in a cornfield of the Marion County Poor Farm near its boundary with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Hammond and Kinder were killed on impact, while Pickett escaped with a broken right leg and a lacerated jaw and shock.Classen, page 398. Hammond's funeral was held in Indianapolis with thousands, including a firing squad of American and British aviation officers, attending the ceremony, at which the bishop of Indianapolis officiated. Hammond was cremated and his remains were then stored in the family mausoleum of Carl Fisher, the founder of the Indianapolis speedway. Fisher had donated his own plot in the mausoleum in the expectation that Hammond's family could come and claim the remains after the war. Hammond's remains were never collected and still reside in Carl Fisher's mausoleum at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. It is believed that by the time of his death he had accumulated over 6,000 flying hours. Personal life On 19 November 1909 he married Ethelwyn Wilkinson (1887‚Äì1951) from Seaford. After Hammond's death she moved back home to live with her parents and did not remarry, dying at the age of 64 in Hailsham. Legacy By the time of his death Hammond had 'become almost a legendary hero' according to the editor of The Aeroplane.Classen, page 399. A plaque unveiled on 15 April 2011 at Hammond Place, Mascot honours his 18 April 1911 flight over Sydney. The plaque reads: On the 18th April 1911, Captain Joseph Joel Hammond, a New Zealander, flew a Bristol box-kite biplane on a flight that lasted less than 10 minutes. Thousands of paying spectators crowded what was then the Ascot Racecourse to see one man in a flying contraption fly a course of about 10 kilometres.

Its common names include leaf curl plum aphid, and leaf-curling plum aphid, and it is a serious pest of plum and damson trees. Description The viviparous wingless females have an oval or pear-shaped body and grow to a length of up to . Early in the season they are brownish but later they are yellowish-green. The antennae are pale green and short, about half the length of the body. There is no dark, shining patch on the dorsal surface of the abdomen, a fact which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar thistle aphid (Brachycaudus cardui). The cauda (tail-like elongation) is bluntly rounded, the legs are pale except for the extremities, and the cornicles are pale-coloured, short and flanged. Winged females range from in length and have a blackish head with longer antennae, blackish thorax and a green abdomen with dark spots on the third to sixth segments. The overwintering eggs are black. Biology Brachycaudus helichrysi overwinters as fertilised eggs which hatch during the winter or early spring, before the plum and damson trees on which they are laid come into leaf. The fundatrices (viviparous parthenogenetic females produced on the primary host) feed at first at the base of buds but as the buds begin to expand, they move on to softer tissues, and later on to the new shoots and underside of the foliage. By May, some winged forms are beginning to appear and these fly to secondary hosts, such as Asteraceae, Chrysanthemum and Trifolium, where they found new colonies. The colonies on the primary host gradually die out. Further generations develop on the secondary hosts and in the autumn, winged forms fly back to the primary host. Here sexual forms develop, mating takes place and eggs are laid on twigs and spurs of the plum and damson trees. Natural enemies include ladybirds, lacewings, soldier beetles and hoverflies. Damage Brachycaudus helichrysi is a serious pest of stone fruits. It forms dense colonies on the underside of the leaves of the primary host causing curling, twisting and distortion of the foliage, the shedding of flowers and the dropping of young fruit. It is one of several species of aphid that can transmit the virus that causes plum pox.

Plot  Chittu (Ranjini) returns to her hometown of Mettupatti after being raised by her grandmother in a neighboring town. The two most powerful and rich men in town are brothers Thavasi, known as Periyavar (Sivaji Ganesan), and Virumandi, known as Chinnavar (Vinu Chakravarthy). Periyavar believes in equal justice above all else and is highly respected in the village while Chinnavar believes is his own caste-superiority. Periyavar has a very young grandchild, Chinnathayee, who's been widowed after a child marriage. Chittu's parents, Velappa (Rajesh) and Velaiamma (Sujatha), launder the town's clothes. Chittu finds it difficult to adjust to the town's rigid caste hierarchy after being raised with more freedom by her grandmother. She also clashes with her classmate Mayilsamy (Murali), Chinnavar's son. He constantly teases and humiliates her due to her caste. Chittu eventually convenes the panjayath to ask for justice and Periyavar punishes Mayilsamy. Chittu intervenes as she's worried his punishment will only breed more resentment and retaliation. In the aftermath of this incident, Mayilsamy realizes his errors and soon falls in love with Chittu while Periyavar grows closer to Velappa's family. Chinnavar is incensed by Chittu's arrogance and what he believes is Velappa rising above his station. When Periyavar is called away, Chinnavar, the town's doctor and a few others force Velappa to work during the town's Pongal festival celebrations. Velappa is burned terribly in an accident while he's working. Chittu begs the doctor for help but is rebuffed by him and Chinnavar. Vellappa dies in agony and, in anger, Chittu yells at Chinnavar and his friends for their cruelty. In retaliation, he drives Chittu and Vellamma out of town. Years later, the two women return to the town when Chittu becomes the town's new doctor. Some of the townspeople have changed significantly, however some things are still very much the same.

Apethorpe is certainly on a par with Hatfield and Knole and is by far the most important country house to have been threatened with major loss through decay since the 1950s.\\" Baron Pfetten has agreed to an 80-year commitment of 50 days' public opening a year, a far more extensive undertaking than the normal period of 10 years in the case of English Heritage grant-aided properties.

It is approximately long and flows through Madison Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . Several people settled on the stream in the 1780s and 1790s. Two bridges were built over it in the 20th century. Spruce Run is designated as a \\"Locally Significant Area\\" in the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. More than 80 species of woodland herbs and numerous trees, mammals, and birds inhabit the area near the stream. The Pennsylvania State Game Lands are also in the watershed. Course Spruce Run frozen over in January Spruce Run begins in a valley in northern Madison Township, approximately south of the Columbia/Lycoming county line. It flows southeast for approximately a mile and then east for a slightly shorter distance, running parallel to Spruce Run Road. The stream then turns east-southeast and its valley widens considerably. Over the next few miles, the stream's valley gets broader and shallower and eventually it stops flowing parallel to Spruce Run Road. It then crosses Pennsylvania Route 254 and turns southeast for a few miles. The stream's valley becomes narrower again in its lower reaches. Shortly afterwards, it reaches its confluence with Little Fishing Creek near the community of Eyers Grove. Spruce Run joins Little Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation of Spruce Run near its mouth is above sea level. The elevation of the stream at its source is approximately above sea level. The stream is described as a \\"small stream\\" in John Gosse Freeze's book A History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania: From the Earliest Times. Watershed The watershed of Spruce Run has an area of . The upper reaches of the stream are in the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 226. There are no all-terrain vehicle trails along the stream and the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory opposes the addition of any. History and Industries A number of people settled on Spruce Run in the late 1700s. Peter Brugler, a former resident of Jersey, settled on the western side of the stream in 1779 or 1780 and James Masters, another former Jersey resident settled there in 1786. George Runyon arrived at the stream in 1796 and also settled there. In 1791, James Masters built a sawmill, chopmill, and fulling mill on the stream. This was one of the first industries in Madison township. Two bridges that are more than long cross Spruce Run. One was built in 1932 and repaired in 2011. It is long. The other is a concrete tee beam bridge that was built in 1970. It is long. The Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory advises against logging on Spruce Run. Biology There are eastern hemlock and mixed hardwood forests along Spruce Run. There is also a high level of diversity of birds near the stream. Red salamanders and black-throated green warblers have the potential to inhabit the areas near the stream. In addition to eastern hemlock, tree species that live near Spruce Run include yellow birch, black birch, basswood, sugar maple, white ash, beech, and black cherry. There are more than 80 species of woodland herbs in the area, including 15 fern species and 12 sedge species. However, invasive plants such as the multiflora rose and the autumn olive also inhabit the area near the stream. Numerous game animals are found in the vicinity of Spruce Run. These include white-tailed deer, black bear, ring-necked pheasant, cottontail rabbit, wild turkey, and squirrels. A large number of other bird species also inhabit the area. These include five warbler species, two thrush species, one flycatcher species, and a number of other species. Ruffed grouse also occur in large numbers on Spruce Run.

The publication ran from 1851 to 1879. History =Early history and background= The first proposition to establish a newspaper in Los Angeles was made to the city council October 16, 1850. The minutes of the meeting on that date contain this entry: ‚ÄúTheodore Foster petitions for a lot situated at the northerly corner of the jail for the purpose of erecting thereon a house to be used as a printing establishment. The council‚Äîtaking in consideration the advantages which a printing house offers to the advancement of public enlightenment, and there existing as yet no such establishment in the city: Resolved. That for this once only a lot from amongst those that are marked on the city map be given to Mr. Theodore Foster for the purpose of establishing thereon a printing house; and the donation be made in his favor because he is the first to inaugurate this public benefit. The location of the printing house was on what is now Los Angeles Street, then called Calle Zanja Madre (Mother Ditch street), and sometimes Canal street. This site of Foster‚Äôs printing office was opposite the Bell Block. On the lot granted by the council, Foster built a small two-story frame building. The lower story was occupied by the printing outfit, and the upper story was used as a living room by the printers and proprietors of the paper. Over the door was the Sign ‚ÄúImprenta‚Äù (printing office). The first number of the pioneer paper was issued May 17, 1851. It was named La Estrella de Los Angeles (Los Angeles Star). It was a four-page, five column paper; size of page, 12x18 inches. Two pages were printed in English and two in Spanish. The subscription price was US$10 a year, payable in advance. Advertisements were inserted at the rate of $2 per square for the first insertion and $1 for each subsequent insertion. The publishers were John A. Lewis and John McElroy. Foster had dropped out of the establishment before the publication of the first issue. Two years later he committed suicide by drowning himself in the Fresno River. In July 1851, William H. Rand bought an interest in the paper and the firm became Lewis, McElroy & Rand. In November, McElroy sold his interest to Lewis & Rand. John A. Lewis edited the English pages and Manuel Clemente Rojo was editor of the Spanish columns of the Star for some time after its founding. The press was an old Washington Hoe. It came around the Horn of Africa, a journey of six or seven months. Its circulation did not exceed 250 copies. The first job of city work done by La Estrella (as it is always called in the early records) was the printing of one hundred white ribbon badges for the city police. The inscription on the badge, which was printed both in English and Spanish, read ‚ÄúCity Police, organized by the Common Council of Los Angeles, July 12, 1851.‚Äù La Estrella‚Äô; the bill for the job was US$25. = 1853‚Äì55 = In July, 1853, Rand transferred his interest in the Star to his partner, John A. Lewis. August 1, 1853, Lewis sold the paper to James M. McMeans. The obstacles to be overcome in the publication of a pioneer newspaper in Southern California were described by Lewis in his final issue of the Star on July 30, 1853: :‚ÄúIt is now two years and three months since the Star was established in this city‚Äîand in taking leave of my readers, in saying my last say, I may very properly be permitted to look back through this period to see how accounts stand. The establishment of a newspaper in Los Angeles was considered something of an experiment, more particularly on account of the isolation of the city. The sources of public news are sometimes cut off for three or four weeks, and very frequently two weeks. San Francisco, the nearest place where a newspaper is printed, is more than five hundred miles distant, and the mail between that city and Los Angeles takes an uncertain course, sometimes by sea and sometimes by land, occupying in its transmission from two to six weeks, and in one instance, fifty-two days. Therefore, I have had to depend mainly upon local news to make the Star interesting. And yet the more important events of the country have been recorded as fully as the limits of the Star would permit. The printing of a paper one-half in the Spanish language was certainly an experiment hitherto unattempted in the state. Having no exchanges with papers in that language the main reliance has been upon translations and such contributions as several good friends have favored me with. I leave others to judge whether the ‚ÄòEstrella‚Äô has been well or ill conducted.‚Äù Under Lewis‚Äô management the Star was nonpartisan in politics. He says, ‚ÄúI professed all along to print an independent newspaper, and although my own preferences were with the Whig party, I never could see enough either in the Whig or Democratic party to make a newspaper of. I never could muster up fanaticism enough to print a party paper.‚Äù McMeans went to the States shortly after assuming the management of the paper. William A. Wallace conducted it during his absence. Early in 1854 it was sold to M. D. Brundige. Under Brundige‚Äôs proprietorship, Wallace edited the paper. It was still published in the house built by Foster. In the latter part of 1854, the Star was sold to J. S. Waite & Co. The site donated to Foster by the council in 1850, on which to establish a printing house for the advancement of public enlightenment, seems not to have been a part of the Star outfit. A prospectus on the Spanish page informs us that ‚ÄúImprenta de la Estrella, Calle Principal, Casa de Temple‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the printing ofiice of the Star is on Main street, in the House of Temple, where was added, the finest typographical work will be done in Spanish, French and English. Waite reduced the subscription price of the Star to $6 a year, payable in advance, or $9 at the end of the year. Fifty per cent advance on a deferred payment looks like a high rate of interest, but it was very reasonable in those days. Money, then, commanded five, ten and even as high as fifteen per cent a month, compounded monthly; and yet the mines of California were turning out $50,000,000 in gold every year. Here is a problem in the supply and demand of a cirsulating medium for some of our astute financial theorists to solve. In July, 1855, the subscription price of the Star was reduced to US$5 a year. The publisher informed his patrons that he would receive subscriptions ‚Äúpayable in most kinds of produce after harvest‚Äîcorn, wheat, flour, wood, butter, eggs, etc., will be taken on old subscriptions.‚Äù In November, 1855, Waite, the sole proprietor, publisher and business manager of the Star, was appointed postmaster of Los Angeles. He found it difiicult to keep the Star shining, the mails moving and his produce exchange running. = 1856‚Äì64 = In the issue of February 2, 1856, he offers the ‚Äúentire establishment of the Star for sale at US$1,000 less than cost.‚Äù In setting forth its merits, he wrote: ‚ÄúTo a young man of energy and ability a rare chance is now offered to spread himself and peradventure to realize a fortune.‚Äù The young man with expansive qualities was found two months later in the person of William A. Wallace, who had been editor of the Star in 1854. He was the first principal of the school-house No. 1, which stood on the northwest corner of Spring and Second streets, where the Bryson Block subsequently was located. In his salutatory, he says: ‚ÄúThe Star is an old favorite of mine, and I have always wished to be its proprietor.‚Äù Two months later, Wallace became laid up. Henry Hamilton, the successor of Wallace, was an experienced newspaper man. For five years previous to purchasing the Star he had been proprietor of the Calaveras Chronicle. He was an editor of the old school‚Äîthe school that dealt out column editorials, and gave scant space to locals. Hamilton‚Äôs forte was political editorials. He was a bitter partisan. He was an able writer. He was a Scotch-Irishman. His vigorous partisanship got him into trouble. During the American Civil War, he espoused the cause of the Confederate States of America. For some severe criticisms on Abraham Lincoln and other ofiicers of the government, and his outspoken sympathy for the Confederates, he was arrested. He took the oath of allegiance, and was released, but the Star went into an eclipse. The last number, a single page, appeared October 1, 1864. The press and type were sold to Phineas Banning, and were used in the publication of the Wilmington Journal. = Last years 1868‚Äì79 = On Saturday, May 16, 1868, the Star emerged from obscurity. ‚ÄúToday,‚Äù wrote Hamilton, ‚Äúwe resume the publication of the Los Angeles Star. Nearly four years have elapsed since our last issue. The little ‚Äòonpleasantness,‚Äô which at that time existed in the family, has toned down considerably, and if perfect harmony does not yet pervade the circle, our hope is this brotherly feeling will soon be consummated.‚Äù The paper was no longer the bitter partisan sheet that it had been during the early 1860s. Hamilton now seldom indulged in political leaders of a column length, and when he did they were of a mild type. The new Star was a seven column blanket sheet, and was devoted to promoting the welfare of the county. It was ably conducted, and was a model newspaper for a town of 5,000 inhabitants. June 1, 1870, the first number of the Daily Star was published by Hamilton & Barter. Barter retired from the firm in September and founded the Anaheim Gazette, the pioneer newspaper of Orange County, California. He bought the old press and type of the Wilmington Journal‚Äîthe first press of the Star‚Äîand again the old press became a pioneer. When the Anaheim Gazette office burned down in 1877, the old press perished in the flames. After G. W. Barter sold out the Anaheim Gazette in 1872, he leased the Daily Star from Hamilton. He ran it less than a year, but that was long enough for him to take all the twinkle out of it. It had almost sunk below the horizon when Hamilton resumed its publication. In July, 1873, he sold it to Ben C. Truman. Truman put sparkle in it. He made it interesting to his friends, and equally so to his enemies. Truman continued its publication until July, 1877, when it was sold to Paynter & Company. Then it passed to Brown 81 Company. The Rev. Campbell of the Methodist Church South conducted it for a time. In the last year of its existence, it had several different publishers and editors. Its brilliancy steadily diminished until in the early part of 1879 when the sheriff attached it for debt, and its publication was discontinued. The plant and the files were stored in an outbuilding of Mr. Hollenbeck‚Äôs, who was one of the principal creditors. His Chinese laborers roomed in the lower part of the building, and after setting fire to the house, destroyed what remained of The Star. Footnotes Further reading * William B.

As of 2020, Peregrine is one of the top 15 private companies in Australia, and the largest in SA, with an annual revenue of over . It also owns The Bend Motorsport Park at Tailem Bend and the Mallala Motor Sport Park. History Fathi (Fred) Shahin and the rest of his Palestinian family moved to Lebanon during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, when he was ten years old. Shahin went to night school to qualify as an accountant. After working for the United Nations for 27 years, he and his family migrated to Australia. When he could not find work, he bought a BP service station in Woodville, a suburb of Adelaide, and the family lived on site. Peregrine was founded in 1984 with the purchase of the service station, soon followed by a chain of Smokemart (tobacco retailer) stores across Adelaide. After Fred's death, three of his sons, Yasser, Khalil (Charlie) and Samer (Sam) took over the business. Peregrine bought the Mobil fuel outlets in South Australia in 2010 and 25 company-owned BP outlets in 2014. The acquired sites were rebranded and upgraded to 24-hour On The Run sites. By June 2014, Peregrine owned a chain of 24-hour convenience stores and service stations operating under the On The Run brand. Yasser Shahin and family were included on the BRW Rich 200 list in 2014. In 2015 Peregrine announced plans to redevelop the former Mitsubishi Motors Australia test site outside Tailem Bend, South Australia as The Bend Motorsport Park, to be opened in 2017, and in May 2017, announced the purchase of the Mallala Motor Sport Park. In 2016 Peregrine Corporation was listed at number 14 in The Australian Financial Review's \\"Top 500 Private Companies\\", with an estimated annual revenue of A$1.90b. Company description Many of the On the Run sites operate alongside other brands such as Subway, Brumby's Bakeries, Oporto, and Wendy's. Peregrine brought the Krispy Kreme doughnut franchise to South Australia and also runs the Mexican food franchise Guzman Y Gomez. , OTR had 145 outlets in SA, and one in Victoria, and is the state‚Äôs biggest seller of barista-made espresso coffee. , Peregrine is one of the top 15 private companies in Australia, and the largest in SA. Its annual revenue is over , and it employs more than 3,500 people.  Controversies  Redevelopment of an On The Run Store dumped 2000 tonnes of contaminated carcinogenic soil in the Adelaide Hills. For this sustained breach of law, fines of $28000 were levied against the operators of Peregrine Corporation and associated business Nasmin Pty Ltd. In 2018 the OTR brand of the company received significant criticism from consumers and environmental groups for a decision to ban reusable coffee cups, amongst growing concerns of the negative effect of the 1.2 billion disposable cups that end-up in landfill in Australia each year. A class action on behalf of 1,050 On The Run workers was lodged with the Australian Federal Court on 13 May 2020. The company was accused of failing to pay overtime, underpaying staff and misusing its traineeship program as a method to reduce workers' pay, dating back to 2014 and involving all stores in South Australia. OTR allegedly used eight different wage minimisation tactics that enabled gross underpayment of its staff. In March 2020, the Federal Court had upheld a separate decision by South Australia's Employment Tribunal to award to an OTR employee who had been underpaid. There has been opposition by local residents to a planned OTR outlet on Kensington Road in Kensington Park, and to the expansion of the Peregrine headquarters building in Kensington to a height of seven storeys with a helipad on top of the building. In August 2020 Peregrine was ordered by the South Australian Employment Tribunal to pay to an employee after being found to have deliberately underpaid him over the period of a about a year in 2016, at an OTR at Fulham, South Australia.

The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background American companies can currently deduct the costs of moving facilities overseas from their taxes, something that would change under this bill. The text of S. 2569 is identical to a bill written by the Senator Stabenow that failed in the 112th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Bring Jobs Home Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) grant business taxpayers a tax credit for up to 20% of insourcing expenses incurred for eliminating a business located outside the United States and relocating it within the United States, and (2) deny a tax deduction for outsourcing expenses incurred in relocating a U.S. business outside the United States. The bill would require an increase in the taxpayer's employment of full-time employees in the United States in order to claim the tax credit for insourcing expenses. Procedural history The Bring Jobs Home Act was introduced into the United States Senate on July 8, 2014 by Sen. John Walsh (D-MT). Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) was an initial co-sponsor. On July 23, 2014, the Senate voted to advance the bill for consideration in a vote of 93-7. Debate and discussion Senator Stabenow said that \\"we've got to make sure the tax code reflects the right values and policies.\\" Senator Walsh is considered \\"one of the most vulnerable incumbents in this election cycle.\\" Walsh has alleged that his opponent was involved in outsourcing. According to Walsh, \\"it is outrageous that Americans are forced to subsidize corporate decisions to ship jobs overseas.\\" Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) said that the bill \\"would end senseless tax breaks for outsourcers\\" and \\"would end the absurd practice of American taxpayers bankrolling the outsourcing of their very own jobs.\\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) accused the Democrats of only being interested in politics and not in actually encouraging companies to stay in the United States. McConnell pointed to reducing corporate tax rates as a step that would keep businesses in the United States that the Democrats have been unwilling to take. According to McConnell, the bill is \\"designed for campaign rhetoric and failure - not to create jobs here in the U.S.\\" The Joint Committee on Taxation reported that the bill would result in the government losing $214 million in revenue over 10 years. Howard Cleckman on Forbes criticized the bill as a \\"message bill\\" that \\"Democratic sponsors have no interest in making\\" law because \\"they merely see it as a way to boost the party's Senate candidates in part by forcing Republicans against something that sounds like a good idea.\\" Cleckman argued that major U.S. firms already pay such low taxes, that any tax credits available for bringing business units back to the United States would be meaningless. He also argues that the bill won't do anything to increasing hiring in the United States because the company can claim the credit with as few as one new job.

It was founded in 1904, and formally chartered in 1933. At one time it was one of the larger organizations of Canadian artists. History The Society of Graphic Art, or Graphic Arts Club, was organized in 1904 by the members of the Toronto Art Student's League and the Mahl-stick Club. Charles William Jefferys was one of the founding members. In 1909 the Canadian National Exhibition granted the Society space at its annual fall fair. The Royal Canadian Academy of Arts supported the Society from 1912. Arthur Lismer published a short essay on the Graphic Arts Club of Toronto and its relationship with the Canadian National Exhibition in The Year Book of Canadian Art 1913. The Graphic Arts Club held its first public exhibition in 1924. This exhibition was held in the Art Gallery of Toronto, where most of the annual shows were held until 1963. The society published The Canadian Graphic Art Year Book in 1931, with 24 pages and 38 illustrations, in a limited edition of five hundred copies. It was meant to showcase the national scope of Canadian graphics artists and the advances that had been made in the medium. The illustrations included bookplates, book illustrations, drawings and Christmas cards. The Society was formally granted a charter in 1933. At that time it changed its name to the Canadian Society of Graphic Art. The CSGA was exhibiting serigraphs by the mid-1930s. The CSGA was one of the larger of the Canadian artists' organizations by the late 1930s. The CSGA exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair. An exhibition was held in the Art Gallery of Toronto in March- April 1950 for the 50th anniversary of the gallery. All the visual art schools, styles and media were represented. The CSGA was among the eight art societies that contributed to the show. Jo Manning, who made prints between 1960 and 1980, was an executive member of the Canadian Society of Graphic Art and a member of the Society of Canadian Painter-Etchers and Engravers. In June‚ÄìAugust 1971 the two organizations held a joint exhibition at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. They merged in 1976 to form the Print and Drawing Council of Canada. Jo Manning was a founding member of the new Council.

It follows an 11-year-old girl named Haruna who becomes pregnant and gives birth with the support of her classmates. A live action adaptation, directed by Koji Hagiuda and starring Haruna Amari, was released in 2008. Plot Haruna and her childhood friend Hiroyuki are fifth-grade students who attend an unnamed school in Japan. Their class, taught by the young teacher Ms. Yagi, is a rambunctious one, despite efforts from Yagi and the class representative Mika. One day, when they are playing in the park, Haruna asks Hiroyuki if he wants to \\"stick it in\\". They find the experience funny, and Haruna jokes about the \\"white urine\\" which came out of Hiroyuki's penis. As they go to their respective homes, Haruna does not suspect that she has become pregnant. Over the next few months Haruna grows bigger, which her family attributes to her increased appetite, and begins suffering morning sickness. Haruna realizes her pregnancy after Yagi teaches an explicit sex ed class, with dolls illustrating intercourse. She hides this new understanding from her family, trying to keep the pregnancy a secret. After fearing that she's lost her mother and realizing how important a parent can be, Haruna decides to keep the baby, rather than having an abortion. Haruna's secret slowly gets out. She tells Hiroyuki, as the father, and Daigo, whom she has a crush on. She also accidentally tells Mika, thinking that she is another classmate named Mayu; Mika begins to worry about her pregnant classmate. The entire class learns of Haruna's pregnancy before an athletics competition, when Haruna rebuffs claims that she's fat by yelling \\"I'm running for two!\\" As the due date comes closer Haruna's grandmother learns of the pregnancy and gives Haruna cloth diapers and a talisman to ease the birth, but dies before she can tell Haruna's mother. Meanwhile, Yagi is losing control over her class as she is stalked by her ex-boyfriend, Nomura, with whom she broke up after he was too insistent on sex. The PTA, unaware of the stalking problem and its effect on her home life, find Yagi disorganized and unprepared for classes. They are also outraged over her teaching methods ‚Äì particularly in sex ed. Towards the end of Haruna's pregnancy, the fifth graders mutiny against Yagi, refusing to listen to her orders or follow her rules. Ultimately, the child is born a month before expected. Unable to reach Haruna's family or a doctor, the children decide to help Haruna give birth in their hideout, a shack in the middle of a field. Their classmate Mitsuo ‚Äì whose father is an obstetrician ‚Äì guides them through the process, and after the birth the children take turns watching the baby ‚Äì named Hajime, meaning \\"beginning\\" ‚Äì although Haruna is the only one who can feed him. The students try to raise Hajime in secrecy, but after Haruna and the children save Ms. Yagi from her stalker the teacher learns of Hajime's existence. Rather than report the news to Haruna's parents, and thus run the risk of national ridicule for not knowing her own student was pregnant, Yagi decides to teach the children how to take care of babies. The secret is found out when Haruna's grandfather goes unexpectedly for a walk, taking the baby with him from the hideout. The adults who find him demand to know whose baby he is carrying, and Haruna confesses. Hiroyuki's parents refuse to acknowledge their son as the father, and the press and neighbours' talk drives them to move to Hiroshima; at the last minute Hiroyuki gets off the train to affirm he is the father. Twelve years later, Haruna has raised Hajime alone and become a model. The classmates and their teacher gather at the old hideout, and Hajime meets his father for the first time. A pregnant Ms. Yagi suddenly goes into labour, giving birth to a daughter whom she names Haruna. Characters *, a girl who grows up in a household where sexual matters are discussed rarely, if at all.

Three volumes were compiled and published by Futabasha in 2005, on 28 January, 28 April, and 27 August respectively. In 2008, Futabasha compiled the whole story in a single volume. While writing the story, Sas≈ç attempted to balance the point of view of the children with that of adults and emphasize the conflict of old and new. He set the story in a suburb of Tokyo. Minami Nobunaga, reviewing Kodomo no Kodomo for the Asahi Shimbun, wrote that the manga, despite its seemingly simple premise, touched on themes of education, parent‚Äìchild relationships, community, professionalism, and gender equality. The reviewer described the manga as reaching all of the reader's senses, including through the heat of a dead chicken and the sound of Hajime's heart beating in sync with Haruna's. Film adaptation A live-action adaptation of the manga was directed by , who had previously adapted Sas≈ç's Shind≈ç. The film was shot in Noshiro, Akita, although the city council took issue with the film's themes. It starred ‚Äì a new actress chosen from 400 children at an audition ‚Äì as Haruna. It also featured Kumiko As≈ç, Juri Ueno, Mitsuki Tanimura, Yoshiko Miyazaki, and Ken Mitsuishi. The subject matter was not unprecedented in Japanese cinema; a TV drama called 14-sai no Haha (14-Year-Old Mother) had been released in 2006; several writers also noted that the film followed the success of the similarly themed American film Juno (2007). The film's soundtrack was handled by Shugo Tokumaru, in his debut as a film composer. Prior to its release there were calls for it to be banned for its themes of teenage pregnancy, though screening went ahead as scheduled and the film debuted on 27 September 2008. In his review for The Japan Times, Mark Schilling describes the film as an exposure of \\"the idiocies and hypocrisies of parents and teachers in dealing with the burgeoning sexuality of tweens, while tenderly celebrating the process of pregnancy and birth\\", adopting a positive view of early pregnancy while still showing the consequences and scandals a young mother faces. He also points out that the movie's realist tone is deceptive, calling it ‚Äúa serious film about a serious subject that is more wish fulfillment than realism‚Äù. In his review of the film, gives it 55 out of a 100. He finds it to have abandoned some of the manga's darker elements, such as a class run amok under a powerless feminist teacher. He also notes that the film version changed the athletics meet to a school play, and removed the glasses Mika wore in the manga; he considered these detrimental to the film, which he finds unable to adequately deal with its subject material.

His life and career encompassed coal mining, trade union work, First World War service with the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), political and animal welfare activism.  Early life, 1896‚Äì1920  Wilfred Risdon was born in Bath, Somerset, England, on 28 January 1896, the youngest of ten surviving children of Edward George Fouracres Risdon (1855‚Äì1931), a bespoke boot and shoe maker born in Devonport, Devon, and Louisa n√©e Harris (1851‚Äì1911) from Exeter, Devon, who also worked intermittently as a shoe machinist. In his childhood, Wilfred Risdon is reputed to have been a devout Christian, because his father was an adherent of the Plymouth Brethren: his grandfather committed suicide in 1862 when Edward Risdon was only 7 years old. This zealous Christianity undoubtedly influenced Wilfred Risdon's later career. Although the 1911 census describes Risdon as working in bookbinding, having presumably finished schooling at the age of 14, he soon started working at one of the local Somerset collieries: although the work would have been physically demanding for such a young boy, the wages might have been marginally better, especially after a few years' experience (assuming he survived). At that time, many Somerset coal miners moved to South Wales for better career prospects, and at some stage Risdon joined the exodus. It was in Wales that he became involved in union work, and either before or during the First World War, he aspired to a South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF) scholarship for a place at the Central Labour College, in competition with a colleague, Aneurin Bevan; Bevan was awarded the place, in 1919, while Risdon was still in Germany with the army of occupation (British Army of the Rhine). Risdon finished his war service with the rank of sergeant, but had also suffered shell shock, which affected his heart for the rest of his life. He decided to become a political organiser, and as a result of his association with trade unionists, his inclination was socialist.  Politics, 1921‚Äì1939  Around 1921, Risdon moved to Weymouth, Dorset, perhaps at the invitation of his older brother Charles Risdon (1884‚Äì1972); he was certainly living there after Charles's first wife Ellen Ann, n√©e Sheppard (born 1884) died in 1922. Risdon was working as a political organiser for the Labour Party and, in 1924, he was selected as Labour candidate for the South Dorset constituency in the October general election. South Dorset was a staunchly Conservative constituency, and Risdon was defeated by the incumbent, Major Robert Yerburgh, 1st Baron Alvingham.Craig, F. W. S. (1983). British parliamentary election results 1918-1949 (3 ed.). Chichester: Parliamentary Research Services. . One of the factors contributing to the defeat of Ramsay MacDonald's ten-month minority government was the Zinoviev letter. Risdon went back to his organising work in the south west of England, but he also started cultivating links with Birmingham, most probably because the then regional organiser, J H Edwards, was replaced in 1924 by Clem Jones, previously the divisional Labour Party agent in Smethwick.Worley, Matthew, ed. Labour's Grass Roots: Essays on the Activities of Local Labour Parties and Members, 1918‚Äì45 One of those links was with Fircroft College, \\"a residential college for working men\\", so, as well as meeting his future wife at one of the socialist summer schools in the Birmingham area, he also encountered for the first time his future colleague, mentor and employer, Oswald Mosley, most probably at the 1925 Independent Labour Party (ILP) Easter Conference in Gloucester. Mosley was a recent convert to socialism, and he was determined to dislodge one of the highest profile members of the \\"Birmingham Caucus\\",Tholfsen, Trygve R. \\"The Origins of the Birmingham Caucus\\", Louisiana State University, New Orleans; The Historical Journal, II, 2 (1959), p. 161 Neville Chamberlain. He was only narrowly defeated at Ladywood, Birmingham, in the 1924 election, and this aspiration had to take second place to his desire to return to parliament, which he was able to do in 1926, albeit in an adjacent constituency, Smethwick. While there is no specific evidence that Risdon helped with this campaign, his close association with Mosley at this time is generally acknowledged. By 1929, Risdon was living in Acocks Green, Birmingham, and he was now Midlands Divisional Organiser for the ILP. The following year, he organised the Easter Conference, held that year in Birmingham. By then, Mosley, although successful in cultivating Labour support in Birmingham and district, having used his own resources to finance the winning of six of the twelve available seats for Labour at the 1929 general election, was becoming increasingly pessimistic about the probability of achieving his goals of economic and social reform, even with a non-cabinet ministerial post, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, so he set about drawing up his own proposals, referred to as the Mosley Memorandum. After being ignored for over two months, this was finally rejected in May 1930, which convinced Mosley that resignation and criticism of the government from the back benches was the way forward, and by the autumn of that year, there was a \\"Mosley Group\\" in Parliament, including Risdon's erstwhile colleague, Aneurin Bevan. Mosley reconstituted his Memorandum into a Manifesto, which was published on 13 December 1930, and his thinking that the State should play a strong role in the affairs of the country, that it \\"should constitute a public utility organisation to turn out houses and building materials as we turned out munitions during the war\\" was made clear in his \\"immediate plan to meet an emergency situation\\",Skidelsky, Robert. Oswald Mosley. London: Papermac 1990 although by then, Mosley had already started making plans for a new political party, including an office at One Great George Street, Westminster, in January 1931, and the same month, the proposals contained in the Memorandum and Manifesto were published as a 61-page pamphlet entitled A National Policy, with the authors given as Aneurin Bevan, W. J. Brown, John Strachey and Allan Young. The New Party was founded on 1 March 1931. Risdon is known to have still been working as Midlands Divisional Organiser for the ILP until early FebruaryMinutes of the West Bromwich branch, ILP; Archives of the Independent Labour Party, series 2: minutes and related records, part 2: branch minutes and related records 1892‚Äì1950; microform; The British Library DSC Microform Research Collections but, given that the core of Mosley's new movement was based in Birmingham, (prior to the formation of the New Party, what had already become known as \\"Mosleyism\\" had been described as \\"Birminghamism rampant\\")\\"Eight of the 17 (Labour MPs who signed the Mosley Manifesto) came from the Black Country complex, thus justifying Frank Owen's description of Mosleyism as \\"Birminghamism rampant\\". Skidelsky, Robert. Oswald Mosley. London: Papermac 1990 Risdon was undoubtedly one the New Party's founder members, and his first major responsibility for the fledgling party was as election agent for Allan Young at the April 1931 by-election at Ashton-under- Lyne, a Labour seat, near Manchester. Young just saved his deposit, earning third place with 16% of the votes cast. The Labour supporters were angry at their candidate being beaten into second place; they formed a raucous mob outside the polling station, but Mosley faced them down, commenting to Risdon, \\"We saw worse than this in the war, Bill.\\"Cross, Colin. The Fascists in Britain. London: Barrie & Rockliff 1961 Not long after this, Risdon was sent to Newcastle to develop a regional organisation in the north east of England, and by the beginning of October, he had created branches in Hull, Newcastle and Gateshead.Worley, Matthew. Oswald Mosley and the New Party, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, At this time, Mosley initiated a plan for an \\"active force\\" of stewards (forerunners of the later controversial \\"Blackshirts\\"), supplied in part by a nationwide network of athletic clubs which was aimed at British youth:Skidelsky, Robert. Oswald Mosley. London: Papermac 1990 this was deemed necessary to prevent the violence and intimidation that was a feature of most of the New Party's meetings, but this behaviour was not only experienced by the new upstart party. The central planning of the New Party was, at best, haphazard, and in July, the support for local party organisation was drastically reduced, but Gateshead was considered important enough to warrant a candidate at the 1931 general election at the end of October; Risdon was again election agent, this time for the candidate James Stuart Barr, an old friend from Birmingham. His main rival was Ernest Bevin, for Labour. Not one of the 50 New Party candidates, including Barr, was successful at the election, forcing Mosley to take stock; the party was reduced to little more than an embryonic Youth Club organisation, known as NUPA (a mnemonic for NuParty) and this confirmed the view of many that Mosley appeared to be, and indeed was, moving towards an openly fascist party. Risdon was left with little to do, and without a regular salary, opened an advertising agency, whilst retaining a rump of committed New Party supporters. Meanwhile, Mosley was moving ever closer to fascism, visiting Italy in January 1932 to study the Italian version at close quarters, including meeting Benito Mussolini. During May and June, Mosley worked on \\"his exposition of the policy and philosophy of the new movement\\", The Greater Britain. Risdon received his copy in September, a month ahead of publication, and set about organising a local branch for Mosley's transformed political movement, the British Union of Fascists (BUF, or \\"British Union\\"), of which Risdon was a founder member. The inaugural ceremony on 1 October 1932, was attended by 32 founder members, most of whom wore black shirts. Risdon remained in Newcastle until February 1933, when he moved to London to take up his post as Mosley's first Director of Propaganda. His main area of responsibility was organising Mosley's public meetings, the first of which was held at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester on 12 March. The following month, he was one of a party of 14 from the BUF who visited Italy for Mussolini's International Fascist Exhibition in Rome. At this time, his salary in the BUF was second only to that of Dr. Robert Forgan, Director of Organisation. The first high-profile meeting he organised was at the Albert Hall in London on 22 April 1934, which passed off without any trouble. A few months after the notorious Olympia meeting of 7 June that year, following which the Blackshirt stewards were accused of using excessive force in ejecting troublemakers, Risdon was replaced as DoP by a relative newcomer who was a compelling public speaker, William Joyce. Risdon moved to Manchester to spearhead a recruiting campaign in the north west of England, which proved to be very successful: \\"The BUF opened about a score of propaganda centres in the cotton towns which, under Risdon's direction, enrolled new members by the thousand and were so successful as seriously to worry the Labour Party.\\" By now, he was writing regularly for the organisation's three (albeit not concurrent) periodicals, The Blackshirt, Fascist Week and Action, as well as occasionally in The Fascist Quarterly. Around this time, the police-style Action Press uniform started to be issued to the most dedicated members, but Risdon positively refused to wear it: in 1936, the wearing of political uniforms was banned under the Public Order Act, partly as a response to the violence of Cable Street, for which the British Union was not directly responsible. Towards the end of that same year, Risdon was promoted to Assistant Director General (Electoral), as a recognition of his expertise in the field of electoral organisation. The movement also published his book, A Guide to Constituency Organisation. The following year, British Union published a five-page pamphlet written by Risdon, called Strike Action or Power Action?, in which he outlined the benefits to trade unionists of the corporate state, as proposed by British Union. After the disappointing results in the 1937 London municipal elections (following which Joyce and John Beckett were sacked), and with the clouds of war gathering, it appeared to be increasingly unlikely that the planned general election in 1940 would take place, notwithstanding which British Union's chances of electoral success were diminishing rapidly, so in July 1939, Risdon left British Union without even tendering his notice. This was not a precipitate move; he did have a job to go to: a position organising a canvass on public attitudes towards vivisection for an organisation called the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society (LPAVS), whose committee secretary was an erstwhile colleague, Norah Elam, aka Mrs. (or \\"Lady\\") Dacre-Fox.  Antivivisection, 1939‚Äì1967  Risdon had been in his new post for less than a year when he was arrested under Defence Regulation 18B, which facilitated internment without charge or trial, on 23 May 1940 as a potential fifth columnist, along with around 80 other present and former members of British Union, men and women, and taken to Brixton Prison, as was Mosley. They were given the opportunity to appeal, and Risdon's appeal was heard on 11 July, before an Advisory Committee chaired by Mr. Norman Birkett KC. No decision was made or conveyed on the day, but subsequently it was decided that Risdon was not a threat to national security, and he was released from prison on or around 9 August. He was not able to resume his previous position immediately, but he was back within a matter of weeks, and by February 1941, he was Assistant Secretary. At the end of 1940, however, he made one of his most significant contributions to animal welfare during the war,Kean, Hilda. Animal Rights: Political & Social Change in Britain since 1800. London: Reaktion Books Ltd 1998 a design for an air raid shelter for domestic pets, that only required a minor alteration to an existing Anderson shelter.LPAVS News-Sheet no. 4, October 1940 By January 1942, Risdon was Secretary of the LPAVS committee. During this period, he encountered and developed a working relationship with Lord Hugh Dowding, who was committed to animal welfare, including anti-vivisection. During 1956, approaches were made to the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS), with a view towards amalgamation, and at the end of that year, the LPAVS was wound up and incorporated into the larger NAVS. Risdon became Secretary of the combined organisation. There were also moves towards an amalgamation with the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) at various times, but they did not succeed. In 1961, after two years of negotiations with the BUAV and the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Vivisection (SSPV), the Lawson Tait Memorial Trust, intended to commemorate the Scottish surgeon and anti- vivisectionist, Robert Lawson Tait (1845‚Äì1899), was set up with Risdon as Secretary. In 1962, he submitted an essay entitled Vivisection is Fundamentally Evil to a subcommittee on Health and Safety of the United States Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, chaired by Kenneth A. Roberts, during the second session of the 87th United States Congress.http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/AWA2007/hr19621937.pdf His most audacious public relations coup came in 1964 when he engineered the move of the NAVS headquarters to 51 Harley Street, in the heart of the medical establishment. It was during his time there that Risdon wrote his Biographical Study, an appreciation of the life and work of Lawson Tait, published at the beginning of 1967. The foreword was written by Lord Dowding, who described the work as \\"Mr. Risdon's remarkable book\\".Risdon, Wilfred. Lawson Tait ‚Äì a Biographical Study. London: NAVS 1967 It was ironic that Risdon died from a heart attack at his home in Harley Street on 11 March 1967, but his tireless work undoubtedly advanced the cause of anti-vivisection in Great Britain.

They married at Leeds North register office in March 1935, and although Margaret was living and working in Leeds, Risdon continued living in Manchester until February 1936, when he bought a house in north west London for his family. After Risdon's death, Nellie Risdon moved to Reading, Berkshire, and she died in the Sue Ryder hospice at Nettlebed, near Henley-on- Thames in Oxfordshire.

Made of bronze, it is situated on the corner of Druitt and George Street in front of the Queen Victoria Building. It was the last royal statue to have been erected in Ireland. The statue in its original location Sculpture The Queen toured Ireland in April 1900, prompting the Royal Dublin Society to propose a national monument to her. Her death nine months later spurred a second burst of enthusiasm. John Hughes, instructor in Modelling at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, was commissioned to create the statue and moved his studio to Paris to cast the work. It was his most important commission to date. Almost a decade later, it was unveiled in Dublin, Ireland, in the enclosed courtyard of Leinster House on 17 February 1908. At a ceremony with 1000 troops on parade, the Lord Lieutenant declared \\"we are assembled here to dedicate this noble work of art to the perpetual commemoration of a great personality and a great life.\\" > The statue shows an effort to portray Victoria Regina as the 'Irish Queen' > rather than the 'British Sovereign'. She is seated in a low chair rather > than an elaborate throne, allowing the artist to contain the figure within a > sphere rather than as a towering pillar. (Other seated examples place her on > a high throne.) And she wears a simple coronet rather than the royal or > imperial crown...Moreover, the statue portrayed her as the Sovereign Head of > the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, Ireland's order of chivalry dating > from 1783. The star on her left breast, and the pendant badge, feature > shamrocks, crowned harps, and St Patrick's Cross. The St Patrick reference > probably backfired. It confirmed Ireland's colonial subordination. Round her > neck the chain alternates the red and white roses of England. The statue sat atop a portland stone column, also designed by Hughes, with three sculptural groups to be placed below ‚Äì \\"Fame\\", \\"Hibernia at Peace\\" and \\"Hibernia at War\\". This last group was also known as \\"Erin and the Dying Soldier\\" and referred to the loyalty demonstrated by Irish soldiers in the Boer War. Location =Ireland= In 1922, 14 years after the statue's installation, Leinster House had become the seat of the Irish parliament, the Oireachtas, and nationalistic sentiment disapproved of having a British queen celebrated in such a location. The statue had by now been given the nickname \\"The auld bitch\\" by Irish writer James Joyce. In August 1929 The Irish Times reported that discussions were under way to remove the statue ‚Äúon the basis that its continued presence there is repugnant to national feeling, and that, from an artistic point of view, it disfigures the architectural beauty of the parliamentary buildings.‚Äù Some time after the Irish State declared itself a republic, it was removed from its original location in July 1948 and replaced with a carpark. It was transported by lorry to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and, along with the associated three sculptural groups, was placed in a courtyard and left, developing a patina. The hospital had also been a proposed site for the parliament, and was used as a storage location for property belonging to the National Museum of Ireland. It is now the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Attempts to send the sculpture to London, Ontario did not succeed as neither the Canadian nor Irish governments wished to pay the cost of transport. In February 1980 the statue was transferred to a yard behind a disused children's reformatory at Daingean, County Offaly. The associated sculptures from the base of the statue are currently in the collection of Dublin Castle. =Australia= In the mid-1980s, the iconic Queen Victoria Building in central Sydney was undergoing major renovations after decades of disuse, and appropriate public art was being sought for the entrance. Neil Glasser, Director of Promotions for the company undertaking the renovations (Singapore's Ipoh Gardens Ltd), travelled to several former British colonies in the hope of finding a statue. After a \\"considerable amount of sleuthing\\", the statue, sitting in long grass behind the reformatory, was rediscovered and proposed to be moved to Australia. In order to obtain approval, Glasser contacted John Teahan, the Director of the National Museum of Ireland, and Sydney's Lord Mayor contacted the Irish Ambassador in Canberra. In August 1986 Fine Gael Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, authorised that the statue be given to Australia \\"on loan until recalled\\". Subsequently, declassified cabinet papers showed that the plan was opposed by the then finance minister John Bruton (later to be Taoiseach), as well as Teahan, on the basis that it represented the work of an Irish artist and \\"...representative of one of the many traditions of Irish history\\". The statue was transported by sea to Australia that year, restored in Sydney, and installed at its present location 43 years after it had last been on display. Despite heavy rain an unveiling ceremony took place on Sunday 20 December 1987 overseen by Eric Neal, Chief Commissioner of Sydney, and Dermot Brangan, first secretary at the Irish embassy to Australia. The irony of the British Queen being \\"transported\\" to Australia by ship was not lost on the Irish media. In the days before the unveiling the embassy and the Daily Telegraph newspaper received anonymous threats of violence and protest about \\"the propriety of an Irish government giving a statue of Victoria as a gift.\\" The small sculpture of \\"Islay\\" disguising the ventilation shaft A second statue nearby is of the Queen's favourite pet, a Skye Terrier named \\"Islay\\", begging above a wishing well on behalf of the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. At a cost of $10,000, Sydney sculptor Justin Robson modelled the bronze work from an 1843 sketch by the Queen. The location of the statue is actually to disguise the ventilation shaft for the new carpark underneath the renovated building. The wishing well also includes \\"a poem telling the story of Islay which will be specially translated into Braille, four proverbs highlighting the morality of giving in six different languages, and a piece of stone from Blarney Castle, Ireland.\\" Since 1998, a recorded request for donations, supposedly being \\"spoken\\" by Islay, has been played at regular intervals from hidden loudspeakers. The recording says, \\"Because of the many good deeds I've done for deaf and blind children, I have been given the power of speech\\", and then expresses thanks for donations. It is voiced by local radio personality John Laws and concludes with two barks, also by Laws.

They had a #25 on the UK Singles Chart with a disco rendition of the Doctor Who theme music. Background In an interview with MigMag.co.uk, engineer Don Gallacher said that he had the idea for a disco version of the Doctor Who theme music after hearing Meco's Star Wars Theme, and at the suggestion of his three-year-old son, decided that as disco was still popular, it would be a good idea for him to create a disco version of Dr. Who's theme. He commented: \\"If it wasn't disco it was punk, and I couldn't stand punk\\". Together with keyboard player Mark Stevens, he recruited guitarist Dave Christopher, bassist Dave Green and drummer Graham Jarvis - his usual session drummer, Graham Hollingsworth, wasn't available - and booked, in his words, \\"the cheapest 24-track studio I could find, above a bingo hall in Clapham, London\\" and had the track completed in twelve hours: three hours a day, for four days. According to the inlay notes of \\"The Ultimate Seventies Collection Volume 6: Solid Gold\\", a BMG/Telstar 8-disc box-set released in 2001 that featured the track, that studio was known as \\"Gaumont Studios\\". He added some vocals due to the BBC Radio 1's \\"absolute anti-instrumental policy: if it didn‚Äôt have a voice on it, they wouldn‚Äôt play it\\" which he later denounced as \\"absolute garbage\\". The single was backed by \\"Time Traveller\\". After Gallacher sent cassette copies off to the major labels, he decided to release the single himselfhttp://www.millenniumeffect.co.uk/audio/tributes/themes2.php so that it could be released in time for Christmas. He found a small pressing plant, Motor Records, which said \\"we'll do it all for you\\" and produced 500 copies. Shifting them was not easy, however; Gallacher called the sleeve \\"so awful ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt bare to look at it, let alone put it out. It had this horrible orange sticker... it looked as if someone had made up an old stamp-printing set, like a kiddie‚Äôs printing set ‚Äì horrible\\", and \\"the only way that a record shop would buy stock from the makers was to have an account. Getting an account with a major was not an easy thing to do\\". However, he eventually found a wholesaler - Ray Self of the One Stop record shop in Euston Tower - who agreed to produce the first 1,000 copies as long as they were 12-inch picture sleeves. They were printed as \\"dazzling, eye-catching translucent blue\\" vinyls with no writing on it; talking to MigMag.co.uk, he said this was because a supermarket supplier \\"advised me that a product label is designed to get the customer to pick it up. If they pick it up they are more than 60% likely to buy it. So I had the cover designed without any writing on the front at all. The record shop owners would literally have to pick it up to see what it was\\". On 13 October 1978, he collected and delivered the new pressings to the wholesalers, clubs and smaller shops around London. On his way home, he spotted a disco and asked the DJ to play his record. Despite it being in the shops for a matter of hours, the DJ took out his copy of the record, leading Gallacher to believe he may have a hit on his hands. Eventually, distribution was delegated to Pinnacle at the suggestion of Pete Waterman, then a new distributor, who produced new 7-inch pressings and multi-coloured versions of the 12-inch. The deal was biased towards Pinnacle due to his desire to \\"get it over and done with\\", who placed a sticker saying \\"Pinnacle Records\\" placed over the \\"Motor\\" logo and the word \\"Motor\\" placed somewhere else on the record in far smaller print. They got it played on Radio Luxembourg, though not BBC Radio One, as they would have seemed biased in playing a remix of one of their theme tunes. On 25 November 1978, the track entered the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, eventually peaking at #25 and spending 12 weeks in the chart. Gallacher reckons that over 240,000 copies were sold and that \\"if a single sold that many copies between October and January in the present day, it would probably be number one for the entire Christmas/New Year period\\". Top of the Pops Even before the track had been recorded, Gallacher had contacted Graham Williams, the then producer of Doctor Who, and at a meeting over a drink, he told him what he wanted - if they made it onto Top of the Pops, they wanted their performance to contain \\"swirling Daleks and the TARDIS and all those effects\\". He made a point of doing it as early as possible, on the grounds that \\"if we have to ask for them with one day's notice it will never happen\\". After the song charted, distributor Pinnacle rung Gallacher to tell him they would be appearing on Top of the Pops. They performed three times, with these performances involving the band wearing Tom Baker-esque hats and scarves, the audience bopping, and visuals of the Bernard Lodge credit sequence being mixed in. In addition, Paul Martinelli substituted for Dave Christopher (because, according to Gallacher, \\"he wasn't good looking enough\\") and in what Gallacher called a \\"welcome irony\\" Graham Hollingworth on drums. It is unknown why they were engaged, however Gallacher suggested they may have been on tour with Cliff Richard. However, miming to the track was not allowed due to instructions from the Musicians' Union and thus they had to re-record it and then mime to that. This was next to impossible; though the musicians were capable of recording the backing track in one take, Gallacher and Stevens had spent days overdubbing keyboards and synthesizers, which couldn't be redone in three hours. Thus, Gallacher told the members to arrive before the Union representative arrives, and that they would \\"pretend\\" to re-record the track. However, Dave Green, the bass player, heeded no such instruction and arrived later, leading to Gallacher needing to hit \\"talkback\\" and give instructions to Green and take frequent \\"trips to the loo\\"; on one of these, Gallacher found Green ascending the stairs, whispered to him instructions, and he snuck into the studio. 1979 Doctor Who convention 1,000 copies were produced exclusively for the first Doctor Who convention in Los Angeles. Gallacher was exclusively responsible for the fourth Doctor, Tom Baker, being present at the convention, as he found out that the BBC TV technicians were going on strike that day and thus asked convention producer Lucy Chase Williams and her co- producer Amy Krell if it was worth him calling Graham Williams to see if Baker could get there. The convention was on the top of the Sunset Hyatt Hotel and demand was such that the queue for autographs filled the entire convention floor and down into the street outside and they had to continue the following day on Venice Beach. After \\"Dr. Who\\" Pinnacle wanted Mankind to issue a follow-up recording immediately. However, the follow-up, \\"Chain Reaction\\", flopped despite thousands of pounds being spent on it and it being recorded in a 48 track studio and being backed by \\"Funky Revolution\\". An extended period of time went by before Mankind was resurrected for Ovation Records, for \\"Dark Star Angel\\" and \\"UFO\\", which were released in 1980 and flopped. Mark Stevens, Paul Martinelli, Dave Green and Graham Jarvis are all deceased.

He promptly received a phone call in favour of the idea, and suggested that Dos Amigoz did the remix. On the subject of that remix, Gallacher said \\"I awaited the new remix with some trepidation.

The bill would require taxpayers claiming the child tax credit to provide their Social Security Numbers, a change that would prevent undocumented immigrants from claiming the credit. The bill would index the child credit to inflation. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background A study by the United States Department of Agriculture found that it costs a middle-income family more than $241,000 to raise a child up to age 18. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014 would amend the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the child tax credit, to: (1) increase from $110,00 to $150,000 ($75,000 for individual taxpayers and married taxpayers filing separately) the threshold amount applicable to married couples filing joint tax returns above which such tax credit is reduced, and (2) allow an inflation adjustment to the threshold amounts and the $1,000 credit amount beginning after 2014. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on June 25, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4935 would increase the amount of the child tax credit and the income thresholds at which the credit begins to phase out for taxpayers. Under current law, an individual may claim a tax credit of $1,000 for each qualifying child under the age of 17. H.R. 4935 would index the $1,000 amount for inflation starting in 2015. In addition, under current law the aggregate amount of child credits that may be claimed is phased out for married individuals filing joint tax returns with modified adjusted gross income over $110,000 and for unmarried individuals with such income over $75,000. H.R. 4935 would increase the beginning of the phaseout for joint filers to $150,000, and it would index for inflation the beginning points of the income phaseouts for all taxpayers starting in 2015. For married taxpayers filing separately, the beginning of the income phaseout would increase from $55,000 under current law to $75,000, indexed for inflation. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 4935 would reduce revenues over the 2014-2024 period by about $93.9 billion, and increase direct spending by about $21.0 billion over that period. JCT therefore estimates that enacting the legislation would increase federal budget deficits by about $114.9 billion over the 2014-2024 period. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Because enacting H.R. 4935 would affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 23, 2014 by Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R, KS-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On July 17, 2014 the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-527. The bill passed the House on July 25, 2014 in a vote of 237-173. The White House threatened to veto the bill. Debate and discussion Rep. Sam Johnson (R-TX) supported the bill. He said that \\"right now the IRS is providing this refundable child tax credit to those who are here illegally,\\" arguing that \\"the last thing we need is to continue to encourage folks from Central America to make the dangerous and life-threatening trek to Texas.\\" Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) opposed the bill, arguing that \\"this provision will harm millions of American kids who are in the United States living in immigrant families.\\" Rep. Rub√©n Hinojosa (D-TX) accused House Republicans of \\"attacks on the Latino community\\" with this bill as an example. Elaine Maag, writing in The Christian Science Monitor, argued that Jenkins' \\"proposed expansions are ill-targeted and fail to address the credit's biggest looming issue: the change in refundability that will hit the poorest recipients after 2017.\\" According to Maag, the plan would be improved if the credit was made refundable for all families so that families so poor they had no tax liability could still benefit from the credit.

The film was released on February 14, 2014. Starring actress Nha Phuong, actor Thai Hoa, Quy Binh, Hoang Bach, Tu Vi, Kim Xuan, Nancy Nguyen and Van Tung. The film was based on same title play written by Thai Hoa, which used to be a best selling play at Phu Nhuan Theater.  Plot  The story starts as Son takes his newly wife Linh on a vacation after her heart transplant. After the transplant, Linh keeps encountering unexplainable incidents and dreaming about a strange house located in the countryside of Da Lat. 49 days later, she sleepwalks to the grave of Phuong at an isolated area, where she meets Tam who is Phuong's husband. Tam brings Linh back to his house while waiting for Son to pick Linh up after informing him, Linh comes to realize this is the house which she has kept dreaming about. Entering the house, she meets Phuong's mother - Ms. Le and Cu Hu (a friend of Phuong and Tam). Son comes to pick Linh up, in the midst of talking, it is revealed that the heart which had been transplanted for Linh is from Phuong - Ms. Le's daughter also Tam's wife. Ms. Le gets emotional, therefore she invites both of them to stay at their house to join her late daughter's 49-day ceremony. Many weird and supernatural incidents begin to happen since they have decided to stay, Linh has more sleepwalking incidents, while Son keeps being haunted, as well as there seems to be a soul or ghost trying to warn Linh something, to the point Linh is unable to leave that house as her heart will stop beating once she does it. Finally, after being heavily haunted, Son can't take it anymore and confesses that he caused the accident that killed Phuong in the middle of the street, however, he was in a rush to the hospital. Son drove away after calling the police to inform the situation. The police named Sau Dung invites him to the police station for a couple of questions. Thinking everything is coming to an end, things are getting weirder as Son claims that when he drove away, Phuong was still alive and was not injured, she was just unconscious. However, the body found by the police was heavily crushed, unable to identify, later Tam confirmed it was Phuong then took her body back home for the funeral. Cu Hu discovers that Linh's blood type to be O, therefore she couldn't be able to get transplant by Phuong whose blood type is AB. Later, Linh and Cu Hu find a funeral table with the picture of Hong - who is allegedly Tam's business partner. Right after knowing that Hong is missing, Cu Hu drives Linh to the flower farm where Tam is working a night shift. Linh has intuition so she insists Tam to drive her back to the abandoned house on Ma Ta Hill, which turns out Phuong is still alive and has been locked inside for months. Phuong says Hong is Tam's mistress and they had much debt due to their failed business. Knowing Tam wouldn't divorce Phuong (Tam truly loves Phuong) and leave her deal with all the debts alone, Hong had secretly texted and told Phuong to go to the abandoned house on Ma Ta Hill in order to know the truth about her husband. Phuong was hiding outside and heard the full story, which little did she know that Tam hits Hong with a shovel later. Phuong terrifyingly ran away while Tam was chasing her. As she was about to get close to the outskirt of the wood, Phuong got hit by Son while carelessly crossing the road. Tam hid until Son drove away, Phuong was still alive and kept warning that she would report this to the police. Tam decided to switch Phuong and Hong's clothes and locked Phuong in the basement, then Tam carried barely conscious Hong to the road where Phuong got hit previously. Tam used Phuong's car to crush Hong until she was completely dead, then made a false statement about Phuong that she was in the accident in which her face was fully crushed. Actually, the heart Linh carries is from Hong. Cu Hu calls the police right away, however, he is hit by Tam, while Linh is chased by Tam in the woods. As she is about to reach the outskirt, Linh suddenly falls like Phuong did. Tam intends to kill Linh but the ghost of Hong shows up to save her. Being terrified to see Hong, Tam is stunned as Hong is staring at him. The police arrive and Tam tries to escape, however, he gets hit by a truck. Phuong reconciles with her mother, Linh and Son are happy together. The movie ends with the scene in which Cu Hu is taking Phuong to sightsee on the boat. Phuong also discovers Cu Hu's unrequited love for her after a long time.

She received her Ph.D. from Harvard University, and has published in deformation theory, group theory, and representation theory. She is also a writer, authoring several novels under the pseudonym Rachel Pomerantz. Early and personal life Mary Elizabeth Kramer was born on August 6, 1948 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. From 1965 to 1969, she was educated at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, majoring in mathematics, philosophy and history, and graduating summa cum laude in 1969. She then attended Harvard University as a mathematics graduate student: she completed her Master of Arts (MA) degree in 1971 and her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1972. Her doctoral thesis was titled \\"Non-singular deformations of space curves, using determinantal schemes\\": her advisors were David Mumford and Heisuke Hironaka. She was brought up a Christian (Presbyterianism and then Unitarian Universalism). She became interested in Judaism, and formally converted to Conservative Judaism in college. In 1968, she married David Schaps, a classics professor who was then also studying for a PhD at Harvard. They both gradually felt more and more drawn to Orthodox Judaism and considered themselves ultra-Orthodox by the time they had completed their doctorates. The couple made aliyah (moved to Israel) in 1972. Together, she and her husband had two children: this was a small family by Haredi standards, and they raised four more foster children. They live in Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city near Tel Aviv. Career Schaps had some teaching experience at Harvard University: she was teaching assistant from 1971 to 1972, and a lecturer at the 1975 Harvard Summer School. In 1972, having moved to Israel, she was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Tel Aviv University. In her second year in Israel the Yom Kippur War occurred: the change in language, culture and the threat to her new family were a shock. In 1977, she moved to Bar-Ilan University as a senior lecturer: she was promoted to associate professor in 1991 and full professor in 2006. She was the only female ultra-Orthodox professor in Israel. In October 2013, she was appointed Dean of Exact Sciences at Bar-Ilan University: having been the only female Haredi professor, she now became the highest ranking Haredi woman in Israeli academia. She stepped down as dean in 2015, and was made Professor Emeritus on retirement in 2016. Selected publications *. * Katz, Mikhail G.; Schaps, Mary; Vishne, Uzi.

Two of his brothers would become Methodist Episcopal ministers. His family moved west to Illinois in 1845. Jacob helped on the family farm, as well as attended the local public schools. He traveled west to Lebanon, St. Clair County, Illinois to attend McKendree College, and graduated in 1862. Soon afterward, Wilkin enlisted in the Illinois militia and Union Army, as discussed below. After the war, Wilkin married, as well as began studying law under the direction of John Scholfield in Marshall, Clark County, Illinois. Military service During the Civil War. Jacob Wilkin enlisted for three years, initially as a private in the 130th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Fellow soldiers elected him their captain, and by the time he was mustered out in August 1865, Wilkin had attained the rank of major. Wilkin fought in the Vicksburg campaign, and his company guarded General Grant. As the war ended, he was transferred to the staff of General Ransom, and fought in the Battle of Fort Blakeley in Alabama in April 1865.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/32592918 Legal career Admitted to the bar in March 1867, Wilkin joined Scholfield's practice as a partner. Wilkin was a Republican and was a presidential elector during the 1872 United States presidential election. However, the following year Scholfield was elected to the Supreme Court of Illinois, ending the partnership. Wilkin continued to practice in Marshall until 1879. That year, he was elected to the 4th Illinois Circuit Court. He served until 1885, when he was elevated to the 4th District, Illinois Appellate Court. Wilkin moved to Danville, Illinois that year. In 1888, he was elected to the Supreme Court of Illinois to fill the vacancy of John M. Scott, who had declined re-election. Wilkin was re- elected in 1897 and 1906, serving a total of nineteen years.

It is the aim of Policy Coherence for Development to make foreign relations to be as ecologically, economically and socially coherent as possible and thereby to make international co-operation for international development more effective.Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Policy Coherence (http://www.sdc.admin.ch/en/Home/Effectiveness/Policy_coherence) Policy Coherence for Development Flow Chart Commitments on achieving greater policy coherence to promote development have also been promoted by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (which has a specific department, Policy Coherence for Development Unit) as well as in the 2011 Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, the UN Millennium Declaration and the 2010 UN Millennium Development Goals Summit. In an era when development assistance is likely to come under more pressure, Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) should become more rather than less important, including in the post 2015 framework as is increasingly becoming recognised. An example of such recognition is the target of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17 which aims to enhance policy coherence for sustainable development as part of the 2030 Agenda. The origins of the concept go back to successful European NGO campaigns of the 1990s that put a spotlight on 'dumping' of European products in developing countries, and which in 1992 led to an article in the Treaty on European Community that required EU policy makers to take account of developing country interests when drawing up new policies. Depending on the translation, this Treaty article was referred to as promoting coherence (e.g. German version) or consistency (e.g. English version). Later that same decade the OECD added 'for development' so as to clarify that 'PCD' was about ensuring that policies do not harm and where possible contribute to international development objectives. Examples of PCD definitions clarifying this impact focus can be found in the 2005 European Consensus on Development and the 2008 outcome document of the UN MDG summit, both of which link to the MDGs. Under the principles of Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) potential conflicts of objectives and interests between international co-operation and other sectoral policies of the various federal departments should be identified and resolved as far as possible. These may be in the following policy areas: Migration policy, agricultural policy, environmental policy, health policy, financial sector policy, security policy, education, research and cultural policy. The concept of policy coherence for development (PCD) first emerged in discussions among international aid donors in the early 1990s. The term Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) originally emerged from the realisation that non-aid policies of donors affect developing countries and should not distract but rather be supportive of international development goals. The PCD concept initially emphasised the responsibility of developed countries to take into account the effect on developing countries when formulating domestic policies across different sectors (trade, finance, migration, security, technology, science). It thus originates from a north- south paradigm with responsibilities for better PCD placed on developed countries to the benefit of developing countries. As the concept evolved, PCD has been understood to go beyond a 'do no harm' approach, also with a requirement to seek synergies between development co-operation and other policies as well as to correct existing incoherencies. The debates taking place in the EU and the OECD on promoting PCD have also fostered the understanding that PCD should be enhanced at different levels. These were commonly referred to as internal, intra-governmental, inter-governmental, multilateral, multi stakeholder and developing country coherence.Knoll, A. 2014. Bringing Policy Coherence for Development into the Post-2015 Agenda ‚Äì Challenges and Prospects. ECDPM Discussion Paper 163. Maastricht: ECDPM. PCD operates in a multi-polar global economy in which all countries are playing a role in driving global growth and enabling sustainable development. A rapidly changing global economic landscape means every country is facing more complex and interlinked economic, social and environmental challenges. A better understanding of the linkages of the emerging global trends and their implications is critical for countries as they craft strategies for sustainable development.OECD (2014), Better Policies for Development 2014: Policy Coherence and Illicit Financial Flows, OECD The European Union and policy coherence for development The European Union has translated this idea into a legal commitment as most recently stated in the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 and has highlighted the concept in political declarations and communications, including the position on the post-2015 agenda ‚ÄòA decent life for all‚Äô. The OECD expressed political will to ensure PCD as noted its 2008 Ministerial Declaration and in the following 2010 Council Recommendations on PCD. The OECD Strategy for Development also assigns key importance to PCD. Both OECD and EU have put in place systems and tools define overall ambition and targets, facilitate decision-making and monitor progress, which include institutional mechanisms, monitoring tools, e.g. peer reviews, indicators and reporting, as well as policy tool-kits presented as practical measures to achieve progress. Some OECD Member states, for example Finland, the Netherlands, have currently developed and piloted self-assessment PCD toolkits. Finland and Switzerland are also testing developing country-level impact assessments in the area of food security. The European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) a think tank focused on development co- operation that is based in Maastricht, The Netherlands, argue that Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) is fundamentally a matter of politics. A key dilemma for the countries is how to develop and sustain a level of political interest in and support for PCD, how to put PCD on the political agenda, and to retain momentum and make commitments towards promoting PCD meaningful at both the national and EU level. Although the potential benefits of effective PCD remain unquestioned, ECDPM argues that political leadership, sponsorship and focus have waned in recent years in the several countries, even if many of these are considered global leaders in PCD.Galeazzi, G., Knoll, A., Kr√§tke, F., Lein, B. Rosengren, A., Sherriff, A. 2013. Insights from development in national policy coherence for development systems: Key cross cutting issues and dilemmas. (ECDPM Discussion Paper 144) A recent report from the European Commission states that the European Union has made good progress on Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) at both European and Member State level, a fact recognised by the OECD in the most recent (2012) OECD DAC peer review. It argues that the EU has cemented its position as a global leader in implementing PCD commitments in policy-making. It does however acknowledge that there is still room for progress in terms of using mechanisms such as impact assessments, evaluation and/or measuring, monitoring progress and reporting on implementation. The Commission argues that the EU remains the lead actor for PCD internationally, ahead of its main partners, with the highest levels of political and legal commitment. More recently, PCD issues have benefited from sustained high-level political attention in the EU and featured more prominently on the agenda of the EU Foreign Affairs Council.European Commission; Commission Staff Working Document 'EU 2013 Report on Policy Coherence for Development'; 2013; The United States and policy coherence for development Policy coherence for development is among the many criteria for the OECD Development Assistance Committee Peer Review Process. The 2011 DAC Peer Review of the United States stated that \\"The OECD/DAC describes progress towards policy coherence for development (PCD) as involving three building blocks: (i) a political commitment that clearly specifies policy objectives; (ii) policy co-ordination mechanisms that can resolve conflicts or inconsistencies between policies and maximise synergies; and (iii) monitoring, analysis and reporting systems to provide the evidence base for accountability and for well- informed policy making and politics (OECD, 2008a). The 2006 peer review encouraged the US government to develop a more explicit policy on the role of policy coherence for development and to put in place the resources needed to carry out analysis and effectively manage the policy coherence agenda. Five years on, the US has achieved mixed progress in implementing these recommendations and the three PCD pillars\\"DAC PEER REVIEW OF THE UNITED STATES; OECD; 2011 The OECD argue that national security strategy cannot substitute for a policy coherence for development agenda. After the passing of the FY14 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill in 2013, Kate Almquist Knopf, a former assistant administrator for USAID, blogged that \\"There is a fundamental mismatch between the United States‚Äô foreign aid architecture, resources, and objectives\\" and that the bill was a \\"stinging reminder of the low esteem in which many members of Congress hold global development and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the primary federal agency charged with delivering US foreign assistance worldwide.\\" She called for the USAID administrator to be a standing member of the National Security Council, and the US Secretary of State could return actual budget and planning authority to USAID by restoring the USAID administrator as the dual-hatted director of US foreign assistance.Knopf, K A; \\"USAID: Destined to Disappoint\\" Centre for Global Development; 2013 http://www.cgdev.org/blog/usaid-destined-disappoint Policy coherence for food security Food security is a major development challenge and to address this, the EU amongst others has effectively put global food security high among its development priorities for the years to come. However, while the European Union is the world's major development actor on food security, as ECDPM argues some of its other policies are still contested as harmful to global food security and agricultural development. An analysis of EU policy- making processes related to agriculture, fisheries, energy and trade shows that some tangible efforts have been made to strengthen policy coherence 'for food security'. However, these are tentative steps. Other concerns and interests dominate the debates and shape the outcomes, while global food security considerations play a very marginal to no role, or the food security rationale used is at odds with the logic of the EU's own food security policy framework.Engel, P., Lein, B., Seters, J. van, Helden, B. van. 2013. EU Policy Coherence for Food Security: Aligning parallel agendas. (ECDPM Discussion Paper 153). Maastricht: ECDPM Policy coherence for development in the post-2015 development goals debate United Nations Summit on the Millennium Development Goals Amid international reflection on the form and content of a post-2015 framework, among many other issues, PCD was highlighted as being a key component of the 'beyond-aid' debate. The post-2015 agenda discussions emphasise the need for a universal development agenda that is relevant to the needs of all countries and which is based on shared responsibilities. This is against the background of a changing global development landscape and shared development and 'global public goods' challenges, such as climate change, widening income inequalities, resource scarcity and environmental degradation. The original PCD concept focusing on 'beyond-aid' policies of OECD DAC donor countries does not easily fit such a new 'universal' logic. For this reason, the OECD has reconceptualised PCD and now promotes a wider universal approach and definition of PCD in the context of the post-2015 agenda. The Eighth Millennium Development Goal (MDG8) was designed \\"to create an environment ‚Äì at the national and global levels alike ‚Äì conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty.\\" The OECD argue that progress in achieving the MDG8 has been limited and in fact the MDG8 downplayed the importance of domestic policies and domestic resource mobilisation in financing the MDGs and fostering development. They also argue that discussions on PCD have mainly taken place among donors, having focused on coherence between aid and non-aid policies and on a sector-by-sector basis. This has meant focusing on issues with important cross-border dimensions, such as trade, agriculture, investment, health and migration, amongst others, but without giving attention to the multi-dimensionality of development challenges. At the same time, an approach to \\"naming and shaming\\" has succeeded only in highlighting the failures and negative effects of non-aid policies. This has been counterproductive for engaging other policy communities and key actors beyond those in development. A paper by ECDPM argues that the various of the ideas and principles of PCD can be mainstreamed in the post-2015 framework without using strong PCD jargon. These include i) targets for Means of Implementation in thematic areas that effectively require strengthened PCD efforts, ii) targets in relation to capacity building for more integrated and evidence- based policy-making and iii) efforts to build a strong accountability framework. The paper further concludes that independent from whether a universal PCD concept will explicitly be part of the language of a new framework, real progress on PCD will have to remain a major, if not the most, important component of OECD and EU MS action in achievement of post-2015 commitments. Policy coherence for development index The Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development Index (PCSDI) is an index elaborated by the Non Governmental Organisation Coordinator in cooperation with the Spanish Network for Development Studies REEDES. PCSDI analyses both the policies that make a positive contribution to sustainable development in a country and those that impact negatively, not only on that country, but also on third countries or on the whole planet. In 2019 PCSDI 148 countries are ranked from 26.76 (the worst, India) to 79.02 (the best, Denmark). The PCSDI has 5 components: economic, social, environmental, global and productive. A critique of policy coherence for development In 2013, the high-profile development blogger Owen Barder wrote a critique of the concept of 'Policy Coherence for Development' entitled 'Policy Coherence Is a Hobgoblin'. He argued that \\"The term PCD has given us an industry of reports and conferences focussing on whether countries have policies which are consistent with each other, and institutions thought likely to make them so, instead of focusing on whether and how those policies are individually supportive of, or inimical to, development.\\" He argued that the PCD concept has \\"perhaps subconsciously, altered the country‚Äôs policy objectives away from impact to consistency.\\"'Policy Coherence Is a Hobgoblin' Barder, O.

Between 1728 and 1747 he was effectively the ruling prince of Tibet and carried royal titles during the period of Qing rule of Tibet. He is known as an excellent administrator, a fearsome warrior and a grand strategist. After the troubled years under the reign of Lhazang Khan, the bloody invasion of Tsering Dhondup and the civil war, his government ushered in a relatively long period of stability and internal and external peace for Tibet. Family Polhan√© S√∂nam Topgy√© was born in 1689 in Polha (Pho-lha) as the son of the general Pema Gyalpo and his wife Drolma Butri. His father was an experienced warrior who took part in the war against Ladakh in 1679-1684. He later participated in campaigns against Bhutan and Nepal. His forefathers were local officials in Tsang in the 17th century; his grandfather Asum was endowed with the estate Polha, south of Gyangtse, by the Khoshut king Tenzin Dalai Khan for his services.McKay, Vol. II 2003, p. 593. It was here that S√∂nam Topgy√© grew up. In his young years he received teachings in the Mindroling Monastery which belonged to the Nyingma school, and also by the Panchen Lama.Van Schaik 2001, p. 140. While his given name was S√∂nam Topgy√©, he is usually known by the cognomen Polhan√© (the one from Polha). Career under Lhabzang Khan Shortly after his marriage in 1707, Polhan√© traveled to Lhasa where he was presented to the ruler Lhabzang Khan. The ruler confirmed him in his possession of the estate that he had inherited from his deceased father. Now he began a typical official career and was educated in the Ministry of Finance (rTsis khang) in Lhasa. After some years he was appointed district judge in Gyangtse.McKay, Vol. II 2003, p. 593. In 1714 he received his first military command. He successfully led an entire detachment against Bhutan, although the war as such was lost by the Tibetans.Shakabpa 1967, p. 134. After the invasion of Tibet by the Dzungars he took part in the organization of the Tibetan defense lines. He was present during the final defense of Lhasa. Resistance against the Dzungars 1717 to 1720 Lhasa fell in the hands of the Dzungars because of treason from some defenders, and Lhabzang Khan was killed in the mel√©e.Shakabpa 1967, p. 136. Pholhan√© managed to take refuge in the Drepung Monastery. In the following months, the Dzungars tried to eliminate followers of Lhabzang Khan. Pholhan√© was captured and brought naked through the streets of Lhasa. After having been whipped with 15 lashes he was cast in prison. He managed to survive since old friends brought him food. Finally, he was released through the intervention of Tagtsepa, leader of the Tibetan government that was formed under the Dzungars. Pholhan√© then returned to Tsang. Here he began to collaborate with Khangchenn√© S√∂nam Gyalpo who had been appointed governor of Ngari by Lhabzang Khan and continued to rule there in spite of the Dzungars. They organized resistance against the invaders until the grand Chinese army sent by the Kangxi Emperor marched into Lhasa in September 1720. Participation in the cabinet 1721 to 1727 Immediately after their arrival to Lhasa, the representatives of the Manchu- led Qing dynasty organized a provisional military government under the general Yansin. After the return of the imperial army, a garrison of 3,000 men stayed in Lhasa. This troop was replaced in 1723. Two officials called zongli and two other termed xieli were placed as representatives of the emperor and advisers to the Tibetan government. The provisional military government was replaced in 1721 by a cabinet under the leadership of Khangchenn√©, who retained the jurisdiction over Ngari. The other two ministers were Ngaph√∂pa Dorje Gyalpo (d. 1728) and Lumpan√© Tashi Gyalpo (d. 1728). Khangchenn√© appointed Polhan√© as personal adjutant, and he received the jurisdiction over the Tsang province. He submitted a proposal that the hundreds of Nyingma monasteries and temples which had been ruined by the Dzungars should be restored with government assistance. This was taken up badly by many, especially by the Seventh Dalai Lama and his father who viewed the Nyimgma as heretic.Van Schaik 2011, p. 141. In 1723 he and Charaba Lotro Gyalpo were appointed regular members of the cabinet, which from now on consisted of five members. The basic principle of this new administrative structure of Tibet was, that the members of the cabinet acted as ruling princes over the regions standing under them (√ú, Kongpo, Tsang, and Ngari), having their particular military resources and means of income. This certainly weakened the position of Tibet vis-√†-vis its neighbours, but also raised the danger of inner dissent, if the leading politicians could not agree. In fact, there was great disharmony between the cabinet members from the start. The tension eventually exploded in 1727 when Khangchenn√© died under the knives of his peers. Polhan√© was luckily absent from Lhasa at the time, since his wife was ill and he had hastened to her sickbed at his estate.Van Schaik 2011, p. 142. The civil war of 1727-1728 Immediately after Khangchenn√©'s assassination, Ngaph√∂pa, Lumpan√© and Charaba took over power in Lhasa, supported by the father of the Dalai Lama, S√∂nam Dargye. They mobilized the troops in their respective territories, in particular from Kongpo and √ú. 300 men were sent to catch Polhan√© but failed to do so. The latter boded up troops from Tsang. He allied with Khangchenn√©'s brother Gashiba Tseten Tashi who had taken over governance in Ngari in 1725.Shakabpa 1967, p. 142. Meanwhile, he sent an express envoy to inform the court in China. After a half year of fighting at Gyangtse, Ngaph√∂pa was defeated. Polhan√© marched towards Lhasa with 9,000 troops, occupied the city and laid siege to the Potala Palace where his opponents and the ambans had taken refuge. Dalai Lama was allowed to take sanctuary in the Drepung Monastery, but Polhan√©'s adversaries were taken prisoners on 5 July 1728. Polhan√© immediately communicated his victory to the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty. As the imperial troops arrived on 4 September 1728 the civil war had already been concluded. One of the main tasks of the arriving Chinese was to find the main culprits behind the eruption of the war. Ngaph√∂pa and Lumpan√© were publicly executed by slow slicing, two clerics were hanged, and 13 others were beheaded. In addition, the close kin of the culprits were executed as well, including small children.Shakabpa 1967, p. 144. Government 1729-1735 Now Beijing interfered strongly in the organization of the civil and military administration of Tibet. Polhan√© was once again given the jurisdiction over Tsang. Two other ministers, namely Sicho Tseten and Tsering Wanggyal, were appointed to govern Lhasa and √ú. However, they stood entirely under the direction of Pholhan√©. Two Manchu representatives or ambans watched over the government of Polhan√©. The Panchen Lama, Lobsang Yeshe (d. 1737), was given great authority which de facto made him the ruler of western Tsang. The borders in East Tibet (1724, Amdo, 1727, Kham) were much altered, and Lhasa was permanently occupied by imperial troops, plus 2,000 men who supported the ambans. Under the pretext of going on a tour to Beijing, the Seventh Dalai Lama was sent in exile to Garthar near Lithang for six years (1728-1735).Richardson 1984, p. 52. The actual reason was that his father had played a dubious role during the civil war and had to be kept far away from the government. Another reason was supposedly that the Dalai Lama was to be kept safe from the Dzungars. Pholhan√© as administrator and ruling prince 1735-1747 As time passed Polhan√© became ever more independent and posed as a king or ruling prince of sorts (honorary royal titles bestowed by the emperor in 1731 and 1739). The Tibetans usually knew him by the title miwang, \\"ruler of men\\". The protector status of the Manchu rulers was handled more as a formality. Still, he took care to orient his politics so as to take the powers of the imperial court into account.Richardson 1984, p. 53. Since his trustworthiness and loyalty to the imperial dynasty could not be questioned, the troops stationed in Lhasa were reduced to 500 men in 1733. At the same time, Polhan√© built up a professional army consisting of 15,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He ordered the borders to be guarded and secured and built military barracks all over the land. In 1729 he organized a postal system that secured the transmission of messages from Ngari to Lhasa and from Lhasa to East Tibet. This postal system was inspired by Chinese model and replaced the system instigated by the Chinese in 1720, especially in East Tibet. In the time of Polhan√© even the Chinese officials in Lhasa used this postal system for the communications with the imperial court. In the sphere of culture Polhan√© sponsored the first printed edition of the Buddhist canon.Van Schaik 2011, p. 143. In sum, Polhan√©'s tenure is remembered as being peaceful, stable and welfare oriented. Succession After Polhan√©'s death in 1747, the imperial government confirmed his second son Gyurme Namgyal as his successor. Gyurme Namgyal was murdered in 1750 by the two ambans. The deed provoked some unrest among the population under the leadership of the chief groom of the murdered leader, Lobsang Tashi. Imperial troops intervened anew, after which the government was handed over to the Seventh Dalai Lama.Van Schaik 2011, p. 144.
