Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher along-track resolution than conventional sonars. The along-track resolution can approach half the length of one sonar element, though is downward limited by 1/4 wavelength. The principle of synthetic aperture sonar is to move the sonar while illuminating the same spot on the sea floor with several pings. When moving along a straight line, those pings that have the image position within the beamwidth constitute the synthetic array. By coherent reorganization of the data from all the pings, a synthetic aperture image is produced with improved along- track resolution. In contrast to conventional side-scan sonar, SAS processing provides range-independent along-track resolution. At maximum range the resolution can be magnitudes better than that of side-scan sonars.

Born in Yucat√°n under Spanish rule, he was closely involved in drafting the constitution for the First Federal Republic of Mexico in 1824 after Mexico won independence from Spain. Years later, through a remarkable series of events, he also helped in drafting a constitution for Mexico's rebellious enemy at the time, the Republic of Texas, to secure independence from Mexico in 1836. Zavala was said to have had a keen intellect and was fluent in multiple languages. Zavala was one of the most prominent liberals in the era of the First Republic. Since his youth, Zavala was an indefatigable believer in the principle of democratic representative government. As a young man he founded several newspapers and wrote extensively, espousing democratic reforms ‚Äî writings which led to his imprisonment by the Spanish crown. While imprisoned, he learned English and studied medicine; after his release, he practiced medicine for two years before entering politics. Over his career, he served in many different capacities including the Spanish Cortes (legislature) in Madrid representing Yucat√°n, and in Mexico's Senate. He became Mexico's Minister of Finance and served as Ambassador to France and Governor of the State of Mexico. In 1829, when the Mexican government was overthrown, Zavala was forced into exile and moved to the United States for two years. He wrote a book about U.S. political culture during this time and also traveled extensively in Europe. With his diplomatic experience and linguistic skills, Zavala was well received by foreign governments. After exile, he returned to Mexico and was appointed as Minister to France. While serving in Paris, Zavala saw that Mexican President Santa Anna was becoming a military-backed dictator, ignoring the Mexican Constitution that Zavala had helped write. Zavala resigned his position in protest and spoke out against Santa Anna. After this schism, Zavala could not return home and fled to Texas, then a Mexican territory, where he owned land. He eventually became an advocate of Texas independence to the point of helping in the drafting of the Constitution of the Republic of Texas, personally designing its flag, and serving as Vice President. Some Mexicans consider Zavala a traitor for supporting Texas independence, while Texans consider him a founding father and state hero.TexasTejano - Texas Heritage Revival Announcement In modern-day Texas, both a county and a city are named in his honor, as well as many schools and public buildings including the Texas State Archives and Library Building in Austin. Early life and education Zavala was born on October 3, 1788, in the town of Tecoh, Yucat√°n, Zavala's parents were criollos, Spanish Basques born in Mexico. Zavala was a third-generation Yucatecan. His grandfather moved to the Yucat√°n peninsula from Peru. Zavala's father, born in 1725, was a notary‚Äî a legal representative in Spanish-speaking countries. Zavala was educated in M√©rida, Yucat√°n's provincial capital, in the Tridentine Seminary of San Ildefonso. There he studied the standard curriculum of Latin, morals, scholastic theology, and classical philosophy. After graduation, he founded a newspaper called The Universal Critic (El Aristarco Universal) and wrote for several newspapers in which he espoused democratic ideas that would remain the pillars of his later political career. His writings were critical of the Spanish officials, and he was imprisoned at age 26 for three years by the Spanish Crown (1814-1817). While incarcerated, Zavala learned the English language and studied medical textbooks to an extent that qualified him to practice medicine upon his release. He practiced medicine for two years, then political events compelled him to return to politics. Career Zavala began his political career becoming secretary of the local government of his home state of Yucat√°n, which created opportunities leading to his later election to the Cortes (legislature) in Madrid representing Yucat√°n as its governor. After M√©xico won independence from Spain in 1821, Zavala resigned his position in Madrid and returned to Mexico, where he was elected to the newly formed national congress, again representing Yucat√°n. Zavala became part of a group to draft the constitution of the Federal Republic of Mexico. In 1824, he was elected as President of the Constituent Congress and was the first to sign the Mexican Federal Constitution of 1824.Ron Morgan, \\"Lorenzo de Zavala\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1638. He served in the Mexican Senate from 1824 to 1826. He was appointed Minister of Finance in 1829, but served only 6 months before the government was overthrown and Zavala was placed under house arrest. He fled to the United States entering a self- imposed exile. =Exile= During his exile Zavala, ever the scholar, wrote a book called Journey to the United States of North America, a travel narrative similar to Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America, although Zavala's book preceded de Tocqueville's work by a year. Zavala traveled in the northeast U.S. and wrote about U.S. political system and culture from a Mexican point of view. The book was mainly a panegyric, but did point out the hypocrisy of the U.S. for allowing slavery despite professing lofty ideals of freedom. His other notable writing was a two-volume history of Mexico, entitled Historical essay of the Revolutions of Mexico from 1808 to 1830 (\\"Ensayo Hist√≥rico de las Revoluciones de M√©xico de 1808 hasta 1830\\"). He lived in New York, but spent several months in England and France. Zavala's keen mind and his command of Spanish, English, French made him popular abroad. He was made a member of the Geographical and Scientific Society of France and was a received by the Court of St. James's in England. =Renunciation of President Santa Anna= His exile ended in 1832 when he returned to Mexico to serve as governor of the State of M√©xico, located just west of Mexico City. (It is one of 32 individual states in Mexico and does not refer to the entire country). He was appointed as Minister to France by then President Antonio Lopez Santa Anna. While serving in this capacity in Paris, Zavala became increasingly aware that President Santa Anna, backed by military force and the clergy, was assuming dictatorial powers and was not observing the Mexican Constitution of 1824 that Zavala had helped create. In protest, Zavala resigned his post in France and renounced Santa Anna, who then ordered Zavala to return to Mexico City. Zavala, for his own safety, moved his family to Texas where he owned land. =Move to Texas= He arrived in Texas in 1835 by steamboat near the mouth of the Brazos River and briefly shared a house with his good friend Stephen F. Austin who would later be called \\"the Father of Texas\\". Other than Austin, the only other Texan he knew before arriving was David G. Burnet who later became Interim President of Texas. Zavala had known Burnet in New York. Both men had been given Empresario Grants in prior years. These grants were designed by the Mexican Government to encourage new settlers to come to Texas from around the world, the hope being to create a buffer zone between Mexico and the U.S. and also to help deal with the hostile Indians in the region. The owner of a grant was given immense tracts of Texas land in exchange for recruiting and being responsible for a certain quota of new settlers‚Äî in Zavala's case, 500 families. Zavala and Burnet had sold their grants to groups of investors in New York. The previous summer, Zavala had bought a home on 177 acres (equal to one labor, a Spanish term of land measurement) north of Buffalo Bayou in Harris County, called Zavala Point. This border area contained many immigrants from the United States who were accustomed to a democratic government and individual rights. Animosity against Santa Anna's rule was common and rebellion was brewing. Santa Anna was angered by what he perceived to be U.S. interference in Mexican affairs, and set about to stop the rebellion by dispatching troops. At this point, Zavala's hope was to overthrow the existing Mexican government and restore Mexico to a democracy and to have Texas be one of the Mexican states. Before long, he realized that this was not going to happen. A pragmatic realist, he gradually changed his viewpoint and began advocating for Texas independence from Mexico. Despite orders from Santa Anna for Zavala to be captured and deported from Texas, Zavala was never in real danger ‚Äî he had become a valuable ally with influential Texans seeking independence. His legislative experience, linguistic skills, and diplomatic experience made him ideally suited for drafting the new Constitution of the Republic of Texas, not to mention that he was the only one among them with actual experience in drafting a such a document. In March 1836, a meeting of delegates was held in a Texas settlement known as \\"Washington-on-the-Brazos\\" where the Declaration of Independence for the Republic of Texas was drafted and signed. Zavala personally designed the flag of the new republic, helped write the new constitution, and served as Vice President under the provisional government. While working, the delegates received a message that the Alamo was under siege. After the Alamo fell, Santa Anna's forces were soon advancing on the delegation, forcing them to flee. When Santa Anna's troops approached Zavala's Point, Zavala and his family fled down the San Jacinto River to the home of William Scott, one of the Empressario Grant colonists. A number of families awaited there for a steamer to take them to safety on Galveston Island. Nearby, in Harris County, Santa Anna's army faced Texas General Sam Houston's forces on April 21, 1836 at the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna was defeated and captured. A few months after this, Zavala's health began to fail. He resigned his office of Vice President and returned home. Less than a month after his resignation, he was boating in Buffalo Bayou when his rowboat overturned and he was chilled. Zavala developed pneumonia and died at his home on November 15, 1836. He was buried in a small cemetery plot at his home. The grave was later moved to the San Jacinto Battleground Park. Mexican historians are generally respectful to Zavala for his efforts to create a republic and for improving conditions for the lower class; however, Zavala's apparent reversal of loyalty to his native Mexico and his turning to participate in Texas Independence branded him as a traitor to many Mexicans, a feeling some harbor to this day. Personal life In 1807 Zavala married Teresa Correa y Corres. They had three children: a son named Lorenzo Jr., a daughter named Manuela, and a daughter who died at age one. Zavala's wife, Teresa, died in the spring of 1831. Zavala remarried while in exile. He married Emily West in New York on November 12, 1831, at the Church of the Transfiguration. To this union was born a son and two daughters. The son Augustine, the eldest, was the father of Adina Emilia de Zavala, who played a role in the fight to preserve the Alamo as a historic structure for future generations. =Freemasons= Zavala and his friends secretly organized the first Masonic Lodge in Yucat√°n, the Reuni√≥n a la Virtud lodge No. 9. The lodge received its charter from the Louisiana Grand Lodge in 1817. It was Zavala's relationship with his fellow masonic brothers and to other lodges that allowed him to gather many political connections prior to Mexico's Independence. Zavala was one of the key people that helped establish the York Rite Masonry in Mexico in 1826 as an alternative to the older, well established Scottish rite (Escoc√©s). That same year the Grand Lodge of New York issued charters to five Masonic Lodges in Mexico City. These five lodges became the nucleus of the movement that favored decentralization of leadership. Zavala became the Charter Master of Independencia Lodge No. 454. He kept his position until his exile in 1830. He is listed as a \\"Masonic Hero\\" by the Grand Lodge of Texas. Some sources state that Zavala was disgraced for revealing ritual secrets. Legacy The town of Zavala, Texas was named for him in Jasper County in 1834. The town no longer exists, but there is a village about 20 miles away in Angelina County named Zavalla (spelled differently) which is also named for Lorenzo de Zavala. In 1858, 22 years after Zavala's death, the Texas Legislature named Zavala County in his honor. Zavala County is in southern Texas, and sits roughly in a triangle formed by Del Rio, Laredo, and San Antonio. The county seat is Crystal City. Unfortunately, when the name was given, it was misspelled as \\"Zavalla\\" and the error was not officially corrected until 71 years later (1929). Currently, his name appears on many public buildings and schools, including the Texas State Library and Archives Commission in Austin. The National Hispanic Institute named its Lorenzo de Zavala Youth Legislative Session program (colloquially known as the \\"LDZ,\\" now hosted at five universities across the U.S. and one in Panama) for him. =Namesakes= Schools * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, San Marcos, Texas * De Zavala Elementary, Channelview, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Crystal City, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Dallas, Texas * Zavala Elementary School, El Paso, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Fort Worth, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Grand Prairie, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Harlingen Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Houston, Texas (Magnolia Park neighborhood) * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, Midland, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Elementary School, San Antonio, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Middle School, Amarillo, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Middle School, Irving, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Middle School, La Joya, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Environmental Science Academy, Grand Prairie, Texas * Zavala Elementary School, Austin, Texas Other things named for Lorenzo de Zavala * Zavala County, Texas * De Zavala Rd, a major thoroughfare in San Antonio, Texas * Lorenzo De Zavala Lodge #1397, Masonic Lodge, Houston, Texas * City of Zavalla, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Texas State Library and Archives Commission, Austin, Texas * Lorenzo de Zavala Youth Legislative Session, National Hispanic Institute (with programs in San Antonio, Texas; Rochester, New York; San Diego, California; Fort Collins, Colorado; Joliet, Illinois; and Panama City, Panama) References Category:1788 births Category:1836 deaths Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Members of the Senate of the Republic (Mexico) Category:Politicians from Yucat√°n (state) Category:People of the Texas Revolution Category:Vice Presidents of the Republic of Texas Category:People from Galveston County, Texas Category:Mexican people of Basque descent Category:American writers of Mexican descent Category:People of Spanish Texas Category:People of Mexican Texas Category:Texas Consultation delegates ","title":"Lorenzo de Zavala"},{"id":"1918408","text":"North is a cardinal direction or compass point.

It was picked up by various European cable television networks. Super Channel Super Channel 1987-1993 Launched on 30 January 1987, replacing 24-hour music channel Music Box, Super Channel was co-owned by all but one of the ITV companies at the time in the United Kingdom. Virgin Group had a majority stake in Music Box (60%) and would own 15% of the equity with the rest being split between ITV franchise holders including Granada, Yorkshire, LWT, Central, Anglia, Tyne Tees, Ulster, Grampian, Scottish, and Border Television. Thames Television was the only one of the ITV contractors not to participate.Transnational Television in Europe: Reconfiguring Global Communications Networks, Jean K. Chalaby, I.B.Tauris, page 25 It competed with Sky Channel, forerunner of Sky1, which was the only other major pan-European satellite-channel around at the time. Unlike Sky Channel, Super Channel's syndicated output was less American and more European. Many of the programmes were what it called the \\"Best of British\\", sourced from ITV or the BBC, while ITN produced news bulletins (see also ITN World News). It also broadcast syndicated non-British European programmes such as the Dutch sitcom Zeg 'ns Aaa (with English subtitles). Super Channel fared poorly, due to UK programming seen as unsuitable for European audiences, such as drama being seen as \\"too violent\\" or \\"too realistic\\",Media Information Australia, Australian Film and Television School, 1990, age 80-, 83, 1990, Issues 55-58 as well as a dispute with the British actors unions who demanded additional fees for viewing by European audiences which meant that it could no longer offer the 'Best of British to a European audience'. Within a year, the ITV companies sold the channel to the Italian Marcucci family, owners of Videomusic, the first music channel in Italy, with a minority stake being held by Richard Branson's Virgin plc, and the programming changed from British to pan-European, although it continued carrying ITN's World News bulletins. At the beginning Super Channel was based in the heart of London, 19-22 Rathbone Place, London W1P 1DF, in the same building as Music Box; the building would later become the home of CNN International until 2007. For a number of months the channel's transmission facilities were provided by Molinare at Fouberts Place, London W1, it returned briefly to 19-22 Rathbone Place until the Marcucci family acquired Melrose House, 14 Lanark Square, in Limeharbour (London) where it set up a state of the art transmission facility. In 1996 the channel (along with its sister channel CNBC Europe) was transmitted from the GE building in Hammersmith, London. The transmission suite used cutting edge (at the time) Pro-Bel COMPASS and MAPP automation, and Profile video servers for all commercials and promotions. Programmes continued to be played from tape, however. NBC steps in NBC Super Channel 1993-1996 In 1993, the station was having financial difficulties, and was taken over by the American company General Electric, then-parent of the NBC television network, and became NBC Super Channel. In 1996, the channel was renamed NBC Europe, but was, from then on, almost always referred to as simply \\"NBC\\" on the air. Most of NBC Europe's prime time programming was produced in Europe, but after 10 pm Central European Time on weekday evenings, the channel aired The Tonight Show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and Later, hence its slogan \\"Where the Stars Come Out at Night.\\" Most NBC News programs were broadcast on NBC Europe, including Dateline NBC, Time and Again and NBC Nightly News, which was aired live. The Today Show was also initially shown live in the afternoons, but was later broadcast the following morning instead, by which time it was more than half a day old. That meant that all news portions had to be replaced with European updates produced by ITN in London. ITN also supplied the network with the main European newscasts before and after the GE takeover. The European weather was produced by the BBC at first, but was later taken over by NBC in the U.S. NBC Europe carried virtually no prime time fiction entertainment programs shown on NBC in the US, because they were usually owned and distributed by other studios under the fin-syn rules (which did not apply in Europe). NBC would have had to buy the rights for each country in order to show them on NBC Europe, which would have been too expensive. Even for shows that NBC Studios owned itself, it was generally more financially viable to sell the rights country by country either to broadcast or cable/satellite channels than to air them on NBC Europe. The most notable exceptions to this rule were brief runs of Profiler and The Pretender, as well as short-lived US sitcoms Union Square and Mr. Rhodes. That is widely considered to be one of the main reasons why NBC Europe was ultimately not a success.  NBC Europe as a German network  Studio of news programme \\"GIGA Real\\" NBC Europe stopped broadcasting to most of Europe in 1998, when the DFA (Deutsche Fernsehnachrichten Agentur) took it over and moved it to D√ºsseldorf. Most of the satellite feeds of NBC Europe became either National Geographic or CNBC. NBC Europe continued to operate on the German cable TV, fed by one digital satellite link from Eutelsat II-F1 (later Hotbird 5). In November 1998 the first German programming started airing. Programming was assembled with content from GIGA and CNBC Europe, as well as other shows. In 2004, NBC Universal took over the DFA and consequently NBC Europe. On 29 September 2005 NBC Europe was split into GIGA and the new channel Das Vierte. NBC Europe was replaced by Das Vierte. In fact Das Vierte is still broadcasting with the licence of NBC Europe on cable TV; on satellite, IPTV and digital cable it is a new channel. Das Vierte broadcasts a special version on cable TV, including CNBC Europe, and from 29 September 2005 to 31 March 2006, also GIGA. This is necessary to keep the licence and the cable channel. In 2012 The Walt Disney Company acquired Das Vierte and closed the channel on New Year's Eve 2013. On January 17, 2014, the channel was replaced by Disney Channel Germany switching from pay-TV to free-to-air.

Rat√≥n is Spanish for \\"mouse\\". It is located on the eastern side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains between Trinidad, Colorado and Raton, New Mexico, approximately 180 miles (290 km) northeast of Santa Fe. The pass crosses the line of volcanic mesas that extends east from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains along the state line, and furnishes the most direct land route between the valley of the Arkansas River to the north and the upper valley of the Canadian River, leading towards Santa Fe, to the south. The pass now carries Interstate 25 and railroad tracks. The pass is a historically significant landmark on the Santa Fe Trail, a major 19th-century settlement route between Kansas City, Missouri and Santa Fe. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for this association. History In 1821, Captain William Becknell laid the path of the Santa Fe Trail through the pass. In 1846 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Stephen W. Kearny and his troops passed through the pass en route to New Mexico. During the Civil War, it was the primary path into New Mexico since it avoided Confederate raiders. It was later developed into a toll road by Richens Lacey Wootton. =Railroad route= In the late 19th century, it was used by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway as the railroad's primary route through the mountains. Along with the Royal Gorge in Colorado the pass was one of the focal points for the 1878‚Äì1879 Railroad Wars between the AT&SF; and the smaller Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. The route over the pass required gradients of up to 3.5%, with a tunnel at the highest point of the AT&SF;, at 7588 feet above sea level. The tunnel is entirely within New Mexico, with its northern portal only a few feet south of the Colorado border.Harper, Jared V. \\"Santa Fe's Raton Pass\\". (1983, Kachina Press). . BNSF Railway, which absorbed the Santa Fe railroad in 1996, and Amtrak continue to use this route. However, following completion of the Belen Cutoff in 1908, the majority of freight traffic was diverted over the Cutoff, which has gradients of no more than 1.25%. Amtrak's Southwest Chief passenger service between Chicago and Los Angeles, continues to use Raton Pass (one train daily in each direction). In 2012, there was not enough freight traffic for BNSF to maintain the line up to the standards required by Amtrak for continued intercity service. This problem has placed the future of rail transportation over Raton Pass in jeopardy.Colorado State Legislature, Preserve & Expand Amtrak Interstate Rail Service p2 Section 1(b)(c) BNSF operates little to no revenue freight service over the pass between La Junta, Colorado, and Lamy, New Mexico, leaving Amtrak's Southwest Chief as the only daily revenue train to occupy the route. =Highway route= In the 20th century the Pass became the route of U.S. Route 85 and later Interstate 25 between Denver and Albuquerque. The road at the pass is at an elevation of 7834 feet above sea level, and therefore is subject to difficult driving and occasional closure during heavy winter snowfalls. In popular culture The pass was part of a Townes Van Zandt song \\"Snowin' on Raton\\". During a live performance, Townes commented how he liked playing a show in Colorado because he didn't have to explain what Raton was. The 1951 western movie named Raton Pass stars Academy Award actress Patricia Neal. Raton Pass is mentioned in C. W. McCall's (Bill Fries) song \\"Four Wheel Cowboy\\", from his album Wilderness. \\"Four Wheel Cowboy\\" also appears on his compilation release, titled \\"The Best of C. W. McCall\\". Clint Black makes reference to the Raton Pass in the song \\"The Goodnight-Loving\\" from the album \\"Put Yourself in My Shoes.\\" :Ridin' against the wind in east New Mexico, :His skin is dry and worn as the Texas plains. :He's headed where the air is thin and the cold blue northers blow, :Up through the Raton Pass, but he'll have to beat the early snow, In the 1951 Randolph Scott film Santa Fe there is a part about how the Santa Fe rail road acquired Raton Pass for the use of the rail road.

Association with Schapelle Corby In 2005, Bakir donated an undisclosed sum of money to the legal defence of Schapelle Corby. Bakir retained the services of the Australian law firm Hoolihans to \\"Investigate the claim and gather evidence, provide advice in respect of the claim, attend to all procedures necessary for the disclosure by Australian or other bodies of information relevant to the defence, including attendance at conferences with representatives of such bodies, appearing before the media or presenting press releases which may assist the matter, issue Court proceedings if necessary, assist in attending to all pre-trial preparation, engage counsel and other experts, attend at trial as necessary and attend to all such other matters as required.\\" Bakir claims to have no relationship to Corby other than being from the same city. He reportedly decided to help fund Corby's defence because he believed that a miscarriage of justice could occur if she were not properly represented. He pledged A$100,000 towards the A$1,000,000 reward fund, but the full reward was never raised. Before the prosecution announced their sentencing recommendation, Bakir accused the prosecution team (chief prosecutor Ida Bagus Wiswantanu) of seeking a bribe to reduce the requested sentence. The prosecution team and the Indonesian government vehemently denied that this had occurred. Bakir quickly issued a written apology to Indonesian authorities for his statements. After her sentencing, Corby sacked her main Indonesian defence lawyer, Lily Lubis, and Indonesian case co-ordinator Vasu Rasiah in July 2005, when Australian lawyer Mark Trowell QC told the media that Rasiah had asked him to request A$500,000 from the Australian government, money meant to bribe the judges of the appeal court. Bakir registered a company titled Schapelle Corby Pty Ltd, stating that he wanted to protect her name from people who wanted to exploit it. Some raised doubts as to his motives, although Schapelle's cousin, Melissa Younger, told the media that his support was genuine. In June 2005, Bakir formally ended his involvement in Schapelle's defence, stating that he had done everything in his power to help her, including contributing more than $200,000 to her campaign. By 22 July 2005, Bakir had deregistered both Schapelle Corby Pty Ltd and the schapellecorby.com.au website.  Philanthropy  Bakir is known for his philanthropy having donated hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to the disadvantaged and various charity organisations. In 2016 he donated more than $100,000.00 to the Big Plates Little Mates Cancer Foundation; $20,000.00 to the MS Foundation; and $25,000 to the Salvation Army.

Those who are dying may lose their ability to swallow and may have increased production of bronchial secretions, resulting in such an accumulation. Usually, two or three days earlier, the symptoms of approaching death can be observed as saliva accumulates in the throat, making it very difficult to take even a spoonful of water. Related symptoms can include shortness of breath and rapid chest movement. While death rattle is a strong indication that someone is near death, it can also be produced by other problems that cause interference with the swallowing reflex, such as brain injuries. It is sometimes misinterpreted as the sound of the person choking to death or gargling.  Timing  This symptom most commonly appears sometime during the last 24 hours of the person's life, although some people live somewhat longer.  Management  The dying person is usually unaware of the noisy breathing and is not disturbed by it, but some healthcare providers attempt to minimize the sound for the emotional comfort of family members and caregivers. This may be done through repositioning the person, reducing the volume of IV fluids being given, or giving anticholinergic drugs to reduce secretions. In hospice and palliative care, drugs such as glycopyrronium, hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) or atropine may be used for their anticholinergic effects to reduce secretions and minimize this effect.

SR 25 provides access to the Pinnacles National Park east entrance, running parallel to the San Andreas Fault.The San Andreas Fault - III. Where Is It? Running parallel to the Gabilan Range and Diablo Range, SR 25 passes through the communities of Paicines and Tres Pinos before reaching the city of Hollister. Upon reaching Hollister, the route turns into a four-lane undivided road, curving north and west through the east side of the city. North of Hollister, SR 25 reverts into a 2-lane road and continues northwest from Hollister, intersecting with State Route 156. From there, the route is a partially divided road until just short of a railroad crossing and eventually crossing the Pajaro River into Santa Clara County.

He was a three-time ABA All-Star. Jones' brother Nick also played in the ABA and NBA. During his time in the ABA, Jones picked up the moniker \\"Snapper\\" but he never revealed how it came to be. Biography =Basketball career= Jones was born in Alexandria, Louisiana, but grew up in Portland, Oregon, where he led Franklin High School to the state basketball championship in 1959. He went on to a standout career at the University of Oregon, pacing the Ducks in scoring during the 1963‚Äì64 season. Jones earned ABA All-Star honors three times during eight ABA seasons, averaging 16.0 points while scoring over 10,000 points in 640 games. Jones played for the Oakland Oaks (1967‚Äì68), New Orleans Buccaneers (1968‚Äì1970), Memphis Pros (1970‚Äì71), Dallas Chaparrals (1971‚Äì1973), Carolina Cougars (1973‚Äì1974), Denver Rockets (1974) and Spirits of St. Louis (1974‚Äì1975). Jones was a three time ABA All Star, shot 34% from three-point range and never in his career had a technical foul called against him. Jones then jumped leagues and finished his professional playing career in the NBA out with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1975‚Äì76. =Broadcasting career= Jones' broadcasting career began in 1976 (the season after he retired as a player with the Portland Trail Blazers), when he became a color commentator for CBS. He was part of the network's crew that handled the Blazers championship game against the Philadelphia 76ers. He also served as color analyst for the Blazers that year and stayed on into the 1990s. Jones' other broadcasting credits include stints with TNT, TBS, USA Network and the Denver Nuggets. Jones joined NBC shortly after the network obtained the rights to telecast NBA games prior to the 1990-91 season. After serving as an analyst on The NBA on NBC for 13 years, Jones then worked the same position for NBA TV. One of Jones' career highlights was his assignment as basketball analyst with Chick Hearn and Jim Durham in Barcelona, as part of the NBC coverage of men's basketball during the 1992 Olympic Games. In that capacity he worked the equivalent of almost one-half of an NBA season, 36 games, in just two weeks. When he worked at NBC, Jones was typically paired up with former NBA teammate Bill Walton for NBA games due to the point-counterpoint style of banter between the two. He gained notoriety while announcing with Bill Walton for reining in his verbose outbursts, often responding to Walton's sometimes sensational statements with phrases such as \\"Bill, you can't be serious...\\" Though they typically argued and disagreed during games, the two had a mutual respect for each other and remained good friends. They reunited on Walton's short-lived TV show Bill Walton's Long Strange Trip. =Personal life and death= Jones' health began declining in 2005 when he suffered a ruptured appendix while on assignment in New York. His younger brother, Nick Jones stated, \\"My brother was a very strong guy. He fought for life for a long time.\\" Jones died on November 25, 2017, in Houston, Texas, at the age of 75. He was survived by his younger brother, Nick Jones (his older brother Roman had died earlier the same week), his mother & sisters, and his wife Carol.

It was used to mean throwing open the doors of the Church metaphorically in order to open a dialogue with the outside world. It was the name given to the pontifical program of John XXIII in a speech he gave on January 25, 1959.  Overview  Since the pontificate of Pope Pius X, the Church had set itself firmly against modernism. Pope Pius XI identified the enemy as those who said that ‚Äúthe Roman Pontiff can and ought to come to terms with Progress, Liberalism, and the New Civilization.‚Äù But Pope John XXIII had a different response to change in the modern world, to \\"throw open the windows of the Church so that we can see out and the people can see in.\\" Bishop Christopher Butler, a participant in Vatican II and prolific author, expressed this aggiornamento, as John XXIII had called it, in a way that would become more evident during Francis' papacy. Butler said that the new \\"pastoral aim, the instinct of a charity that goes beyond all boundaries, the sense of mission not so much to human nature or the abstract human species, but to human persons and the actually existing human family, demanded that our aggiornamento should be conceived of in depth.\\" The bishops at Vatican II, Butler explained, recognized that great changes in the human environment and world required serious adaptation of the Church to respond to this new environment. The pre-Vatican II church remained fashioned after the manner of rule in the Holy Roman Empire, and in its Counter-Reformation mode. Such a Church was, according to Bishop Butler, moving toward \\"monumental irrelevance\\". Proclamation of the gospel is the first task of the Church, and so it must make this gospel intelligible and relevant to the people of each age, and now to the whole world of diverse peoples represented by their bishops at Vatican II. For this the Council, in a spirit of aggiornamento, reached back \\"behind St Thomas himself and the Fathers, to the biblical theology which governs the first two chapters of the Constitution on the Church.\\" Before the council Originally, as John XXIII announced in his 1959 speech, the word only referred to an update of the 1917 Code of Canon law.Allocuzione con la quale il Sommo Pontefice annuncia il Sinodo Romano, il Concilio Ecumenico e l'aggiornamento del Codice di diritto Canonico The revised Code of Canon Law was not completed until 1983, though. The term describing the Canon law update was eventually broadened to refer to the larger process of Church reform sought at Vatican II. In June 1961, in an address to a group of Blessed Sacrament Fathers, John XXIII said Gaudium et spes The conciliar document most often associated with the aggiornamento is Gaudium et spes. The document was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. Yves Congar French theologian Yves Congar was a lead theological consultant (peritus) during the Council. Congar was monitored by Holy Office as early as the 1930s and silenced in the 1950s after the Raid on the French Dominicans. His reputation recovered in 1960 when Pope John XXIII invited Congar to serve on the preparatory theological commission of the Second Vatican Council. After the pre-developed council plans were discarded by the attending bishops, Congar played a significant role in the discussions between the Curial minority and the Episcopal majority at Vatican II. In November 1994, Congar was named a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II. Ressourcement One of the \\"sign of the times\\" that Vatican II dealt with was that scholasticism, which dominated Catholic philosophy and theology from the 13th into the 20th century, had little appeal for the modern mind. From the late 19th century, \\"neo-scholasticism\\" was supported by the hierarchy but with diminishing success. From the period 1935 to 1960 several French and German theologians proposed going back to before scholasticism, with what was called a \\"ressourcement\\" approach, looking for inspiration in the early church and in the Church Fathers as interpreters of the New Testament. The term Nouvelle th√©ologie was attached to this theology, at first by those who opposed it. There was wide support for ressourcement at Vatican II. After the council, when those who were more conservative emphasized the traditionalist element in ressourcement in their journal Communio, a more progressive group emphasized discontinuities and became more identified with aggiornamento, advocated in their journal Concilium. Paul VI Paul VI went on to adopt Pope John's motto for himself, as he stated in Ecclesiam suam : We cannot forget Pope John XXIII's word aggiornamento which We have adopted as expressing the aim and object of Our own pontificate. Besides ratifying it and confirming it as the guiding principle of the Ecumenical Council, We want to bring it to the notice of the whole Church. It should prove a stimulus to the Church to increase its ever growing vitality and its ability to take stock of itself and give careful consideration to the signs of the times, always and everywhere \\"proving all things and holding fast that which is good\\" with the enthusiasm of youth. Conservative reaction Some conservatives had warned about excessive progressivism and had repeated the final sentence of the 1861 Syllabus of Errors : The Roman Pontiff can, and ought to, reconcile himself, and come to terms with progress, liberalism and modern civilization. Cardinal Francis Spellman, who had been nominated by Pius XII, was reportedly cautious of aggiornamento and, before departing to Rome, declared, \\"No change will get past the Statue of Liberty.\\" The Cardinal believed that predominantly liberal clergymen were being appointed to the Council's commissions, and opposed the introduction of vernacular into the Mass, saying, \\"The Latin language, which is truly the Catholic language, is unchangeable, is not vulgar, and has for many centuries been the guardian of the unity of the Western Church.\\"  Pope Francis  Aggiornamenti were particularly associated with the much repeated phrase in the Church in the 1960s the \\"sign of the times\\", meaning an attempt to learn from the world and read the signs of the times. Some see the time of John Paul II as a retrenchment from the solid advancements of Vatican II and the contribution of Pope Francis as \\"reconnecting of the church with the energy of the Second Vatican Council, the energy coming out of that council\\".

Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker, Alec Baldwin, Julia Stiles, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, David Paymer, Patti LuPone, Clark Gregg, and Charles Durning. The plot involves the on-location production in Waterford, Vermont, of a film called The Old Mill. The actual film was shot in Massachusetts in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Beverly, Dedham and Waltham. State and Main received favorable reviews from critics.  Plot  Havoc is wrought on the inhabitants of a small New England town by a troubled film production. After the leading man's penchant for underage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location, the crew moves to the small town of Waterford, Vermont to finish shooting The Old Mill. As its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago. Unfazed, the film's director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to alter the script. What he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block. A local bookseller, Annie Black (Rebecca Pidgeon), tries to provide White with inspiration. The film's leading lady (Sarah Jessica Parker) refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional $800,000, while the foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile, the leading man, Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), dallies with Carla (Julia Stiles), a crafty local teen. Everything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White (the only witness) to another emotional quandary and into the arms of Annie. Meanwhile, a powerful movie producer (David Paymer) comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.  Cast  *William H.

Digital comics commonly take the form of mobile comics. Webcomics may also fall under the \\"digital comics\\" umbrella. Background With the growing use of smartphones, tablets, and desktop screen reading, major publishers begun releasing comics, graphic novels and manga in digital formats. Declining sales and copyright violation have led some publishers to find new ways to publish their comics, while others are just adapting to the digital age while still having great success with the printed comic format. American publishers' attempts at creating digital publishing platforms for local comics and Manga have thus far been more successful than attempts with digital Manga publishing in Japan, which have lacked a coherent strategy to create successful digital platforms in which to publish, and had revenue considerations from the impact of illegal scanlation. Some attempts in Japan have been made, but failed, such as JManga; while others merged with larger worldwide distributors as in the case of Square Enix digital publishing joining the Hachette Book Group for distribution in over 200 countries. Some western notable platforms such as Graphicly have closed down due to the creators getting hired by the self-publishing platform Blurb. Notable digital distributors comiXology is a cloud-based digital comics platform that offers material from over 75 publishers and independent creators, which can be bought or downloaded for free. Its publishers catalog includes both big western publishers such as Marvel Comics and DC; and translations of Manga through publishers such as Tokyopop. As of 2014 the platform is owned by Amazon.com. Marvel Comics launched Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited, a subscription service allowing readers to read online many comics from Marvel's history, on November 13, 2007. The service also includes periodic releases of new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of Avenging Spider-Man, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book. Image Comics launched its 'Image Digital Comics Store store' in 2013 which is a part of its company website. It got attention for selling comics digitally that are DRM-free, thereby allowing users to download their comics in PDF, EPUB, and the CBR or CBZ Comic Book Archive file formats to their various electronic devices. It also has exclusive digital releases on its website and offers 5-page previews of its comics online. Image Comics was the first big publisher to offer DRM-free digital comics in the U.S., stating that it believes that consumers should be able to own what they have bought in the case of a platform having major technical problems or leaving the market altogether. It also stated that it does not see infringement as a big problem as most consumers will buy comics that are of high quality. Since 2012, DC Comics has offered to sell its comics through all three major E-book stores: Amazon Kindle Store, iBookstore and Nook Store, as well as through the site www.readdcentertainment.com and through comiXology. DC Comics was the first to offer readers multiple formats to download and digital issues releases on the same day as their printed counterparts. The company stated that it sees the future in digital comics, but its digital sales also help the printed books. Dark Horse Comics launched its online digital store in 2011 which supports both computers, iOS and Android devices. The site allows over 2,000 comics to be previewed. The website Humble Bundle was originally created in 2010 for selling time-limited pay-what-you-want indie game bundles. Since 2012 it has been putting up pay- what-your-want book bundles, which now and then featured comics. The first fully dedicated comic bundle was in April 2014, hosting material from Image comics. The Humble Comic Bundles are digital rights management-free and support charities. The website has hosted comic bundles from some publisher such as Dark Horse Comics, Top Cow, Oni Press, Boom! Studios and Valiant Comics, among others. The idea behind the bundles from publisher standpoint is to try to find new audiences for their products at heavily discounted prices. In 2013, Panel Syndicate received critical acclaim and media attention for its role publishing one of the first DRM-free, pay what you want comics by high caliber creators. Asian digital comics In Asia, digital comics have become very popular due to readers mostly reading titles on their smartphones and the lower barrier to create their own comics. In some countries, digital comics have revitalized the industry or even created them where they didn't exist before. In China, digital comics are known as \\"web manhua\\" and many of the big internet giants in the country have created platforms for anyone to submit their own works and read many titles for free, \\"U17\\" being an example. Thanks in part to free access to these comics and most being in color, the manhua industry has seen a surge in revenue and production in both China and Taiwan. On those platforms, there are comics created by so-called \\"Platinum Authors\\" who have over one million \\"Paid Subscription/Views\\" and one of the most successful one is \\"Á´ØËÑë\\" (the English version is valled \\"Die Now\\"). This single comic series has over 2,109,000,000 (2.109 billion) views. The team of authors for this web manhua earned over ten times the US national average salary. In recent years, several web manhua have been adapted into animated series, with some in co-production with the Japanese animation industry. In Japan, web manga have started to pick up steam as many manga artists choose to upload their own original works on image hosting sites and social media forgoing traditional publishers. Many of the big publishers have also launched digital magazines and websites where web manga get released alongside traditional print works. Unlike digital comics in other Asian countries, web manga are almost always released in black-in-white rather than color despite being released digitally in contrast to titles released in nearby countries. The South Korean manhwa industry actually created their own original format for comics called webtoons which helped revitalized the manhwa industry in the country. Before, the industry had difficulty taking off and becoming popular among readers due to the popularity of translated manga and lack of support for local titles. Webtoons have brought in new readers and fans of manhwa, both in South Korea and around the world. The popularity of webtoons has even led to other countries adopting the format to release their own comics.

Members of the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae, the genus is represented by about 17 species. Two very similar and coexisting genera are Tanaecia (the viscounts and earls) and Euthalia (the barons and counts), the latter previously including some Lexias species. The largest species reach a wingspan of about . Description Lexias pardalis and L. dirtea are also among the most colourful archdukes. Sexual dichromatism is however extreme, with the two sexes appearing entirely different. The males' dorsal wing surfaces are a dramatic combination of velvety black forewings and metallic blue green to violet covering the margins of the forewings and hindwings. The females' dorsal wing surfaces are a drab brown, with small yellowish white spots. Both sexes have drab ventral wings, presumably as a means of camouflage. The dramatic colours of the males are thought to play a role in intraspecies communication, both by signalling to other males when defending territory, and by attracting females. L. pardalis and L. dirtea, two commonly farmed species, are nearly identical and often confused, but they can be distinguished by their differing antennae: the dorsal surface of L. pardalis antennae tips are yellow orange, whereas they are black in L. dirtea. Life cycle Caterpillars of the genus are protected from predators by their long spinous bristles. Archduke chrysalids are pale green and angular in shape; they may be up to 30 mm in length. Calophyllum trees are host to the caterpillars of Southeast Asian archdukes. The observed readiness of Southeast Asian species to feed on both decaying fruit (of Garcinia tree species) and the nectar of flowers suggests that these species inhabit the forest periphery. Because both types of food are common in this habitat, the Southeast Asian archdukes have not become specialised in feeding on one or the other, as is usual in butterflies. Archdukes are found primarily in virgin forests and are attracted to sunlit areas such as clearings and paths. Butterfly farming Several archduke species are raised in large numbers on butterfly farms for the specimen collecting market and for live sale to butterfly conservatories. The most commonly farmed species are L. pardalis and L. dirtea.

Design and development When the USAAF started strategic bombing in Europe there were no fighters available to escort the bombers all the way to distant targets. The bombers carried several defensive guns and formed up in boxes so that they could provide mutually covering fire but there was interest in providing more firepower for the formation. The XB-41 Liberator was outfitted with 14 .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns. This was achieved by adding a second dorsal turret and a remotely operated Bendix turret (of the same type as fitted to the YB-40) under the chin to the standard twin gun tail turret and twin gun retractable ventral ball turret, plus twin mount guns at each waist window.Davis 1987, p.24. The port waist mount was originally covered by a Plexiglas bubble; testing showed this caused severe optical distortion and it was removed. The XB-41 carried 12,420 rounds of ammunition, 4,000 rounds of which were stored in the bomb bay as a reserve. It was powered by four Pratt & Whitney R-1830-43 radial engines. Operational history On 29 January 1943, the sole XB-41 was delivered to Eglin Field, Florida. Tests were carried out for two months at Eglin during February 1943.Consolidated XB-41 Liberator. Historyofwar.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-31. These indicated significant problems with the aircraft; on 21 March 1943, the Army declared the XB-41 as unsuitable for operational use; the conversion of thirteen Liberators to YB-41 service test aircraft was cancelled. Despite this, Consolidated continued to work on the XB-41 prototype; wide-blade propellers were fitted, and some of the armor was removed to reduce the aircraft's weight. Tests resumed at Eglin on 28 July 1943; however, the basic flaws of the \\"gunship\\" concept remained, and the XB-41 program was abandoned. The prototype XB-41 was redesignated TB-24D; it served as an instructional airframe for training mechanics on the B-24. It was scrapped at Maxwell Field, Alabama on 2 February 1945.

COM distinguishes between three interface types: custom that are VTABLE-based IUnknown interfaces, dispatch that are IDispatch interfaces supporting introspection, and dual interfaces supporting both types. The Automation (IDispatch) interface allows a client application to find out what properties and methods are supported by an object at run-time, i.e. implements the concept of RTTI. It also provides the information necessary to invoke these properties and methods. Client applications do not need to be aware of the object members when they are compiled. This allows COM and ActiveX objects to be called by scripting programs platforms such as the ASP server and JavaScript on Internet Explorer, where calling conventions were not known at the time IIS or IE were built. By contrast, a simple object library is compiled and linked into a program, e.g. a DLL call needs to know a function name and parameters at compile time. A script writer can ask the COM object for a method or property it already knows about from documentation. Then, the client can execute the function with Invoke provided by the IDispatch interface, a form of late-binding. This sort of capability was also supported by Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), which never became popular due to being too low-level. Dispatch interfaces are flexible, but suffer from additional introspection and invocation overhead compared to custom interfaces.Microsoft MSDN: ActiveX/COM Q&A; December 1995 It is therefore often a good idea to support both interface types with dual interfaces. That way, clients supporting VTABLE-based invocation can use the custom interface instead of the dispatch counterpart. Methods Each property and method implemented by an object that supports the IDispatch interface has what is called a Dispatch ID, which is often abbreviated DISPID. The DISPID is the primary means of identifying a property or method and must be supplied to the Invoke function for a property or method to be invoked, along with an array of Variants containing the parameters. The GetIDsOfNames function can be used to get the appropriate DISPID from a property or method name that is in string format. IDispatch derives from IUnknown and extends it with four additional methods: interface IDispatch : public IUnknown { virtual HRESULT GetTypeInfoCount(unsigned int * pctinfo) = 0; virtual HRESULT GetTypeInfo(unsigned int iTInfo, LCID lcid, ITypeInfo ** ppTInfo ) = 0; virtual HRESULT GetIDsOfNames(REFIID riid, OLECHAR ** rgszNames, unsigned int cNames, LCID lcid, DISPID * rgDispId ) = 0; virtual HRESULT Invoke(DISPID dispIdMember, REFIID riid, LCID lcid, WORD wFlags, DISPPARAMS * pDispParams, VARIANT * pVarResult, EXCEPINFO * pExcepInfo, unsigned int * puArgErr ) = 0; }; The IDispatch interface ID is defined as a GUID with the value of {00020400-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}.

Biography  Born as Mary Elise Dodd in Los Angeles, California to Rev. Neal Dodd (September 6, 1879 ‚Äî May 26, 1966) and Lila Elsie Dodd (n√©e Weaver; September 12, 1889 ‚Äî March 28, 1949), her father was a priest of the Anglo- Catholic Episcopal Church. Dodd began her career on the Los Angeles stage in 1939, debuting in a revival of the play The Cradle Song with the Westwood Theatre Guild. Her performance in The Penguin (1940), at the Call Board Theatre in Hollywood, was reviewed as demonstrating unusual eccentric comedy gifts. That same year, she appeared in And Eternal Darkness at the Call Board and the review read, \\"Molly Dodd as the love interest was appealing.\\" In February 1947, Dodd received a citation from the USO for her performance in No√´l Coward's Private Lives at United States Army camps. She acted in numerous stage productions through the years, including summer stock in La Jolla. Dodd was in only four theatrical movies. She first appeared as a beautician in Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) starring James Stewart and Kim Novak. She also appeared as Mrs. Rigg in What's the Matter with Helen? (1971), which was written by her husband, writer Henry Farrell, and starred Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters. In 1965, Dodd and actor/writer Robert Lansing formed the State Repertory Theatre as a rallying ground for professional actors who wanted to do plays outside the realm of commercial theatre. They did various productions ‚Äì Spoon River Anthology, a concert titled From Our Bag, Pirandello's As You Desire Me, and a double-bill titled Those Mad Victorians, which the company took to Caltech in the late 1960s. When they returned to Caltech the following season, they performed An Evening With Oscar Wilde, a concert reading based on Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and The House of Pomegranates, with Dodd as one of the players. She made a number of guest appearances on various top-rated TV shows, including The Andy Griffith Show, The Twilight Zone, Gomer Pyle, Hazel, Petticoat Junction, The Brady Bunch, Bewitched and The Rockford Files. Dodd also played a mental patient in the TV movie How Awful About Allan (1970), which was written by her husband, and starred Anthony Perkins and Julie Harris. Death Molly Dodd died at the age of 59 in Santa Monica from undisclosed causes and was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

This idea is more broadly referred to as programmable matter.Goldstein (2005), p. 99-101 Claytronics has the potential to greatly affect many areas of daily life, such as telecommunication, human-computer interfaces, and entertainment.  Current research  Current research is exploring the potential of modular reconfigurable robotics and the complex software necessary to control the ‚Äúshape changing‚Äù robots. ‚ÄúLocally Distributed Predicates or LDP is a distributed, high-level language for programming modular reconfigurable robot systems (MRRs)‚Äù. There are many challenges associated with programming and controlling a large number of discrete modular systems due to the degrees of freedom that correspond with each module. For example, reconfiguring from one formation to one similar may require a complex path of movements controlled by an intricate string of commands even though the two shapes differ slightly.De Rosa (2009) In 2005, research efforts to develop a hardware concept were successful on the scale of millimeters, creating cylindrical prototypes 44 millimeters in diameter which interact with each other via electromagnetic attraction. Their experiments helped researchers verify the relationship between mass and potential force between objects as ‚Äúa 10-fold reduction in size [which] should translate to a 100-fold increase in force relative to mass‚Äù. Recent advancements in this prototype concept are in the form of one millimeter diameter cylindrical robots fabricated on a thin film by photolithography that would cooperate with each other using complex software that would control electromagnetic attraction and repulsion between modules.Karagozler (2009) Today, extensive research and experiments with claytronics are being conducted at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by a team of researchers which consists of Professors Todd C. Mowry, Seth Goldstein, graduate and undergraduate students, and researchers from Intel Labs Pittsburgh.Goldstein (2010b)  Hardware  The driving force behind programmable matter is the actual hardware that is manipulating itself into whatever form is desired. Claytronics consists of a collection of individual components called claytronic atoms, or catoms. In order to be viable, catoms need to fit a set of criteria. First, catoms need to be able to move in three dimensions relative to each other and be able to adhere to each other to form a three-dimensional shape. Second, the catoms need to be able to communicate with each other in an ensemble and be able to compute state information, possibly with assistance from each other. Fundamentally, catoms consist of a CPU, a network device for communication, a single pixel display, several sensors, an onboard battery, and a means to adhere to one another. = Current catoms = The researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed various prototypes of catoms. These vary from small cubes to giant helium balloons.Karagozler (2006) The prototype that is most like what developers hope catoms will become is the planar catom. These take the form of 44 mm diameter cylinders. These cylinders are equipped with 24 electromagnets arranged in a series of stacked rings along the cylinder's circumference. Movement is achieved by the catoms cooperatively enabling and disabling the magnets in order to roll along each other's surfaces. Only one magnet on each catom is energized at a time. These prototypes are able to reconfigure themselves quite quickly, with the uncoupling of two units, movement to another contact point, and recoupling taking only about 100 ms. Power is supplied to the catoms using pickup feet on the bottom of the cylinder. Conductive strips on the table supply the necessary power.Kirby (2005), p. 1730-1731 = Future design = In the current design, the catoms are only able to move in two dimensions relative to each other. Future catoms will be required to move in three dimensions relative to each other. The goal of the researchers is to develop a millimeter scale catom with no moving parts, to allow for mass manufacturability. Millions of these microrobots will be able to emit variable color and intensity of light, allowing for dynamic physical rendering. The design goal has shifted to creating catoms that are simple enough to only function as part of an ensemble, with the ensemble as a whole being capable of higher function.Kirby (2007) As the catoms are scaled down, an onboard battery sufficient to power it will exceed the size of the catom itself, so an alternate energy solution is desired. Research is being done into powering all of the catoms in an ensemble, utilizing the catom-to-catom contact as a means of energy transport. One possibility being explored is using a special table with positive and negative electrodes and routing the power internally through the catoms, via ‚Äúvirtual wires.‚Äù Another major design challenge will be developing a genderless unary connector for the catoms in order to keep reconfiguration time at a minimum. Nanofibers provide a possible solution to this challenge.Aksak (2007), p. 91 Nanofibers allow for great adhesion on a small scale and allow for minimum power consumption when the catoms are at rest.  Software  Organizing all of the communication and actions between millions of sub-millimeter scale catoms requires development of advanced algorithms and programming languages. The researchers and engineers of Carnegie Mellon-Intel Claytronics Research Lab launched a wide range of projects to develop the necessary software to facilitate communication between catoms. The most important projects are developing new programming languages which work more efficiently for claytronics. The goal of a claytronics matrix is to dynamically form three-dimensional shapes. However, the vast number of catoms in this distributed network increases complexity of micro-management of each individual catom. So, each catom must perceive accurate position information and command of cooperation with its neighbors. In this environment, software language for the matrix operation must convey concise statements of high-level commands in order to be universally distributed. Languages to program a matrix require a more abbreviated syntax and style of command than normal programming languages such as C++ and Java.Goldstein (2010a) The Carnegie Mellon-Intel Claytronics Research Project has created two new programming languages: Meld and Locally Distributed Predicates (LDP). = Meld = Meld is a declarative language, a logic programming language originally designed for programming overlay networks.Ashley-Rollman (2007b) By using logic programming, the code for an ensemble of robots can be written from a global perspective, enabling the programmer to concentrate on the overall performance of the claytronics matrix rather than writing individual instructions for every one of the thousands to millions of catoms in the ensemble.Ashley-Rollman (2007a) This dramatically simplifies the thought process for programming the movement of a claytronics matrix. = Locally distributed predicates (LDP) = LDP is a reactive programming language. It has been used to trigger debugging in the earlier research. With the addition of language that enables the programmer to build operations in the development of the shape of the matrix, it can be used to analyze the distributed local conditions.De Rosa (2008) It can operate on fixed-size, connected groups of modules providing various functions of state configuration. A program that addresses a fixed-size module rather than the entire ensemble allows programmers to operate the claytronic matrix more frequently and efficiently. LDP further provides a means of matching distributed patterns. It enables the programmer to address a larger set of variables with Boolean logic, which enables the program to search for larger patterns of activity and behavior among groups of modules. = Distributed watchpoints = Performance errors for thousands to millions of individual catoms are hard to detect and debug, therefore, claytronics matrix operations require a dynamic and self-directed process for identifying and debugging errors. Claytronics researchers have developed Distributed Watchpoints, an algorithm-level approach to detecting and fixing errors missed by more conventional debugging techniques.Rister (2007) It establishes nodes that receive surveillance to determine the validity of distributed conditions.De Rosa (2007) This approach provides a simple and highly descriptive set of rules to evaluate distributed conditions and proves effective in the detection of errors. = Algorithms = Two important classes of claytronics algorithms are shape sculpting and localization algorithms. The ultimate goal of claytronics research is creating dynamic motion in three-dimensional poses. All the research on catom motion, collective actuation and hierarchical motion planning require shape sculpting algorithms to convert catoms into the necessary structure, which will give structural strength and fluid movement to the dynamic ensemble. Meanwhile, localization algorithms enable catoms to localize their positions in an ensemble.Funiak (2008) A localization algorithm should provide accurate relational knowledge of catoms to the whole matrix based on noisy observation in a fully distributed manner.  Future applications  As the capabilities of computing continue to develop and robotic modules shrink, claytronics will become useful in many applications. The featured application of claytronics is a new mode of communication. Claytronics will offer a more realistic sense to communication over long distance called pario. Similar to how audio and video provide aural and visual stimulation, pario provides an aural, visual and physical sensation. A user will be able to hear, see and touch the one communicating with them in a realistic manner. Pario could be used effectively in many professional disciplines from engineering design, education and healthcare to entertainment and leisure activities such as video games.Goldstein (2009), p. 29-45 The advancements in nanotechnology and computing necessary for claytronics to become a reality are feasible, but the challenges to overcome are daunting and will require great innovation. In a December 2008 interview, Jason Campbell, a lead researcher from Intel Labs Pittsburgh, said, \\"my estimates of how long it is going to take have gone from 50 years down to just a couple more years. That has changed over the four years I‚Äôve been working on the project\\".Byrne (2008)  See also  * Ensemble axiom * Nanotechnology * Smartdust *The Invincible, a 1964 science fiction novel with intrigue centered on self- configuring nanobotic swarms * Ubiquitous computing * Utility fog  Notes   References  *Aksak, B., Cassell, A., Li, J., Meyyappan, M., & Callen, P.

Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro The Archdiocese of S√£o Sebasti√£o do Rio de Janeiro (, lit. \\"Archdiocese of St. Sebastian of Rio de Janeiro\\") in Brazil was established as a territorial prelature on July 19, 1575. It was elevated to the status of a diocese on November 16, 1676. It was later elevated to a metropolitan archdiocese on April 27, 1892. On May 6, 2003, the territorial abbey of Nossa Senhora do Monserrate do Rio de Janeiro lost its territorial rank and was added to the archdiocese. Cardinal Orani Jo√£o Tempesta O. Cist. has been its Archbishop since 2009. Cardinal Eus√©bio Scheid S.C.I. is Archbishop Emeritus.

(22 Nov 1676 Appointed ‚Äì 1680 Resigned. Manoel Pereira, O.P. was consecrated a Bishop due to his appointment as Bishop of Rio de Janeiro but he resigned the office in 1680 without ever having taken canonical possession of his See.) * Jos√© de Barros Alarc√£o (19 Aug 1680 Appointed ‚Äì 6 Apr 1700 Died. Bishop Alarc√£o is counted as the first Bishop of Rio de Janeiro, because his predecessor never travelled to the city and never took canonical possession of the newly erected See; Bishop Alarc√£o was therefore the first Bishop of Rio to be actually installed in the office.) * Francisco de S√£o Jer√µnimo de Andrade S.C.I. (8 Aug 1701 Appointed ‚Äì 7 Mar 1721 Died) * Ant√¥nio de Guadalupe O.F.M. (21 Feb 1725 Appointed ‚Äì 31 Aug 1740 Died) * Jo√£o da Cruz Salgado de Castilho O.C.D. (19 Dec 1740 Appointed ‚Äì 4 Dec 1745 Resigned) * Ant√¥nio de Nossa Senhora do Desterro Malheiro O.S.B. (15 Dec 1745 Appointed ‚Äì 5 Dec 1773 Died) * Jos√© Joaquim Justiniano Mascarenhas Castello Branco (20 Dec 1773 Succeeded ‚Äì 28 Jan 1805 Died). Then Father Castello Branco had been selected by the King of Portugal and nominated to the Holy See to be coadjutor bishop of Rio de Janeiro, with the right of succession, due to the failing health of bishop Antonio de Nossa Senhora do Desterro Malheiro OSB, on 17 August 1773 (Kings of Portugal had the right of nomination due to the padroado regime, that continued in the imperial era after the independence of Brazil, in accordance with the agreements between the State and the Holy See). Bishop Malheiro died on 5 December 1773 before the Holy See confirmed the nomination of Father Castello Branco as coadjutor bishop. On 20 December 1773, still unaware of the demise of the diocesan Bishop, the Pope granted the confirmation to the nomination of Castello Branco as coadjutor bishop of Rio de Janeiro, and appointed him titular bishop of Tipasa in Mauretania, with the right of succession to the see of Rio de Janeiro. Because of the prior death of the diocesan Bishop, Castello Branco immediately succeeded to the See of Rio de Janeiro upon the confirmation of his appointment as coadjutor Bishop. Accordingly, his appointment as titular bishop became without effect and he at once acquired the jurisdiction of bishop of Rio de Janeiro, in accordance with the norms of canon law then in force, on 20 December 1773. Because he was still only a priest, he was consecrated as Bishop on 30 January 1774. * Jos√© Caetano da Silva Coutinho (26 Aug 1806 Appointed ‚Äì 27 Jan 1833 Died. From 1808 to 1822 he also served as Major Chaplain of the Royal Chapel, providing religious services to the Portuguese Royal Court then established in Rio de Janeiro. After the independence of Brazil, the Royal Chapel became the Imperial Chapel, continuing under the leadership of the Bishop of Rio de Janeiro. Accordingly, Bishop Jos√© Caetano da Silva Coutinho became Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel, serving the Brazilian Imperial Family, from 1822 until his death. Due to holding those royal and imperial offices he was known as Bishop Major Chaplain.) He was also elected for life as a Senator of the Empire of Brazil in 1826, and, chosen by his peers, served as the President of the Senate from 1827 to 1832. * Manoel de Monte Rodrigues de Ara√∫jo, later Count of Iraj√° (23 Dec 1839 Appointed ‚Äì 11 Jun 1863 Died. Also served ex officio as Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel during his tenure as Bishop of Rio de Janeiro, and was accordingly known as The Bishop Major Chaplain.) Created Count of Iraj√° in the Peerage of the Empire of Brazil in 1845. * Pedro Maria de Lacerda, later Count of Santa F√© (24 Sep 1868 Appointed ‚Äì 12 Nov 1890 Died. Also served as Major Chaplain of the Imperial Chapel from the start of his tenure as Bishop of Rio de Janeiro until the abolition of the Monarchy in 1889, holding during that period the title of Bishop Major Chaplain.) Created Count of Santa F√© in the Peerage of the Empire of Brazil in 1888. * Jos√© Pereira da Silva Barros, Count of Santo Agostinho (25 Jun 1891 Appointed ‚Äì 1 Sep 1893 Resigned. During his tenure, in 1892, the Diocese was raised to the rank of Metropolitan Archdiocese; however he was not promoted to the rank of Metropolitan Archbishop, and continued leading the particular Church as Bishop, until the acceptance of his resignation on 1 September 1893. Days later, on 12 September 1893, the first Metropolitan Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro was appointed.) Bishop Jos√© Pereira da Silva Barros had been created Count of Santo Agostinho in the Peerage of the Empire of Brazil in 1888, before he was named Bishop of Rio de Janeiro, while serving as Bishop of Olinda and Recife. He was appointed Titular Archbishop after his resignation from the See of Rio de Janeiro. ;Metropolitan Archbishops Since Pope Pius X appointed the second Metropolitan Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Arcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti, a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church in 1905, all subsequent Archbishops were either elevated to the Cardinalate during their service in the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, or were transferred to that Metropolitan See when already members of the College of Cardinals. * Jo√£o Fernando Santiago Esberrard (12 Sep 1893 Appointed ‚Äì 22 Jan 1897 Died) * Cardinal Joaquim Arcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti (24 Aug 1897 Appointed ‚Äì 18 Apr 1930 Died.

IUPUC offers degree programs from both Indiana University and Purdue University. History IUPUC was founded in 1970 as an extension of Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Originally, the extension had no single campus, instead offering classes in various locations throughout Columbus. An old airport building was converted to the first centralized campus building for IUPUC, but was soon renovated for academic use in 1985. In 1994, the chancellor of IUPUI renamed IUPUI Columbus to IUPUC.History of IUPUC IUPUC's first vice-chancellor, Paul Bippen, served in this capacity from 1977 until his retirement in 2003, when he was replaced by Nasser Paydar. In 2007, Jay Howard was named interim vice-chancellor. In 2009, Marwan Wafa was named the new vice-chancellor. IUPUC's most-senior executive title is vice-chancellor. Academics Students can complete several Indiana University (IU) and Purdue University (PU) bachelor's and master's degrees in their entirety on IUPUC's shared Columbus campus. Students can also complete a substantial number of classes toward degrees not offered at IUPUC and then transfer to IUPUI or another IU or PU campus. The university's divisions include: * Division of Business * Division of Education * Division of Liberal Arts * Division of Mechanical Engineering * Division of Health Sciences * Division of Science * University College * Honors Program IUPUC predominantly serves students in Bartholomew, Brown, Decatur, Jackson, Jefferson, Jennings, Johnson, Ripley and Shelby counties, as well as other areas in the largely rural south central and southeastern portion of Indiana. IUPUC also offers off-campus classes at the community learning center in Seymour. IUPUC is one of the first academic institutions to innovate a cross- institutional and cross-discipline tutoring program through partnerships with Ivy Tech Community College and the Purdue Statewide Technology program. The Academic Resource Center (ARC) is a one-of-a-kind, one-stop tutoring operation for math, science, writing, public speaking, Spanish, and basic technology.

Atlee Burpee & Co., is an American seed company that was founded by Washington Atlee Burpee in Pennsylvania in 1876. History = Early years (1876-1915) = W. Atlee Burpee & Company was founded in 1876 by Washington Atlee Burpee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after starting a mail-order chicken business in 1876. The company expanded to selling garden seeds, farm supplies, tools and hogs after customers began asking for seeds they had grown in their native farms. In 1888, the family farm, Fordhook Farms in Doylestown, Pennsylvania was established as a family farm and crop field trials after Burpee began traveling to Europe to collect seeds which needed to be adopted to North American climates. The farm was likely the first experimental test field station in the United States. In 1900, distant cousin Luther Burbank visited the farm inspiring him to create his own experiments. He later created additional research stations, including in California in 1909, to test seeds. By the turn of the century, Burpee's had created one of the largest mail and freight businesses of the time. = Expanding the company (1915-1970) = The direction of the company began to change with the death of its founder in 1915, when his son, David Burpee, inherited the company. David was interested in war or victory gardens and was an early promoter of the concept during World War I. He also prioritized in flowers and initiated several flower hybridization breeding programs. Geneticists also began to modify the genes of seeds using x-rays and colchine. Under his leadership, the advertising and catalog also improved. The advertisements began to include full-color advertising to include Burpee's strengths of reliability of seeds using the motto \\"Burpee's Seeds Grow\\" and leader in the industry while the catalog was compact, arranged by category, and easy to find the order form. Any information not included in the catalog was sent to the customer requesting it in a handwritten letter. The catalog's sales averaged $4 per order (roughly $53 in 2019). Various artists illustrated the catalog including Paul de Longpre and Alois Lunzer. After Burbank's death in 1926, Burpee acquired the rights to his experiments but no notable vegetables or flowers were to come from Burbank's work. In 1949, Burpee introduced its 'Big Boy' tomato hybrid which quickly became its best sellers. = New ownership (1970-current) = In 1970, David Burpee sold the company to General Foods for $10 million. In 1974, Burpee moved from its north Philadelphia location to its current headquarters at 300 Park Avenue in Warminster, Pennsylvania. SEPTA extended its Warminster Line commuter rail to Warminster, the train station being opposite Park Avenue from Burpee's headquarters. In the 70s, the company introduced seed-starting kits for beginners, an innovation in the seed industry. In 1979, the company was acquired by ITT. David Burpee remained as a consultant until his death in June 1980. In 1981, experimentation and seed production left Fordhook Farms. In the 1980s, gardens had begun to shrink in size from 600 square feet to 325 square feet while chain stores began selling a better selection of plants to their customers who preferred plants over seeds. These market changes and mismanagement by ITT led Burpee's sales to slump and was purchased for $15 million by new investors McKinsley & Co. in 1987. In 1991, the Burpee company was acquired by George Ball, Inc., a diversified horticultural family business. The new leadership diversified the business by selling new and unusual varieties; more plants than seeds; opening its own retail stores in 2000; and utilizing its web store to boost business. Jonathan Burpee, the founder's grandson, was the last Burpee family member to work for the company. In 1998, Ball purchased the family farm where notable varieties such as Iceberg lettuce and Big Boy tomato were bred to renovate and establish the property as a horticultural center. The seeds Burpee produces are almost exclusively grown in California. In March 2019, James Mattikow was named the company's president and CEO. White Marigold David Burpee began working to hybridize the marigold in 1919 to despite its limited colors, scrawniness, and late blooming flower. It was at this time that he first had the idea of a white marigold competition but held off on it due to his belief that the hybridization would be unsuccessful. In its 1954 catalog, W. Atlee Burpee & Co. first advertised a competition for the development of the first white marigold flower, offering $10,000 to any gardener whose efforts produced a flower deemed to be pure white. 21 years later, the prize was awarded to 67-year-old Alice Vonk of Sully, Iowa, who received $100 the previous year as one of six gardeners nationwide whose marigolds came closest to being white.\\"Sully Woman's Life Unchanged After Producing Prize Marigold,\\" Pella Chronicle, Pella Iowa, September 10, 1975, page 16.Beaver County Times - Google News Archive SearchThe Free Lance-Star - Google News Archive SearchThe Evening Independent - Google News Archive SearchSarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search Vonk kept seeds from the lightest flowers in her garden each season, replanting for over two decades before achieving a pure white marigold that measured 2.5 inches in diameter. Her entry in the 1975 edition of the contest topped 8,200 other entrants and produced what was then described as the \\"costliest flower ever.\\" Burpee's branded the flower as \\"Burpee's Best Whites.\\" By 1960, the odorless flower was the best-selling flower in the United States.

After finishing the military academy in Enns and Klosterneuburg Austria, Bernardis started his military career as a lieutenant in Linz. After the Austrian Anschluss in 1938, he accepted the new regime, but remained critical. However, once the Second World War had begun, experiences at the front such as witnessing the murder of civilians changed his mind and he became involved in the resistance movement against the Third Reich. He was assigned to the German General Staff by May 1942. By 1944, though still relatively young, he held the rank of an Oberstleutnant. He was not stationed near Hitler's headquarters at Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg when the 20 July assassination attempt was carried out, but was in Berlin instead. Unaware that the bomb had failed to kill Hitler, Bernadis was responsible for the order that set Operation Valkyrie in motion. That same evening, he was arrested by the Gestapo. On 8 August, he was sentenced to death by the German \\"People's Court\\" (Volksgerichtshof) and executed the same day. Despite being deported to a concentration camp, Bernardis's family survived the war.

His family belonged to the nobility of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The son of a land surveyor and a member of the minor nobility, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Surveying - and later from the General Staff Academy. From 1892 to 1895 Bonch-Bruyevich served as an officer with the Lithuanian Guards Regiment, posted at Warsaw.From Tsarist General to Red Army Commander by Mikhail Bonch-Bruyevich, translated by Vladimir Vezey, Progress Publishers, 1966, p48 First World War At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Bonch- Bruyevich commanded the 176th Perevolochensky Regiment, based at Chernigov. He witnessed the Russian aviator Pyotr Nesterov's fatal aerial ramming attack on 25 August 1914 [O.S.] during the Battle of Galicia. After the February Revolution of March 1917, the Provisional Government put Bonch-Bruyevich in command of the Russian garrison in Pskov, where he was elected to the executive of the Pskov soviet. After the German army captured Riga (3 September 1917) he was transferred to the northern front. He commanded the Northern Front from 29 August 1917 to 9 September 1917.  Under Communist rule  After the October Revolution of November 1917 Bonch-Bruyevich became one of the first high-ranking army officers to rally to the new regime, with which he had a strong family link: his younger brother, Vladimir Bonch- Bruyevich was a leading Bolshevik. On 19 November 1917 he was appointed chief of staff of the Supreme Commander, Nikolai Krylenko. In March 1918 he was appointed military director of the Supreme Military Council, and chief of field staff of the Revolutionary Military Council, and played a major role at the start of the Russian Civil War in organising the Red Army and the defence of the Soviet state. Former fellow-officers now in the White army declared him an outlaw, and attempted to catch him by raiding a train which they thought he was on. This incident may have contributed to his decision to resign his command. From March 1919 to October 1923 Bonch-Bruyevich served as the head of the () for the Supreme Economic Soviet. He was arrested in 1923 and accused of sabotage, but released after the head of the OGPU, Felix Dzerzhinsky intervened. In 1925 he organised the bureau of aerial photography. He was arrested again in February 1931, along with other former imperial army officers suspected of plotting against the Soviet regime, but was released without charge. He survived the Stalinist purges, and was promoted to the rank of divisional commander as the mass arrests of Red Army officers began in 1937. In 1944 he was promoted again - to the rank of lieutenant general.

His mother Audra Chartrand is an elementary school teacher and former fast-pitch softball player. Justin has an older brother, Geordie. His father once played hockey for the Brandon Wheat Kings and attended the training camp of the Minnesota North Stars. Morneau grew up in New Westminster, British Columbia, the historic \\"Royal City\\", adjacent to Vancouver, where he played hockey for the local minor team, the New Westminster Royals, and emerged as a star goaltender, playing for teams a year older than he was. He also played baseball in the New Westminster Minor Baseball Association and for the North Delta Blue Jays in the B.C. Premier Baseball League.

Humphrey Metrodome =Minor leagues= Morneau did not attend college, despite receiving many attractive offers from NCAA schools. He was selected by the Twins in the 3rd round as the 89th overall pick of the 1999 MLB amateur entry draft. He converted to first base in 2001 while playing for the Class-A Quad Cities River Bandits. In six minor league seasons, he hit .310 with 87 home runs, 153 RBIs and 122 doubles. Morneau participated in the 2002 and 2004 All-Star Futures Games, playing for the World teams.

He singled in his first career at-bat off Jason Jennings and went 2 for 4 in the game. A week later, he hit his first career home run off Kansas City Royals reliever Albie Lopez. Morneau went on to hit four home runs in his rookie season while batting .226. He spent the majority of the season with the Twins' Triple-A affiliate Rochester Red Wings. In 2004, after Morneau compiled impressive minor league numbers, the Twins dealt veteran first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz to the Boston Red Sox and Morneau became the Twins' starting first baseman. He appeared in 74 games for the Twins in 2004, hitting 19 home runs and 58 RBIs in 280 at bats while committing just three errors. The 2005 season was a struggle for Morneau, as he dealt with off-season illnesses as well as being hit in the head by a pitch in April. Although he never appeared to fully shake off his early season setbacks, Morneau finished the 2005 season second on the Twins in home runs with 22 and paced the squad with 79 RBI. Dominance (2006‚Äì2009) During Morneau's first three seasons with the Twins, he wore #27. Starting in 2006, he wore #33 for the rest of his Twins career. After a slow start to 2006, Morneau exploded offensively in the months of June, July, and August, raising his batting average nearly 50 points in June after beginning the month hitting .240.

He finished the season hitting .321 (6th in the AL) and slugging .559 (6th in AL) with 34 home runs and 130 RBI. He was second in the league in RBIs and tied Larry Walker's 1997 total for the most RBIs in a season by a Canadian. For his hitting, he won the 2006 American League Silver Slugger Award representing first basemen. His efforts helped the Twins win their fourth division title in five years. On November 21, 2006, Morneau won the American League Most Valuable Player Award in a close vote over Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees, becoming only the fourth player in Twins history (after Zoilo Versalles, Harmon Killebrew, and Rod Carew) to receive the honour. He became the first Canadian to win the AL MVP award, and the second Canadian to win a major league MVP award (Larry Walker was the first, having won the NL MVP Award in 1997; Walker and Morneau were joined in 2010 by Joey Votto). In 2007, Morneau played in 157 games, hitting 31 home runs. In May 2007, Morneau won the Player of the Month in the American League for the first time in his career. Morneau appeared on the cover of the arcade baseball video game The Bigs in Canadian stores and at Best Buy stores in the United States. Morneau was named to the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game roster in 2007 for the first time. He also participated in the 2007 State Farm Home Run Derby for the first time. He was up first and hit 4 homers and ended up tying with Albert Pujols in the first round. He was subsequently eliminated with only one homer on 5 chances in a tie-off. Pujols advanced to the 2nd round with 2 homers. Morneau had his first career three home run game on July 6, 2007, against the Chicago White Sox. He had a solo, a 2-run, and a 3-run homer. He had an at bat to try for his fourth home run, but his bat got under the ball, and he flew out to deep left field. In January 2008, Morneau agreed to a six- year contract worth $80 million, which at the time was the longest and richest contract in Minnesota Twins history until in 2010, teammate Joe Mauer signed an 8-year, $184 million contract. Morneau produced with his new contract, as he played in all 162 of the Twins' games and hit .300 with 23 home runs and 129 RBI. On July 10, 2008, Morneau tied a career high with 5 hits in a game as the visiting Minnesota Twins defeated the Detroit Tigers. He hit what went on to be the game-winning home run to finish the day 5 for 5 with a walk in a 7‚Äì6 extra-innings win. Morneau was then announced as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Morneau won the 2008 Home Run Derby, defeating Josh Hamilton of the Texas Rangers. He became the first Canadian to win the Home Run Derby. Later during the All-Star event, Morneau scored the winning run for the American League in the MLB All Star Game at Yankee Stadium on a sacrifice fly to right field off the bat of Michael Young. Morneau was awarded the Lionel Conacher Award as the Canadian Press Male Athlete of the Year, joining Ferguson Jenkins and Larry Walker as the only Major League Baseball players to win the award. Morneau finished second in the balloting for AL MVP, as Dustin Pedroia won, and Kevin Youkilis came in third. In 2009, Morneau hit 30 home runs and was selected as a reserve position player at first base for the 2009 All Star Game. On September 14, Morneau was officially diagnosed with a stress fracture in his back after a long slump; he missed the rest of the 2009 season and the playoffs. Injuries and struggles (2010‚Äì2013) Morneau got off to a strong start in the 2010 campaign, hitting a career first-half high .345 batting average and having a major-league leading .437 on-base percentage and .617 slugging percentage at the All-Star break. For the first time in his career, he was voted in by the fans to start the 2010 All-Star Game at first base, but ended up pulling out from the event after sustaining a concussion on July 7. Morneau missed the remainder of the 2010 regular season with the effects of post- concussion syndrome. After the Twins clinched the American League Central Division championship, Morneau said that he was finally symptom-free. Morneau said he would be unavailable for the ALDS, but that he hoped to be available for the ALCS should the Twins advance. On October 4, 2010, the Twins announced that Morneau would not return for the 2010 season, regardless of how far the team went in the postseason. In 2011, the Twins were glad to see Morneau somewhat recovered from his season-ending concussion in the previous season. He was in the Opening Day starting line-up against the Toronto Blue Jays. This did not last long, though, as he missed five games with the flu later in April and a couple of games in June with a sore wrist. He underwent neck surgery in June to correct pinched nerves in his neck, causing him to miss two months from mid-June to mid-August. Just ten days later, he missed two games with a bruised foot. On August 29, 2011, Morneau suffered a left shoulder injury that would lead to mild concussion-like symptoms. These symptoms eventually led to Morneau missing the remainder of the season. In 2011, Morneau appeared in just 69 games collecting just 60 hits, only four of them home runs. He batted a meager .227 with 19 walks and 30 RBI. All of the previous are career lows disregarding his rookie season. In 2012, Morneau returned as an everyday first baseman for the Twins. Appearing in 134 games, Morneau finished the season with a .257 batting average, 19 home runs and 77 RBI. In 2013, before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 31, Morneau played in 127 games for the Twins. He had nearly matched his total stats for 2012, batting .259 with 17 home runs and 74 RBI. =Pittsburgh Pirates (2013)= On August 31, 2013, Morneau was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Alex Presley and a player to be named later,Pirates Acquire Morneau who was later identified as Duke Welker on October 5, 2013. On September 1, 2013 he made his debut with the Pirates, playing first base and wearing number 66. Morneau wore number 33 in Minnesota, but due to number being retired in Pittsburgh (in honor of Honus Wagner), he simply decided to double it. =Colorado Rockies (2014‚Äì2015)= Morneau batting with the Colorado Rockies On December 3, 2013, Morneau agreed to a 2-year, $14 million deal with the Colorado Rockies, pending a physical. The deal became official on December 13. Morneau became the first Rockies player since Larry Walker to wear #33 as it had been out of circulation, but not retired for Walker since he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2004. Morneau went on to have a solid year in Colorado, batting .319 on the season and claiming the National League battle title. Morneau had a .310 batting average in 49 games with the Rockies in 2015. =Chicago White Sox (2016)= On June 9, 2016, Morneau signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Chicago White Sox.

Front office and broadcasting After playing for Canada in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, but spending the 2017 MLB Season as a free agent, Morneau took a job as a special assistant to the Minnesota Twins, functionally ending his playing career. His current roles as special assistant include player drafting and development, spring training instruction, and community outreach. He also serves as a television analyst for the Twins on Fox Sports North, becoming the team's primary analyst for the 2020 season. International career Morneau was selected for the Canada national baseball team at the 2006 World Baseball Classic, 2009 World Baseball Classic, 2013 World Baseball Classic, 2017 World Baseball Classic and 2019 WBSC Premier12. Morneau was also selected for the MLB-All-Stars at the 2014 MLB Japan All-Star Series. Personal life Baseball diamond #5 in Moody Park was named Justin Morneau Field in honor of Morneau on February 2, 2008. =Early Childhood= Morneau's parents divorced when he was 7 years old. His mother is a retired teacher and his father works in a warehouse. He has an older brother named Geordie. His mother remarried in 2006 and now Justin has two stepsisters. =Marriage & Children= Morneau married Minnesota native Krista Martin on January 10th, 2009 at Landmark Center in St. Paul, Minnesota. The couple has five children. Morneau purchased a house in his hometown of New Westminster. His house is just four blocks from Queen's Park, where he grew up playing hockey and baseball. As a homesick minor leaguer in Florida, he would log onto a Vancouver radio station online to hear the weather and traffic reports and wonder what his friends were up to back home. Morneau's family is well known in New Westminster. On February 2, 2008, the city honored him by renaming Moody Park Diamond #5 to Justin Morneau Field.http://www.eteamz.com/newwestbaseball/images/JMF_Front_photo.jpg Morneau Field is located just from a field named for one of Morneau's idols, Larry Walker Field, located in the nearby city of Maple Ridge. Morneau is superstitious. For much of his career, he wore number 33 to honor his idol, former NHL goaltender Patrick Roy. As a young hockey player, he would refuse to leave the car for hockey games until the clock read :33 minutes past the hour. (He actually appears as an Easter egg in the NHL video game, NHL 2K8, playing his junior position of goaltender.) Morneau had a superstitious routine on game days in Minnesota. Before each home game, Morneau stopped by the same Jimmy John's Gourmet Subs, on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, Minnesota and ordered the same sandwich from the menu: Turkey Tom with no sprouts. Later, he drank a slurpee from a slurpee machine in the Twins' clubhouse made of one- half Mountain Dew, one-half red or orange flavor. The Justin Morneau Foundation was established by Morneau himself and his wife, Krista, to support underprivileged communities with an emphasis on those where the Morneaus have lived. Over a span of four years, (2008‚Äì2011) Morneau mailed more than 200 personalized holiday gifts to Twins employees, including the Target Field grounds crew.

Hacker was founded in 1417, 99 years before the enactment of the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516. As one of six breweries located within Munich's city limits, its beers are among those served at Oktoberfest. History In the late 18th century, Joseph Pschorr (1770-1841) bought the Hacker brewery from his father-in-law Peter-Paul Hacker. He subsequently founded a separate brewery under his own name. His two sons, Georg Pschorr (1798-1867) and Matthias Pschorr Sr., divided his estate by each taking control of one of the two separate breweries. In 1972, Hacker and Pschorr merged to form Hacker-Pschorr, but the beers were sold as separate brands well after 1975. When Crown Prince Ludwig I of Bavaria was to celebrate his wedding in Munich in 1810, he decided it was an occasion for all of Bavaria to celebrate. He commissioned Josef Pschorr, then the brewmaster of the Hacker- Pschorr brewery, among other Munich brewers, to develop special brews to commemorate the occasion. A young woman serves litre-sized glass mugs (Ma√ükr√ºge) of Hacker-Pschorr beer during the 2011 Oktoberfest. Subsequent annual celebrations evolved into the city of Munich‚Äôs Oktoberfest, which is attended by over six million people each year, who in 2011 consumed over six million litres of beer. By Munich law, only the six breweries within the city limits of Munich are invited to serve their beer at Oktoberfest. Hacker- Pschorr is one of the six, as is its sister brand, Paulaner. Today‚Äôs event is held on land donated by Josef Pschorr. Prior to 2009, Hacker-Pschorr was imported to the U.S. via Star Brand Imports, based in White Plains, New York and part of Heineken International.Star Brand Imports In 2009, Paulaner HP USA (formerly Distinguished Brands), of Littleton, Colorado, took over the import business of Hacker-Pschorr and Paulaner in the United States.

The picture was directed by John Cromwell and written by Steve Fisher and Oliver H.P. Garrett based on a story by Gerald Drayson Adams and Sidney Biddell, adapted by Allen Rivkin. Plot Lizabeth Scott in Dead Reckoning (1947) Leaving a church, Father Logan, a well known ex-paratrooper padre, is approached by Captain \\"Rip\\" Murdock (Humphrey Bogart). Murdock needs to tell someone what has happened to him in the past few days in case his enemies get to him. A flashback follows. Just after World War II, paratroopers and close friends Captain Murdock and Sergeant Johnny Drake (William Prince) are mysteriously ordered to travel from Paris to Washington, D.C. When Drake learns that he is to be awarded the Medal of Honor (and Murdock the Distinguished Service Cross), he disappears before newspaper photographers can take his picture. Murdock goes AWOL, follows the clues and tracks his friend to Gulf City in the southern United States, where he learns Drake is dead - his burned corpse is recovered from a car crash. Murdock finds out that Drake joined the Army under an assumed name to avoid a murder charge. He was accused of killing a rich old man named Chandler because he was in love with his beautiful young wife Coral (Lizabeth Scott). Murdock goes to a nightclub to question Louis Ord (George Chandler), a witness in the murder trial. Ord reveals that Drake had given him a letter for Murdock. Murdock also meets Coral and Martinelli (Morris Carnovsky), the club owner, there. Seeing Coral losing heavily at roulette, Murdock not only recoups her losses at craps, he wins her $16,000. For some reason, however, she is uncomfortable with the situation. When they go to collect the money in Martinelli's private office, Murdock accepts a drink; it is drugged. When he wakes up the next morning, he finds Ord's dead body planted in his hotel room. He manages to hide the corpse before police Lieutenant Kincaid (Charles Cane), responding to an anonymous tip, shows up to search his room. Murdock teams up with Coral. Suspecting that Martinelli had Ord killed in order to get the letter, Murdock breaks into his office, only to find the safe already open. Just before he is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant, he smells jasmine, the same aroma as Coral's perfume. When Murdock awakens, Martinelli has him roughed up by his thug, Krause (Marvin Miller), to try to find out what is in the coded letter. However, Murdock is able to escape his captors when taking him back to his hotel, the police arrive. The flashback ends, and Murdock slips away. Now suspicious of Coral, he goes to her apartment to confront her. She claims to be innocent, but finally admits that she shot her husband in self-defense. She went to Martinelli for advice and gave him the murder weapon to dispose of, but he has been blackmailing her ever since. In love with her himself, Murdock agrees to leave town with her, but insists on retrieving the incriminating weapon first, despite Coral's objections. He threatens Martinelli with a gun, eliciting some startling revelations. The club owner reveals that Coral is his wife. He killed Chandler (having learned the man had lied about having only six months to live) and framed Drake so that Coral could inherit the estate. Murdock gets what he came for and forces Martinelli to precede him out of the building. As he opens the door, Martinelli is shot and killed. Murdock jumps into the waiting car and drives off with Coral. As they are speeding away, he accuses her of having just tried to kill him. When she shoots him, the car crashes. He survives, but she suffers fatal injuries. In the hospital, Murdock comforts her in her final moments. Cast * Humphrey Bogart as Capt.

Simpson (uncredited) * Ruby Dandridge as Hyacinth (uncredited) Production Dead Reckoning was originally intended by Columbia Pictures' production chief Harry Cohn as a vehicle for Rita Hayworth, a follow-up to the extremely popular Gilda. Cohn thought that the pairing of Hayworth and Bogart would be a guaranteed money maker. Hayworth, however, was in the middle of a contract dispute with Columbia, and could not come to contractual terms with Columbia. Hayworth refused to make the film, so she was replaced by Lizabeth Scott, who was borrowed from Paramount Pictures' producer Hal Wallis. Scott, an up-and-coming actress being promoted as \\"The Threat\\", was often compared to Bogart's wife, Lauren Bacall, as both were former models, and had deep, sultry voices. Bogart was a loan-out from Warners as well, and was reportedly unhappy with being sent to Columbia at the height of his career, if only because Warners kept any extra money paid by Columbia over and above Bogart's usual salary.Muller, Eddie (May 26, 2020) Intro to the Turner Classic Movies presentation of the film Bogart had right of refusal over the director for the film, and picked John Cromwell. Bogart and Cromwell had worked together on Broadway when Bogart was a very young actor and Cromwell, the play's director, cast him in his first bit part in 1922.\\"Drifting\\" on Internet Broadway Database Bogart was responsible for Murdock's extended speech to Scott about men carrying women around in their pockets, taking them out when they were needed to have dinner with or make love to. This idea was one that Bogart was known to espouse when he had been drinking.Muller, Eddie (May 26, 2020) Outro to the Turner Classic Movies presentation of the film The song \\"Either It's Love or It Isn't\\", sung by Lizabeth Scott, had words and music by Allan Roberts and Doris Fisher. Many of Dead Reckoning's exterior shots were filmed on location in St. Petersburg, Florida. Other background and location shooting took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; LaGuardia Airport in New York City; and Biloxi, Mississippi. Reception =Critical response= The New York Times gave the film a mixed review, praising Bogart as \\"beyond criticism in a role such as Dead Reckoning affords him\\", with \\"some of the best all-around dialogue he has had in a long time.\\" However, it was less kind to his co-star, Scott, \\"whose face is expressionless and whose movements are awkward and deliberate.\\" Although the actions of Bogart's character are not particularly plausible at times, and the plot was considered to be \\"rambling\\" with \\"a lot of things about the script ... that an attentive spectator might find disconcerting,\\" the Times' found that \\"the suspense is skillfully drawn out.\\"Sterritt, David (ndg) \\"Dead Reckoning (1947)\\" (article) TCM.com Variety magazine also praised Bogart and liked the film, writing, \\"Humphrey Bogart's typically tense performance raises this average whodunit quite a few notches. Film has good suspense and action, and some smart direction and photography ... Bogart absorbs one's interest from the start as a tough, quick-thinking ex-skyjumper. Lizabeth Scott stumbles occasionally as a nitery singer, but on the whole gives a persuasive sirenish performance.\\"Staff (December 31, 1946) \\"Dead Reckoning\\" (review). Variety. Accessed July 17, 2013. In 2004, film critic Dennis Schwartz was critical of the film. He wrote, \\"This second-rate Bogart vehicle has the star depart from his usual tough-guy role, though he manages to get into plenty of the action. It plays as a bleak crime melodrama that is too complexly plotted for its own good ... There's some fun in watching the Bogart character romance the husky-voiced femme fatale character played by Lizabeth Scott, but not enough fun to overcome how unconvincing is the sinister plot.\\"Schwartz, Dennis (November 2, 2004) \\"Dead Reckoning (1947)\\" (review) Ozus' World Movie Reviews. Accessed July 17, 2013. Time Out calls Scott \\"synthetic\\" but \\"alluring\\", and detects a \\"hint of self-parody\\" in Bogart's performance. It says that their \\"relationship never quite convinces, leading to a faintly embarrassing emotional climax.\\" The film, according to the reviewer, \\"tries too hard to maintain its note of doomed noir romance,\\" but is nevertheless \\"[h]ighly enjoyable\\".Staff (ndg} \\"Dead Reckoning\\" (review) Time Out References External links   Dead Reckoning information site and DVD review at DVD Beaver (includes images) * Category:1947 films Category:1947 mystery films Category:American black-and- white films Category:American films Category:American mystery films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Film noir Category:Films directed by John Cromwell ","title":"Dead Reckoning (1947 film)"},{"id":"1918680","text":"Le Petit Robert is a popular single-volume French dictionary first published by Paul Robert in 1967.

The first sequel to the 1978 film Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, the film stars Anthony Starke, Karen Mistal, and John Astin, as well as George Clooney in an early role. The film has developed a cult following. Plot Set ten years after the events of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (referred to as the \\"Great Tomato War\\"), the United States is once again safe, and tomatoes have been outlawed (although authorities still deal with \\"tomato smugglers\\" who sell to people who cannot live without ordinary tomatoes). Wilbur Finletter (Steve Peace) has been praised as a hero of the Great Tomato War and parlayed his fame into opening Finletter's Pizzeria, which serves tomato-less pizzas. Working for Wilbur is his nephew Chad Finletter (Anthony Starke) who is a delivery boy. Also with Chad is his roommate Matt Stevens (George Clooney), a suave ladies' man. However, trouble returns with a misanthropic villain, Professor Mortimer Gangreen (played by John Astin) and his assistant Igor (Steve Lundquist - who also is an Olympic swimming gold medalist) seek to unleash another wave of tomato terror. Professor Gangreen was perplexed at being defeated by \\"Puberty Love\\", the worst song ever created, and says that this time music will aid, rather than hinder him. Gangreen has created a tomato transformation chamber by which he can turn ordinary tomatoes into replicas of men and women. By dipping ordinary tomatoes into vats of toxic waste and then placing them into the chamber, Gangreen uses music to his advantage, as the juke box that is hooked up to the chamber syncs up with the tomato transformation chamber, allowing him to create virtually anything by the use of whatever song he has picked (Michael Jackson music seems to make tomatoes into a clone of Jackson, the Miami Vice theme seems to make replicas of Don Johnson and seductive music apparently turns tomatoes into beautiful women). Gangreen's preferred music is rock, which creates soldiers. With his tomato commandos, Professor Gangreen seeks to attack the nearby prison where he will break out his imprisoned ally Jim Richardson (Rick Rockwell), then take over the United States under the subjugation of his killer tomatoes and installing Richardson as President of the United States. Gangreen has also used his device to create an attractive female replica named Tara (Karen Mistal), who serves Gangreen (as she straightforwardly informs a visitor: \\"I'm his lover. I also cook and clean.\\") until she realizes his abusive attitude towards a wrongly mutated tomato whom she dubs FT, or Fuzzy Tomato. Tara defects to Finletter's Pizza where she starts dating Chad. The quirky plot line partially breaks the \\"fourth wall\\" as the characters relate to the audience that the production has run out of money. Matt suggests \\"product placement\\" ‚Äì at that time an emerging practice in film and television ‚Äì as a solution for the financial problems. From that point forward, the film's characters comically showcase and promote various products as the film's plot line continues. Chad and Tara have a whirlwind romance where everything seems to be going magically except for Tara's strange behavior and extreme aversion to any form of music. Chad's dislike of tomatoes eventually causes a rift between himself and Tara and after an extremely caustic remark at a romantic dinner Tara dumps a drink in Chad's lap in retaliation. While Chad is in the bathroom cleaning up a violinist comes by and begins to play for Tara, who changes back into a tomato. Panic ensues and the restaurant empties as the other patrons flee in terror at the sight of the tomato. The sound of a chiming grandfather clock turns her back into a human as Chad returns to the now-deserted restaurant and they leave. Tara continues to protect FT while living with Chad (and Matt). Chad notices the garbage truck Igor is driving while Igor tries to find Tara and follows it to the dump (where Igor picks up more toxic waste) and back to Dr. Gangreen's house where Chad watches as they transform a tomato into a person. Going home Chad finds Tara consuming plant food‚Äîthey both scream and she runs away, only to be kidnapped by Igor and returned to Dr. Gangreen. Chad, who has found a tomato at a grocery store he believes to be Tara, returns with Matt to use Dr. Gangreen's equipment to restore the woman he loves. They find the machine can create a wide range of people depending on the music used, including more beautiful women (of great interest to Matt) but they do not get Tara back. They are captured by Dr. Gangreen who squishes the tomato and has Igor throw Chad and Matt into the dungeon. There they find Tara undamaged and in human form and she and Chad reconcile. Outside the locked door they hear FT, to whom they pass a message that FT is to deliver to Wilbur who gathers the team of heroes from the first movie to rescue the captives. But while they are en route Dr. Gangreen forces Chad and Matt into the transformation chamber and starts a countdown that at the end will transform the two into tomatoes. He and Igor then leave with a captive Tara to raid the prison and start Dr. Gangreen's plan for world domination but Wilbur and his team rescue them just in time. At the prison Dr. Gangreene transforms a bag of tomatoes into a massively-muscled and well-armed assault team and they storm the prison. While fighting Tara breaks away and Gangreen and Igor chase her, who are in turn chased by Chad, Matt, Wilbur and the others. They find Gangreen and Igor have imprisoned Tara in a gas chamber and threaten to gas her if the pursuers do not surrender. Also Igor has a hand grenade. In the ensuing fight FT throws himself on the live hand grenade before it explodes and Gangreen successfully triggers the gas. As the fumes envelope Tara behind the door she and Chad have a tearful farewell and it appears Tara is finished. Matt presses a button to clear the gas from the chamber. A distraught Chad opens the door to find an unharmed Tara; she isn't human so the gas didn't hurt her. Dr. Gangreen triumphantly plays music to transform Tara back into a tomato but nothing happens; exposure to the gas has made Tara permanently human. The town celebrates the heroes again, including and especially FT, as people wonder where Matt went and it is remarked that he returned to Gangreen's lab to destroy it but he instead is using the equipment to produce beautiful women.

Rick Rockwell, who played Jim Richardson, later would appear on the TV show Who Wants to Marry a Multi- millionaire?. Poster The art for the poster, shown above, was created by then illustrator now portrait painter, David R. Darrow, now living in San Jose, CA. The original design as assigned by designer Kevin Eaton and completed by Darrow, used the design of a Campbell's Soup can, using the face of actor John Astin in the center seal. The idea was sidelined over copyright / branding concerns, and a \\"patch\\" was created to alter the work. High-end digital compositing was too expensive at the time, so Darrow was further commissioned to create the new replacement label which was physically glued over the original illustration, preserving the original background and tomato characters. Darrow still retains the original, 2-layer artwork. Reception According to IMDb it grossed $5 million in U.S. sales. Out of the more unfavorable reviews, TV Guide described the film as being a \\"unnecessary sequel\\" and Emanuel Levy gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5, while other reviews were more favorable. JoBlo.com reviewer Jason Adams wrote, \\"The zany, self-referential style lends itself to a unending stream of gags, and overall more jokes work than don't.\\" VultureHound's Lee Hazell wrote that \\"Return of the Killer Tomatoes has everything a comedy like this needs. An irreverent attitude towards filmmaking conventions, genre expectations and downright decency. The manic energy of the Marx Brothers. The wilfully gleeful stupidity of the Zucker films. The playfulness of Mel Brooks. The only thing they don‚Äôt have is action scenes with murderous tomatoes. For some reason, the plot dictates that they all get turned into Chippendales with machine guns. So that takes off a point.\\" DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner wrote, \\"Its hyper-meta sense of humor was years (maybe approaching decades) before its time. Return of the Killer Tomatoes doesn't just break the fourth wall; it grinds it into a fine powder, mixes it with some hardwood mulch, and lets all manner of comedy and humor blossom from there\\". Chris Coffel, writing for Bloody Disgusting, in review of the Blu-ray edition of the film, wrote, \\"Return of the Killer Tomatoes has so many great jokes and little tidbits that you can‚Äôt possibly catch them in one viewing. It‚Äôs similar to The Simpsons in not only the level of humor it provides but that it‚Äôs a movie made for the VHS generation.\\" Anthony Arrigo, reviewing the same edition for Dread Central, called the film a \\"zany riot. [...] Think the output of Zucker/Abrams back in their heyday, add a dose of Mel Brooks‚Äô humor, and that's the direction for this sequel to the equally absurd Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (1978). One liners and sight gags fly with such frequency that it's almost impossible to hear and see every joke the first time around. [...] few films have ever taken comedy this meta. The actors don't break the fourth wall; the film itself breaks it!\\"  References  External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20160305041853/http://killertomatoes.com/return- of-the-killer-tomatoes/ (fan site) Category:1988 films Category:1980s comedy horror films Category:American films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American satirical films Category:American sequel films Category:Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Category:New World Pictures films Category:1980s parody films Category:Parodies of horror Category:1980s satirical films Category:1988 comedy films ","title":"Return of the Killer Tomatoes"},{"id":"1918688","text":"CDnow, Inc. was a dot-com company that operated an online shopping website selling compact discs and music-related products.

In 1997, the company had revenues of $18 million and in February 1998, with 100 employees, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. CDNow then embarked on a large Internet advertising campaign, and was an innovator in preference-based retail recommendations, online video, the use of editorial content as a means to promote interest internet affiliate marketing programs, and email marketing. On March 17, 1999, CDNow acquired its largest competitor, another Philadelphia area company, N2K, whose online properties included Music Boulevard and Jazz Central Station In July 1999, the company announced a deal to merge with Columbia House, establishing a new public company jointly held by CDNow's shareholders, Time Warner and Sony.  Decline  CDNow was among the first of the Internet companies to show signs of struggle with the dot-com business model. On March 20, 2000, as the dot-com bubble burst, Barron's published a cover article called \\"Burning Up\\", which noted that the company was running out of cash. In March 2000, the Columbia House merger was called off. In June 2000, the company closed its London office to cut costs. In July 2000, Bertelsmann Music Group acquired the company, intending to combine it with its BMG Direct record club as a new venture called BeMusic, and eventually add Napster to the service. Bertelsmann paid just $117 million, a price that was down over 90% from the valuation of the company at its peak in April 1998. The founding Olim brothers received a total of $17 million. In April 2001, the company cut 40 employees, 10% of its staff. In August 2001, the company closed its Japanese website and laid off 200 employees. In November 2002, Bertelsmann announced it would close CDnow's Fort Washington facility and lay off the company's remaining 33 employees. Later that month, they signed a deal to outsource CDnow website operations to Amazon. The new deal retained a revised version of the BMG Direct model called the \\"Preferred Buyers Club\\", offering a 20% discount for club-edition records; all other music was sold at standard Amazon prices. In 2011, the CDnow.com URL was redirected to a maintenance notice, and in 2013, it was permanently taken offline.

Two bridges span the two narrowest points across the strait The Euripus Strait (From Ancient Greek Œï·ΩîœÅŒπœÄŒøœÇ; R. S. P. Beekes has rejected previous Indo- European derivations and suggested a Pre-Greek one (Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 482). ) is a narrow channel of water separating the Greek island of Euboea in the Aegean Sea from Boeotia in mainland Greece. The strait's principal port is Chalcis on Euboea, located at the strait's narrowest point. The strait is subject to strong tidal currents which reverse direction approximately four times a day. Tidal flows are very weak in the Eastern Mediterranean, but the strait is a remarkable exception. Water flow peaks at about , either northwards or southwards, and lesser vessels are often incapable of sailing against it. When nearing flow reversal, sailing is even more precarious because of vortex formation. The Swiss scholar Fran√ßois- Alphonse Forel contributed to an understanding of the enigmatic phenomenon by his study of limnology and the discovery of seiche, where layers of water of differing temperature oscillate in thickness in a confined body of water. But the problem was solved completely only by D. Eginitis, director of the Athens Observatory, who published his conclusions in 1929. See also the commentary about this explanation in  Bridges  There are two road bridges across the strait, both at Chalcis. One is the Euripus Bridge or Chalcis Bridge, a two- pylon, cable-suspended bridge built south of town in 1992, and commonly called the \\"New\\" or \\"High\\" bridge, with a span of about 215 m (705 ft). The strait is 160 m (525 ft) wide at this point. The bridge is accessible via a fork on the main road at Aulis. The \\"Old\\" or \\"Low\\" or \\"Sliding\\" Bridge lies across midtown, and can slide away to allow shipping traffic. It is located at the narrowest point of the strait, where it is only 38 m (125 ft) wide. It accommodates two lanes of vehicular traffic. It was originally built as a retractable bridge in 1858, replaced by a rotating one in 1896. The existing, originally wooden bridge was built in 1962 and was extensively refurbished in 1998.  History  The current consensus is that the Euripus was closed by a dike of coarse sediment until about 6000 years ago.Kambouroglou, Evangelos, Hampik Maroukian, Adamantios Sampson, \\"Coastal Evolution North and South of Khalkis (Euboea) in the last 5000 Years,\\" Archaeology of Coastal Changes: Proceedings of the First International Symposium \\"Cities on the Sea‚ÄîPast and Present\\" (BAR International Series 404) 1988. Pp. 71‚Äì79. It was opened following an (unrecorded) earthquake and remained open (see Herodotus, e.a. VII.173 and VIII.66, on the sea-battle of Artemision) until 411 BC, when the Euboeans decided to renounce their status as an island subject to Athenian hegemony and make themselves part of Boeotia (Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 13.47, sections 1‚Äì8). There is no trace of this either in Thucydides or in Xenophon (in History of the Peloponnesian War and in Hellenica respectively.) Diodorus mentions specifically that gaps had to be left in the dike to allow the Euripus tides to flow through and that the current became much more intense owing to the narrowness of the passage and says that a single passage was left just wide enough for a single ship. Strabo (IX.2.2) wrote of some later time when there was a bridge two plethra long (approximately 50 m, which is probably an exaggeration). Some vestiges of the two ends of the dike of 411 probably remained, so that this later bridge was probably narrower than the channel that existed before 411 BC. We have no information about the depth, but even in the case of a channel about 50 m wide under Strabo's bridge, the depth could have been scoured out to a level entirely sufficient for ancient shipping. It is not until the time of the Emperor Justinian I, that we have evidence of two channels in the Euripus, the large original channel and a new, narrow cleft to the east of it, so narrow that it could be crossed on a plank of wood. (Procopius, On the Buildings, 4.3.16.) This later stream is what was eventually widened to make the present shipping channel. At the time when Procopius wrote, the name of the fortress on the Euripus was probably \\"Euripus,\\" which had become \\"Egripos\\" by 1204, and was adopted and slightly altered to \\"Nigriponte\\" by the Latins who occupied the place in 1205. (The name has nothing to do with any sort of \\"Black Bridge,\\" except as a Veronese or Venetian joke, or folk-etymological corruption or re-interpretation in reference to the old bridge across the channel.) The Venetian tower and bridge over the Euripus, in the 19th century In 1395, Nicola di Martoni came to Negropont during the return from his pilgrimage to Egypt and Palestine.Leon Legrand, ed. \\"Relation du p√©lerinage √† J√©rusalem de Nicolas de Martoni, notaire italien,\\" Revue de l'Orient Latin 3: (1895) 566‚Äì669, (564‚Äì55); recently reedited in Studium Biblicum Francescanum, Collectio Major, 42) He is clear that the main shipping channel in the Venetian period was on the side of the Boeotian mainland, and mentions the mills on the narrower channel, which he says were sometimes broken in the speed and turbulence of the flow there. We have further information about the shipping channel and its single wooden bridge from various documents in the archives of the Venetian Empire. In 1408, the formation of a reef under the bridge severely affected shipping (http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/divenire/collezioni.htm Senato, Deliberazioni, Misti. 48,43v) and in 1439 there was concern over the tendency of the current to erode the surroundings of the pilings that supported the bridge (http://www.archiviodistatovenezia.it/divenire/collezioni.htm Senato, Deliberazioni, Misti. 60,140r‚Äì42r).Transcripts in C.

Evliya √áelebi, in his Travel Journal (SN VIII250a27, ff.), tells us that the narrow channel was first opened out enough for a galley to pass through at some time in the late 16th century, and was still just barely wide enough at the time of his visit in 1668 for a galley to squeeze through, even though the old shipping channel had been abandoned. By the end of the 18th century it was well on its way to being the width of the modern channel.

However it is more generally accepted that the Lyons descend from a French family called de L√©on. At the end of the eleventh century the de Leons had come north with Edgar, son of Malcolm III of Scotland to fight against his uncle, Donald Bane. Edgar was victorious and the de Leons received lands that were later called Glen Lyon in Perthshire.

Lyon was also granted the barony of Kinghorn, however he was later killed in a quarrel with Sir James Lindsay of Crawford. Sir John Lyon's son, another John Lyon further strengthened the royal ties by marrying a granddaughter of Robert II. John's son, Patrick Lyon was created Lord Glamis in 1445. He became Master of the Household of Scotland and a Privy Councillor. He had previously been sent to England as a hostage in 1424 for the ransom of James I of Scotland. John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis was a quarrelsome man with a quick temper. He married Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis, granddaughter of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus who was known as Bell the Cat, and after Douglas died she suffered terribly for the hatred that James V of Scotland had towards all of the name of Douglas. Lady Glamis was accused of witchcraft and despite speaking boldly in her own defense, she was burnt at the stake on castle hill in Edinburgh on 3 December 1540. Her young son was also sentenced to death when he came of age, however the king died before he had grown up and so he avoided the death sentence and was released. The king had taken possession of Glamis Castle and plundered it. John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis renounced his allegiance to Mary, Queen of Scots and served under the Regents Moray and Lennox. The 8th Lord was made Lord Chancellor of Scotland and also Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. The 9th Lord Glamis was captain of the Royal Guard and a Privy Councillor to James VI of Scotland. He was created Earl of Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis in 1606. =17th century and Civil War= Glamis Castle, seat of clan Lyon John Lyon, 2nd Earl of Kinghorne was a close personal friend of James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose. Lyon was with Montrose in 1638 when he subscribed to the National Covenant. Lyon accompanied Montrose on his early campaigns in defense of the Covenant, however he did not support him when he chose to fight for Charles I of England. As a result, Lyon's estates were almost ruined for supporting the Army of the Covenant. Patrick Lyon, 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne paid off the debts that he had inherited from his father and was later able to enlarge Glamis Castle. =18th century and Jacobite risings= The 3rd Earl's son, John Lyon, 4th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne was a member of the Privy Council but opposed the 1707 Treaty of Union. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, his son was a Jacobite who fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir and died defending his regiment's colours. James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender) stayed at Glamis in 1716 and amongst the relics of the castle today are a sword and watch that belonged to him. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Duke of Cumberland stayed at Glamis on his march to the Battle of Culloden, but it is said that he was much less welcome.

With start-up investments you sow your seeds and the harvest could take two or three years, but in the end it will always come. Perhaps that's what confuses the investors. They see wagon-loads of produce and they run to sow, but they cannot see when the harvest will come.

It is mainly known for steel manufacturing, centered on the Nyby Bruk steel mill, and also for its historic old town centre. Because of its historic town status, from 1317 to 1971, Torsh√§lla is customarily referred to as a stad (town or city) even though it does not have a population of 10,000, which is the limit presently in use defined by Statistics Sweden. Before the local government reform of 1971 Torsh√§lla was an independent municipality. A new proposal to detach Torsh√§lla from Eskilstuna Municipality was turned down in a referendum in 2006.  History  = Foundation and early history = Torsh√§lla is one of the oldest towns in Sweden and received city rights as early as 1317 from King Birger. The oldest part of the town church is from the 12th century; however, the church was likely built on top of, or close to, the site of an earlier Old Norse holy place, where the god Thor was worshipped during the Viking Age. The name Torsh√§lla stems from √ûors harg, which means \\"place for sacrificing to Thor\\". The town is located at Eskilstuna√•n's very first rapids upstream of Lake M√§laren, creating a natural trading and reloading site. Several archeological digs have uncovered remains of two (possibly three) \\"strong houses\\", that is, small fortresses or castles, the one on Husberget next to the rapids dating from around 1300 AD. The fortification on Husberget was burned to the ground during the late 14th century. In 1436, during the aftermath of the Engelbrekt Rebellion, Torsh√§lla was plundered by the forces of Lord High Constable of Sweden (later King) Karl Knutsson Bonde, due to siding with the local nobleman Erik Puke's uprising.Sundberg, Ulf. 2002 (1999). Medeltidens svenska krig. Andra upplagan. Stockholm: Hjalmarsson & H√∂gberg. . Torsh√§lla was during the Middle Ages the dominant trading town in Rekarne, the northwestern part of S√∂dermanland County, which roughly corresponds to present day Eskilstuna Municipality. After neighbouring Eskilstuna was granted town rights in 1659, Torsh√§lla lost in relative importance due to the rapid growth of industry and trade in Eskilstuna, the building of a canal bypassing the rapids in Torsh√§lla, and the great fire which devastated Torsh√§lla in 1798. = Industrial era = The development of Torsh√§lla during the 19th and 20th centuries was greatly influenced by the foundation of an ironworks on the lands of Nyby manor house on the western outskirts of Torsh√§lla. The Nyby Bruk ironworks was founded in 1829 by the silversmith and industrialist Adolf Zethelius. The mill village of Nyby Bruk grew up around the ironworks, forming a symbiotic relationship with the neighbouring town.Alla tiders historia om Nyby Bruk, 1996 Several small tool making and mechanical industries were established in Torsh√§lla during the mid- to late 19th century, using the available water power around the river; Johan Termaenius' mechanical works (1846), F O Nystr√∂m's tin vessel factory (1854), Ali Andersson's Torsh√§lla saw blade factory (1881) and Holmens' foundry & mechanical works (1888).Eskilstunas historia: Torsh√§lla Stad (machine translation) In 1895 the Northern S√∂dermanland Railway was connected to Nyby Bruk, bypassing Torsh√§lla town centre. Passenger traffic on the line was discontinued in 1933 after which the tracks were exclusively used for freight to Nyby.NrSlJ, Norra S√∂dermanlands J√§rnv√§g During the years between 1900 and 1940, Torsh√§lla experienced dwindling population numbers with recession hitting the local manufacturing industry hard. = 1940 - present day = During the decades of economic growth leading up to the 1970s the Nyby Bruk steel mill attracted large numbers of workers from other parts of Sweden and from abroad. A significant part of the immigrant workforce was Finnish, which accounts for the high proportion of Sweden Finnish Torsh√§lla inhabitants today. As part of the local government reform of 1971 Torsh√§lla became part of neighbouring Eskilstuna Municipality with Eskilstuna as the municipal centre. Due to the close proximity of and loss of business to the larger neighbour Eskilstuna, Torsh√§lla has in recent years gradually acquired the character of a picturesque commuter town, while still retaining a significant stainless steel industry. In a referendum concurrent with the elections of 2006, the inhabitants of Eskilstuna Municipality turned down a proposed split of the municipality into two parts, which would have made Torsh√§lla an independent municipality. The result was a 67.5% majority for the status quo. However, Torsh√§lla remains an own administrative division within the municipality, with certain local government duties delegated to the town administration.  Economy  The main industry and private employer in Torsh√§lla is Outokumpu, producing cold rolled stainless steel products at Nyby Bruk. Sports * Torsh√§lla Nyby Idrotts√§llskap (TNIS) is the local soccer team, founded on February 12, 1914, when the existing local teams Torsh√§lla Guif, Nyby Bruk IF and IF √ñstermalms merged and formed Torsh√§lla-Nyby Idrotts√§llskap; TNIS. Soon thereafter Torsh√§lla AIK choose to join the club and March 7 of that year four cooperating sports clubs became TNIS. Initially the club had Guif's red shirts and black pants. Nowadays the team plays in green / black-striped shirts with white pants and green socks. Sights * Bergstr√∂mska g√•rden (Bergstr√∂m House) is a well preserved 18th century merchant loghouse which houses the local history museum.

European route E20 passes south of Torsh√§lla, and the distance by E20 to Stockholm is 71 mi (114 km). Swedish national road 56 passes west of Torsh√§lla, providing road connections to northern and southern Sweden. The old Northern S√∂dermanland Railway connection to the present day main line of Svealandsbanan has since the 1930s only been used for goods traffic. The closest train station is in Eskilstuna, and there are frequent city bus connections to Eskilstuna available. Torsh√§lla boat harbour is reachable by boat from Lake M√§laren through the river Torsh√§lla√•n and is mostly used by leisure boats and tourist boats. The Eskilstuna√•n river, upstream of the now- defunct locks in Torsh√§lla Canal, is only partially navigable, due to the very low clearance under the several fixed bridges which have been built over the river since the 1960s.

This includes hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. In a thyrotoxic crisis it is generally more effective than methimazole. Otherwise it is typically only used when methimazole, surgery, and radioactive iodine is not possible. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include itchiness, hair loss, swelling, vomiting, muscle pains, numbness, and headache. Other severe side effects include liver problems and low blood cell counts. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Propylthiouracil is in the antithyroid family of medications. It works by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland and blocking the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). Propylthiouracil came into medical use in the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Side effects Propylthiouracil is generally well tolerated, with side effects occurring in one of every 100 patients. The most common side effects are related to the skin and include rash, itching, hives, abnormal hair loss, and skin pigmentation. Other common side effects are swelling, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of taste, joint or muscle aches, numbness and headache, allergic reactions, and hair whitening. Its notable side effects include a risk of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. On 3 June 2009, the FDA published an alert \\"notifying healthcare professionals of the risk of serious liver injury, including liver failure and death, with the use of propylthiouracil.\\" As a result, propylthiouracil is no longer recommended in non-pregnant adults and in children as the front line antithyroid medication. One possible side effect is agranulocytosis, a decrease of white blood cells in the blood. Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the clotting of blood, thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat. Another life-threatening side effect is sudden, severe, fulminant liver failure resulting in death or the need for a liver transplantation, which occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil. Unlike agranulocytosis which most commonly occurs in the first three months of therapy, this side effect may occur at any time during treatment. =Pregnancy= Propylthiouracil is classified as Drug Class D in pregnancy. Class D signifies there is positive evidence of human fetal risk. The maternal benefit may outweigh fetal risk in life-threatening situations. PTU is preferred over methimazole (which is also a class D) only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in women who may become pregnant because of the increased risk of teratogenicity of methimazole during critical organogenesis. In the second and third trimester, this risk is diminished and methimazole is preferred to avoid the risk of liver complications from PTU in the mother. The primary effect on the fetus from transplacental passage of PTU is the production of a mild hypothyroidism when the drug is used close to term. This usually resolves within a few days without treatment. The hypothyroid state may be observed as a goiter in the newborn, and is the result of increased levels of fetal pituitary thyrotropin. The incidence of fetal goiter after PTU treatment in reported cases is approximately 12%. Mechanism of action =Thyroid= PTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I‚àí) to iodine (I0), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4).Boron, WF & Boulpaep, EL. 2005. Medical Physiology, Updated Edition. Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA PTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. = T3/T4 target tissues = PTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase (tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase), which converts T4 to the more active form T3. (This is in contrast to methimazole, which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one.) It is important to recognize that these enzymes only work on the conjugated tyrosine molecules of T3 and T4: a completely different enzyme family is responsible for the deiodinase activity of iodized single tyrosine molecules within the thyroid follicular cells. For information on that enzyme family, see Iodotyrosine deiodinase. Pharmacokinetics The administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status may not be achieved until 2‚Äì4 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein- bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However, both are equally transferred across the placenta. The plasma half-life is one hour and is not altered appreciably by the thyroid status of the patient. Due to the concentration in the thyroid, however, dosing intervals may last 8 hours or longer. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation. Chemical synthesis Propylthiouracil can be prepared from ethyl 3-oxohexanoate and thiourea. :500px :  Role in taste  Propylthiouracil, together with phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), are known to have bitter taste. However, it seems the propensity for tasting these compounds is genetically based and the bitter taste is likely to be engendered by the thiocyanate moiety, also present in PTC.

Its primary asset was AirTran Airways until Southwest Airlines acquired AirTran on May 2, 2011.  History  After the large amount of negative publicity surrounding the Flight 592 disaster, ValuJet Airlines suffered serious financial problems. On July 10, 1997, ValuJet announced it would merge with the much smaller Airways Corporation, the owner of Orlando, Florida based AirTran Airways. In November 1997, AirTran Holdings announced it would move its headquarters to Airways' existing headquarters in Orlando from Atlanta; on November 17, 1997, Airways Corporation and ValuJet completed their merger and the name ValuJet was dropped. On January 11, 1999, Joseph Leonard was elected as the chairman, president and chief executive officer of the company. On August 15, 2001, AirTran stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. = Proposed AirTran Holding acquisition of Midwest Air Group = In December 2006, AirTran Holdings made public that in December 2005 it had approached the board of directors of Midwest Air Group‚Äîowner of Midwest Airlines and Skyway Airlines which operates as Midwest Connect‚Äîand had asked the board negotiate a sale of the company. That AirTran offer in 2005 was rebuffed by Midwest's board, which also rebuffed a second offer in late 2006. In December 2006, AirTran disclosed the rejection of both offers in hopes of bringing shareholder pressure on Midwest's board to reconsider, which the board recommended that shareholders reject. On December 13, 2006, AirTran announced that it had made an offer to acquire Midwest Airlines, another operator of the Boeing 717. The offer has since been rejected by the Midwest board. On January 11, 2007, AirTran sweetened its offer for Midwest to $13.25 a share from $11.25 a share, valued at US$290 million, or a 24% premium over Midwest's trading price at the time, and AirTran took its renewed bid directly to Midwest shareholders, bypassing Midwest's board of directors; with an offer that expires on April 11, 2007. On April 2, 2007 AirTran raised its bid to $15 a share, in what CEO Joe Leonard called AirTran's final bid.http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070402/midwest_airtran.html?.v=8 In response to AirTran's overtures, Midwest Air Group has stated publicly that it believes that it can maximize shareholder value as a stand-alone company. Midwest Air Group has said that the latest AirTran proposal rejected by its board of directors significantly undervalued Midwest and did not reflect the long-term opportunity inherent in its strategic growth plan. The company also has reiterated that its strategic business plan will offer superior value to shareholders by capitalizing on current industry conditions while remaining true to Midwest's commitment to customer service excellence. On January 11, 2007, AirTran Holdings increased its bid for Midwest to $345 million in cash and stock, an 18% increase from their previous offer.\\"AirTran Boosts Offer for Midwest Air.\\" ABC News. January 11, 2007. On April 2, 2007, AirTran again raised its bid for Midwest to $389 million in cash and stock ($9 in cash and .5842 shares of AirTran stock totaling $15 a share). CEO Joe Leonard stated that this would be AirTran's final bid. In May 2007, an independent securities expert William McGinnis, CFA, published an analysis of board of directors responsibilities related to hostile takeover offers. He utilized the AirTran offers for Midwest Airlines as the basis for this case study which is available here. AirTran was successful in having its slate of 3 board members elected to the Midwest Air Group's board of directors in the election on June 14, 2007 at the Midwest annual meeting. On August 12, 2007, it was announced that AirTran had lost the bid for Midwest. A private equity group, headed by TPG Capital and including Northwest Airlines, had purchased Midwest and will turn the airline into a privately funded company.\\"Midwest to go private - AirTran spurned; investors, including Northwest, make $16-a-share bid .\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. August 12, 2007. On August 14, 2007, it was announced that AirTran had renewed their bid for Midwest at a price slightly above that of the TPG Capital offer, in theory at the request of Midwest shareholders. Pequot Capital Management, which owns 8.8% of Midwest, had been unhappy with the TPG Capital offer, as they felt that AirTran's cash and stock offer would result in greater gains because they felt AirTran's stock would rise in value once the acquisition of Midwest was completed. An executive at another unnamed investment group also expressed similar misgivings about the TPG Capital offer. TPG Capital's offer had been $16/share in cash, where AirTran's latest offer is $10 cash plus 0.6056 share of AirTran stock for each share of Midwest, which at the close of trading on August 13 made the value of AirTran's new offer approximately $16.25/share in cash and stock.\\"AirTran Circles Back - CEO says Midwest shareholders asked for sweetened bid .\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel August 14, 2007 However, Midwest announced TPG would increase its offer to $17 per share and a definitive agreement had been reached on August 16, 2007. =Acquisition by Southwest Airlines= On September 27, 2010, Southwest Airlines announced it would acquire AirTran Holdings, along with its subsidiary AirTran Airways. The companies operated separately for a period of time until the absorption of the owned and leased aircraft within AirTran's fleet was completed. On May 2, 2011, AirTran Holdings was purchased by Southwest Airlines.bizjournals.com As a result, AirTran Airways and AirTran Holdings both became fully owned subsidiaries of Southwest Airlines.

It was built after the city fire of Trondheim in 1681 to protect the city against attack from the east. Construction was finished in 1685. It fulfilled its purpose in 1718 when Swedish forces laid siege against Trondheim. The fortress was decommissioned in 1816 by king Charles XIV John. Construction Panoramic view Trondheim was traditionally protected with fortifications by the river Nidelven and Skansen, but the city was vulnerable to attack from the east. The Fortress was therefore put on a hill to protect the city centre and control the area from Ila to Lade. General Johan Caspar von Cicignon, who was chief inspector of fortifications, was responsible for the new town plan of Trondheim after the great fire of 18 April 1681. He also made the plans for the construction of Kristiansten Fortress. The fortress was built during the period from 1682 to 1684 and strengthened to a complete defence fortification in 1691 by building an advanced post Kristiandsands bastion in the east and in 1695 with the now vanished M√∏llenberg skanse by the river Nidelven. These fortifications were encircled by a continuous palisade and thereby connected to the fortified city. In 1750 the fortress was modernized with new bastions and casemates to protect against mortar artillery. Two new isolated defensive works were also built to the east - Gr√ºner's and Fr√∏lich's redoubts - but they are hardly visible today.Kristiansten Festning plackard The main building featured in the picture is the defensive tower - Donjonen - with artillery, quartering and stores was the centre of the defences. After decommissioning in 1816 it was location of the fire watch, and since 1997 as a museum. Great Northern War The defensive tower - donjonen. In the final years of the Great Northern War, Karl XII of Sweden initiated a second invasion of Norway in the fall of 1718. While Karl XII led his main army in an attack from the south at Fredrikshald, an army under General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt (or Armfelt) was sent into Tr√∏ndelag to seize Trondheim. Armfeldt advanced against Trondheim, which was defended by an army of 6,900 men under Vincens Budde. The Swedish forces were resisted both by Norwegian forces and by the people of the countryside, who bitterly recalled the previous Swedish occupation of Tr√∏ndelag. Provisions were not available, and the Norwegian winter set in. Although he reached the city and laid siege, the strength of Kristiansten Fortress and other fortifications was such that he chose to retreat toward Verdal. Karl XII issued a sharp rebuke and ordered Armfeldt to take Trondheim. Although Armfeldt's forces surrounded Trondheim, Budde's forces were able to keep him at bay. Camping in the open and poorly fed, many of Armfeldt's troops fell ill and his capable forces were reduced to 4,000 men. When Karl XII was killed in December by a bullet at Fredriksten Fortress, Armfeldt's forces retreated to Sweden. On their way back across the mountains, almost the entire army was lost, mostly because of snow, cold temperature and a strong blizzard; the retreat has been likened to Napoleon‚Äôs from Moscow for the severity of casualties. The 20th century Gun salute on December 4, 2005 celebrating Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway who was born the previous day The Norwegian war flag with the badge denoting the union with Sweden was hauled down on 9 June 1905, and the \\"pure\\" war flag was hoisted instead, with full military honours and gun salutes for both flags. On 18 November 1905 a twenty-one gun salute was again fired from Kristiansten Fortress to proclaim the election of Prince Carl of Denmark as the new King of Norway under the name of Haakon VII of Norway. The flag of union with Sweden was hauled down and the Flag of Norway hoisted. During German occupation of Norway in World War II the Nazis executed a number of Norwegian patriots at Kristiansten. The fortress was the official place of execution of convicted and condemned traitors and war criminals following the legal purge in Norway after World War II. The notorious Henry Rinnan was executed here on 1 February 1947, and nine of his followers afterwards, eight of them on the same day in 1947. View From this fortress you can see \\"strandlinja\\"; a topographical line along the hills of the Bymarka which was formerly beaches and sea cliffs. The \\"line\\" can be seen stretching out in the hills around Trondheim, but is best seen from the fortress, towards By√•sen.The land in Norway is still rebounding from the enormous weight of the glacial ice (isostatic rebound), \\"growing out of the sea\\" with several millimeters a year, especially the eastern part of the country and the inner part of the long fjords, where the ice cover was thickest. This is a slow process, thus the sea covered substantial areas of what is today dry land for thousands of years following the end of the ice age. The sea formerly reached an elevation higher in Trondheim.

It formally ended the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which had begun two years earlier. Background After the Mukden Incident of September 18, 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria, and by February 1932, it had captured the entire region. The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, who was living in exile in the Foreign Concessions in Tianjin, was convinced by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo, which remained under the control of the Imperial Japanese Army. In January 1933, to secure Manchukuo‚Äôs southern borders, a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe. After conquering that province by March, it drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast beyond the Great Wall into Hebei Province. From the start of hostilities, China had appealed to its neighbors and the international community but received no effective support.Kitchen, p. 140‚Äì141. When China called an emergency meeting of the League of Nations, a committee was established to investigate the affair. The Lytton Commission's report ultimately condemned Japan's actions but offered no plan for intervention. In response, the Japanese simply withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.Van Ginneken, p. 115. The Japanese army was under explicit instructions from Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who wanted a quick end to the China conflict, not to venture beyond the Great Wall.http://www.republicanchina.org/war.htm#Chang-Cheng-Zhi-Zhan Battles of the Great Wall Its negotiating position was very strong, as the Chinese republicans were under severe pressure from their simultaneous full- scale civil war with the Chinese communists. Negotiations On May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to negotiate the end of the conflict. The Japanese demands were severe: a demilitarized zone extending 100 km south of the Great Wall from Beijing to Tianjin was to be created, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the demilitarized zone although the Japanese were allowed to use reconnaissance aircraft or ground patrols to ensure that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a lightly- armed Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps. Two secret clauses excluded any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from the Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any disputes that could not be resolved by the Peace Preservation Corps to be settled by agreement between the Japanese and the Chinese governments. Harried by their civil war with the communists and unable to win international support, Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese government agreed to virtually all of Japan's demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the discredited Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.Fenby, p. 282. Aftermath Area demilitarized by the Tanggu Truce The Tanggu Truce resulted in the de facto recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomintang government and acknowledgement of the loss of Rehe.Bix, p. 272. It provided for a temporary end to the combat between China and Japan and relations between the two countries briefly improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was raised to the status of embassy, and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang Kai-shek time to consolidate his forces and to concentrate his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, albeit at the expense of northern China. However, Chinese public opinion was hostile to terms so favorable to Japan and so humiliating to China. Although the truce provided for a demilitarized buffer zone, Japanese territorial ambitions towards China remained, and the truce proved to be only a temporary respite until hostilities erupted again with the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

Koegel's produces 35 products. Koegel's hot dogs are considered by the authors of \\"Coney Detroit\\" as the best hot dog for a Flint-Style Coney Dog along with Abbott's Meat's coney sauce. Koegel is also a supplier of A&W;, about 200 Coney restaurants, Walmart, Dairy Queen and Kroger. Distribution of its own products to each store gives Koegel an advantage of being able to give a shorter shelf life, at half its competitors, to ensure a fresh product. Koegel's delivery truck, Pittsfield Township, Michigan History Albert Koegel learned meat cutting and developed various recipes while in his native Germany. The company was founded in 1916 by Koegel on Kearsley Street, Flint, as a retail market to take part in the expanding population due to the automotive industry starting up. Production was upstairs to the retail area. To keep up with the regional demands, Koegel opened a processing plant in the mid-1930s on Stevens Street at the Flint River. In 1972, the company operations were moved to Bristol Road, Flint Township. Koegel's made news when the Michigan Jobs Commission awarded an economic development package to one of Koegel's competitors, Boar's Head Provision Company, in 1998. While Boar's Head is a New York company, it was awarded a large incentive, paid with taxpayer money, to open a processing plant in Michigan. Al Koegel, the son of company founder Albert Koegel, claims that Koegel's has never accepted taxpayer money or tax breaks from the state. In 2007, Michigan locations of Costco started carrying Koegel products. In 2008, Koegel's discontinued two products, a honey-style loaf and ham. President John Koegel told the press that in previous years, a couple of truckloads of the ham product would be sold per annum, but declining sales forced its discontinuation. With the downturn of the Great Recession, Koegel sales increased over first couple of years as people prepared meals at home more. Beef prices rose after that cutting into the profits. In 2012, Koegel and Meijer agreed to a distribution deal placing Koegel products in Meijer store in other states, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois while keeping direct distribution to Michigan Meijer stores. Keeping Michigan distribution allows their drivers to keep their jobs and retain other customers like A&W;, Dairy Queen and Kroger. Previous, the company's products were only available in Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. This deal added 98 new retail outlets for four to six products with two, hot dogs and bologna, being the core products. A few years before 2016, Koegel was selling nationwide by mail order as far away as Alaska. Keogel Meats was given the 2015 Al Kessel Outstanding Achievement Award by the Michigan Grocers Association. In January 2016, Koegel had to answer multiple inquires, in regards to the Flint water crisis and their water supply, that their plant is not connect to the Flint City water system, but the county run system via Flint Township. Factory Built in 1972, the current factory is on Bristol Road in Flint Township. Features of the plant include: * production moves east to west with no circling back to decrease instances of contamination * The production area floor included bricks as a meat's acid would erode a concrete one over the years * 100,000 square feet * the ceilings, equipment and the walls are stainless steel Products and recipes The Koegel Meat makes 64 products based on 32 different recipes. This including 16 types of sausage and hot dogs: brats, Italian sausage, foot- longs, franks, vienna frankfurters, bologna rings, Alt URL chicken frank and Polish sausage. Lunch meat products include bolognas, cotto salami, Dutch loafs, olive loafs, pickle loafs, head cheeses and mac & cheese loaf. Also they make coneys and hot dog chili products. Koegel uses its original 100-year old recipes that the meat products are smoked with damp sawdust with hardwood for flavor and in its own blend of spices Processes have changed over the 100 years moving from hand stuffing to machine based operation.

The VKI contested 61 clauses of Lyoness‚Äô ‚ÄòGeneral Terms and Conditions‚Äô, which it called opaque, uncertain, and/or meaningless.‚ÄúBei Lyoness tobt der Krieg der Gutachter‚Äù , ‚ÄúKleine Zeitung‚Äù, April 19, 2013‚ÄúVerbandsklage zielt auf das R√ºckgrat von Lyoness ab‚Äù, ‚ÄúWirtschaftsblatt‚Äù, April 23, 2013 Eric Breiteneder, hired as a legal representative by the organisation, also referred to the concepts used to distinguish various parts of ‚Äì and benefits within the Lyoness business model as vague and/or undefined elsewhere.‚Äú Causa Lyoness ‚Äì VKI leitet Verbandsklage ein‚Äù, ‚ÄúFormat‚Äù, April 23, 2013‚ÄúCausa Lyoness ‚Äì VKI leitet Verbandsklage ein‚Äù, ‚ÄúDer Standard‚Äù, April 23, 2013 The Handelszeitung reported about suspicions that high-level Lyoness members were earlier involved in (other) pyramid schemes, like the ‚ÄòSpirit of Independence‚Äô.‚ÄúLyoness: Top-Kader sahnten mit illegalem Schenkkreis ab‚Äù, ‚ÄúHandelszeitung‚Äù, April 3, 2013 It also mentioned a system called ‚ÄòGTS‚Äô (Global Trade System), operated by Erin Trade SA, as a former organisation tied to Hubert Freidl. Like Lyoness, this company has been called a pyramid scheme in the public debate. The Kleine Zeitung reported that various experts were looking at the investment schemes for advertising campaigns organised by Lyoness, and whether a prospectus was required before attracting capital from investors. Lyoness-hired ‚ÄúLyoness r√ºstet sich mit Gutachten gegen Klagen‚Äù, ‚ÄúDer Standard‚Äù, April 5, 2013 professor Susanne Kalls concluded that no capital market regulations were violated by not issuing a prospectus; attorney Karl Hengstberger came to the opposite conclusion but agreed with Kalls that the Lyoness business package does not constitute an investment. In the same article, Lyoness spokesman Mathias Vorbach admits that the company may have had some trouble before, but that those days are behind it ‚Äì Lyoness has learned from its mistakes. He asserts that legal problems have only appeared in Austria (a contested claim) and that 95% of the Lyoness members just shop and do not participate in the earning models offered by Lyoness. However, the Beobachter, after reportedly considering internal Lyoness documents, published an article ‚ÄúDer Goldesel‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeobachter‚Äù, April, 2013 suggesting that 99.7% of the Lyoness turnover derives from down-payments on future purchases, not from actual shopping or (saved up) discounts. In September 2009, Lyoness hired criminal law expert Peter Lewisch to assess whether the company's business model violated the Austrian law concerning illegal pyramid schemes.‚ÄúGutachten √ºber Lyoness: Kein Pyramidenspiel‚Äù The study, conducted by Lewisch in September 2013, argued that Lyoness is not a pyramid scheme under Austrian legislation. The judges of the regional court in Krems,http://www.justiz.gv.at/web2013/html/default/2c9484853f386e94013f57e51d320e9a.de.html Austria, however concluded that the business model of Lyoness is so \\"Ponzi- Scheme-like\\", that contracts between the company and its business partners are not valid.http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/wirtschaft/Ist-Lyoness-ein- Schneeballsystem-Juristen-uneins-Kunden-unzufrieden;art15,1300757 Lyoness has been declared a pyramid scheme by at least four independent civil courts in Austria. Additionally it was reported that the Austrian Consumers Union has filed suit against Lyoness for providing participants with unclear and deceptive terms and conditions. VKI represented clients who contended they invested money in the advertising campaigns organised by Lyoness, and several option trading packages offered by Lyoness, but were not provided with a prospectus. VKI won their case against Lyoness and the court ruled that the 61 contested clauses are indeed unlawful, making the contracts between Lyoness and its premium members not legally binding under Austrian law. ‚ÄúWirtschaftsblatt‚Äù‚ÄúGutachten √ºber Lyoness: ‚ÄúOTS‚Äù Further civil proceedings have been combined into a class-action lawsuit worth millions of euros, initiated by process financier Advofin, and supported and recommended by the Austrian Consumers Union (VKI). ‚ÄúKurier‚Äù, ‚ÄúKurier‚Äù, February 18, 2015 ‚ÄúWirtschaftsblatt‚Äù, ‚ÄúWirtschaftsblatt‚Äù, March 19, 2015 The lawsuit will be filed in Amsterdam. ‚ÄúDer Standard‚Äù, ‚ÄúDer Standard‚Äù, May 7, 2015 ‚ÄúWirtschaftsblatt‚Äù, ‚ÄúWirtschaftsblatt‚Äù, May 6, 2015 Lyoness is suspected to be a pyramid scheme in several of the countries it operates in.

In October 2015, the Australian Federal Court found that the loyalty program is not a pyramid scheme as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has originally claimed. The latest decision in Austria also declared that Lyoness is not classified as fraud or any illegal pyramid scheme by the Austrian Economic and Corruption Prosecutor (\\"WKStA\\"). In April 2016, the Vienna Regional Court stated that Lyoness is not a pyramid scheme. This decision is legally binding and can no longer be subject to appeal. In Australia, The Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), after researching Lyoness for a while, instituted proceedings against Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited, Lyoness UK Limited and Lyoness Australia Pty Limited (together ‚ÄòLyoness‚Äô) for operating a pyramid selling scheme and engaging in referral selling. The ACCC alleges that Lyoness has operated the scheme in Australia from mid-2011 and that it continues to operate the scheme. The scheme offers ‚Äòcash back‚Äô rebates to members who shop through a Lyoness portal, use Lyoness vouchers or present their Lyoness card at certain retailers. Whilst cash back offers themselves are not prohibited by the Australian Consumer Law, the ACCC alleges that the Lyoness scheme also offers commissions to members who recruit new members who make a down payment on future shopping. The ACCC is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties, injunctions, an order requiring the Lyoness website to link to the case report and costs. As Lyoness International AG, Lyoness Asia Limited and Lyoness UK Limited are located overseas, the ACCC will be making arrangements for service on those entities. The case is before Justice Flick of the Federal Court in Sydney. ‚ÄúLyoness: ACCC takes action against alleged pyramid scheme operator‚Äù, ‚ÄúACCC Website and Media Release‚Äù, 28 August 2014 Lyoness have submitted their defence in October 2014, and the next hearing will be in February 2015.

In Greece, an arrest warrant was issued in August 2015 against the Austrian directors of Lyoness Greece. On the 10th of August 2015 the Prosecutor of Thessaloniki Court of First Instance issued an arrest warrant against Herbert Teissel and his wife Anna Teissel, alleged directors of Lyoness Greece, for attempted fraud. Lyoness vehemently denies all allegations. In January 2019, Italy‚Äôs Competition Authority (AGCM) ruled that the Lyoness cashback formula, which promises a percentage refund of the money spent by consumers shopping at the company‚Äôs affiliated retailers, is an unfair and deceptive commercial practice that constitutes a pyramid scheme according to the Italian Consumer Code, and imposed a penalty of ‚Ç¨3,200,000 against the company. Television On November 30, 2011, Dragons‚Äô Den Canada aired an episode featuring the pitch of a Lyoness ‚ÄòPremium Member‚Äô from Ontario, Canada in which he asked the ‚ÄòDragons‚Äô to jointly invest 175,000 Canadian Dollars to acquire Lyoness ‚Äòbusiness packages‚Äô through him.Dragons‚Äô Den Canada season 6: episode 9, November 30, 2011 None of the Dragons were willing to invest. Instead, they ridiculed him and his business idea, suggesting that it's 'distasteful', and 'a pyramid scheme‚Äô. They also advised the Lyoness member, who borrowed against his house to acquire Lyoness positions, not to invest any more money in the Lyoness system.

Income From a Lyoness income disclosure statement‚ÄúLyoness Income Disclosure Statement 2012‚Äù, ‚ÄúLyoness Official Website‚Äù, June 8, 2013 can be derived that the average Lyoness member in the United States receives a gross annual commission of approximately $275, or $23 per month. The monthly median commission value of $0.38 indicates that the vast majority of the members receives a lower commission than the 23 dollar monthly average. Additionally, the document states that 46% of the Lyoness members makes $0 in commission and that the average annual expenditures, not taken into account when calculating the average commission, are $1,294. Similar figures have been reported in 2013,‚ÄúLyoness Income Disclosure Statement 2013‚Äù and in Canada.‚ÄúLyoness Income Disclosure Statement Canada 2013‚Äù  Internet  On the Internet, various websites and blogs from all over the world have focused critical attention on Lyoness, accusing the company of illegal business practices (mainly of running pyramid and Ponzi schemes) and questioning the alleged partnerships between Lyoness and several multinational corporations, as well as the validity and relevance of the certificates granted to the Lyoness shopping community. In April 2013, it was reported that former (Austrian) participants of Lyoness had organised themselves and founded an organisation and website called Plattform Lyoness.\\"Plattform Lyoness\\", \\"Plattform Lyoness\\", June 8, 2013 Not much later, an international equivalent was established under the name Lyoness Complaint Centre.\\"Lyoness Complaint Centre\\", ‚ÄúLyoness Complaint Centre‚Äù, June 8, 2013 In the beginning of June 2013, it was reported that Lyoness filed legal complaints against the founders of Plattform Lyoness.\\"Ermittlungsakt f√ºr Lyoness-Gegner tabu\\", \\"Der Standard\\", June 5, 2013\\"Klage und einstweilige Verf√ºgung gegen Plattform\\", \\"Plattform Lyoness\\", June 4, 2013 The founders were forced to remove legal documents concerning Lyoness from their website.

The Southern Encounter operated from Adelaide instead of Mount Barker, including six tunnels through the Mount Lofty Ranges. Special services were also operated to other places on the South Australian broad gauge network including Burra (near the Clare Valley), Nuriootpa in the Barossa Valley and shorter services on the metropolitan network. Operations Mount Barker station in August 2007 The Cockle Train operates year-round between Goolwa and Victor Harbor. It operates with a steam locomotive in school holidays, and historic diesel locomotives or railcars other weekends. The Southern Encounter runs from Mount Barker to Victor Harbor during winter, utilising most of the remaining broad gauge branch from the main Adelaide to Melbourne line. Some shorter services along the line are: *The Bugle Ranger - from Mount Barker to Bugle Ranges using a Redhen railcar set. Services operate one Sunday each month from late April to October *The Highlander - from Mount Barker to Strathalbyn using steam locomotives when possible.

On March 22, 1992, a USAir Fokker F28, registration flying the route, crashed in poor weather in a partially inverted position in Flushing Bay, shortly after liftoff from LaGuardia. The undercarriage lifted off from the runway; however, the airplane failed to gain lift, flying only several meters above the ground. The aircraft then veered off the runway and hit multiple obstructions before coming to rest in Flushing Bay, just beyond the end of the runway. Of the 51 people on board, 27 were killed, including the captain and a member of the cabin crew. A similar accident had happened three years before in 1989, when Air Ontario Flight 1363 crashed shortly after takeoff at Dryden Regional Airport after ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. Out of 69 passengers and crew, 24 were killed. The subsequent investigation revealed that due to pilot error, inadequate de-icing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, a large amount of ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident. Investigators also found that the deicing procedures at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes, they found that the deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.  Flight history  A USAir Fokker F28, similar to the aircraft involved in the accident The jet involved in the accident was a Fokker F28 Series 4000 airplane manufactured in the Netherlands. A two-engine, medium-range jet, the Fokker F28 is designed for transporting up to 95 passengers. The particular jet involved in the accident was registered in the United States as N485US. It was first delivered to Piedmont Airlines in August 1986, and was acquired by USAir (US Airways) three years later in August 1989 when Piedmont and USAir merged. N485US had amassed a total of 12,462 flying hours at the time of the accident. Captain Wallace J. Majure II, 44, who was fully qualified to pilot the F28 and four other commercial aircraft, had accumulated approximately 9,820 total flying hours, of which 2,200 hours were in the F28. Majure was initially hired as an F28 first officer by Piedmont Airlines in 1985. He was later reassigned to serve as a first officer and then a captain on a Boeing 737, but finally returned to an F28 captain because of company cutbacks. The New York Times reported that: > Majure was a man who yearned to please his passengers, and if he made them > happy then he also made his airline happy. He had often spoken to friends > about how important it was for him to get travelers to their destinations on > time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was > also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot. First Officer John Rachuba, 30, was hired by Piedmont in 1989. At the time of the accident, company records indicate that he had accumulated approximately 4,507 flying hours, of which 29 hours were in the F28. Rachuba held a flight engineer certificate with ratings for turbojet-powered aircraft and an expired instructor certificate issued on August 16, 1987. He also held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license for non-federal control towers. Previously, he had served as a flight engineer on Boeing 737s and Boeing 727s. The two flight attendants were Debra Andrews Taylor and Janice King. Janice King, who was seated in the aft jumpseat, died in the crash. Accident =Poor weather, deicing, taxiing delays= An NTSB diagram of Flight 405's attempted takeoff, showing it veer off the left of the runway and hit a water pump The aircraft took off from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York and the removal of the baggage of a passenger who decided not to board the jet. The instrument approach landing was uneventful and the jet was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate. One hour and six minutes behind schedule, the jet arrived at Gate B1, where the pilot advised a ground mechanic that his airplane was \\"good to go.\\" The flight crew then disembarked the jet to use facilities in the terminal. The poor weather did not improve as the jet was deiced with Type I fluid, a heated 50/50 water/glycol mixture. Following the completion of this process, one of the two deicing trucks delayed the pushback of the jet when it experienced mechanical problems. The vehicle was immobilised for 20 minutes in such a position that it prevented the aircraft from taxiing to the runway following the flight crew's return. After the deicing truck was repaired, the pilot requested a second deicing, though the flight crew did not perform a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi. Engine anti-ice was turned on for the two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and they should not be worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a reminder of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots. Weather reports for LaGuardia showed that on the night of the accident, all taxiways were coated with a thin covering of snow. Runway 13 was also covered with a thin layer of wet snow, although it had been plowed, treated with urea and it had been sanded. The first officer described the snowfall as \\"not heavy, no large flakes.\\" He told authorities that snow was sliding off the jet and the nose of the airplane was coated in a watery layer. He used a light positioned on the wing of his jet to check for signs of ice several times before they attempted to take off. Neither he or the pilot saw any evidence of contamination on the wing or on the black strip and therefore decided against a third deicing. He told investigators that he checked the wings \\"maybe 10 times, but at least 3.\\" He said that he did not consider the snowfall heavy, and he did not recall any wind blowing the snow. The first officer stated that as they taxied, they looked back at the wings several times. Near the time of the takeoff, he said \\"looks good to me, black strip is clear.\\" While taxiing, the flight crew discussed deicing procedures. The first officer suggested to the pilot that the aircraft ahead of them in the queue \\"might keep our wings clear for us.\\" The pilot replied that \\"it can cause us to re-freeze too ... I don't want to be very close to him.\\" Later, the first officer remarked \\"look at all that stuff. What is that?\\" to which the pilot replied \\"sand I guess, urea sand.\\" The pilot of a jet taxiing behind Flight 405, Northwest Airlines Flight 517, a Boeing 757, stated that he had a good view of the top of Flight 405's wing, and that there was just enough snow on the fuselage to \\"fuzzy\\" the USAir printing but that the wings appeared to be clear. He believed that the snow had \\"all but stopped\\" and was more concerned about the amount of vehicular traffic, such as sweepers and plows, than he was about the snowfall. The second officer of Trump Shuttle Flight 1541, which had landed around the time Flight 405 was taxiing, said their Boeing 727 had \\"picked up a lot of snow quickly during my post-landing walkaround, but by the finish it seemed to be more rain.\\" He described Flight 405 as a \\"fairly clean airplane.\\" He said that he could not comment on clear ice, but that the wings and fuselage were clear of snow. The jet, already several hours behind schedule, then suffered further delays taxiing to the runway. The weather had created heavy ground traffic at LaGuardia, and it was reported that there were queues of aircraft waiting for permission for takeoff. Investigators estimated that the plane took between 25 and 45 minutes to taxi from the gate to the runway. Flushing Bay, New York, where the aircraft came to rest in a partially inverted position =Crash= Following permission for takeoff from controllers, the flight crew initiated the takeoff procedure and the first officer made a callout of 80 knots, and, several seconds later, a V1 callout, followed shortly after by a VR callout. Approximately 2.2 seconds after the VR callout, the nose gear left the ground. The final report read that \\"the first officer described the takeoff as normal through the rotation. He stated that no problem was evident with vibration, rate of acceleration, ambient noise, [or] directional control\\". However, The New York Times reported that \\"several passengers sensed that [the airplane] was not going fast enough.\\" The first officer said it was \\"just like we lost lift.\\" As the captain attempted to level the wings, the crew used right rudder to manoeuvre the aircraft back toward the ground and avoid the water below. The accident report found that \\"the first officer said that they seemed to agree that the airplane was not going to fly and that their control inputs were in unison.\\" Rachuba and Majure continued to try to hold the nose up to impact in a flat attitude, although Rachuba later stated that there were no \\"heavy control inputs.\\" The final report further noted that \\"first officer stated that he did not touch the power levers.\\" The first officer later told investigators that the flight crew's primary focus was to find a safe place to land. Just under five seconds after the undercarriage left the ground, the plane's left wing scraped against the asphalt for 110 feet and the stick shaker activated. The crew received six stall warnings, before the jet began banking to the left, then to the right, and then to the left again, still only several meters above the ground. The aircraft struck two visual approach slope indicator posts, touched down again for approximately 100 feet, before lifting off again and striking an ILS beacon and a water pump house. The left wing then separated from the body of the airplane, before the fuselage struck the edge of Flushing Bay and came to rest in a partially inverted position. Parts of the fuselage and cockpit were submerged in water. Confusion, disorientation, or entrapment most likely caused the drowning of passengers who otherwise sustained only minor injuries and injuries that were not life-threatening. The final report read: > Prior to impact, passengers did not assume the brace position. When the > airplane came to rest, many of the passengers in the forward portion of the > cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water > over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their > seatbelts were still buckled, and other passengers had difficulty locating > and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following > the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions > of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated > that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight > attendant and first officer escaped through a hole in the cabin floor near > the flight attendant's position.

Others were assisted out of the water by > ground personnel. =Rescue attempts, medical operation= The crash site of USAir Flight 405 is highlighted by the white oval The tower cab coordinator on duty at the time of the accident stated that he saw a fireball emanating from the crash site following the accident. Upon seeing the flames, he sounded an alarm, alerting the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police, who responded. An investigation revealed that there were technical issues with an emergency telephone at LaGuardia, however it was found that these issues did not hinder the emergency response. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department initially sent four vehicles. Personnel in these vehicles reported that snow and fog hampered their visibility while heading to the crash site, and they could not see the destroyed aircraft. However, one member of the fire crew observed people standing on top of a dike near the crash site. Police divers also entered the water following the crash, although they found no-one alive inside the jet or in the water. The fire-fighters continued spraying the fire, and the incident commander estimated that they had the fire under control ten minutes after their arrival at the scene. The New York Times reported that: > The accident sent thick black smoke billowing above the airport as more than > 200 emergency workers ... had to contend not only with blustery snow but the > powerful icy current in Flushing Bay ... the tense drama of the rescue > continued into the early hours, with fire-fighters and police officers in > water up to their shoulders and helicopters shining spotlights on the > wreckage and an ice-covered mound of earth at the end of the runway so slick > the rescue workers needed metal ladders to walk across it. The NTSB report on the accident noted, but did not criticise, the medical operation at the scene. It described how paramedics attended to those who were conscious with life-threatening injuries, but did not make any attempts to resuscitate victims who appeared drowned or lacked vital signs because they believed that they could not be revived because they had succumbed to the cold salt water. It was estimated by the authorities who attended the scene of the crash that 15 ambulances responded to the accident site, all of which were used to transport the injured to hospitals, and that 40 additional ambulances were available near the site of the crash, but were not needed. The report described the emergency response as \\"effective and contributed to the survivability of the airplane's occupants. However, the response by the emergency medical services personnel was inadequately coordinated, and the ambulance response times to the hospitals were excessive.\\" The final report read: > ... a basic principle of triage is to treat victims having the most life- > threatening injuries first with available medical resources and to utilize > limited medical personnel in a manner that will provide maximum > effectiveness. However, the Safety Board is also aware that in recent years > a number of victims of cold water drowning have been successfully > resuscitated. They survived after periods of underwater, including sea > water, as long as one hour or more. In view of these facts, the Safety Board > believes that all emergency response organizations should review their > emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary > resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained > personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, > regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water > immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not > indicate death. Investigation The NTSB sent a team to the crash site to investigate the accident. They concluded that, unknown to the crew, ice had collected on the wings, which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year. =Buildup of ice= The investigators suggested multiple reasons why the jet was unable to gain lift, but the accident report states there was no evidence to suggest corrosion on the wings. The airplane's flight control systems were also examined and revealed no failure prior to impact. The report reads that \\"the evidence did not support improper wing configuration, airframe or system defects, or deployment of the speed brakes as reasons for the loss of aerodynamic efficiency.\\" The investigators also stated that the takeoff roll of the jet was not abnormal. The board came to the conclusion that ice had built up on the wings, and this had contributed largely to the accident. When attempting to find out why ice was present on the wings of the jet, the board determined that the airplane had been properly cleared of ice and snow during the two deicing procedures at the gate. However, approximately 35 minutes elapsed between the second time that the aircraft was deiced and the initiation of takeoff during which the airplane was exposed to continuing precipitation in below freezing temperatures. The NTSB were unable to determine how much ice had built up on the wings following the second deicing, but considered it to be highly likely that \\"some contamination occurred in the 35 minutes following the second deicing and that this accumulation led to this accident.\\" \\"The Safety Board views the evidence as conclusive that the primary factor in this accident was the reduced performance of the wing due to ice contamination. Therefore, the Safety Board evaluated the extent to which the decisions of, and procedures used by the flight crew could have contributed to the accident,\\" read the final report. Although, when the cockpit was examined, the engine anti-ice switch was found in the 'OFF' position, further investigations found that even slight pressure could move the switch, and the NTSB ruled this out as a contributing factor in the crash. Following the accident, USAir sent out a maintenance directive ordering engine anti-ice switches to be changed on F28s so they would lock into a selected position. Investigators found that a flaw in the design of the F28's wings made them extremely vulnerable to ice buildup. Because of the angle of the wings, even a very small amount of ice could have devastating effects. When the NTSB, in collaboration with Fokker, investigated the effect ice can have on an aircraft, they found that ice particles as small as 1-2mm of a density of one particle per square centimeter can cause a loss of lift of over 20%. A document written by Fokker before the accident detailed the effect of ice on the wing of an F28 warned that an \\"uncontrollable roll\\" would begin even with a small amount of ice on the wings. =Errors by the flight crew= The report found that the flight crew were aware that the poor weather was likely to cause ice buildup, however neither of them took any action to check the condition of the wing leading edge and upper surface. The aircraft was evaluated by ground crew and was deiced. After the mechanical failure of the deicing truck, the investigators reported that, as the captain requested another deice, there was an indication he was: > ... concerned about the continuing exposure to precipitation, and the > request was prudent and in accordance with USAir guidance. Following the > second deicing, the flight crew was most likely satisfied that the airplane > was free of adhering contamination. The flight crew was not aware of the > exact delay that they would encounter before takeoff and their decision to > leave the gate was reasonable. After taxiing, when it became evident that > they would be delayed for a prolonged period, conversations between the crew > showed that they were aware of and probably concerned about the risk of > reaccumulating frozen contamination on the wing. They also found that USAir guidance and flight crew training was sufficient and should have alerted the flight crew to the risk of attempting a takeoff while they were unaware of the condition of the wing. USAir guidance to flight crews specifically stated that: > ... it is the captain's responsibility to exercise caution prior to takeoff. > If the elapsed time since deicing exceeds 20 minutes, careful examination of > the surfaces should be conducted to detect the extent of accumulation [of > ice] and to assure that the takeoff can be made safely and in compliance > with existing [regulations]. The final report read: > The Safety Board believes that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have > taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as > entering the cabin to look at the wing from a closer range. Although the > Safety Board acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of > contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is > difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an > observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some > contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. > The Safety Board believes that the flight crew's failure to take such > precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing > cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it. In a television interview, one of the NTSB investigators suggested that \\"the captain was faced with quite a problem. If he wanted to be deiced a third time, he would have had to get out of the line [of jets waiting to take off] and taxi all the way back to the parking area and meet up with a deicing truck again. That would have put him very, very late and it may have even caused the cancellation of the flight.\\" The NTSB carried out tests to discover why the first officer was unable to see the ice buildup on the wing of the jet. When the sliding window of the cockpit was fully open, the first officer would have been able to see the outer eighty percent of the wing, including the black strip used to contrast the white surface of the wing so the flight crew can search for a build up of ice. When the sliding window was shut, as it was in the accident, it would be difficult to make out any details of the wing, and the black strip would have been distorted by the glass. They also found that the ice light made little difference to how much the first officer would have been able to see. The investigators also requested that Fokker conduct a study of the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots, but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard. =Deicing procedures at LaGuardia= Investigators also focused on deicing practices at LaGuardia. They found that the airport was using only Type I deicing fluid, not Type II. Type I fluids are used for the actual deicing of the jet, while Type II fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice. At the time of the accident, LaGuardia had prohibited the use of Type II deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction. Investigators noted the change had been made because of LaGuardia's shorter runways and the fact that if an aircraft left the vicinity of the runway, it would come to rest in the cold water surrounding Runway 13. The accident report, however, criticised the fact that the majority of the airplane operators in the United States relied only upon Type I fluids for protection, and they do not use Type II. The board stated that tests have shown that both Type I and Type II fluids do flow off the wings of a treated airplane in significant amounts during the initial takeoff ground run. The NTSB stated: > There are a number of views on the potential uses of Type I and II fluids. > The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter > than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both > fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is > uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction > since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the > use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the > airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase > in drag. =Safety card errors= A diagram based on the official NTSB report showing the deaths and injuries to the passengers aboard Flight 405 While it was not named as a cause of the accident, investigators also found that the passenger safety briefing cards in the airplane showed two types of galley service doors. However, only one door is installed on a particular F28 model at any one time. The examination also showed that the safety card did not show how to operate either of the two types of galley service doors in the emergency mode if the normal opening mode failed. However, the final report stated that this \\"did not contribute to the fatalities in the accident.\\" =Conclusion= The final report, published by the NTSB, cited the probable cause of the accident to be: > ... the failure of the airline industry and the Federal Aviation > Administration to provide flight crews with procedures, requirements, and > criteria compatible with departure delays in conditions conducive to > airframe icing and the decision by the flight crew to take off without > positive assurance that the airplane's wings were free of ice accumulation > after 35 minutes of exposure to precipitation following de-icing. The ice > contamination on the wings resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of > control after lift-off. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the > inappropriate procedures used by, and inadequate coordination between, the > flight crew that led to a takeoff rotation at a lower than prescribed air > speed. Aftermath =NTSB recommendations= The NTSB made several recommendations to the FAA, including requiring that \\"flight crew members and appropriate ground personnel responsible for the inspection of transport-category airplanes for wing contamination receive specific periodic training that will illustrate what contamination looks like and feels like on a wing and the amount of contamination that is detectable under different light conditions\\". They also ordered \\"airlines to establish a way to inform fight crews of the type of [deicing] fluid and mixture used, the current moisture accumulation rate, and the available holdover time.\\" With regard to the obstructions that the airplane collided with during the accident sequence, the NTSB ordered the modification or replacement of \\"all pump houses adjacent to Runway 13/31 so that they are not obstructions to airplanes\\". They also ordered a study on the \\"feasibility of building a frangible ILS antenna array for LaGuardia Airport\\" Further, they ordered a review of Fokker F28-4000 passenger safety briefing cards \\"to ensure that they clearly and accurately depict the operation of the two types of forward cabin doors in both their normal and emergency modes and that they describe clearly and accurately how to remove the overwing emergency exit and cover.\\" =Dryden report allegations= The crash was featured on National Geographic Channel in an episode of the television program Mayday (Air Crash Investigation/Air Emergency) entitled Cold Case, where the accident was compared with Air Ontario Flight 1363, which crashed in Dryden, Ontario, after the crew did not deice their jet. The program opened by saying that Canadian investigators were \\"stunned\\" to hear of the USAir accident, as it mirrored the Air Ontario flight which had occurred three years earlier. The report on the crash in Dryden criticised approaches to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway rather than at the gate, and that the crew should inspect their wings not only from the cockpit, but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry's sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations. The Honourable Virgil P. Moshansky, who investigated the crash in Dryden and wrote the report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report \\"probably sat on somebody's [at the FAA] desk.\\" He said \\"when I first heard about it I thought, my God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in my report, the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted.\\" Another investigator into the Air Ontario accident told the documentary that \\"after all of this work [investigating the Dryden crash], after all of the efforts, to see it happen again was extremely frustrating.\\" The documentary focused largely on these allegations, while also reconstructing the Air Ontario flight and the USAir flight. However, it was reported that the FAA refuted Moshansky's allegations, and they claim that they never received his report. =International Conference on Airplane Ground Deicing= These ice formations on the propeller and fuselage surfaces of a test unit installed in the Icing Research Tunnel at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Cleveland, Ohio, show what may happen to an aircraft in flight under certain atmospheric conditions. Following the crash of Flight 405 and the Air Ontario accident in Dryden, the FAA began to research methods of improving deicing practices at airports to minimise the number of accidents caused by a buildup of ice. Described by the FAA as a \\"sharply focused effort\\", experts convened on May 28 and 29, 1992, in Reston, Virginia for the International Conference on Ground Deicing. At the conference, industry methods were discussed and agreed upon for actions that should be taken in the long term and short term. A report on the conference by the FAA read: > A better understanding of airplane ground deicing and anti-icing issues is a > crucial prerequisite to the implementation of feasible and effective safety > improvements. To achieve this goal, the FAA sponsored a conference at which > the international aviation community could exchange thoughts and offer > recommendation on a variety of issues concerning safe winter operations. [At > the conference] more than 750 participants discussed the problems posed by > aircraft deicing and examined possible solutions. It was reported that discussions over different types of deicing fluid were discussed, along with different deicing equipment and techniques. They also found that the pilot in command was the ultimate authority for take off decisions, but that all operators had to provide proper training and criteria for the pilot in command to base a proper decision on. The conference concluded with an amendment to FAA regulations which air carriers operated under. The new regulations stated that airlines should put in place FAA- approved ground deicing or anti-icing procedures anytime weather conditions of ice, snow or frost prevailed. The new rules went into effect on November 1, 1992. =Developments in deicing= An American Airlines MD-80 aircraft being deiced at Syracuse Hancock International Airport In the years that followed the accident, airlines started using Type IV deicing fluid, which is more effective than both Type I and Type II fluids. Type IV fluids stick to aircraft for up to two hours. Chicago O'Hare International Airport was the first to introduce deicing facilities at the runway, something which has now become commonplace. Aircraft themselves now have more sophisticated deicing systems that can be used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions. Ground deicing technologies are also developing, and a newer technology is infrared deicing. This is the transmission of energy by means of electromagnetic waves or rays. Infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from the heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating the space (air) it passes through. When infrared waves strike an object, they release their energy as heat. This heat is either absorbed or reflected by the cooler surface. Infrared energy is continually exchanged between \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\" surfaces until all surfaces have reached the same temperature (equilibrium). The colder the surfaces, the more effective the infrared transfer from the emitter. This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional deicing (convection and conduction) due to the cooling effect of the air on the deicing fluid spray. Aircraft deicing vehicles have also improved since the accident, usually consisting of a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip to take place in a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.

It was a licensed version by Avro of the Fokker F.VIIB/3m. Development In 1928 Avro came to an arrangement with Fokker to license production of its successful F.VIIB/3m for sale in the British Empire (except Canada). The Avro designation 618 Ten was adopted as the aircraft was capable of carrying two crew and eight passengers. After a modification of the centre motor mounting to accommodate British airworthiness requirements, the aircraft was first displayed at the 1929 Olympia Aero Show. The Avro 642 Eighteen used the same wing as the Ten but had a new fuselage for 16 passengers. Operational history =Australia= Southern Sun The first five aircraft were sold to the new Australian National Airways. The type entered service on 1 January 1930 on the Brisbane-Sydney route, and later Melbourne-Sydney. They were: :VH- UMF Southern Cloud :VH-UMG Southern Star :VH-UMH Southern Sky :VH-UMI Southern Moon :VH-UNA Southern Sun Two of this fleet were lost in accidents: Southern Cloud in the Toolong range of the Australian Alps on 21 March 1931 (the wreckage was not found until 1958) and Southern Sun in Malaya in November 1931, while attempting the first airmail flight to the United Kingdom. The airline folded and the remaining aircraft were sold. Southern Moon was rebuilt in 1933 for long-range flights, fitted with 330 hp (250 kW) Wright Whirlwind radial engines and restyled as VH-UXX Faith in Australia. The last surviving 618 Ten in Australia, it evacuated many people from New Guinea in 1941. Another two 618 Ten aircraft were also sold to Australian companies.Virtue in Flying p.23 Three of the 619 Five aircraft went to two Australian airlines, as did (after commercial service in Britain) the sole 642/2m. =Britain and elsewhere= Four 618 Tens were delivered directly to British customers. Two went to Imperial Airways (April and June 1931) and were chartered to the Iraq Petroleum Transport Company before returning to Britain in 1933. One went to Midland & Scottish Air Ferries (May 1933) and at the end of 1931 one went to Indian State Airways for the use of the Viceroy of India. Two Tens went to the Egyptian Army air force in January 1932, one of them surviving to join Indian National Airways in September 1934. The last production Ten was delivered to the Royal Aircraft Establishment's Wireless and Equipment Flight in July 1936 with the RAF serial K2682. One of the 624 Sixes was used by A.S.T Ltd; the other two were eventually sold to the Chinese government.

He spent his early manhood as a drifter in the Southwest, learning the trades of farrier and miner. Supposedly he joined the U.S. Army but deserted in 1906 and drifted to Mexico. He was married and had a daughter. Gardner began his criminal profession as a gunrunner around the time of the Mexican Revolution. He smuggled and traded arms and ammunition to the Venustiano Carranza forces until he was captured by soldiers from Victoriano Huerta's army and was sentenced to death by firing squad; however, on March 29, 1909, he broke out of the Mexico City jail along with three other American prisoners after attacking the soldier guards. Back in the United States, Gardner became a prizefighter in the Southwest. He was good enough that he became a sparring partner for Heavyweight Champion J. J. Jeffries at Ben Lemond Training Camp in Reno, Nevada, during the summer of 1910. Eventually, Gardner ended up in San Francisco, where he gambled all of his boxing money away and then robbed a jewelry store on Market Street. He was arrested and spent some time in San Quentin, but was paroled after he saved a prison guard's life during a riot. He then landed a job as an acetylene welder at the Mare Island Navy Yard, married, fathered a daughter, and on Armistice Day in 1918 left and began his own welding company. Robbery career On a business trip to Mexico, Gardner gambled all his money away at the racetracks in Tijuana. Then on the night of April 16, 1920, outside San Diego, he robbed a U. S. Mail truck of about $80,000 in cash and securities. The job went smoothly, but he was arrested three days later while burying his loot. He was sentenced to 25 years at McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary for the armed robbery, but vowed he would never serve the sentence. On June 5, 1920, he was being transported by train, accompanied by Deputy U. S. Marshals Cavanaugh and Haig. Some way outside Portland, Oregon, he peered out of the train window and yelled, \\"Look at that deer!\\". The lawmen looked, and Gardner grabbed Haig's gun from his holster, then disarmed Cavanaugh at gunpoint, handcuffed the two together, and stole $200. He jumped off the train and made his way to Canada. He slipped back into the United States the next year, and started robbing banks and mail trains across the country as a lone bandit. Returning to California, on May 19, 1921, he tied up the mail clerk on Train No. 10 eastbound from Sacramento and robbed the express car of $187,000. The next morning, he told the mail clerk of Train No. 20 to throw up his hands or he would blow his head off. When the train reached the Overland Limited at Roseville, he ran down the tracks with an armful of mail. The home office recognized the gunman as Roy Gardner, the train robber with a $5,000 reward on his head. Gardner was recognized at the Porter House Hotel and while he was playing a game of cards in a pool hall, federal agents arrived and captured him. He was sentenced to another 25 years at McNeil Island for armed robbery of the mail trains. Trying to reduce his sentence, he told Southern Pacific Railroad detectives that he would lead them to the spot where he buried his loot. The officers found nothing, and Gardner announced, \\"I guess I have forgotten where I buried that money.\\" He was heavily shackled, with the addition of an \\"Oregon Boot\\", and was once again transported on a train to McNeil Island, this time by U. S. Marshals Mulhall and Rinkell, both fast-shooting veterans. During the journey, Gardner asked to use the bathroom, in which an associate had earlier hidden a .32 caliber pistol. When he came out of the bathroom, Gardner pointed the gun at Mulhall and ordered another prisoner to handcuff the two lawmen to the seat. He relieved the officers of their weapons and cash before hopping onto another moving train outside Castle Rock, Washington. The largest manhunt in Pacific Coast history began after this. Gardner was described as a dangerous man who would shoot on sight and must be captured at all costs. He once again had a $5,000 reward on his head. He arrived in Centralia, Washington, where he was almost recognized by Jack Scuitto at the Olympic Club. Gardner plastered his face with bandages to hide his identity, leaving one eye slit, and told the Oxford Hotel staff that he had been severely burned in an industrial accident near Tacoma. Proprietor Gertrude Howell and Officer Louis Sonney became suspicious of the bandaged man, and when Sonney saw a firearm in Gardner's hotel room, he accused him of being the \\"Smiling Bandit\\". Gardner fought back, but was arrested and a doctor removed the bandages, confirming his identity. He was sentenced to another 25 years, and heavily chained, was finally brought to McNeil Island. =Escape from McNeil Island= After six weeks at the penitentiary, Gardner had convinced two other prisoners, Lawardus Bogart and Everett Impyn, that he had \\"paid off\\" the guards in the towers. On Labor Day, September 5, 1921, at a prison baseball game, he said \\"Now!\\" during the fifth inning when someone hit a fly ball into center field, as the guards in the towers had their eyes on the ball and the runners. He, Bogart, and Impyn ran 300 yards to the high barbed-wire fence where Gardner cut a hole, and the three men ran to the pasture as bullets whirled about their heads. Gardner was wounded in his left leg, but escaped behind a herd of cattle near timber.Scott McCabe, \\"'Smiling Bandit' makes daring escape off island\\", Crime History, The Washington Examiner, September 5, 2012, p. 6. He saw Bogart fall, badly wounded. Impyn was shot dead; his dying words were, \\"Gardner told us those fellows in the towers couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.\\" Bogart later said that Gardner had deceived them and used his companions as decoys to better his chances of escape. Guards scoured the beaches and confiscated every boat on the shoreline, but were unable to find Gardner, who lived in the prison barn, drinking milk from the cows, and then swam to Fox Island, where he lived off fruit in the orchards. Warden Maloney claimed Gardner was still on McNeil Island, but by that time Gardner had already left. A San Francisco newspaper published a letter from him. =Recapture and Alcatraz= Alcatraz Island in 2005 Gardner was now the \\"Most Wanted\\" criminal, and committed several crimes in Arizona before he was captured by a mail clerk during a train robbery in Phoenix in fall 1921. He was sentenced to an additional 25 years, this time at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Headlines read: \\"Gangster Gardner brags, 'Leavenworth will never hold me'\\". Now known as the \\"King of the Escape Artists\\", Gardner was transferred in 1925 to Atlanta Federal Prison, then the toughest prison in the country. The following year, he tried to tunnel under the wall and saw through the bars in the shoe shop. Then in 1927, he led a prison break during which he held the captain and two guards hostage with two revolvers, but the escape failed and he was placed in solitary confinement for twenty months. When he was released from solitary confinement, he was placed in a mental hospital in Washington, D. C. In 1929, the warden described Gardner as the \\"most dangerous inmate in the history of Atlanta Prison\\", and that year he began a hunger strike protesting prison food and threatened suicide. He was then transferred to Leavenworth Annex Prison in 1930, and in 1934 he was transferred to Alcatraz, where he was one of the first hardened criminals incarcerated there. Gardner's time in Alcatraz coincided with Al Capone's. Capone was an unpopular prisoner. Supposedly, an unidentified inmate once threw a lead sash weight at Capone, but Capone was only wounded in the arm because Gardner pushed him out of the way. During Gardner's time in Alcatraz, his wife divorced him. He worked and supervised at the mat shop with Ralph Roe and they planned an escape, but Gardner was paroled and released in 1938 after his appeal for clemency was approved. Final years In 1939 Gardner published his autobiography, titled Hellcatraz. He attended crime lectures, and he and Louis Sonney made one of the first re-enactments, a short film called You Can't Beat the Rap. Gardner worked as a film salesman and an exposition barker. A 1939 movie called I Stole a Million was based on his life; it was a failure. On the evening of January 10, 1940, in a hotel room in San Francisco, Gardner wrote four notes; one of them he attached to the door, warning: \\"Do not open door. Poison gas. Call police.\\" He sealed the door from the inside, then killed himself by dropping cyanide into a glass of acid and inhaling the poison fumes.

Early life Tachihara was born in Andong city, Gyeongsangbuk-do province, Korea to Korean parents. His father was a member of the former Korean aristocracy and a military officer serving the Joseon Dynasty, who became a Zen priest after the Japanese annexation of Korea, and subsequently committed suicide when Tachihara was five. Four years after his father's death in 1931, Tachihara moved with his mother to Yokosuka city, Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. His Korean name was Kim Yun Kyu (ÈáëËÉ§Â•é: ÍπÄÏú§Í∑ú), but he changed his name to ' when his mother married a Japanese man. Later, he registered his name as Kanai Masaaki under the soushi- kaimei policy, but after his own marriage (to a Japanese woman), he once again changed his name to '. He has been naturalized in Japan in 1947. He was a student at Waseda University in Tokyo, and was initially enrolled in the Law Department. However, he gradually shifted over the Literature Department, drawn by his interest in the novels of Yasunari Kawabata and the literary criticism of Hideo Kobayashi. Tachihara was strongly attracted to medieval Japanese culture, particularly Noh drama, and traditional Japanese gardens, and his novels are patterned after the aesthetics in Zeami's Noh treatise Fushi Kaiden. Tachihara's interests included the collection of ceramics, especially many Korean Yi Dynasty works. It was not until after his death that his Korean ethnic background became widely known. Literary career Tachihara's first novel, Bakush≈´ (‚ÄúAutumn Wheat‚Äù) was published in the literary magazine Bungei kenky≈´kai. It was well received by literary critics, which led to his decision to become a professional writer. In 1958, he published Tanin no jiy≈´ (‚ÄúOther People's Freedom‚Äù) in the magazine Gunz≈ç, followed by Takigi n≈ç (‚ÄúFirelight Noh‚Äù), Tsurugigasaki (‚ÄúCape Tsurugi‚Äù) and Urushi no hana (‚ÄúLacquer Flower‚Äù). He won the 55th Naoki Award for his novel Shiroi keshi (‚ÄúWhite Poppy‚Äù, 1965). He also declined the Akutagawa Prize twice, as he felt that the reward would damage his reputation as an author of serious literature. One of his books, Wind and Stone, has been translated into English by Stephen W. Kohl. Tachihara lived in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture from 1950 until his death of esophageal cancer. Before he died, he officially changed his name to Tachihara Masaaki. His grave is at the temple of Zuisen-ji in Kamakura.

It is a coastal settlement that is almost equidistant from the provincial capitals of Wewak and Vanimo, and marks the midpoint of the highway between these two capitals. Aitape has 240 V power (in general 24 hours), telephone, a bank, a post-office, a courthouse and a police station, a supermarket and many tradestores, a petrol station, two airstrips, two secondary schools, a mission office and a hospital.Diocese of Aitape Aitape was established as a train station by German colonists in 1905 as part of German New Guinea. During the Second World War the town was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army. Transport Aitape can be reached by logging road from Vanimo and Wewak (180 km). Boats also leave Aitape Harbor to Vanimo and Wewak. There are two airstrips: Tadji (TAJ), where most flights land, and Aitape (ATP). Tadji airstrip is located 10 km east of town. History First contact between the Aitape (Eitape) area and the outside world is believed to have occurred during the 15th century when large sailing expeditions arrived from China. It is certain that Malay fishing fleets were active along the Sepik coastline from the early 17th century when island inhabitants were recruited as navigators for these Malay fishing vessels. The first Christian missionary arrived in the Aitape area in 1896. It was Societatis Verbi Divini (the Society of the Divine Word or SVD) from Germany and Holland. The first mission station was established on the island of Tumleo in 1896. A second station was set up at Pro on the mainland the following year. The inhabitants of Pro requested that the mission station be established to protect them from raids by much larger settlements. The major native settlements at the time were at Sissano, Malol, and Arop (the Siau group). The island settlements of Tumleo, Ali and Seleo (the Bakla) made up the next group of main settlements. Both the Siau and Bakla would band together annually for major trading expeditions taking in the Aitape coastline to the south east areas around Wewak. German authorities found it difficult to colonize the Siau and Bakla of the Aitape area. The Aitape area was officially described as uncontrolled during the German colonial period. Still, the Germans built a solid prison at Aitape and installed a powerful radio station which maintained quality communication with Europe. In 1908, the Aitape coastline was struck by a major tsunami event resulting in the collapse of an area of coastline between Arop and Sissano creating the Sissano Lagoon. (A second tsunami struck in 1935 with most recent occurring in 1998 also hitting Sissano.) By 1914 there were 68 missionaries and 6 new stations established along the coast. The town along with the rest of German New Guinea passed to Australian control after the First World War and became part of the Territory of New Guinea. =Second World War= During the Second World War the town was occupied, along with the rest of the Territory of New Guinea, by the Imperial Japanese Army. During the recapture American forces bypassed the Japanese 18th Army based at Wewak, taking Aitape on 22 April 1944. A base was developed here and repulsed a major Japanese counter-attack. The Americans were content to hold Aitape and not advance far towards Wewak. In fact, Aitape was captured as part of a 3-pronged invasion by the Allies (Aitape, and landings on either side of Hollandia). There was little or no strategic gain to be had in doing so as the Japanese force based at Wewak no longer posed a real threat ‚Äì cut off, short of supplies, and weakened from battle and diseases. In mid-1944, General Douglas MacArthur, the American Commander-in-Chief of Allied forces in the South-West Pacific Area, secured an agreement from the Australian government for Australian forces to take over at Aitape. MacArthur then continued island hopping in preparation for the re-capture of the Philippines. The Aitape-Wewak campaign was the final Australian military campaign on mainland New Guinea. It ran from November 1944 to the war's end in August 1945. It was fought by the 6th Division, Australian Imperial Force (AIF) with air and naval support. Australian intelligence soldier Leonard Siffleet was beheaded by the Japanese on Aitape beach 24 October 1943 . =Tsunami= In July 1998, the area surrounding the town suffered from a destructive tsunami that killed over 2,000 people. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurred offshore and triggered a large undersea landslide that generated the tsunami. The area worst hit was Warapu village about 8 km west of Aitape. The village was situated on a narrow spit between the coast and a large lagoon. It is estimated that waves with an average height of 10.5 metres passed over the spit into the lagoon. Climate Aitape has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.

Early life Porter started both training for the priesthood and molesting children at a young age; he abused his earliest known victim in 1953, the summer before he entered seminary. He was ordained in 1959 and became a priest of the diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts. Crimes Porter was assigned to St. Mary's parochial grammar school in North Attleboro, Massachusetts in April 1960 and put in charge of the altar boys. Porter gained a reputation there as a child molester, but no action was taken against him by the Catholic Church until 1963, by which time at least four parents had complained to his superiors about his inappropriate behavior. Rather than contact the police, however, Church officials moved Porter to a parish in Fall River, where further complaints about his behavior surfaced. In the early 1960s, Porter abused more than 60 North Attleboro children, and nearly 100 in southeastern Massachusetts. In 1964, Porter was arrested for molesting a 13-year-old boy and sent to a mental institution for 13 months. Once released, he was quickly reassigned to another parish, the first of many such reassignments over the years. He was shuffled into two more parishes before more accusations piled up and he was hospitalized again in 1967, this time to a hospital run by fellow priests who practiced holistic psychotherapy upon its patients, many of whom were clergy members suffering from psychological problems. Porter's \\"problem\\" was not unique among the hospital's patients; two of them were later imprisoned for abusing, between them, hundreds of children. Porter was released after a few months, once again declared cured, and given probationary assignments in parishes in Texas, New Mexico and Minnesota, all of which included access to children. Complaints surfaced by the dozen against Porter, but none of them resulted in disciplinary action beyond his being moved from post to post. In 1973, Porter wrote a letter to Pope Paul VI requesting to be released from the priesthood, in which he admitted molesting children across five states. The Pope granted his request and, in 1974, Porter gave up his collar. He married, and eventually settled in Minnesota. He and his wife, Verlyne (n√©e Bartlett), had four children. Following Porter's arrest years later, his family revealed that he was often emotionally and physically abusive toward them; Porter‚Äôs son Sean also told authorities that his father had sexually abused him. Caught In 1990, Frank Fitzpatrick went public with accusations that Porter had molested him as a child in the 1960s. Over the next two years, Fitzpatrick contacted the state police, the FBI, and the media. No one agreed to help him. He eventually reached attorney Roderick MacLeish, who had won a large sexual abuse case that year. MacLeish agreed to take the case on. He arranged for Fitzpatrick and five other Porter victims to talk to Joe Bergantino, an investigative reporter for WBZ-TV. Bergantino's piece attracted nation news and eventually more than 100 victims came forward to accuse Porter. The Boston Globe published more than 100 articles about the case. In 1992, a series of investigative reports by ABC News producer Grace Kahng on Porter's crimes aired on Primetime Live, hosted by Diane Sawyer, which sparked national attention. The initial Primetime Live broadcast revealed Porter had abused over 100 children in Massachusetts. Sawyer interviewed 30 adults who had been raped as elementary school children by Porter. The investigation and documents obtained by MacLeish revealed that instead of removing Porter after parents reported the abuse, the Catholic Church had moved him to a treatment center and then to Bemidji, Minnesota, where he continued to rape dozens of children. Primetime Live interviewed 30 of Porter's victims and their parents, and confronted the priest who had transferred Porter from Massachusetts to Minnesota knowing of his crimes. They also contacted Porter himself, who still had contact with children as a Sunday school teacher at his church. The ABC News investigation discovered and interviewed a local babysitter who said Porter had sexually abused her in 1984. After the report aired, it was discovered that Porter had also molested the babysitter's younger sister, a crime that was within the statute of limitations. This development allowed local Minnesota authorities to finally arrest Porter. Before Porter's arrest, Sawyer and her producer confronted the former priest at a local carnival. Arrest and first conviction Within weeks of the ABC News broadcast, Porter was arrested, tried and convicted of sexually abusing his children's babysitter. He served four months of a six- month prison sentence before his conviction was overturned by the Minnesota Supreme Court. The Porter case caused a national outcry and the U.S. Conference of Bishops adopted new guidelines for handling priests charged with child molestation. Second conviction and imprisonment By 1993, dozens of lawsuits had cropped up against Porter in Minnesota, Texas and New Mexico; in Minnesota alone, he was charged with over 200 counts of sexual abuse. Porter's lawyer struck a plea bargain, and Porter was sentenced to 18‚Äì20 years in prison, with the possibility of parole, with counseling, after six years. Parole was consistently denied for several years. He completed his prison sentence in 2004, but was held until his death pending a civil commitment hearing. Death Porter died February 11, 2005, of cancer at New England Medical Center in Boston, where he had been transferred the month before from a Massachusetts hospital. In popular culture The 1995 Law & Order episode \\"Bad Faith\\" and the 2010 Law & Order: UK episode \\"Confession\\" were based on Porter's case. His crimes were also referenced in the 2015 film Spotlight.

He lists baseball card collecting as one of his hobbies.1990 Topps Baseball Card Career Mulholland made his Major League debut on June 8, , with the San Francisco Giants. After that, he played for eleven different Major League teams: the Giants, the Phillies, the Yankees, the Mariners, the Cubs, the Braves, the Dodgers, the Pirates, the Indians, the Twins, and the Diamondbacks. He is well known for having one of the \\"nastiest\\" pickoff moves in the game.ESPN ‚Äì The definite pick ‚Äì MLB =San Francisco Giants= While pitching for the Giants, Mulholland made a play that is often shown on sports bloopers shows. After he grabbed a hard-hit ground ball, the ball got stuck in the webbing of his glove. Mulholland then ran towards first base and tossed his glove to first baseman Bob Brenly, who recorded the out. =Philadelphia Phillies= On June 18, , the Giants traded Mulholland, Dennis Cook and Charlie Hayes for former Cy Young Award winner Steve Bedrosian and a player to be named later. On August 15, , Mulholland no-hit the Giants 6-0 at Veterans Stadium. In pitching this, the first no-hitter in the stadium's history, Mulholland became the first pitcher to no-hit a former team since the Houston Colt .45s' Ken Johnson did so against the Cincinnati Reds in (Johnson lost the game 1-0‚Äîthe only game, to date, whose losing pitcher had pitched a nine- inning no-hitter). He faced the minimum of 27 batters. The only batter to reach base was on a throwing error by Hayes on Rick Parker's ground ball leading off the seventh inning; Parker was retired on Dave Anderson's double play ground ball one batter later. The 27th out was made by Hayes with a lunging catch of Gary Carter's line drive down the 3rd base line. He defeated Don Robinson, who also served up the 500th career home run to Phillies legend, Mike Schmidt, just three years earlier. Mulholland was named the starter for the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Mulholland started Game 6 for the Phillies in the 1993 World Series versus the Toronto Blue Jays. This game will always be remembered for Mitch Williams giving up the series-ending home run to Joe Carter. Mulholland was also the starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star Game played at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland. =Chicago Cubs= Terry was instrumental in the Cubs' playoff run, pitching in relief and as a starter, often on consecutive days. =Atlanta Braves= At the 1999 trading deadline, the Braves acquired Mulholland along with infielder Jos√© Hern√°ndez from the Chicago Cubs for Micah Bowie, Rub√©n Quevedo and a player to be named later. He appeared in 16 games down the stretch with the Braves, going 4-2 with an ERA of 2.98, during a season that the Braves went to the World Series. The next season, Mulholland was used as a spot starter for the Braves, and went 9-9 with a 5.11 ERA in 156.7 innings of work. He became a free agent after the season ended. =Minnesota Twins= While pitching for the Minnesota Twins Mulholland became one of the few players who have beaten every Major League team. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On June 21, , the Diamondbacks waived Mulholland.

History Proposals for the Mid-Hudson span were made by state legislature in 1923. Although the Bear Mountain Bridge in Orange County, New York and the Holland Tunnel in Manhattan were under construction, there were then no fixed highway crossings south of Albany. Then-Governor of New York Alfred E. Smith signed the bill in June 1923. Construction would be undertaken by the New York State Department of Public Works (now the New York State Department of Transportation). Construction began in 1925. Caissons weighing 66,000 tons were sunk into the riverbed; dirt was removed by crews working in a pressurized environment. The Gothic steel towers were constructed in April 1929. Three years after opening, ownership was transferred to the New York State Bridge Authority in 1933, shortly after the Authority was created. Then-Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor attended the opening ceremony on August 25, 1930. The toll plaza was originally located on the eastern side of the bridge, but was moved to the western side in Ulster County when a new highway approach was opened in December 1967. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York‚ÄìNew Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to eastbound-only at that time. The bridge was renamed the \\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge\\" in 1994. In 2009, composer Joseph Bertolozzi completed Bridge Music, a project which allows listeners to hear the Mid-Hudson bridge played like a musical instrument. The work was created for New York's 400th anniversary observance of Henry Hudson's voyage up the Hudson. Originally intended to be a live performance piece,Young, Alison (1 July 2007). \\"It's all in the ears of the beholder.\\" , Minnesota Public Radio (Minnesota).\\"Reuters Video: Hudson River Bridge Used For Music\\".

Description The bridge is long with a clearance of above the Hudson. At opening, it was the sixth-longest suspension bridge in the world. The chief engineer was Polish immigrant Ralph Modjeski, who had previously engineered the strengthening of the nearby Poughkeepsie Railroad bridge. Primary contractor was the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania with steel from Carnegie. The span contains stiffening trusses intentionally constructed on top of the deck instead of below the deck. The bridge carries three lanes of US 44 and NY 55 and a pedestrian/bicycle walkway over the Hudson. The bridge allows connections to US 9 on the east side, and US 9W to the west. The center lane is generally closed, except for rush hour traffic eastbound from 6am to 9am, and westbound from 3pm to 6pm. The center lane is also occasionally opened when work is being done on either side of the bridge. Five lane signals (referred to as \\"gantries\\" by NYSBA) indicate which lanes are open for travel. Approaches on either side of the bridge are four lanes, causing a bottleneck going onto the one- or two-lane span. The bridge has a computer-controlled LED decorative lighting system attached to the suspension cables, allowing the bridge to be decorated for Christmas (red, green) or the Fourth of July (red, white, and blue), and for other holidays.

Purpose This share gives the government organization, or other shareholder, the right of decisive vote, thus to vote all other shares, in a shareholder meeting. Usually this will be implemented through clauses in a company's articles of association, and will be designed to prevent stakebuilding above a certain percentage ownership level, or to give a government, or other shareholder, veto powers over any major corporate action, such as the sale of a major asset or subsidiary or of the company as a whole. In the context of government-owned golden shares, this share is often retained only for some defined period of time to allow a newly privatised company to become accustomed to operating in a public environment, unless ownership of the organisation concerned is deemed to be of ongoing importance to national interests, for example for reasons of national security. NATS Holdings, the UK's main air navigation service provider, is an example of a company with a golden share. History The term arose in the 1980s when the British government retained golden shares in companies it privatised, an approach later taken in many other European countries, as well as the former Soviet Union. It was introduced in Russia by law on November 16, 1992. Legal challenges The British government's golden share in BAA, the UK airports authority, was ruled illegal by European courts in 2003, when it was deemed contradictory to the principle of free circulation of capital within the European Union. The European Court of Justice also held that Portugal's holding of golden shares in Energias de Portugal is contrary to European Union law since it presented an unjustified restriction on free movement of capital. Other golden shares ruled illegal include the Spanish government's golden shares in Telefonica, Repsol YPF, Endesa, Argentaria and Tabacalera.

It is dedicated to the memory of Sergei Prokofiev. According to many, the last movement, \\"D√©ploration,\\" is the last piece Poulenc wrote before he died. It sits as a kind of obituary.  Music  The Oboe Sonata is very difficult in places, especially the Scherzo. The sorrowful D√©ploration also requires great skill. To express his mourning for his friend Prokofiev, Poulenc uses the extremes of the oboe. For example, in one passage the player must play a phrase at the bottom of the oboe's range including B flat, the oboe's lowest note, very loudly (fortissimo). The same phrase is then repeated but is marked to be played very quietly (pianissimo). Another obvious example of Poulenc's use of extreme scoring in the first movement is the starting theme which is very high and the player must be skilled to control the notes and keep them in tune. The piece is in three movements: #El√©gie (Paisiblement, Sans Presser) #Scherzo (Tr√®s anim√©) #D√©ploration (Tr√®s calme) The movements are in the order slow-fast-slow as opposed to the fast-slow-fast of the traditional sonata. A typical performance will last between 13 and 15 minutes. The sonata is the last of Poulenc's three sonatas for wind instruments and piano, the others being the Flute Sonata (1956) and the Clarinet Sonata (1962). Just after World War I he wrote a few other wind sonatas as well, for example a Sonata for two clarinets (FP 7a, 1918, revised 1945), a sonata for clarinet and bassoon (FP 32a. 1922, revised 1945), and a Sonata for horn, trumpet and trombone (FP 33a, 1922, revised 1945). Poulenc's wind sonatas share similar thematic material. For example, motifs in the final movement of the Clarinet Sonata can be heard in the Scherzo of the Oboe Sonata. Similarly, the Second Movement of the Clarinet Sonata opens with a motif that can be seen as an inversion of the opening of the El√©gie of the Oboe Sonata.

History The plan for a bridge to connect Achill Island to the Corraun peninsula was considered in the early 1880s. A Mayo County surveyor drew up plans, which were approved by J. Price, a civil engineer. The official authorization was received from The Board of Trade in London and in 1883 an administrative body was organized to finance it ; total cost was projected to be approximately ¬£5,000. The costs exceeded the estimates. However, John Grey Vesey Porter of County Fermanagh contributed his personal funds, so that the bridge could be built as designed. The bridge's structure consisted of a steel bowstring girder construction with a span of pivoting on a central pier. The roadway was in width. It was named for Michael Davitt, 19th Century Irish social campaigner, Fenian, and founder of the National Land League. Davitt officially opened the bridge in 1887. The 1887 bridge was designed for horse- drawn traffic and deteriorated with the advent of heavier motorized traffic in the 1900s. In 1947 the Mayo County Council planned to demolish and replace the bridge. J & C McGloughlin of Dublin undertook the construction, which was the largest bridge construction project by an Irish company at the time. It was completed in early 1949. By 2007 the bridge had a number of problems with its swing mechanism, which hindered boat traffic. A review of its structures indicated corrosion and the Mayo County Council gave its backing to provide a new swing bridge. Its new design by Malachy Walsh & Partners was based on a Spanish Calatrava architectural model. SIAC Construction undertook the work and it was opened in 2008. The finished bridge weighs 390 tons, but is still operated manually. In November 2010, the bridge failed to close for over 2 hours, which resulted in a traffic snarl. The Mayo County Council ordered the bridge consultants and contractors to investigate this failure. The senior engineer, Michael Mongan, said minor modifications were put in place to resolve the issues. The bridge recommenced operations on a trial basis with the bridge back in full operation by the end of March 2011. On September 3, 2017, the bridge celebrated its 130th anniversary.

Most PC motherboards with an LPC bus have either a Platform Controller Hub (PCH) or a southbridge chip, which acts as the host and controls the LPC bus. All other devices connected to the physical wires of the LPC bus are peripherals.  Overview  A diagram showing the LPC bus connecting the southbridge, the flash ROM, and the Super I/O chip The LPC bus was introduced by Intel in 1998 as a software-compatible substitute for the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus. It resembles ISA to software, although physically it is quite different. The ISA bus has a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus that can be used for both 16-bit I/O port addresses and 24-bit memory addresses; both run at speeds up to 8.33 MHz. The LPC bus uses a heavily multiplexed four-bit- wide bus operating at four times the clock speed (33.3 MHz) to transfer addresses and data with similar performance. LPC's main advantage is that the basic bus requires only seven signals, greatly reducing the number of pins required on peripheral chips. An integrated circuit using LPC will need 30 to 72 fewer pins than its ISA equivalent. It is also easier to route on modern motherboards, which are often quite crowded. The clock rate was chosen to match that of PCI in order to further ease integration. Also, LPC is intended to be a motherboard-only bus. No connector is defined, and no LPC peripheral daughterboards are available, except Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) with a TPM daughterboard whose pinout is proprietary to the motherboard vendor and POST cards for displaying BIOS diagnostic codes. Device discovery is not supported; since only motherboard devices or specific models of TPM are connected, the host firmware (BIOS, UEFI) image will include a static description of any devices and their I/O addresses expected to be present on a particular motherboard. = Signals = The LPC specification defines seven mandatory signals required for bidirectional data transfer: * LCLK: 33.3 MHz clock, provided by the host. May be connected to the conventional PCI clock (PCICLK), thereby not requiring a dedicated pin on the host (south bridge). * LRESET#: Active-low bus reset. May be connected to PCIRST#. * LFRAME#: This active-low signal indicates the beginning of an LPC bus transaction. Driven by the host only. * LAD[3:0]: These four bidirectional signals carry multiplexed address, data, and other information. Like the previous two control signals, these signals have weak pull-up resistors on them, so they will remain in the all-ones state if not actively driven by a device. There are six additional signals defined, which are optional for LPC devices that do not require their functionality, but support for the first two is mandatory for the host: * LDRQ#: DMA/bus master request. This is an output from a device that wants to perform direct memory access, either via the Intel 8237 compatible DMA controller, or the LPC-specific bus master protocol. The host must provide one corresponding input pin per device that needs it (minimum two). * SERIRQ: Serialized Intel 8259 compatible interrupt signal.Serialized IRQ Support For PCI Systems (Revision 6.0; September 1, 1995) One line is shared by all LPC devices and the host. * CLKRUN#: Open-collector signal used to restart the clock in systems that can stop it for power management. Not required if the host does not stop the clock. May be connected to the equivalent PCI signal. * LPME#: Open-collector power management event, to wake the system from a sleep state. Equivalent to the PCI bus PME# signal. * LPCPD#: Optional output from the host to warn the LPC device that power is about to be removed and it should not make any interrupt or DMA requests. * LSMI#: System management interrupt request. This is only required if an LPC device needs to trigger an SMI# in response to a bus access (e.g. to perform software emulation of a missing hardware peripheral). Otherwise, the slower SERIRQ protocol can be used to request an SMI. = Timing and performance = The LPC bus derives its electrical conventions from those of conventional PCI. In particular, it shares the restriction that two idle cycles are required to \\"turn around\\" any bus signal so that a different device is \\"speaking\\". In the first, the bus is actively driven high. In the second, the bus is undriven and held high by the pull-up resistors. A new device may begin sending data over the bus on the third cycle. LPC operations spend a large fraction of their time performing such turn-arounds. As mentioned, the LPC bus is designed to have performance similar to the ISA bus. The exact data transfer rates depend on the type of bus access (I/O, memory, DMA, firmware) performed and by the speed of the host and the LPC device. All bus cycles except the 128-byte firmware read cycle, in which 256 of the 273 clock ticks consumed by this cycle actually are used to transfer data to get a throughput of 15.63 MB/s, spend a majority of their time in overhead rather than data transfer. The next fastest bus cycle, the 32-bit ISA-style DMA write cycle that is defined in this standard, can transfer up to 6.67 MB/s because only 8 out of 20 clock ticks used in this bus cycle actually transfer data with the rest of the cycles are overhead. One of the slowest bus cycles is a simple memory read or write, where only 2 of the 17 clock ticks (plus any wait states imposed by the device) transfer data, for a transfer rate of 1.96 MB/s. = Applications = Intel designed the LPC bus so that the system BIOS image could be stored in a single flash memory chip directly connected to the LPC bus. Intel also made it possible to put operating system images and software applications on a single flash memory chip directly connected to the LPC bus, as an alternative to a Parallel ATA port. A CPLD or FPGA can implement an LPC host or peripheral. The original Xbox game console has an LPC debug port that can be used to force the Xbox to boot new code. O. Theis. \\"Modding the XBox\\". section \\"Details of the LPC\\".  ISA-compatible operation  All LPC bus transactions are initiated by the host briefly driving LFRAME# low, for one cycle at least. During the last cycle with LFRAME# low (referred to as the START field), the host drives LAD[3:0] to all-zeros to indicate an ISA-compatible transaction will follow. During the first cycle with LFRAME# high again, the host drives a \\"cycle type/direction\\" (CTDIR) field: three bits indicating the type (I/O, memory, or DMA) and direction (read from device, or write to device) of the transfer to follow. This is usually followed by the transfer address field. The size of the address depends on the type of cycle: * For I/O access, the address is 16 bits, transferred most-significant nibble first over 4 cycles. * For system memory access, the address is 32 bits, transferred most-significant nibble first over 8 cycles. * ISA-style DMA accesses do not have an address per se, but a two clock cycles transfer a nibble containing the DMA channel number, and a second nibble giving the transfer size. The memory address is programmed into the ISA-style DMA controller in the chipset or the CPU outside of the LPC bus. See the section on DMA below. =ISA-compatible reads and writes= Memory and I/O accesses are allowed as single-byte accesses only. For a write, the address described above is followed by the data field, 8 bits transferred with the least significant nibble first over two cycles. Following this, the host turns the bus over to the device. This turn-around take two cycles, and operates the same way as the conventional PCI bus control signals: for one cycle, the host drives the LAD lines high (1111). During the second cycle, the host ceases to drive the lines, although they remain high due to the pull-up resistors. The device may drive the lines beginning with the third cycle. Following any turn-around to the device is a minimum of one SYNC cycle. The number is variable, under the control of the device to add as many wait states as it needs. The bit patterns 0101 and 0110 indicate that the sync cycles will continue. The wait ends when the device drives a pattern of 0000 (ready) or 1010 (error) on the LAD bus for one cycle. In the case of reads, this is followed by 8 bits of data, transferred least significant nibble first over two cycles, the same as for a write. The device then turns the bus around to the host again (taking another two cycles), and the transfer is complete; the host may send the START field of another transfer on the next cycle. If the host attempts a transfer to an unused address, no device will drive the SYNC cycles and the host will see 1111 on the LAD bus. After seeing three cycles of 1111 (two cycles are allowed, in addition to the two turn-around cycles, for a slow device to decode the address and begin driving SYNC patterns), the host will abort the operation. = ISA-compatible DMA = The Platform Controller Hub (PCH) chip or the southbridge chip acts as the host and controls the LPC bus. It also acts as the central DMA controller for devices on that bus if the memory controller is in the chipset. In CPUs that contain their own memory controller(s), the DMA controller is located in the CPU. For compatibility with software originally written for systems with the ISA bus, the DMA controller contains the circuit equivalents of \\"legacy\\" onboard peripherals of the IBM PC/AT architecture, such as the two programmable interrupt controllers, the programmable interval timer, and two ISA DMA controllers, which are all involved in \\"ISA-style DMA\\". ISA-compatible DMA uses an Intel 8237-compatible DMA controller on the host, which keeps track of the location and length of the memory buffer, as well as the direction of the transfer. The device simply requests service from a given DMA channel number, and the host performs a DMA access on the LPC bus. DMA requests are made using the device's LDRQ# signal. Normally high, a device can indicate a transition on an ISA- compatible DRQ line by sending a 6-bit request: a 0 start bit, the 3-bit DMA channel number (most significant bit first), one bit of new request level (almost always 1, indicating that a DMA transfer is requested), and a final 1 stop bit. The host then performs a DMA cycle. DMA cycles are named based on the memory access, so a \\"read\\" is a transfer from memory to the device, and a \\"write\\" is a transfer from the device to memory. The \\"address\\" consists of two cycles: a 3-bit channel number and 1-bit terminal count indication (the ISA bus's TC pin, or the 8237's EOP# output), followed by a 2-bit transfer size. By default, DMA channels 0-3 perform 8-bit transfers, and channel 5-7 perform 16-bit transfers; but an LPC-specific extension allows 1-, 2-, or 4-byte transfers on any channel. When a multi-byte transfer is performed, each byte has its own SYNC field, as described below. DMA transfers allow an additional SYNC field value: a pattern of 1001 indicates that the device is ready with the current byte, and also wishes to transfer more bytes. The standard \\"ready\\" pattern of 0000 indicates that this is the last byte. A normal SYNC \\"ready\\" pattern of 0000 (or an error pattern of 1010) requests that the host stop DMA after the immediately following byte until the device makes another DMA request via the LDRQ# signal. A pattern of 1001 indicates that the host should consider he device's DMA request still active; the host will continue with any remaining bytes in this transfer or start another transfer, as appropriate, without a separate request via LDRQ#. For a DMA write, where data is transferred from the device, the SYNC field is followed by the 8 bits of data and another SYNC field, until the host-specified length for this transfer is reached, or the device stops the transfer. A two-cycle turnaround field completes the transaction. For a DMA read, where data is transferred to the device, the SYNC field is followed by a turnaround, and the data‚Äîturnaround‚Äîsync‚Äîturnaround sequence repeats for each byte transferred. = Serialized interrupts = Serialized interrupts are transmitted over a single shared SERIRQ line with the help of the clock. A time slot is dedicated to each interrupt request, with the initial synchronization being done by the host. As a simplified example: * The host drives the SERIRQ line low for eight clocks, then high for another, and lets the bus float for a final turnaround cycle. * If a device needs to request IRQ#6, it waits for 6√ó3=18 clocks, then drives SERIRQ low for a clock and high for another. The devices can synchronize at the first step because the line can only be driven low for two or more consecutive clocks by the host: no other device drives it low for more than one clock. The host recognizes the sources of the interrupts by watching the line while counting the number of clocks: if it sees the SERIRQ line being driven low at the eighteenth clock, then IRQ 18/3=6 is asserted. The above is the continuous mode, where the host initiates the protocol. In the quiet mode, a device requests interruption by driving SERIRQ low for a clock. The host then continues driving the line low for the other seven clocks. From this point on, the protocol is the same. In both modes, the number of clocks of the initial synchronization pulse may range from four to eight. At the beginning, the protocol works in continuous mode. At the end of each complete bus transaction (after the host has driven SERIRQ low and then waited for all devices to send interrupt requests) the host sends a final message: it drives the SERIRQ line low for two or three clocks depending on the mode that will be used in the next transaction. The advantage of using serialized interrupts over the traditional mechanism is that only the single SERIRQ line is necessary (apart from the clock, which is present anyway), not a line for each interrupt level.  LPC non-ISA cycles  START field values other than 0000 are used to indicate various non-ISA-compatible transfers. The supported transfers are: ; START = 1101, 1110: Firmware memory read and write : This allows the firmware (BIOS) to be located outside the usual peripheral address space. These transfers are similar to ISA-compatible transfers, except that: :* There is no CTDIR field; the direction is encoded in the START field (1101 for read, 1110 for write). :* A chip select field of 4 bits exists to allow the selection of one firmware hub out of many. For example, a second firmware hub can be used to hold a backup BIOS in case the primary BIOS is corrupted by malware or a bad flash. :* The address is 28 bits. It is transferred most significant nibble first. :* The address is followed by a size field. Supported read/write sizes are 1, 2, and 4 bytes. Supported read-only sizes are 16 or 128 bytes. :* The data is transferred in one continuous burst, with no wait states. There is only one SYNC field for the whole transfer. ; START = 0010, 0011: Bus master DMA : Up to two devices on an LPC bus can request a bus master transfer by using the LDRQ# signal to request use of the reserved DMA channel 4. In this case, the host will begin a transfer with a special START field of 0010 for bus master 0 or 0011 for bus master 1, followed immediately by two turnaround cycles to hand the bus to the device requesting the bus master DMA cycle. Following the turnaround cycles, the transfer proceeds very much like a host-initiated ISA-compatible transfer with the roles reversed: :* The device sends a one-cycle CTDIR field (only I/O and memory transfer types are permitted). :* The device sends an address (16 or 32 bits, depending on the type). It is transferred most significant nibble first. :* The device sends a one-cycle transfer size field, encoding 8, 16 or 32 bits. :* In the case of a write, the data follows. Unlike ISA-compatible DMA cycles, the data is transferred in one burst, with no more wait states. :* Then come two turn- around cycles while the LAD bus is handed back to the host. :* A variable- length SYNC field is inserted, under control of the host. :* In the case of a read, the data provided by the host follows. :* This is different from 16-bit ISA bus mastering because LPC bus mastering requires a 32-bit memory address when performing a memory transfer, does not use an ISA-style DMA channel, and can support 8, 16, or 32-bit transfers; while 16-bit ISA bus mastering requires a 24-bit memory address when performing a memory transfer, requires the use of an ISA-style DMA channel, and cannot perform 32-bit transfers. ; START = 1111: Transaction abort : At any time, although typically in response to an error by the device during a SYNC field, the host may abort the current transaction by driving LFRAME# low without waiting for the current transaction to end. It must hold it low for at least 4 cycles, then return it high with a special START field value of 1111. This performs a soft reset of the LPC bus and leaves the bus idle until the next transfer is commenced by driving LFRAME# low again. ; START = 0101: TPM Locality access : Recent Trusted Platform Module specifications define special TPM-Read cycles and TPM-Write cycles that are based on the I/O Read and the I/O Write cycles.. These cycles use a START field with the formerly-reserved value of 0101 and place a 16-bit memory address offset in the address field. These cycles are used when using a TPM's locality facility.  Supported peripherals  The LPC bus specification limits what type of peripherals may be connected to it. It only allows devices that belong to the following classes of devices: super I/O devices, integrated audio including either AC'97 devices or devices that implemented the Sound Blaster interface, generic-application memory including nonvolatile BIOS memory, firmware hubs, and embedded controllers. Furthermore, each class is restricted on which bus cycles are allowed for each class. Super I/O devices and audio devices are allowed to accept I/O cycles, accept ISA-style third- party DMA cycles, and generate bus master cycles. Generic-application memory devices like nonvolatile BIOS memory and LPC flash devices are allowed to accept memory cycles. Firmware hubs are allowed to accept firmware memory cycles. Embedded controllers are allowed to accept I/O cycles and generate bus master cycles. Some ISA cycles that were deemed not useful to these classes were removed. They include host-initiated two-byte memory cycles and host- initiated two-byte I/O cycles. These removed transfer types could be initiated by the host on ISA buses but not on LPC buses. The host would have to simulate two-byte cycles by splitting them up into two one-byte cycles. The ISA bus has a similar concept because the original 8-bit ISA bus required 16-bit cycles to be split up. Therefore, the 16-bit ISA bus automatically split 16-bit cycles into 8-bit cycles for the benefit of 8-bit ISA peripherals unless the ISA device being targeted by a 16-bit memory or I/O cycle asserted a signal that told the bus that it could accept the requested 16-bit transfer without assistance from an ISA cycle splitter. ISA-style bus mastering has been replaced in the LPC bus with a bus mastering protocol that does not rely on the ISA-style DMA controllers at all. This was done in order to remove ISA's limit on what type of bus master cycles a device is allowed to initiate on which DMA channel. The ISA-style bus cycles that were inherited by LPC from ISA are one-byte host-initiated I/O bus cycles, one-byte host-initiated memory cycles, and one- or two-byte host-initiated ISA-style DMA cycles. However, some non-ISA bus cycles were added. Cycles that were added to improve the performance of devices beside firmware hubs include LPC-style one-, two-, and four-byte bus master memory cycles; one-, two-, and four-byte bus master I/O cycles; and 32-bit third-party DMA which conforms to all of the restrictions of ISA-style third-party DMA except for the fact that it can do 32-bit transfers. Any device that is allowed to accept traditional ISA-style DMA is also allowed to use this 32-bit ISA-style DMA. The host could initiate 32-bit ISA-style DMA cycles, while peripherals could initiate bus master cycles. Firmware hubs consumed firmware cycles that were designed just for firmware hubs so that firmware addresses and normal memory-mapped I/O addresses could overlap without conflict. Firmware memory reads could read 1, 2, 4, 16, or 128 bytes at once. Firmware memory writes could write one, two or four bytes at once.

She was also a younger paternal half-sister of Lady Anne Brandon and Lady Mary Brandon from her father's second marriage. After her mother's death in 1533, her father remarried to Catherine Willoughby and Eleanor became an elder half- sister of Henry Brandon, 2nd Duke of Suffolk and Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk. Her paternal grandparents were Sir William Brandon and Elizabeth Bruyn. Her maternal grandparents were Henry VII of England and his queen consort Elizabeth of York. She was thus a niece of Henry VIII. Countess of Cumberland Lady Eleanor was a descendant of a member of the Tudor dynasty and therefore her marriage would advance the political ambitions of any given husband.

Portrait There is a discrepancy as to who the sitter is in the Hans Eworth portrait which is featured. The coat of arms in the top left corner, which may have been added later, are the impaled arms (those of a husband and wife) of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, and his wife Lady Eleanor, daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France. As a result, the painting has been frequently exhibited in the past as a portrait of Lady Eleanor, regardless of the fact that she died in 1547, well before the date of this portrait. It is, however, a rule of heraldry that impaled arms are not used by the children of a marriage, as they would have their own. Hence the later addition and erroneous use of the arms here suggests that the identity of the portrait was already unclear only two or three generations after it was painted, a situation by no means unusual amid the frequent early deaths, multiple marriages, and shifting alliances and fortunes of the most powerful families of the Tudor era. Later the portrait was thought to represent the only child of Eleanor and Henry to survive infancy, Margaret. Unfortunately the inscription on the right which might have provided a check (Margaret would have been aged 25‚Äì28 at the time of this portrait) has been truncated; although the Roman numerals of the year can apply only to 1565-8, the age of the sitter cannot be ascertained with any useful accuracy. The National Portrait Gallery has an online sketch of this portrait identified as Lady Eleanor, but the portrait remains in dispute.Eleanor Clifford (n√©e Brandon), Countess of Cumberland, probably by Alfred Thomas Derby, after unknown artist, Purchased, 1893, Reference Collection NPG D23066.

The Portuguese and Dutch had held some of the maritime provinces of the island for centuries before the advent of the British Empire.Cook, Elsie K (1953). Ceylon ‚Äì Its Geography, Its Resources and Its People. London: Macmillan & Company Ltd 1953. pp 272‚Äî274. With the establishment of Ceylon as a crown colony at the end of the 18th century, most of those who retained close ties with the Netherlands departed. However, a significant community of Burghers remained and largely adopted the English language. During British rule they occupied a highly important place in Sri Lankan social and economic life. Portuguese settlers on Ceylon were essentially traders, but wished to form colonies, and Lisbon did nothing to discourage European settlement‚Äîeven to the extent of advocating intermarriage with the Sinhalese. This was not encouraged by the Sinhalese. It was not the policy of the Dutch East India Company to endorse similar unions, although a number of unofficial liaisons between its employees and local women occurred in the late eighteenth century. Burghers may vary from generation to generation in physical characteristics; some intermarried with the British and produced descendants with predominantly European phenotypes, including fairer skin and a heavier physique, while others were almost indistinguishable from Sinhalese or Tamils. Most Burgher people have preserved European customs; especially among those of Portuguese ancestry, who \\"retained their European religion and language with pride.\\"Smith, IR. Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Phonology. 1978. Dravidian Linguistics Association.  Legal definition  The Burghers were legally defined in 1883 by the Chief Justice of Ceylon, Sir Richard Ottley, given before the Commission, appointed in connection with the establishment of a legislative council in Ceylon. Burghers were defined as those whose father was born in Sri Lanka, with at least one European ancestor on one's direct paternal side, regardless of the ethnic origin of one's mother, or what other ethnic groups may be found on the father's side. Because of this definition, Burghers almost always have European surnames (mostly of Portuguese, Dutch and British origin, but sometimes German, French or Russian).  History  The Portuguese arrived in 1505 in what outsiders then called Ceylon. Since there were no women in the Portuguese navy, the Portuguese sailors married local Sinhalese and Tamil women. This practice was encouraged by the Portuguese. The Dutch first made contact and signed a trade agreement with the Kingdom of Kandy in 1602. From 1640 on the Dutch East India Company (VOC) ('Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie' or United East India Company) had a governor installed and conquered more and more fords from the Portuguese, until, in 1658, the last Portuguese were expelled. However, they permitted a few stateless persons of Portuguese-Jewish (Marrano) descent, and of mixed Portuguese-Sinhalese ancestry to stay. Many people having a Portuguese name were a result of forced conversions of local/native people in order to work for the Portuguese. As a result, Burghers with Portuguese names are most likely to be of Sinhalese ancestry, with a very small portion being Portuguese or mixed Portuguese-Sinhalese ancestry. Those of a Portuguese- Jewish background can be traced in various forms or surmised from their surname. Most Burghers of Eurasian descent with Portuguese surnames are of Sinhalese and Dutch, British, German and/or other European descent. During the Dutch period, all Dutch colonial operations were overseen by the VOC. Virtually all Burghers from this period were employees of the VOC. The VOC employed not only Dutch nationals, but also enlisted men from the Southern Netherlands, the German states, Denmark and Austria. It is therefore not unusual to find ancestors from these countries in many Dutch Burgher family trees. The term 'Burgher' comes from the Dutch word burger, meaning \\"citizen\\" or \\"town dweller\\", and is cognate with the French and English word \\"bourgeois\\". At this time in Europe, there had emerged a middle class, consisting of people who were neither aristocrats nor serfs. These were the traders and businessmen, who lived in towns and were considered free citizens. In Europe, they were called burghers, and they were encouraged to migrate to the colonies in order to expand business horizons. Dutch Ceylon had two classes of people of European descent: those who were paid by the VOC and were referred to as Company servants (i.e. employees), and those who had migrated of their own free will. The latter were not referred to as burghers in Ceylon, but rather by their rank, position or standing. During British colonial rule, they were referred to by the British as 'Dutch Burghers' and formed the European-descended civilian population in Ceylon. To some degree the term of Burgher was used in a derogatory way to divide and conquer the population, as it distinguished between British and other races or positions. The 'Dutch Burgher' community took pride in its own achievements and prized their European ancestry. A number of Dutch Burgher Union journals have been created over a period of time, to record family histories. They were not only of Dutch origin but incorporated European (Dutch, German, Hungarian, Italian, French, Swedish etc.), United Kingdom, Portuguese Mix, and Sinhalese lines. When the British took over in 1796, many VOC employees chose to leave. However, a significant number chose to stay, mostly those of mixed descent. Some chose to go to Batavia, which was the headquarters of the VOC. Reportedly about 900 families, both free citizens and United East India Company employees, decided to remain in Ceylon. The British referred to them all as 'Dutch Burghers'. One condition of their being allowed to stay was that they had to sign a Treaty of Capitulation to the British. Many 'Dutch Burghers' can find their ancestors' names in this treaty. At the time of the British conquest, the 900 'Dutch Burgher' families residing in Ceylon were concentrated in Colombo, Galle, Matara and Jaffna. The Burghers included members of the Swiss de Meuron Regiment, a mercenary unit employed by the VOC. In diplomatic negotiations in Europe, Count de Meuron pledged allegiance to the British in exchange for back pay and information. This allowed the British to get detailed fortification information and reduce the fighting strength of Ceylon prior to 1796. The de Meuron Regiment refused to fight the Dutch due to relationships forged on the island of Ceylon and South Africa. Post 1796 members of the de Meuron Regiment stayed in Ceylon, whilst the regiment itself went off to fight and distinguish itself in India and later in Canada. Society =Demographics= In the census of 1981, the Burgher population of Sri Lanka was 39,374 persons, about 0.2% of the total population. The highest concentration of Burghers is in Colombo (0.72%) and Gampaha (0.5%). There are also significant communities in Trincomalee and Batticaloa, with an estimated population of 20,000. Burgher descendants are spread throughout the world. Families with surnames such as Van Dort (or the variant Vandort) are of Dutch ancestry. =Language= Percentage of burghers per district based on 2001 or 1981 (cursive) census. Nowadays Burgher people predominantly speak Sinhala. Until the early 20th century, many Burghers spoke English and a form of Portuguese Creole, even those of Dutch descent. Portuguese Creole had been the language of trade and communication with Sri Lankans. It is now only spoken in parts of the coastal towns of Trincomalee and Batticaloa. While much vocabulary is from Portuguese, its grammar is based on that of Tamil and Sinhala. Depending on where they live in Sri Lanka, Burghers may also additionally speak English and or Tamil. According to the 2012 Census 73.6% or 24,412 Burghers also spoke English and 88.3% or 29,277 Burghers also spoke Tamil.  Culture  Burgher culture is a mixture of East and West, reflecting their ancestry. They are the most Europeanised of the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. Most of them wear modern contemporary clothing, although it is not uncommon for a man to be seen wearing a sarong, or for a woman to wear a sari. A number of elements in Burgher culture have become part of the cultures of other ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. For example, baila music, which has its origin in the music of 16th- century Portugal, has found its way into mainstream popular Sinhalese music. Lacemaking, which began as a domestic pastime of Burgher women, is now a part of Sinhalese culture too. Even certain foods, such as love cake, breudher, bol fiado (layered cake), ijzer koekjes (iron cookies), frikkadels (savoury meatballs) and lamprais, have become an integral part of Sri Lankan national cuisine. Burghers are not physically homogeneous. It is possible to have a blond, pale white-skinned Burgher, as well as a Burgher with a very dark complexion and black hair, a Burgher with complexion from brown to light brown and black hair, and a Burgher with fairer complexion and black hair. Pale- skinned and dark-skinned children can even appear as brother and sister in the same family of the same parents. Burghers share a common culture rather than a common ethnicity. Burghers have a very strong interest in their family histories. Many old Burgher families kept stamboeken (from the Dutch for \\"clan books\\"). These recorded not only dates of births, marriages and deaths, but also significant events in the history of a family, such as details of moving house, illnesses, school records, and even major family disputes. An extensive, multi-volume stamboek of many family lineages is kept by the Dutch Burgher Union. Individual families often have indigenous European traditions reflecting their specific family origins. Burghers of Dutch origin sometimes celebrate the Feast of Saint Nicholas in December, and those of Portuguese- Jewish origin observe customs such as the separation time of a woman after childbirth (see Leviticus 12:2-5), the redemption of the Firstborn (Pidyon ha- Ben), and the purification bath (taharah) after a daughter‚Äôs first period (see niddah). Most of the latter Burgher families, being unaware of the Jewish origins of these customs, have given them a Catholic slant. (Catholic and Episcopal churches had services for the churching of women after childbirth from ancient times.) However, some traditions attributed to Judaism can also be explained as borrowings or retention from the Tamil and Sinhalese communities with whom many Burgher families also share ancestry and culture. For example, the purification bath after a girl‚Äôs first period is a common cultural feature of the Tamil and Sinhalese communities of Sri Lanka and neighboring India. Hence its prevalence amongst some Burghers families of Sri Lanka is not necessarily of Jewish origins. Some commentators believe that the Burghers‚Äô own mixed backgrounds have made their culture more tolerant and open.

This subset of forced migration has been historically associated with the construction of dams for hydroelectric power and irrigation but is also the result of various development projects such as mining, agriculture, the creation of military installations, airports, industrial plants, weapon testing grounds, railways, road developments, urbanization, conservation projects, and forestry. Development-induced displacement is a social problem affecting multiple levels of human organization, from tribal and village communities to well-developed urban areas. Development is widely viewed as an inevitable step towards modernization and economic growth in developing countries; however, for those who are displaced, the end result is most often loss of livelihood and impoverishment. Classification of development-induced displaced persons (DIDPs), refugees and internally displaced persons rests on fundamental differences in the type of assistance provided to each category. Refugees and internally displaced persons typically need international protection and assistance as a result of fleeing violence and persecution. Development-induced displaced persons require the restoration of their capacity to generate income and protection from the state. While people displaced as a result of development have similar experiences to refugees (as defined by the UNHCR) in terms of economic and social loss, they are not protected by international law.  Types of displacement  \\"Primary\\" or \\"direct\\" displacement occurs when people are moved from their traditional lands to make way for a development project or when people move towards a project to meet a new labor demand. Primary displacement is usually predictable and can therefore be mitigated through planning. \\"Secondary\\" or \\"indirect\\" displacement is a result of environmental, geographical and socio- political consequences of the development project that take place over time and distance from the initial project. This type of displacement is less predictable and difficult to control. One example of secondary displacement is if a community is forced to move because of pollution of their water supply by a mining project. Some examples of development-induced displacement are: * Three Gorges Dam in China ‚Äì A hydroelectric dam on China's Yangtze River constructed between 1994 and 2006, which displaced over 1.4 million people through primary and secondary displacement. * Sardar Sarovar Dam in India ‚Äì The largest dam in the Narmada Valley Project, which displaced over 40,000 people. The dam was the subject of protest by environment groups and tribal groups during the 1980s and 1990s. * Ahafo Mine in Ghana ‚Äì An open-pit mine which displaced approximately 10,000 people in 2005 and 2006. Most of the displaced were subsistence farmers, but the mining company, Newmont, denied them compensation for loss of land. * Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in India ‚Äì Between 1999 and 2003, 24 villages were displaced to reintroduce the Asiatic Lion to the area. Resettlement and enforcement of forest boundaries disrupted social and economic ties between the displaced and the host community. * Pacific Park/Atlantic Yards in the US ‚Äì A mixed-use development in New York City that began construction on 2010, involving eminent domain, the destruction of 12 buildings, and several lawsuits.  Effects  It has been estimated that fifteen million people each year are forced to leave their homes as a result of public and private development projects and that number continues to increase as countries move from developing to developed nations. Compensation and rehabilitation policies designed to mitigate effects of displacement are often unsuccessful. This is largely due to corruption of street level bureaucrats, underestimation of the value of resources, failure of planners to recognize the intricacies of the existing social and economic systems of the displaced and lack of involvement of displaced persons in the planning process. Communities and individuals are most often only compensated monetarily, without proper mechanisms for addressing their grievances or political support to improve their livelihoods. When land is used as compensation, it is often inadequate in terms of size, location and natural resources. Land tenure laws may also prevent resettlement policy from being effective. Poor and indigenous people are mostly affected by displacement as they have few political and monetary resources. Michael Cernea's impoverishment and reconstruction model (IRR) sets forth eight potential risks of displacement: # Landlessness # Joblessness # Homelessness # Marginalization # Food insecurity # Increased morbidity and mortality # Loss of access to common property # Social Disarticulation The consensus among researchers is that impoverishment due to loss of capacity to generate income is the most apparent effect of DIDR. Additionally, displacement severs social ties which are often crucial for survival in indigenous communities. Loss of connection to historical, religious, symbolic or spatial locations resulting from forced migration diminishes cultural identity. Development-induced displaced persons, like refugees and internally displaced persons, experience psychological stress as well as feelings of helplessness and distrust towards their government and humanitarian groups. While the state is charged with protecting them as equal citizens, they are considered \\"others\\" and left to bear the cost for those who will benefit. Women are disproportionately affected by DIDR as the loss of land used by women to generate economic worth further marginalizes their socio-economic standing as they become more dependent on their husbands.  Policy and mitigation  The work of sociologists and anthropologists studying displaced populations gradually led to a body of theoretical and conceptual knowledge. Development planners were eventually forced to rely on the work of social scientists in order to devise resettlement plans. Cernea explains that, assisted by dissent from NGOs and displaced persons themselves, a \\"ripple effect\\" of early policies led to expansion of resettlement policy which continues to broaden over time. Resettlement policy may be adopted by the state, regional associations, private development companies, NGOs, large financial institutions and the United Nations. Regardless of the source of the policy, local-level participation during all stages of the planning process is crucial to mitigating negative outcomes. Policies adopted by large financial institutions (mainly the World Bank and OECD), NGOs (The Brookings Institution) and the World Commission on Dams provide guidelines for resettlement of those displaced by development. Implementation of these policies is often lacking and, with no political mandate, the guidelines are usually ineffective. State involvement is dependent on political will but the precarious position of the state as \\"player and referee\\" leaves the displaced with little protection. In 1998, the United Nations was presented with the Guiding Principals on Internal Displacement, a set of guidelines proposed by group of legal scholars identifying rights and protections for internally displaced people. These guidelines specifically name the state as the protector of the rights of its citizens against the effects of development- induced displacement. Should the state fail to protect the rights of DIDRs, the Guidelines state that the international community must respond. In 2002, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs established an IDP Unit to investigate instances of DIDR. There is currently no enforceable international law governing DIDR.

It stems from a compositional tradition that dates back to the introduction of musique concr√®te (a form of musique exp√©rimentale)Palombini, C. (1998), \\"Pierre Schaeffer, 1953: towards an Experimental Music', an exegesis of Schaeffer's 'Vers une musique exp√©rimentale', Music & Letters 74 (4): 542--57, Oxford University Press. in the late 1940s. Unlike musical works that are realised using sheet music exclusively, compositions that are purely acousmatic (in listening terms) often exist solely as fixed media audio recordings. The compositional practice of acousmatic music features acousmatic sound as a central musical aspect. Other aspects traditionally thought of as 'musical' such as melody, harmony, rhythm, metre may be present but more often consideration is given to sound- based characteristics such as timbre and spectrum. Compositional materials can include sounds derived from musical instruments, voice, electronically generated sound, audio that has been manipulated using various effect processors, as well as general sound effects and field recordings. The music is produced with the aid of various music technologies, such as digital recorders, digital signal processing tools and digital audio workstations. Using such technology various sound materials can be combined, juxtaposed, and transformed in any conceivable manner. In this context the compositional method can be seen as a process of sound organisation: a term first used by the French composer Edgard Var√®se.Ouellette, Fernand (1973), Edgard Var√®se, London: Calder and Boyars. Origins According to certain historical accounts, the origin of the term acousmatic can be traced back to Pythagoras; the philosopher is believed to have tutored his students from behind a screen so as not to let his presence distract them from the content of his lectures. Under these conditions, the listener focuses on the sounds being produced to heighten the sense of hearing. In 1955, J√©r√¥me Peignot and Pierre Schaeffer were the first to use the term acousmatique to define the listening experience of musique concr√®te.Peignot, J. (1960), De la musique concr√®te √† l'acousmatique, Esprit, No. 280. Paris: Esprit: 111-123. It is said to be derived from akousmatikoi, the outer circle of Pythagoras' disciples who only heard their teacher speaking from behind a veil. In a similar way, one hears acousmatic music from behind the 'veil' of loudspeakers, without seeing the source of the sound.Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), Trait√© des objets musicaux, Paris: √âditions du Seuil. Developments Within academia the term acousmatic music, or acousmatic art,Dufour, D. (1989), \\"Peu importe le son\\", Le Son des musiques, Symposium Ina-GRM and France-Culture, Paris: Ina- GRM/Buchet-Chastel.Dhomont, F. (1996), \\"Is there a Quebec sound\\", Organised Sound, 1(1), Cambridge University Press. has gained common usage, particularly when referring to contemporary musique concr√®te; however, there is some dispute as to whether acousmatic practice relates to a style of composition or a way of listening to sound.McFarlane, M.W. (2001). \\"The Development of Acousmatics in Montr√©al\\", eContact!, 6.2, Journal of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community, Montreal. Scruton defines the experience of sound as inherently acousmatic, as Lydia Goehr (1999) paraphrases, \\"the sound world is not a space into which we can enter; it is a world we treat at a distance\\".Bauer, Amy. \\"'Tone-Color, Movement, Changing Harmonic Planes': Cognition, Constraints, and Conceptual Blends in Modernist Music\\", in Ashby, Arved Mark (ed.) (2004), The Pleasure of Modernist Music. University of Rochester Press. Style Acousmatic music may contain sounds that have recognizably musical sources, but may equally present recognizable sources that are beyond the bounds of traditional vocal and instrumental technology. We are as likely to hear the sounds of a bird, or of a factory as we are the sounds of a violin. The technology involved transcends the mere reproduction of sounds. Techniques of synthesis and sound processing are employed which may present us with sounds that are unfamiliar and that may defy clear source attribution. Acousmatic compositions may present us with familiar musical events: chords, melodies and rhythms which are easily reconcilable with other forms of music, but may equally present us with events which cannot be classified within such a traditional taxonomy.Windsor, W.L. (1995). \\"A Perceptual Approach to the Description and Analysis of Acousmatic Music\\", Ph. D Thesis, City University Department of Music, September 1995, Sheffield. Performance practice Acousmatic compositions are sometimes presented to audiences in concert settings that are often indistinguishable from acoustic recitals, albeit without performers. In an acousmatic concert the sound component is produced using pre-recorded media, or generated in real-time using a computer. The sound material will then be distributed spatially, via multiple loudspeakers, using a practice known as \\"sound diffusion\\". The work is often diffused by the composer (if present) but the role of interpreter can also be assumed by another practitioner of the art. To provide a guideline for spatialisation of the work by an interpreter, many composers provide a diffusion score; in its simplest form this might be a graphic representation of the acousmatic work with indications for spatial manipulations, relative to a time-line.Emmerson, Simon (2007). \\"Living Electronic Music\\", Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate. The acousmatic experience In acousmatic music, listeners are challenged to distinguish sounds, not based on their source, but by their sonic quality. As Pierre Schaeffer writes in his Treatise on Musical Objects \\"The concealment of the causes does not result from a technical imperfection, nor is it an occasional process of variation: it becomes a precondition, a deliberate placing-in-condition of the subject. It is toward it, then, that the question turns around; \\"what am I hearing?... What exactly are you hearing\\" -in the sense that one asks the subject to describe not the external references of the sound it perceives but the perception itself.\\" Cox, Christopher and Warner, Daniel. Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music Continuum Books (2002). That music is acousmatic is determined more by how it is listened to, than by whether it is being played from a loudspeaker or not. In understanding the term 'acousmatic' appropriately, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between sound source and sound identity.Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), Trait√© des objets musicaux, Paris: √âditions du Seuil. If for example a recording of a solo cello being played in a recognizable way is sounded through a loudspeaker, the source of the sound is the loudspeaker, but its identity is still 'cello' for a listener. Thus, acousmatic music can be said to be that which calls for the listener to perceive sound without (or with a reduced) sensibility to the sound's identity. The listening mode is oriented instead upon more abstract timbral than mimetic aspects of the sound. Pierre Schaeffer has referred to this as √©coute r√©duite. It can be said that an √©coute r√©duite leads to the perception of music as acousmatic, in the sense that playing sounds from loudspeakers has the potential for obscuring their identity, as the visual reference is removed.

Biography Between 1957 and 1961 he studied mime with Jacques Lecoq, a period he later regarded as important to his work as a composer. He joined the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) in 1959 for a two-year master class, shortly after its founding by Pierre Schaeffer. After leaving his studies with Lecoq, he was first a sound engineer and was later put in charge of the Music/Image unit for French television (ORTF). There he worked in the studio with several notable composers, Iannis Xenakis, for example. (Subscription required) While at ORTF Parmegiani produced music for numerous film directors including Jacques Baratier and Peter Kassovitz, and for A, a 1965 short film animated by Jan Lenica. He also wrote a number of jingles for the French media and the \\"Indicatif Roissy\\" that preceded every PA announcement at Terminal 1 of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris until 2005. Parmegiani composed his first major work, Violostries, for violin and tape in 1964 for a choreography performed for Th√©√¢tre Contemporain d'Amiens directed by Jacques-Albert Cartier. During a visit to America in the late 1960s, Parmegiani researched the link between music and video and on his return produced several musical videos, including L'≈íil √©coute, and L'√âcran transparent (1973) during a residency at Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Germany. In the 1970s, he also became involved with live performances of jazz and performed with the Third Ear Band in London. At this time Parmegiani also started writing acousmatic pieces for performance in the concert hall: examples are Capture √©ph√©m√®re of 1967 which deals with the passage of time, and L'Enfer (1972), a collaboration with the composer Fran√ßois Bayle, based on Dante's Divine Comedy. Parmegiani composed the music for Walerian Borowczyk's films Jeux des Anges (1964) and Docteur Jekyll et les femmes (1981), the soundtrack for the latter comprising cues Parmegiani re-arranged from his 1972 work Pour en finir avec le pouvoir d'Orph√©e. In 1992 Parmegiani left the GRM and set up his own studio in Saint- R√©my-de-Provence.Bernard Parmegiani, profile at IRCAM In April 2010 he sat on the jury at the sixth Qwartz Electronic Music Awards, a promotional project and support group for electronic music artists. Parmegiani has been cited as a major influence by younger experimentalists like Aphex Twin, Autechre and Sonic Youth. Works of his were performed at the All Tomorrow's Parties festivals in 2003 and 2008. Awards His music has won awards, among them prizes from the Acad√©mie du Disque Fran√ßais in 1979, SACEM in 1981, Les Victoires de la Musique in 1990, and the Prix Magister at the Concours International de Bourges in 1991.

It is one of three species of lizard of the genus Iguana and is in severe decline due to habitat destruction, introduced feral predators, hunting, and hybridization with its introduced sister species, the green iguana (Iguana iguana). Successful captive breeding of this species has been limited to only two instances, as most captive-laid eggs tend to be infertile. Other common names for it are Lesser Antillean green iguana or West Indian iguana. Etymology and taxonomy The generic name iguana is derived from iwana, a Spanish form of the Taino name for the species. Its specific name delicatissima is Latin for \\"delicate\\". The species was first officially described by Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. Anatomy and morphology A juvenile Lesser Antillean iguana near the Coulibistrie River, Dominica The Lesser Antilles iguana has a more blocky, shortened face than the green iguana and lacks the distinctive stripe pattern present along the green iguana's tail. The feature that most easily distinguishes these two species is the large, round scale that the green iguana has below each ear hole but which the Lesser Antillean iguana lacks. The Lesser Antillean iguana varies in color between different island populations, but the base color tends to be gray, with green splotching on the underside. They have large pale, ivory colored scales on their heads. The jowls of males are pink and the scales around the eyes are blue. Males also have femoral pores along each inner thigh that exude pheromones during breeding season. Males are larger than females and are long, with an tail when full-grown. Females are two-thirds this size. Habitat and distribution The Lesser Antillean iguana is found in scrub woodlands, rainforests, and mangroves throughout the Lesser Antilles on Saint Barth, Anguilla, St. Eustatius, Guadeloupe, Dominica, and Martinique. Ecology Lesser Antillean iguanas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, flowers, fruit, and growing shoots of upwards of 100 different species of plant. Conservation A Lesser Antillean iguana in Dominica The Lesser Antillean iguana is a critically endangered species and is found on the IUCN Red List. The Lesser Antillean iguana is legally protected from hunting throughout its range, but enforcement of these regulations is extremely difficult and therefore limited. Other threats include habitat loss to agriculture and development and the introduction of feral predators such as dogs, cats, and mongooses. The species' greatest threat is from its own relative. The green iguana has been introduced to the Lesser Antilles as an invasive species and directly competes with the Lesser Antillean iguana for food and resources. In addition, the green iguana has been interbreeding with the Lesser Antillean iguana and this hybridization has been the number one reason for the latter species' decline on at least three of the islands: Les Iles des Saintes, Basse Terre (Guadeloupe) and St. Barth√©lemy. After a group of green iguanas washed ashore after hurricane Luis in 1995 on the island of Saint Martin, the endemic Lesser Antillean iguana population was gone within twenty years. Captive Lesser Antillean iguanas are currently kept at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Chester Zoo, the Memphis Zoo, and the San Diego Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species. All individuals originate from the Commonwealth of Dominica. Breeding and keeping the species in captivity is difficult. Mating and egg laying have occurred at each institution, but most of the eggs have been infertile; however, a single individual was successfully hatched at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in 1997 and in 2000 eight iguanas were hatched. Following on from this success, 11 iguanas hatched at Durrell in 2016 and they will be sent to zoos across Europe in an effort to promote and support the urgent conservation work for this species. In 2018 four captured iguanas from Sint Eustatius were sent to Blijdorp zoo in Rotterdam, The Netherlands for a breeding programme.

The arbitrated loop, also known as FC-AL, is a Fibre Channel topology in which devices are connected in a one- way loop fashion in a ring topology. Historically it was a lower-cost alternative to a fabric topology. It allowed connection of many servers and computer storage devices without using then very costly Fibre Channel switches. The cost of the switches dropped considerably, so by 2007, FC-AL had become rare in server-to-storage communication. It is however still common within storage systems. * It is a serial architecture that can be used as the transport layer in a SCSI network, with up to 127 devices. The loop may connect into a fibre channel fabric via one of its ports. * The bandwidth on the loop is shared among all ports. * Only two ports may communicate at a time on the loop. One port wins arbitration and may open one other port in either half or full duplex mode. * A loop with two ports is valid and has the same physical topology as point-to-point, but still acts as a loop protocol-wise. * Fibre Channel ports capable of arbitrated loop communication are NL_port (node loop port) and FL_port (fabric loop port), collectively referred to as the L_ports. The ports may attach to each other via a hub, with cables running from the hub to the ports. The physical connectors on the hub are not ports in terms of the protocol. A hub does not contain ports. * An arbitrated loop with no fabric port (with only NL_ports) is a private loop. * An arbitrated loop connected to a fabric (through an FL_port) is a public loop. * An NL_Port must provide fabric logon (FLOGI) and name registration facilities to initiate communication with other node through the fabric (to be an initiator). Arbitrated loop can be physically cabled in a ring fashion or using a hub. The physical ring ceases to work if one of the devices in the chain fails. The hub on the other hand, while maintaining a logical ring, allows a star topology on the cable level. Each receive port on the hub is simply passed to next active transmit port, bypassing any inactive or failed ports. Fibre Channel hubs therefore have another function: They provide bypass circuits that prevent the loop from breaking if one device fails or is removed. If a device is removed from a loop (for example, by pulling its interconnect plug), the hub‚Äôs bypass circuit detects the absence of signal and immediately begins to route incoming data directly to the loop‚Äôs next port, bypassing the missing device entirely. This gives loops at least a measure of resiliency‚Äîfailure of one device in a loop doesn‚Äôt cause the entire loop to become inoperable.

The mission of the Institute is \\"The Pacific Institute creates and advances solutions to the world's most pressing water challenges.\\" Gleick currently serves as the Institute's President Emeritus, having been succeeded as President by Jason Morrison. Peter Gleick receiving Lifetime Achievement Award from the Silicon Valley Water Conservation Awards Current work Gleick is the editor of the biennial series on the state of the world's water, called The World's Water, published by Island Press, Washington, D.C., regularly provides testimony to the United States Congress and state legislatures, and has published many scientific articles. The ninth volume of \\"The World's Water\\" was released in early February 2018. He serves as a major source of information on water and climate issues for the media, and has been featured on CNBC, CNN, Fox Business, Fresh Air with Terry Gross, NPR, in articles in The New Yorker, and many other outlets. Gleick lectures dozens of times a year on global water resource challenges and solutions, climate science and policy, and the integrity of science. In 2008, he presented the Abel Wolman Distinguished Lecture at the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was a 2009 Keynote Lecturer at the Nobel Conference at Gustavus Adolphus College. In 2014, Gleick published a peer-reviewed article in the American Meteorological Society journal \\"Weather, Climate, and Society\\" (WCAS) that addressed the role of drought, climate change, and water management decisions in influencing the civil war in Syria. This article was the \\"most read\\" WCAS article for 2014. In September 2014, Gleick gave a keynote address at the \\"Global Climate Negotiations: Lessons from California\\" Symposium, co-hosted by the USC Schwarzenegger Institute with the California Air Resources Board and the R20 Regions of Climate Action (R20) in Sacramento, which highlighted the different policies applied by the state of California facing the impact of climate change., In February 2015, Gleick's work on the \\"Water-Energy Nexus\\" was highlighted in an invited keynote at the Georgetown University 2015 Annual Symposium of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies. Heartland Institute incident On February 20, 2012, Gleick announced he was responsible for the unauthorized distribution of documents from The Heartland Institute in mid- February. Gleick reported he had received \\"an anonymous document in the mail describing what appeared to be details of the Heartland Institute's climate program strategy\\", and in trying to verify the authenticity of the document, had \\"solicited and received additional materials directly from the Heartland Institute under someone else's name\\". Responding to the leak, The Heartland Institute said one of the documents released, a two-page 'Strategy Memo', had been forged. Gleick denied forging the document. Gleick described his actions as \\"a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics\\" and said that he \\"deeply regret[ted his] own actions in this case\\" and \\"offer[ed his] personal apologies to all those affected\\". He stated that \\"My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts ‚Äì often anonymous, well- funded, and coordinated ‚Äì to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved.\\"\\"Activist Says He Lied to Obtain Climate Papers\\", New York Times, published February 20, 2012. On February 24 he wrote to the board of the Pacific Institute requesting a \\"temporary short-term leave of absence\\" from the Institute.\\"Peter Gleick requests short-term leave of absence from Oakland's Pacific Institute\\", San Jose Mercury News, Feb 24, 2012 The Board of Directors stated it was \\"deeply concerned regarding recent events\\" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents, and appointed a new Acting Executive Director on February 27.Pacific Institute Board of Directors statement , Feb 27, 2012. The Board Statement posted on Feb 22, 2012 stated it was \\"deeply concerned and is actively reviewing information about the recent events\\" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents. It was subsequently replaced by the Feb 27, 2012 statement. Gleick was reinstated following an investigation, in which the institute found no evidence to support charges of forgery and \\"supported what Dr. Gleick has stated publicly regarding his interaction with the Heartland Institute.\\" Honors * 1999 Elected Academician of the International Water Academy, Oslo, Norway * 2001 Named by the BBC as a \\"Visionary on the Environment\\" in its Essential Guide to the 21st Century * 2001 Appointed to Water Science and Technology Board of the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C. * 2003 MacArthur Fellow \\"Genius Award\\" * 2005 Elected Fellow of the International Water Resources Association * 2006 Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science * 2006 Elected Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences * 2008 Selected to Present the Abel Wolman Distinguished Lecture at the United States National Academy of Sciences, April 23, 2008, Washington, D.C. * 2008 Named by Wired Magazine's Smart List as one of \\"15 people the next President should listen to\\" * 2009 Keynote Lecturer at the Nobel Conference at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota * 2010 Named \\"Visionary: A Catalyst for an Enlightened Future\\" in the Los Angeles Times Magazine, January 3, 2010 * 2011 Winner, along with the Pacific Institute of the first U.S. Water Prize * 2011 Winner of the IWRA Ven Te Chow Memorial Award * 2012 Nominee for the Rockefeller Foundation Next Century Innovators Award. * 2012 Named one of 25 \\"Water Heroes\\" by Xylem. * 2013 Honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Silicon Valley Water Conservation Awards, March 21, 2013 * 2014 Named one of world's \\"Top 10 Water Tweeters\\" by the Guardian. * 2015 Received the Leadership and Achievement Award from the Council of Scientific Society Presidents. * 2015 Received the Carla Bard Environmental Education Award from the Bay Institute. *2018 Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization *2019 Awarded the Boris Mints Institute Prize.

The compound occurs as a white odorless solid, although commercial samples can be off-white and possess a slightly phenolic odor. It is insoluble in water but dissolves in acetone, ethanol, diethyl ether, and chloroform. In medicine, hexachlorophene is useful as a topical anti-infective, anti-bacterial agent, often used in soaps and toothpaste. It is also used in agriculture as a soil fungicide, plant bactericide, and acaricide. Removal from market =French deaths= In 1972, the \\"B√©b√©\\" brand of baby powder in France killed 39 babies. It also did great damage to the central nervous systems of several hundred other babies. The batch of toxic \\"B√©b√©\\" brand of powder was manufactured with 6% hexachlorophene. This industrial accident directly led to the removal of hexachlorophene from consumer products across the world. =United States= In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted the production and distribution of products containing more than 1% of hexachlorophene.Germicide Limit Stirs Confusion, New York Times, September 24, 1972, pg. 53. After that point, most products that contain hexachlorophene were available only with a doctor's prescription.The Milwaukee Sentinel: \\"US Order Curbs Hexachlorophene\\" (UPI), September 23, 1972. From Google News. The restrictions were enacted after 15 deaths in the United States and 39 deaths in France were reported following brain damage caused by hexachlorophene.Ocala Star Banner, \\"15 Deaths Cited In Use of Germ Killer, Hexachlorophene\\" (AP), March 21, 1973. From Google News. Several companies manufactured over-the-counter preparations which utilised hexachlorophene in their formulations. One product, Baby Magic Bath by The Mennen Company, was recalled in 1971, and removed from retail distribution. Two commercial preparations using hexachlorophene, pHisoDerm and pHisoHex, were widely used as antibacterial skin cleansers in the treatment of acne, (with pHisoDerm developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in pHisoHex). During the 1960s, both were available over the counter in the US. After the ban, pHisoDerm was reformulated without hexachlorophene, and continued to be sold over-the-counter, while pHisoHex, (which contained 3% hexachlorophene - 3 times the legal limit imposed in 1972), became available as a prescription body wash. In the European Community countries during the 1970s and 1980s, pHisoHex remained available over the counter. A related product, pHisoAc, was used as a skin mask to dry and peel away acne lesions whilst pHiso-Scrub, a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing, has since been discontinued. Several substitute products (including triclosan) were developed, but none had the germ-killing capability of hexachlorophene. (Sanofi-Aventis was the sole manufacturer of pHisoHex, while The Mentholatum Company owns the pHisoDerm brand today. Sanofi-Aventis discontinued production of several forms of pHisoHex in August 2009 and discontinued all production of pHisoHex in September 2013). The formula for Dial soap was modified to remove hexachlorophene after the FDA put an end to over-the-counter availability in 1972. Bristol-Myers' discontinued Ipana toothpaste brand at one time contained hexachlorophene. Another company involved in the production of products with hexachlorophene was cosmetic company, J.R. Watkins Company of Winona, Minnesota. They had previously produced \\"Watkins Cologne for Men\\". =Germany= In Germany, cosmetics containing hexachlorophene have been forbidden since 1985. =Austria= In Austria, sale of drugs containing the substance has been forbidden since 1990.Rechtsinformationssystem des √∂sterreichischen Bundeskanzleramtes Production Hexacholorophene is produced by alkylation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol with formaldehyde. Related antiseptics are prepared similarly, e.g., bromochlorophene and dichlorophene. Safety The LD50 (oral, rat) is 59 mg/kg, indicating that the compound is relatively toxic. It is not mutagenic nor teratogenic according to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, but \\"embryotoxic and produces some teratogenic effects\\" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) is always a contaminant in this compound's production. Several accidents releasing many kilograms of TCDD have been reported. The reaction between 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and formaldehyde is exothermic. If the reaction occurs without adequate cooling, TCDD is produced in significant quantities as a byproduct and contaminant. The Seveso disaster and the Times Beach, Missouri contamination incident exemplify the industrial hazards of hexachlorophene production. Trade names Trade names for hexachlorophene include: Acigena, Almederm, AT7, AT17, Bilevon, Exofene, Fostril, Gamophen, G-11, Germa-Medica, Hexosan, K-34, Septisol, Surofene, M3.

His books include The Transylvanian Trilogy (They Were Counted, They Were Found Wanting and They Were Divided), and The Phoenix Land. Biography The B√°nffy family emerged in 15th century Transylvania and established itself among the foremost dynasties of the country. They owned a grand palace in Kolozsv√°r (, ), one of the main cities of Transylvania and one of the province's largest castles at Bonchida. One branch was raised to a barony in the 1660s, while another became counts in 1855. The barons produced a 19th-century prime minister of Hungary (Dezs≈ë B√°nffy), and the counts held important offices at court. Among the latter was Count Mikl√≥s, born in Kolozsv√°r on December 30, 1873. Beginning his political career at the time when Hungary was a constituent of Austria- Hungary, B√°nffy was elected a Member of Parliament in 1901 and became Director of the Hungarian State Theatres (1913‚Äì1918). Both a traditionalist and a member of the avant-garde, he wrote five plays, two books of short stories, and a distinguished novel. Overcoming fierce opposition, his intervention made it possible for B√©la Bart√≥k's works to have their first performance in Budapest. B√°nffy became Foreign Minister of Hungary in his cousin Count Istv√°n Bethlen's government of 1921. Although he detested the politics of the Regent, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, he worked to review the boundary revisions confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon after World War I through which Transylvania had been transferred to Romania. Little progress was made, and he retired from office. His trilogy, A Transylvanian Tale, also called The Writing on the Wall, was published between 1934 and 1940. B√°nffy portrayed pre-war Hungary as a nation in decline, failed by a shortsighted aristocracy. In April 1943, B√°nffy visited Bucharest to persuade Ion Antonescu's Romania together with Hungary to abandon the Axis and sue for a separate peace with the Allies (see also Romania during World War II). The negotiations with a delegation led by Gheorghe Mironescu broke down almost instantaneously, as the two sides could not agree on a future status for Northern Transylvania (which Romania had ceded to Hungary in 1940, and where Bonchida was located). Two years later, in revenge for B√°nffy's actions in Bucharest, his estate at Bonchida was burned and looted by the retreating German army. Hungary and Transylvania were soon invaded by the Soviet Union's Red Army, an event which marked an uncertain status for Northern Transylvania until its return to Romania. His wife and daughter fled to Budapest while B√°nffy remained on the spot in a vain attempt to prevent the destruction of his property. Soon after, the frontier was closed. The family remained separated until 1949, when he was allowed by Romanian communist authorities to leave for Budapest, where he died the following year. A mellowing communist regime in Hungary permitted the reissue of A Transylvanian Tale in 1982, and it was translated into English for the first time in 1999. The Castle of Bonchida is now being restored as a cultural center. An apartment is being prepared for the use of the Count's family.

The club was formerly a gay disco called Dreams of LA. Spaceland's owner announced the end of the venue in late 2010, with the space continuing to operate under the new name The Satellite. History The first show ever held at Spaceland featured Beck, The Foo Fighters, Possum Dixon and Lutefisk. The list of acts who have played Spaceland is quite long, ranging from veteran performers from the 1960s and 1970s like Arthur Lee and The Dictators to current major acts such as Supergrass, Jet, The Shore and The White Stripes. It was very important in establishing the career of Beck and the Silver Lake scene which followed in his wake. Spaceland is considered \\"home\\" for many bands in the so-called Silver Lake \\"scene\\" over the years, including Silversun Pickups, 400 Blows, Pine Marten, Radar Bros., The 88, Biblical Proof of UFOs, Patrick Park, etc. The club features as the setting for the fictional band Munchausen By Proxy (lead singer Zooey Deschanel) in the 2008 Jim Carrey movie Yes Man. One of the final bands to play there is the New York Dolls, where they performed a rousing rendition of Bo Diddley's Pills. Photographer Kevin McCarty, in what is described as \\"advocacy criticism,\\" featured the venue of the Spaceland in a series titled The Chameleon Club. A photo of the stage of the Spaceland, and other empty gay bars, appears in Jos√© Esteban Mu√±oz book Cruising Utopia. Alternative comedian Neil Hamburger held a regular show at Spaceland the last Sunday of every month, inviting both mainstream (Tom Green, Tim and Eric, Paul F. Tompkins) and obscure acts to perform with him. The show continues at the venue under its new management. After 17 years, Spaceland came to an end in late 2010 when owner Mitchell Frank decided to open a new space that would focus more on dance and electronic music. Frank's Spaceland Productions would continue to book shows at The Echo/Echoplex complex. Meanwhile, the space at 1717 Silverlake Blvd continued as an indie rock venue in 2011 under the name The Satellite, with shows being booked by former Spaceland booker Jennifer Tefft.

He gained prominence for a series of novels known as \\"the Empire Trilogy\\" (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), which deal with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. Troubles received the 1971 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize and The Siege of Krishnapur received the 1973 Booker Prize. In 2010 Troubles was retrospectively awarded the Lost Man Booker Prize, created to recognise works published in 1970. Troubles and its fellow shortlisted works had not been open for consideration that year due to a change in the eligibility rules. Biography =Early life and education= Farrell, born in Liverpool into a family of Anglo-Irish background, was the second of three brothers. His father, William Farrell, had worked as an accountant in Bengal and, in 1929, he married Prudence Josephine Russell, a former receptionist and secretary to a doctor. From the age of 12 he attended Rossall School in Lancashire. After World War II, the Farrells moved to Dublin, after which Farrell spent much time in Ireland. This, perhaps combined with the popularity of Troubles, leads many to regard him as an Irish writer. After leaving Rossall, he taught in Dublin and also worked for some time on Distant Early Warning Line in the Canadian Arctic. In 1956, he went to study at Brasenose College, Oxford; while there he contracted polio. This left him partially crippled and disease was prominent in his works. In 1960 he left Oxford with third-class honours in French and Spanish and went to live in France, where he taught at a lyc√©e. =Early works= Farrell published his first novel, A Man From Elsewhere, in 1963. Set in France, it shows the clear influence of French Existentialism. The story follows Sayer, a journalist for a communist paper, as he tries to find skeletons in Regan's closet. Regan is a dying novelist who is about to be awarded an important Catholic literary prize. The book mimics the fight between the two leaders of French existentialism: Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, Sayer representing Sartre and Regan Camus. The two argue about existentialism: the position that murder can be vindicated as an expedient in overthrowing tyranny (Sartre) versus the stance that there are no ends that justify unjust means (Camus). Bernard Bergonzi reviewed it in the New Statesman's 20 September 1963 issue, writing, \\"Many first novels are excessively autobiographical, but A Man from Elsewhere suffers from the opposite fault of being a cerebral construct, dreamed up out of literature and the contemporary French cinema.\\" Simon Raven wrote in The Observer on 15 September 1963, \\"Mr. Farrell's style is spare, his plotting lucid and well timed; his expositions of moral or political problems are pungent if occasionally didactic.\\" It entirely lacks the ironic humour and tender appreciation of human frailty that characterise his later work. Farrell came to dislike the book. Two years after this came The Lung, in which Farrell returned to his real-life trauma of less than a decade earlier: the main character Martin Sands contracts polio and has to spend a long period in hospital. It has been noted that it is somewhat modelled after Farrell, but it is modelled more after Geoffrey Firmin from Malcolm Lowry's 1947 novel, Under the Volcano. The anonymous reviewer for The Observer on 31 October 1965 wrote, \\"Mr. Farrell gives the pleasantly solid impression of really having something to write about\\", and one for The Times Literary Supplement on 11 November 1965 that \\"Mr. Farrell's is an effective, potent brew, compounded of desperation and a certain wild hilarity.\\" In 1967, Farrell published A Girl in the Head. The protagonist, the impoverished Polish count Boris Slattery, lives in the fictional English seaside town of Maidenhair Bay, in the house of the Dongeon family (believed to be modelled after V. S. Naipaul's A House for Mr Biswas). His marriage to Flower Dongeon is decaying. His companion is Dr. Cohen, who is a dying alcoholic. Boris also has sex with an underage teenager, June Furlough, and fantasises about Ines, a Swedish summer guest, the titular \\"girl in the head\\". Boris is believed to be modelled on Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita. Like its two predecessors, the book met only middling critical and public reaction. In the 13 July 1967 issue of The Listener, Ian Hamilton wrote that he disliked the novel, and thought it was, at best, an \\"adroit pastiche\\" of Samuel Beckett's deadbeats. Martin Levin in The New York Times Book Review on 23 March 1969 praised Farrell's \\"flair for giving the ridiculous an inspired originality\\". An anonymous reviewer in The New York Times Book Review on 20 July 1967 wrote, \\"verbal assurance and resourcefulness show that Mr. Farrell is not content to coast along merely imitating his previous work. Such a deliberate extension of range is perhaps a hopeful sign for a talent which, after three novels, still has not found the mode in which to fulfil its attractive promise.\\" =Empire Trilogy= Troubles tells the comic yet melancholy tale of an Englishman, Major Brendan Archer, who in 1919 goes to County Wexford in Ireland to reunite with his fianc√©e, Angela Spencer. From the crumbling Majestic Hotel at Kilnalough, he watches Ireland's fight for independence from Britain. Farrell started writing the book while on a Harkness Fellowship in the United States and finished it in a flat in Knightsbridge, London. He got the idea for the setting from going to Block Island and seeing the remains of an old burned-down hotel. London: Bloomsbury Publishing. / 0-7475-4463-8 He won a Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize for the novel, and with the prize money travelled to India to research his next novel. Farrell's next book, The Siege of Krishnapur, and his last completed work, The Singapore Grip, both continue his story of the collapse of British colonial power. The former deals with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Inspired by historical events such as the sieges of Cawnpore and Lucknow, the novel is set in the fictional town of Krishnapur, where a besieged British garrison succeeds in holding out for four months against an army of native sepoys in the face of enormous suffering before being relieved. The third of the novels, The Singapore Grip, centres upon the Japanese capture of the British colonial city of Singapore in 1942, while also exploring at some length the economics and ethics of colonialism at the time, as well as the economic relationships between developed and Third World countries. The three novels are in general linked only thematically, although Archer, a character in Troubles, reappears in The Singapore Grip. The protagonist of Farrell's unfinished novel, The Hill Station, is Dr McNab, introduced in The Siege of Krishnapur; this novel and its accompanying notes make the series a quartet. When The Siege of Krishnapur won the Booker Prize in 1973, Farrell used his acceptance speech to attack the sponsors, the Booker Group, for their business involvement in the agricultural sector in the Third World.A Different Stripe: The Best of the Booker: The Siege of Krishnapur Charles Sturridge scripted a film version of Troubles made for British television in 1988 and directed by Christopher Morahan.Troubles (1988) =Death= In 1979, Farrell decided to quit London to live on the Sheep's Head peninsula in County Cork, Ireland. A few months later he drowned on the coast of Bantry Bay after falling into the sea from rocks while angling.[reproduced on website of Cork University Press] He was 44.Caroline Walsh, \\"Loose Leaves\\", Irish Times, 11 December 2010 \\"Had he not sadly died so young,‚Äù Salman Rushdie said in 2008, \\"there is no question that he would today be one of the really major novelists of the English language.

Early life and career Born in Highgate, to Bertie Russell, a P&O; clerk, and his wife, Alicia (n√©e Quinn) It was only by including a stage management element to her course at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama that Russell was able to her father's resistance to her pursuing such a career. She began her brief career as an actress while still a student working on productions supervised by Michael Barry who cast her in Toad of Toad Hall, and later in the same year in The Insect Play (both 1950). She became more interested in working in television than acting, preferring a three-week assignment in the medium over a ten-week touring production in Ireland. She was the first female floor manager to work for the BBC, her non-gendered credit being a means of avoiding problems with prospective technical crews. Although she appeared in the first two episodes of The Quatermass Experiment (1953), her main role was a production assistant for television director Rudolph Cartier. She worked on the later Quatermass science-fiction serials, as well as the 1954 adaptation of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the Studio 4 series, she appeared on screen in the Cartier directed Holocaust drama Doctor Korczak and the Children (1962) instructing the actors on the roles they were to perform. The production was made in the unadorned studio without sets or the actors in costume. She progressed to becoming a director herself, one of the first two women directors in BBC television. She directed many television programmes from 1962. She became the first woman to direct episodes of Doctor Who when she directed The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve (1966). She directed three further Doctor Who serials: Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974), Pyramids of Mars (1975), and Horror of Fang Rock (1977). The last two Doctor Who serials featured Tom Baker in the title role. She told Doctor Who Magazine: \\"Tom Baker was easy to deal with at first, but the part went to his head completely. By the time I did Horror of Fang Rock, he was desperately difficult to work with\\". Her other work included Out of the Unknown (1965), Pere Goriot (1968), The Moonstone (1972) and The Omega Factor (1980). Later life and death By the 1980s, Russell was living in a cottage in Oxenhope, on the Yorkshire Moors near Keighley. She was working regularly for Yorkshire Television for whom she directed many episodes of Emmerdale, the quiz programme 3-2-1 in its early years and the local news programme, Calendar. She was actively involved in charitable work in the area with particular emphasis on domestic cats. Russell moved to a care home, where she died in 2017, aged 89.

Because a switched fabric network spreads network traffic across multiple physical links, it yields higher total throughput than broadcast networks, such as the early 10BASE5 version of Ethernet, or most wireless networks such as Wi-Fi. The generation of high-speed serial data interconnects that appeared in 2001‚Äì2004 which provided point-to-point connectivity between processor and peripheral devices are sometimes referred to as fabrics; however, they lack features such as a message passing protocol. For example, HyperTransport, the computer processor interconnect technology, continues to maintain a processor bus focus even after adopting a higher speed physical layer. Similarly, PCI Express is just a serial version of PCI; it adheres to PCI's host/peripheral load/store direct memory access (DMA)-based architecture on top of a serial physical and link layer.  Fibre Channel  Example topology of a Fibre Channel switched fabric network A storage area network built with two separate switched fabrics (red and blue) to increase reliability. In the Fibre Channel Switched Fabric (FC-SW-6) topology, devices are connected to each other through one or more Fibre Channel switches. While this topology has the best scalability of the three FC topologies (the other two are Arbitrated Loop and point-to-point), it is the only one requiring switches, which are costly hardware devices. Visibility among devices (called nodes) in a fabric is typically controlled with Fibre Channel zoning. Multiple switches in a fabric usually form a mesh network, with devices being on the \\"edges\\" (\\"leaves\\") of the mesh. Most Fibre Channel network designs employ two separate fabrics for redundancy. The two fabrics share the edge nodes (devices), but are otherwise unconnected. One of the advantages of such setup is capability of failover, meaning that in case one link breaks or a fabric goes out of order, datagrams can be sent via the second fabric. The fabric topology allows the connection of up to the theoretical maximum of 16 million devices, limited only by the available address space (224).

The street runs between Central and Sheung Wan, with Wyndham Street, Arbuthnot Road, Ladder Street, Upper Lascar Row, and Old Bailey Street in the vicinity. Hollywood Road was the second road to be built when the colony of Hong Kong was founded, after Queen's Road Central. It was the first to be completed. The Man Mo Temple was a place for trial in very early years. Name HollyWoodRoad this road is made just behind Queens Road sometimes during research it'll say that HollyWoodRoad was constructed longer than Queens Road but thats fake :) It was probably named by Sir John Francis Davis, the second Governor of Hong Kong, after his family home at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, England. Another origin mentioned for the name is that holly shrubs were growing in the area when the road was constructed. Such plants were not indigenous to the area and would have been imported. History Hollywood Road Hollywood Road was the second road to be built when the colony of Hong Kong was founded, after Queen's Road Central. It was the first to be completed. Like most major roads in the early years of the colony, Hollywood Road was built by the Royal Engineers. More than 100 years ago, Hollywood Road was rather close to the coastline. In those days, foreign merchants and sailors would put up the antiques and artefacts they \\"collected\\" from China for sale here on their way back to Europe. This is how Hollywood Road began its role as an antique market. The 1960 Hollywood film The World of Suzie Wong was shot in part in Hollywood Road. An old wood-built building was re- constructed as a bar for the movie. =The Union Church= There was a Union Church in the street founded in 1844 by the Reverend James Legge, a Scottish missionary who had been sent to Hong Kong in 1843 by the London Missionary Society. The first Union Church was built in 1845 on Hollywood Road above Central. Every Sunday an English language service was held in the morning and a Chinese language service in the afternoon. The Church was later relocated to a new site on Staunton Street. Features Central Police Station Hollywood Road is filled with trinket and antique shops of all sorts: from Chinese furniture to porcelain ware, from Buddha sculptures to Tibetan rugs, from Japanese netsukes to Coromandel screens, from Ming dynasty ceramic horsemen and kitsch Maoist memorabilia. Previously known solely for antique shops, Hollywood Road has developed into a contemporary art district in Hong Kong. The first gallery to open was Plum Blossoms in 1987. From then on, many galleries opened in the area. =Man Mo Temple= Man Mo Temple or Man Mo Miu (ÊñáÊ≠¶Âªü) is a common sort of temple for worshipping the Man Tai (ÊñáÂ∏ù), Pau Kung and Mo Tai (Ê≠¶Â∏ù), Kwan Yu, to pray for good results in examinations in China. The one on the Hollywood Road was built in 1847. It has been managed by Tung Wah Group of Hospitals since 1908. It is a declared monument.Antiquities and Monuments Office. Man Mo Temple Compound, Hollywood Road, Sheung Wan =Central Police Station= Central Police Station was the first police station in Hong Kong. The oldest structure within the compound is a barrack block built in 1864. It is a three-storey building constructed alongside Victoria Prison (see below). A storey was later added to the mass in 1905. In 1919, Headquarters Block facing Hollywood Road was constructed. Subsequently in 1925, the two-storey Stable Block was constructed at the northwest end of the procession ground and later used as a munitions store.

From 1977 to 1996 he worked his way up from being an engineer to division director in the Elektronpribor plant. He was not a public figure before 1999. In October 1999 he became head of the St Petersburg regional branch of Sergey Shoygu's Unity party and in December 1999 he was elected to the State Duma running on the Unity party ticket. In January 2000 he was elected chairman of the Unity fraction in the Duma. Interior Minister In March 2001 he was appointed to the post of chief of Russian police and became Interior Minister. In this position Gryzlov proclaimed that the fight against terrorism and corruption were his priorities. Gryzlov supported the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya and won the reputation of being a trusted and loyal supporter of the president. In August 2001 Boris Gryzlov claimed that up to 100 industrial enterprises in Saint Petersburg, including the Petersburg Fuel Company, a leading gasoline retailing operator in the city, as well as the four main sea ports of Northwestern Russia, Saint Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Arkhangelsk and Murmansk, were controlled by the Tambov Gang. In May 2002 he sent a commission to St. Petersburg to investigate corruption allegations in the city's gasoline market. The investigation was initiated after the Faeton Gasoline Company, the second leading fuel retailing company in the city, had complained to both Gryzlov and the Prosecutor General's Office in April that the Saint Petersburg City Administration had given preferential treatment to the Petersburg Fuel Company.Business - IN BRIEF, St. Petersburg Times.

They had flat, horizontal handles. Colonial porringers tended to have one handle, whereas European ones tended to have two handles on opposite sides, on which the owner's initials were sometimes engraved, and they occasionally came with a lid. Porringers resembled the smaller quaich, a Scottish drinking vessel. One can discern authentic pewter porringers in much the same way that silver can be authenticated from the touch marks that were stamped either into the bowl of the porringer or on its base. Wooden porringers are occasionally found from excavations; e.g. 16th- century example from Southwark and 11th century from Winchester. The most famous colonial porringers are probably those made by Paul Revere. In more modern times, some manufacturers of porringers have produced them without handles. These types of porringers appear to be deep bowls, with the sides being nearly totally flat. Porringers are also used less and less, as a bowl will suffice for most people; porringers, however, are still circulated, mainly as a Christening-gift. A second, modern usage, for the term porringer is a double saucepan similar to a bain-marie used for cooking porridge. The porridge is cooked gently in the inner saucepan, heated by steam from boiling water in the outer saucepan. This ensures the porridge does not burn and allows a longer cooking time so that the oats can absorb the water or milk in which they are cooked more completely. Also the porridge does not need stirring during the cooking process, which means the oats maintain their structural integrity and the porridge has a better mouthfeel and texture. The lower heat may also degrade less of the beta-glucan in the oats, which gives oats their cholesterol-lowering properties. Porringers were also made out of red earthenware clay in a type of pottery that is called \\"redware\\" today but called \\"earthen\\" during colonial and Early America. These would have the typical strap or pulled handle that is familiar on mugs and cups today. Some collectors or materials historians also call what resembles the pewter porringer a \\"bleeding cup\\".

In 1962, at the age of 19, Lotsof was addicted to heroin and accidentally discovered the anti- addictive effects of ibogaine.Howard Lotsof Dies at 66; Saw Drug Cure in a Plant He later attended Fairleigh Dickinson University and then New York University, graduating with a degree in film in 1976. Lotsof authored and co- authoring numerous research papers and was awarded a number of patents for the treatment of various chemical dependencies with ibogaine. The first of his patents, issued in 1985, was US Patent 4,499,096, Rapid Method for Interrupting the Narcotic Addiction Syndrome. The last patent in the series for the use of ibogaine to treat chemical dependence was US Patent 5,152,994, Rapid Method for Interrupting or Attenuating Poly-Drug Dependency Syndromes, awarded October 6, 1992. Lotsof was active in promoting medical usage and further research of ibogaine and had an interest in chemical dependence patient advocacy including authoring the Ibogaine Patients' Bill of Rights. The systematic use of ibogaine was developed first by the Bwiti discipline from where it originated, by the Babongo, Mitsogo and Fang peoples of Gabon and Cameroon, while Western clinical treatment, mostly for the treatment of substance addictions, began was pioneered by Lotsof and others. In the 1980s, Lotsof convinced a Belgian company to manufacture Ibogaine in capsule form and performed successful trials in the Netherlands. The use of ibogaine spread across Europe, and was brought to the Americas by Eric Taub in 1992, who had contacted Lotsof in 1989. Lex Kogan later joined Taub and systematized the treatment of ibogaine with centers across the world, and further academic research and trials were conducted by Deborah Mash. As the use of ibogaine spread, its administration has varied widely, with some groups administering it systematically with well developed methods and medical personnel, while many use or administer it haphazardly in a way that many believe is dangerous. Lotsof was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Alliance of Methadone Advocates and President of the Dora Weiner Foundation. In March 2009, Lotsof was honored for his discovery of ibogaine's antiaddictive effects during the Sayulita, Mexico ibogaine Provider and Facilitator conference. Some fifty experts from around the world joined to present on ibogaine and associated subjects. He died on January 31, 2010, aged 66, from liver cancer. Personal life Lotsof was born in The Bronx, New York to Abnor and Lillian Lotsof. In 1964, he married Norma Alexander.

There she married the son of the family who employed her, Pascal Joly (now deceased), and adopted her middle name 'Eva', which is easier to pronounce in French. Career =Anti-corruption activist= While working as a secretary, Joly studied law at night school and became a magistrate when she was 38. Joly specialised in financial affairs, and as an investigating judge. Here she quickly made a mark with her crusade against corruption, in particular taking on, among others, former minister Bernard Tapie and the bank Cr√©dit Lyonnais. Her most famous case, however, was that of France's leading oil company, Elf Aquitaine. In the face of death threats, she carried on the case to uncover several cases of fraud, leading to the conviction of tens of persons involved in the oil business. In 2001, she received for this work the award for integrity from the non-governmental organisation Transparency International. In 2002, Joly was asked by the Norwegian Minister of Justice, Odd Einar D√∏rum, to accept a three-year position as a special advisor on corruption. The Anti-Corruption and Money Laundering project involved cooperation between the Ministry of Justice and Police, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Norway. The project worked on issues related to financial crimes and organized crime, with a special focus on strong international cooperation. Collaboration with the Ministry of Finance was also important, in addition to strengthening connections to the private sector. The project has among other things led to a Norwegian focus on corruption in foreign affairs. During the three-year period Joly also initiated the Paris Declaration Against Corruption in 2003. The 2006 French film L'Ivresse du pouvoir (English title \\"Comedy of Power\\") is loosely based on Joly.

First American National Bank was a subsidiary of First American National Corporation, a financial institution based in Nashville, Tennessee, that served the states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Virginia. It was headquartered in the First American Center in downtown Nashville. The bank began, in Nashville, as the American National Bank and later (1930), merged with James E. Caldwell's Fourth and First National Bank, to become First American National Bank. In 1971, construction of the First American Center (now the UBS Tower) in downtown Nashville resulted in the discovery of the skeleton of a sabertooth cat (Smilodon floridanus) within a cave beneath the bedrock. First American National Bank facilitated archaeological excavations at the site, funded radiocarbon analysis of the bone, and altered their original building design to protect the remnants of the cave, which still exist beneath the lower level of the building's parking garage. The cave is known variously as the \\"First American Cave\\" or by its official state archaeological site number, 40DV40. In 1997, the Smilodon skeleton from the First American Site was the source for the logo of the Nashville Predators hockey team and the inspiration for their mascot, Gnash.Nashville Predators Timeline - Sports News Story - WSMV Nashville Its name and logo disappeared in December 2000 when it was acquired by AmSouth Bancorporation, an institution based in Birmingham, Alabama that was slightly smaller in size. First American had operated as a fully owned subsidiary of AmSouth for most of the year 2000. First American was sold after a series of unprofitable mergers, including one with Jackson, Mississippi-based Deposit Guaranty Bank that proved to be a hurdle the corporation could not clear financially. Deposit Guaranty was fully integrated into First American, but kept its name. This allowed FANB to gain significant market share in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, though it did not operate these branches under the corporate brand, nor under recent the Iowa purchaserhttps://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/2019/06/25/greenstate- university-of-iowa-community-credit-union-buys-7-first-american-bank- locations/1566120001/. First American's demise ended Nashville's storied history as a strong financial center. It, along with Third National Bank (now a part of SunTrust) and Commerce Union Bank (now a part of Bank of America), was once involved in a tight three-way battle for market share that ultimately helped all three banks expand well beyond their respective bounds. When the resources of the three could no longer stand the rapid expansion and numerous acquisitions, they all succumbed and merged with other banks. FANB, the largest of these three banks, was the only one to fold itself into a smaller institution. As of 2007, Nashville is still home to several local banks, but most do not exist outside of Davidson County. Until 2005, AmSouth Bank continued First American's former tradition of having the highest market share in Nashville, however it was surpassed by SunTrust after its acquisition of Memphis-based National Commerce Financial. In 2006, however, AmSouth reclaimed the distinction of largest market share in metropolitan Nashville. In 2006-2007, AmSouth merged with Regions Financial Corporation which is headquartered in Birmingham. The newly combined bank retained Nashville's largest market share in addition to AmSouth's CEO, C. Dowd Ritter continuing as CEO of the company. Sponsorships First American was very visible in the Nashville area and carried a large load of sponsorships, most notably the now- closed First American Music Center, to which it held naming rights for just one season before selling to AmSouth. First American also prided itself as the \\"official bank\\" of several Nashville-based sports franchises, including the Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, Nashville Kats, and Nashville Sounds. Following the purchase, AmSouth/Regions opted to let each of these sponsorships expire without renewal.

He is remembered as the teacher of his daughter, Clara, a child prodigy who was undertaking international concert tours by age eleven and who later married her father's pupil Robert Schumann, in defiance of her father's extreme objections. As Clara Schumann, she became one of the most famous pianists of her time. Another of Wieck's daughters, Marie Wieck, also had a career in music, although not nearly so illustrious as Clara's. Other pupils included Hans von B√ºlow. Life Wieck was born in Pretzsch, not far from Leipzig, in 1785, the son of a not very successful merchant. Although the family was not musical, Wieck was deeply interested in music and attended the Thomas-Schule in Leipzig in 1798; however, because of illness, his stay lasted only six weeks and he was forced to return home.Reich, Nancy B., Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman, Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 26. In 1800 he attended the Torgau gymnasium, where he received his only formal training in piano, six hours of lessons from Johann Peter Milchmeyer.Reich, Clara Schumann, p. 27. He had little exposure to the wider world of music and he later developed his pedagogical theories by reading Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.Bogousslavsky,J., M. G. Hennerici, B√§zner, H., Bassetti, C., Neurological disorders in famous artists, Part 3, Karger Publishers, 2010, p. 104. He studied theology at the University of Wittenberg in preparation for the ministry, matriculating in 1803, and, having preached the obligatory trial sermon in Dresden, he left theology. The following nine years he worked as a private tutor to various wealthy families in Thuringia. He became a friend of a music teacher, Adolph Bargiel, at his first position with a Baron von Seckendorff in Querfurth, and in 1815 he composed a group of songs which he sent to Carl Maria von Weber. The songs were published and reviewed in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung.Reich, Clara Schumann, p. 28. Spurred on by a favorable comment (also including harsh criticism) from von Weber, he left his position as a tutor and established himself in Leipzig as a piano teacher and in the business of renting and selling pianos and other musical instruments and keeping a music lending library,Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954 which Richard Wagner was known to use.Joseph Braunstein, Liner notes from Michael Ponti recording of Clara Schumann's Piano Concerto No. 1 in A minor, Op. 7 Marriage was considered by Wieck as a means to improve his status, which he did in 1816 by marrying Mariane Tromlitz. Tromlitz was a famous singer in Leipzig at the time. She taught the more advanced piano students of Wieck. As an accomplished singer, Marianne Tromlitz sang at the well-known Gewandhaus in Leipzig on a weekly basis. A prodigy's father He did everything to be known as father of a child prodigy, a piano virtuoso. Clara Schumann was his second born and her musical education was planned down to the smallest detail. She daily received one-hour lesson (in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint), and two hours of practice, using the teaching methods he had developed on his own. He accompanied her on the tours throughout Europe.Scils.rutgers.edu His wife gave birth to another two children, Alwyn and Gustav. The differences between Wieck and his wife, Marianne, were irreconcilable in large part due to Wieck‚Äôs unyielding nature. When his friend Adolph Bargiel, father of Woldemar Bargiel, had an affair with her,Reich, Clara Schumann, p. 34. she divorced Wieck in 1824. She then married Adolph Bargiel. His second wife, Clementine Fechner ‚Äì whom he married in 1828 ‚Äì was twenty years his junior. Clementine was the sister of painter Eduard Clemens Fechner and of experimental psychology pioneer Gustav Fechner. One of the three children she gave birth to, besides C√§cilie and Clemens (1829‚Äì1833), who died at the age of four, Marie Wieck was also a concert pianist, although she was not as famous as was his first-born daughter.The Girlhood of Clara Schumann, Florence May, p. 28, Read Books, 2007 , In 1844, he moved to Dresden, where he lived for the rest of his life, spending the summers at Loschwitz, where he died in 1873. Teaching career His home was a meeting place for his piano students and other musicians. Not only his wife, his children, and his close friends, but also his business associates were affected by his drive to success. Felix Mendelssohn supported his becoming professor of piano at the Leipzig Conservatory, although the post went to Ignaz Moscheles. His methods appear progressive, flexible, nuanced, emphasizing the individuality of the student and leading the student on by means of the enjoyment of music-making rather than harsh discipline and drills. For him, mere finger dexterity was not the focus, and he did not advocate monotonous, mechanical exercises. He emphasized evenness of tone, a beautiful, song-like legato, and expressiveness. While including finger- stretching exercises to increase the student's span, he was careful to avoid fatigue by limiting the number of hours of practice per day and insisting on long walks and fresh air. Overall musical development was essential, achieved by lessons in theory, counterpoint and composition, and regular exposure to the best possible musical performances.Bogousslavsky, Neurological Disorder, pp. 104‚Äì105. In practice, however, he might not always have lived up to the ideals he described in the book Piano and Song: How to Teach, How To Learn, and How to Form a Judgment of Musical Performances.English translation by Mary Pickering Nichols available at Project Gutenberg. When Robert Schumann was living and studying in the Wieck household, he reported seeing Wieck punishing his nine-year-old son, Alwyn, for playing the violin poorly, tearing at his hair and yelling, \\"You wretch, you scoundrel, is this the way you try to please your father?\\" Clara seemed unconcerned at the violent scene. Shocked, Schumann wrote in his diary, \\"Am I among human beings?\\"Ostwald, Peter, Schumann: The Inner Voices of a Musical Genius, Northeastern Press, Boston, 1985, pp. 73‚Äì74. Besides the book he published some studies and exercises for the piano, a number of pamphlets and substantial essaysM√§kel√§, Tomi, Kammert√∂ns, Christoph & Ptasczynsky, Lena Esther (eds.), Friedrich Wieck ‚Äì Gesammelte Schriften √ºber Musik und Musiker [...] mit einer Einf√ºhrung‚Äò‚Äò[by Tomi M√§kel√§], Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2019., and edited various piano works. Opposing his daughter's marriage with Robert Schumann Friedrich Wieck in later life A turning point came in Wieck's life when Clara and Robert Schumann fell in love. Fearing that her marriage to an impecunious composer would destroy the plans he had for her music career, he opposed their union in every way he could. He threatened to shoot Robert.Ostwald, Peter, Schumann, p. 123 The young lovers resorted to clandestine meetings and letter-writing. Because Clara was not yet of age, her father's consent was required before they could marry. Not receiving his consent, they applied to the Saxon Court of Appeals for permission to be married without his consent.Ostwald, Peter, Schumann, p. 151 Wieck threatened that if Clara did not give up Robert, he would disinherit her, deprive her even of the money she had earned herself and tie the pair up in legal proceedings for 3‚Äì5 years.Ostwald, Schumann, p.151. On July 2, 1839 Schumann's attorney tried to negotiate with Wieck but was unsuccessful. On July 16 Schumann filed a complaint against Wieck. The court scheduled a meeting for Wieck, Clara and Robert but when the day came Wieck did not appear, pleading that he was too busy. He then offered to settle with the court, setting highly demanding terms: he would allow Clara to marry provided that Clara give all her seven years of concert earnings to her brothers and pay 1000 thalers in order to retrieve her piano and personal belongings from the Wieck home; he demanded that Robert set aside 8000 thalers to be invested so that the interest would compensate Clara if the marriage failed. The court rejected his highly demanding terms. Wieck asked for another conference with the court, which was set for October 2, but again Wieck failed to appear. The conference was re-scheduled for December 18. Four days before the conference date, Wieck filed another appeal, an ugly, defamatory \\"declaration\\" to court objecting to the marriage, accusing Schumann of a litany of weaknesses and vices, especially habitual drunkenness and the inability to support a wife. Overture, 28 September 2007 Schumann \\"cannot speak coherently or write legibly,\\" he is \\"lazy, unreliable, and conceited,\\" \\"a mediocre composer whose music is unclear and almost impossible to perform,\\" \\"incompetent, childish, unmanly, in short totally lost for any social adjustment.\\"Ostwald, Schumann, p. 153. Some of the information he used was obtained by breaking into Clara's locked letter-box. The court did not issue a judgment for several months. Wieck took to spreading vicious rumours against the couple. He sent copies of his court documents to every city where Clara was planning to give concerts.Ostwald, Peter, Schumann, p. 155 When she traveled to Hamburg and Berlin to perform, he sent letters claiming that Clara's playing had declined.Reich, Clara Schumann, p. 98. Striking an emotional blow against Clara, he began to promote the career of a rival female pianist, Camilla Pleyel. In July 1840, the court ruled against Wieck, and it gave consent to the marriage. Schumann then sued Wieck for slander and won. Wieck was forced to pay the couple a large sum, and he was sentenced to jail for 18 days for unruly courtroom behaviour, although it is not clear whether he actually served the sentence.Ostwald, Schumann, p. 155. Clara and Robert married on September 12, 1840, the day before her twenty-first birthday. For several months Wieck refused to release to Clara the piano from the Wieck home on which she had played since childhood; finally he was forced to do so by court order.Ostwald, Peter, Schumann, pp. 165, 169. By 1843 Wieck was a grandfather, Clara having given birth to the first two of her eight children, and Schumann was winning a growing reputation as a serious composer. Wieck invited Schumann to a reconciliation, writing, \\"For Clara's sake and the world's, we can no longer keep each other at a distance. You too are now a family man ‚Äì is a longer explanation needed?\\".Ostwald, Peter, Schumann, p. 185 The reconciliation was welcomed by Clara, although Robert was less enthusiastic. However, Schumann must have enjoyed the way Wieck treated him in his essays from 1844 on: as a first-grade model for art, beside Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and Ignaz Moscheles.M√§kel√§, Tomi, Kammert√∂ns, Christoph & Ptasczynsky, Lena Esther (eds.), Friedrich Wieck ‚Äì Gesammelte Schriften √ºber Musik und Musiker [...] mit einer Einf√ºhrung‚Äò‚Äò[by Tomi M√§kel√§], Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2019, p. 110ff. In 1844 Wieck was again involved in managing Clara's career, but by March 1850 he was promoting the musical career not of Clara but of her sister, Marie, as well as the singer Minna \\"Schulz- Wieck,\\" whom he falsely advertised as his daughter.Ostwald, Peter, Schumann, p. 235. Chopin Wieck published a very positive review of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Variations on \\"La ci darem la mano\\" in the German periodical, Caecilia. Chopin found the review so embarrassingly gushing that he blocked Wieck's attempts to have the review published in French. In a letter to a friend, Chopin wrote that Wieck, \\"instead of being clever, is very stupid\\" and that he did not want his musical integrity to \\"die\\" because of \\"the imagination of that ... stubborn German.\\"Szulc, Tad (1998).

Applications include refuse incinerators and hazardous material incinerators. Method A sample is continuously extracted from the gas stream being monitored using a titanium probe, which is water- cooled to below 70 ¬∞C. The sample flow rate is automatically adjusted to ensure isokinetic sampling (the velocity of gas entering the sampling system is equal to the velocity of the gas in the system under test). The sample gas is drawn through a quartz wool pre-filter and then across a cartridge filled with resin, such as XAD 2. The sample gas is also cooled to below 5 ¬∞C to condense and remove water vapour. All system parameters are recorded digitally during sampling. The resin cartridge and the condensate are removed at the end of a monitoring period, and the contents are analysed to determine levels of dioxins and furans.

The SSSI is part of Chichester Harbour Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation. It is also part of Chichester and Langstone Harbours Ramsar site, Special Protection Area and Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I. Part of it is a Geological Conservation Review site and two areas are Local Nature Reserves. Description Chichester Harbour is a large natural harbour to the south west of the city of Chichester on the Solent. It is one of four natural harbours in that area of the coastline, the others being Portsmouth Harbour, Langstone Harbour and Pagham Harbour. The harbour and surrounding land is managed by Chichester Harbour Conservancy. It is one of the few remaining undeveloped coastal areas in Southern England and remains relatively wild. Its wide expanses and intricate creeks are at the same time a major wildlife haven and among some of Britain's most popular boating waters. The massive stretch of tidal flats and saltings are of outstanding ecological significance. Very large populations of wildfowl and waders use the mudflats feeding on the rich plant life and the huge populations of intertidal invertebrates. More than 7,500 Brent geese overwinter on the intertidal mud-land and adjacent farmland and around 55,000 birds reside in or visit the Harbour throughout the year.http://www.landscapesforlife.org.uk/about-aonbs/visit-aonbs/chichester- harbour-aonb/ The harbourside villages are: West Wittering, West Itchenor, Birdham, Dell Quay, Fishbourne, Bosham, Chidham, Prinsted, Thorney Island, Emsworth, Langstone and Northney. The nearest towns are Havant, Chichester and Hayling Island. The harbour lowlands contain high quality arable farmland. Boatyards, marinas and commercial fishing are important elements of the local economy. This is one of the south coast's most popular sailing waters with as many as 12,500 craft regularly using the harbour, with competitive racing taking place among the 14 sailing clubs of the Chichester Harbour Federation. The villages, sea walls and footpaths are a popular leisure area for residents and tourists alike. Set up by Act of Parliament in 1971, Chichester Harbour Conservancy has the duty to conserve, maintain and improve the harbour and amenity area for recreation, natural conservation and natural beauty. As well as being the statutory harbour authority, the Conservancy manages the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). To the south west of the entrance to Chichester Harbour is Chichester Bar, a shallow spit which can present a significant navigation hazard at all states of the tide. The entrance to the harbour is deep with a fast tidal stream and to the east of the main harbour entrance channel is a gravel bank known as The Winner. The east side of the harbour entrance is an area of geographical, recreational and conservation interest known as East Head. It is a large sand dune linked to land by a narrow area known as The Hinge. In recent years The Hinge has been breached by several storms and then repaired. There is much debate about whether and how it should continue to be repaired. The western boundary with Langstone Harbour is defined by a historic causeway known as the wade way, once the principal access from Hayling Island to the mainland, but since bisected by a deep channel for the Portsmouth and Chichester Canal in the 1820s, and no longer safely traversable. Chichester Harbour has three main channels. The Emsworth Channel, the Thorney Channel and the Chichester Channel, which also branches off into the Bosham Lake and Itchenor Reach. Biology and geology The harbour has diverse habitats, including intertidal mudflats, shingle, saltmarsh, sand dunes, marshes and woodland. The mudflats provide feeding grounds for internationally important numbers of ringed plovers, grey plovers, redshanks, black-tailed godwits, dunlins, sanderlings, curlews and greenshanks. There are geologically important sand dunes and shingles at East Head and east of Langstone. Recreation Langstone Sailing Club Chichester Harbour is used for a wide variety of sailing, including dinghy racing; it is the venue for the 'Itchenor Gallon' race for the International 14. There are several yacht marinas. It is also used for fishing. Harbour tours depart year round from Itchenor in either a traditional boat or in Solar Heritage, a solar powered boat. During the summer regular trips depart from Emsworth on Solar Heritage and on the Victorian oyster boat Terror. There is a small dory that operates as a ferry service between Itchenor and Bosham. The harbour is a very popular area for birdwatching; guided bird walks and boat trips are offered during the winter months by Chichester Harbour Conservancy. There is a network of footpaths for walkers and a cycle route from Chichester to West Wittering which passes through harbour countryside. West Wittering Beach and East Head is the only sandy beach on the West Sussex coast and is a popular family and tourist destination on warm weekends.

He was the long-time partner of Allen Ginsberg. Early life and career Orlovsky was born in the Lower East Side of New York City, the son of Katherine (n√©e Schwarten) and Oleg Orlovsky, a Russian immigrant. He was raised in poverty and was forced to drop out of Newtown High School in his senior year so he could support his impoverished family. After many odd jobs, he began working as an orderly at Creedmoor State Mental Hospital, known today as Creedmoor Psychiatric Center. In 1953, Orlovsky was drafted into the United States Army for the Korean War at nineteen years old. Army psychiatrists ordered his transfer off the front to work as a medic in a San Francisco hospital. He later went to Columbia University. He met Allen Ginsberg while working as a model for the painter Robert La Vigne in San Francisco in December 1954. Prior to meeting Ginsberg, Orlovsky had made no deliberate attempts at becoming a poet. Ginsberg was living with his girlfriend Sheila Williams Boucher at the time, but broke off the relationship to be with Orlovsky. Orlovsky also had a sexual relationship with Boucher during this time. Ginsberg and Orlovsky considered their relationship to be a \\"marriage sealed by vows.\\" It was an open relationship, in part because Orlovsky was bisexual. With Ginsberg's encouragement, Orlovsky began writing in 1957 while the pair were living in Paris. Accompanied by other beat writers, Orlovsky traveled extensively for several years throughout the Middle East, Northern Africa, India, and Europe. He also helped produce and contributed vocals to Ginsberg's 1970 LP Songs of Innocence and Experience, based on William Blake's poetry collection of the same name. Orlovsky was Ginsberg's lover in an open relationship until Ginsberg's death in 1997. In 1974, Orlovsky joined the faculty of the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, teaching poetry. In 1979 he received a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to continue his creative endeavors. Death In May 2010, friends reported that Orlovsky, who had had lung cancer for several months, was moved from his home in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to the Vermont Respite House in Williston. He died there on May 30, 2010, from complications of the disease; he was 76 years old. He was buried at Shambhala Mountain Center in Red Feather Lakes, Colorado. His epitaph reads: \\"Train will tug my grave, my breathe hueing gentil vapor between weel & track\\".

Written in the first person, the novel follows Henry Chinaski, Bukowski‚Äôs thinly veiled alter ego, during his early years. Written in Bukowski‚Äôs characteristically straightforward prose, the novel tells of his coming-of-age in Los Angeles during the Great Depression. Title The title may be a play on J. D. Salinger's 1951 book The Catcher in the Rye, which is one of the most notable coming-of-age novels about American males. Both Bukowski and Salinger were first published professionally in the 1940s in the literary magazine Story, edited by Whit Burnett. However, Bukowski's admiration of John Fante also suggests that a phrase in Fante's Ask the Dust, \\"liverwurst on rye,\\" may have inspired the title \\"Ham on Rye.\\" A third possibility is that the title is a dig at the New York literary critics who generally disdained Bukowski's work, dismissing him as the equivalent of a ham actor with an overwrought, amateurish style. Thus, Bukowski may be appropriating the insult and boldly declaring himself a ham writer fueled by rye whiskey. Still another possible interpretation is that Hank perceived himself as being sandwiched, or trapped, between his highly dysfunctional parents during his formative years.  Setting  Like his previous works, Ham on Rye is set in Los Angeles where the author grew up. Bukowski keeps his descriptions of his hometown grounded in reality, paying more attention to the people that make up Los Angeles than to the city itself. This type of description does not venerate or idealize the city, a contrast to other so- called \\"Los Angeles Novels\\".Fontana, Ernest. 1985. Bukowski's Ham on Rye and the Los Angeles Novel. The Review of Contemporary Fiction. 5 (3): 4‚Äì8 Scenes outside of Los Angeles show Chinaski as an intruder, as with an early scene where he and his family are chased out of an orange grove.Fontana, Ernest. 1985. Bukowski's Ham on Rye and the Los Angeles Novel. The Review of Contemporary Fiction. 5 (3): 5 The story takes place at home, at his different schools, at the doctor's office (for his never-ending acne treatments) and at various other locales around town. Plot The novel focuses on the protagonist, Henry Chinaski, between the years of 1920 and 1941.Calonne, David Stephen. Charles Bukowski. Reaktion Books, London, 2012. 144. It begins with Chinaski's early memories. As the story progresses the reader follows his life through the school years and into young adulthood. Chinaski relates that he has an abusive father, and his mother does nothing to stop his father's abuse. She is, in fact, a victim of her husband's brutality as well. Henry is not athletic but wants to be and therefore tries hard to improve. Football is difficult for him, but he enjoys the violence that comes with it. He has only slightly better results in baseball. As Chinaski progresses through grammar school, the focus of Henry's attention is on sports, violence, and girls. As Henry grinds his way through Junior High School, he discovers the manifold pleasures of alcohol and masturbation. As Henry begins High School, his father, who is experiencing downward inter-generational socioeconomic mobility, makes him go to a private school where he fits in even less amongst all the well-heeled, spoiled rich kids with their flashy, colorful, convertible sports cars and beautiful girlfriends. To make matters worse, Chinaski develops horrible acne so severe that he has to undergo painful, and mostly ineffective, treatments, essentially becoming a human guinea pig for various experiments thought up by his uninterested doctors. The reader eventually follows Chinaski to college and reads of Henry's attempt to find a worthwhile occupation.  Protagonist  Like his previous autobiographical novels, Ham on Rye centers on the life of Henry Chinaski, this time during his childhood and teenage years. Throughout the course of the novel, Bukowski develops his misanthropic anti-hero character that is seen in his other works like Post Office and Hollywood. Chinaski, growing up poor in Los Angeles during the Great Depression, is shown developing into a sarcastic loner. This stems in large part from his home life, in which he is beaten frequently (often for no reason) by his father. He becomes alienated from the children at school simply for somehow being different in a way that none of them could ever coherently articulate. The post-facto rationalizations they concoct for their hostility, however, involve his inability to play sports and his being viscerally revolted by cruelty to animals, the latter being one of the favorite past-times of neighborhood men and boys alike. The grotesque-looking boils of his acne vulgaris will eventually turn their excuses for hating him into an ostracizing trifecta. Chinaski has been compared to both Frankenstein's monster and Kafka's Gregor Samsa, because of his alienation and outcast resulting from his \\"monstrous\\" appearance.Fontana, Ernest. 1985. Bukowski's Ham on Rye and the Los Angeles Novel. The Review of Contemporary Fiction. 5 (3): 6 He often resorts to violence when confronted with those who alienate him, giving him a tough guy image to his peers. However, he rarely is completely confident with his own abilities and often second-guesses himself.  Themes  As a prequel to Bukowski‚Äôs previous novels, Ham on Rye depicts the origin and development of many of the reoccurring themes of his work as well as the persona of Henry Chinaski. Some of the major themes: *Relationships between parents, children, and economic circumstances. Henry‚Äôs father becomes increasingly abusive towards his son as the family sinks further into poverty.Brewer, Gay. Charles Bukowski. Twayne Publishers, New York, 1997. p. 35. *Disenfranchisement and the myth of the American Dream. As the young Chinaski witnesses the economic failure of his struggling family, he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the idea that success is based on personal merit and hard work.Brewer, Gay. Charles Bukowski. Twayne Publishers, New York, 1997. p. 36, 39, 40. *The underlying superficiality of societal values. Henry notices a disconnect between society‚Äôs supposed values and his personal experience. Rather than a nation dedicated to freedom and equality, he finds a country based on the abuse of power (between himself and his father, teachers, stronger/wealthier students) and obsessed with appearance and displays of wealth,Brewer, Gay. Charles Bukowski. Twayne Publishers, New York, 1997. p. 36, 39, 40. ‚ÄúA whole god-damned nation of assholes driving automobiles, eating, having babies, doing everything in the worst way possible, like voting for a presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.‚ÄùBukowski, Charles. Ham on Rye. Black Sparrow Press, Santa Rosa, 1991. p. 174. *The individual against the system. Henry finds himself in antagonistic relationships with the traditional representatives of societal norms - his father, school authorities, the wealthy. This is exampled in young Chinaski‚Äôs admiration for and regret over the death of John Dillinger - a Robin Hoodesque figure to the poor.Brewer, Gay. Charles Bukowski. Twayne Publishers, New York, 1997. p. 40, 41. Bukowski, Charles. Ham on Rye. Black Sparrow Press, Santa Rosa, 1991. p. 125. *The transformative power of literature. As Henry becomes older and increasingly isolated, he finds solace in the local library and immerses himself in fiction. Writers such as Dostoevsky, Gorky, Hemingway, Fante, and Thurber aid Henry in creating a framework for his own personal experiences, allowing him solace, escape, and a deeper understanding of life. Reading gives him inspiration and confidence to begin writing himself.Brewer, Gay. Charles Bukowski. Twayne Publishers, New York, 1997. p. 36, 42, 43. Thus, Ham on Rye can be read as a K√ºnstlerroman because it gives the reader a glimpse into the formation of the artist Bukowski would eventually become.Calonne, David Stephen. Charles Bukowski. Reaktion Books, London, 2012. p. 146.  The Chinaskis  Like Henry, the rest of the Chinaskis are modeled after Bukowski‚Äôs own family. For example, Henry‚Äôs parents, like Bukowski‚Äôs, had met in Germany after World War I. * Emily Chinaski: Chinaski's grandmother on his father‚Äôs side. The beginning of the novel starts with his earliest memory of his grandmother; she would proclaim ‚ÄúI will bury all of you!‚Äù Other than that, his best memory of visiting her home involves him and his parents leaving to go visit his grandfather, who does not live with Emily. Later, she appears with a crucifix to rid him of \\"the devil\\" causing his acne. * Leonard Chinaski: Chinaski's grandfather, separated from Emily. Though Chinaski's father admonishes Leonard for being a drunk (his breath stinks of alcohol), Chinaski himself remembers Leonard as a beautiful man. When Chinaski meets him for the first time, he gives the boy a gold watch and a German Iron Cross.Ham on Rye, Chapt. 1 * Henry Chinaski, Sr.: Chinaski's father. He met Henry's mother overseas in Germany, where Henry, Jr. was born. At the beginning of the novel, Henry, Sr. works as a milkman. He is a harsh, cruel man who physically and verbally abuses his son from a young age. He also physically abuses his wife, Katherine, particularly after she catches him cheating on her with a woman on his milk route. Henry, Sr. regards the rest of his family, particularly his brothers John and Ben, with disdain. He often disparages them for being alcoholics and womanizers, two traits his son would later develop. At the onset of the Great Depression, he loses his job but continues to spend the day driving around to appear to the neighbors as if he was still employed. His son gets more jaded to his abuse as time goes on, and the two become openly hostile towards each other by the end of the novel. Eventually, Henry, Sr. throws his son out of the house after finding Henry‚Äôs short stories. * Katherine Chinaski: Chinaski's mother. A native German, she met and married Henry Jr.'s father in Germany post World War I. She is also called Katy. Katherine is a loving mother, though she is subjugated by Henry, Sr.‚Äôs abuse. Chinaski initially resents his mother for not saving him from his father‚Äôs wrath, but later comes to regard her as another victim like himself. Though often disappointed with how her son lives his life, she really loves him and often displays a confidence that he will better himself. Her love for her son is perhaps best shown when she warns him that his father found his stories. Like her son, she eventually calluses to Henry, Sr.‚Äôs abuse, shown in the novel by her disregard of his later tirades. * Ben Chinaski: Chinaski's uncle. Ben is only present in chapter three, and Chinaski remembers him as ‚Äúa very handsome man‚Ä¶ he had dark eyes which glittered, were brilliant with glittering light.‚Äù Ben is 24 and lives in a sanitarium because he is dying of tuberculosis. Despite this, Henry Sr. treats Ben with open hostility, ridiculing him for his debauchery. Ben takes it in stride, paying more attention to his nephew and sister-in-law.Ham on Rye, Chapt. 3 * Anna Chinaski: Chinaski's aunt through marriage to John Chinaski, Henry, Sr.‚Äôs brother. In chapter four, Anna appears as an abandoned wife with two children, all three on the brink of starvation. Her husband has been gone quite some time, leaving Anna and the children penniless. Henry Sr. mercilessly belittles his brother and makes light of Anna‚Äôs situation. He claims that John is wanted for rape (whether this is true or not is uncertain) and that he‚Äôll come back ‚Äúwhen he‚Äôs tired of the hens.‚Äù Like Ben, Anna treats Henry‚Äôs father coldly and pays more attention to Katherine, who brings her food for her children.Ham on Rye, Chapt. 4  Other characters  *Various Teachers: Mr. Hall, Mrs. Westphal, Mrs. Fretag, Wagner, Mr. Stanhope, Miss Gredis, etc. *\\"Friends\\": Robert Becker, David (Another loner that attaches to him.), Lila Jane (His first romantic interest), Red, Chuck, Eddie, Gene, Frank, Jimmy, Baldy, etc.  References   External links  * Ham On Rye Quotes Category:1982 American novels Category:Novels by Charles Bukowski Category:American autobiographical novels Category:American bildungsromans Category:Great Depression novels Category:Novels set in Los Angeles ","title":"Ham on Rye"},{"id":"1919168","text":"Man Ray, Vol. 2 is a 2002 compilation album.

Protected areas of New Zealand receive protection to preserve their environmental, historical or cultural value. The method and aims of protection vary according to the importance of the resource and whether it has public or private status. Nearly 30 percent of the land mass of New Zealand is in public ownership and has some degree of protection; these areas include conservation parks, mainland islands, island reserves, marine reserves, and national parks.  History  In 1840 Governor Hobson was instructed that some Crown land was to be, \\"reserved, for the use of the public at large, all tracts which are likely to be required for purposes of public health, utility, convenience, or enjoyment.\\" The Public Reserves Act 1854 allowed the Crown to grant public utility reserves to provinces. The Public Domains Act 1860 covered domains in Auckland and Wellington and allowed the governor to buy other land. The Public Reserves Act 1877 extended the powers, as did the Public Reserves Act 1881, the Public Reserves and Domains Act 1908, the Public Reserves, Domains and National Parks Act 1928, the Reserves and Domains Act 1953 and now the Reserves Act 1977. Types of protected areas Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park The Department of Conservation administers the majority of the publicly owned land in New Zealand that is protected for scenic, scientific, historic and cultural reasons, or set aside for recreational purposes. More than 80,000 km2 - nearly 30 percent of the nation's total area - is administered by the department. The main legislation controlling this is the Reserves Act 1977. There are 13 national parks (excluding the disestablished Te Urewera National Park), covering almost 28,900 km2, over 50 Conservation Parks covering some 18,000 km2, about 3,500 reserves covering around 15,000 km2, and some 610 km2 of protected private land and covenants that have been set aside for scenic, scientific or ecological reasons. The department also has responsibility for the preservation and management of wildlife, and has a role in management of the coastal marine area with 19 marine reserves and two other protected marine areas from the Kermadec Islands to Fiordland. Any development in Coastal Marine Areas, which extend up to the mean high water spring mark and up to a kilometre up rivers, require a Resource Consent under the Resource Management Act (RMA). =Conservation parks= Conservation Parks defined in the Conservation Act 1987 to protect their natural and historic resources, and to facilitate public recreation and enjoyment. Prior to changes in 1987, many Conservation Parks were administered as Forest Parks, before the Conservation Act declared that all such parks would automatically become Conservation Parks in a legal sense. *Ahuriri Conservation Park *Aorangi Forest Park *Aotea Conservation Park *Catlins Conservation Park *Coromandel Forest Park *Craigieburn Forest Park *Eyre Mountains/Taka Ra Haka Conservation Park *Hakatere Conservation Park *Hanmer Conservation Park *HƒÅwea Conservation Park *Ka Whata Tu O Rakihouia Conservation Park *Kaimai Mamaku Conservation Park *Kaimanawa Forest Park *Kaweka Forest Park *Korowai/Torlesse Tussocklands Park *Lake Sumner Forest Park *Mavora Lakes Conservation Park *Mt Richmond Forest Park *Nga Motu / Sugar Islands Conservation Park *North-west Nelson Forest Park *Northland Conservation Park *Oteake Conservation Park *Pirongia Forest Park *Pureora Forest Park *Raukumara Conservation Park *Remutaka Forest Park *Ruahine Forest Park *Ruataniwha Conservation Park *Tararua Forest Park *Te Kahui Kaupeka Conservation Park *Te Papanui Conservation Park *Victoria Forest Park *Whakarewarewa Conservation Park *Whirinaki Te Pua-a-TƒÅne Conservation Park =Island reserves= Often referred to as Island Sanctuaries these off- shore islands have been set aside by organisations like the Department of Conservation as reserves for endemic and native New Zealand species: *Blumine Island *The Brothers Islands *Codfish Island *Kapiti Island *Little Barrier Island *Mana Island *Maud Island *Matiu / Somes Island *Motutapu Island *Poor Knights Islands *Rangitoto Island *Resolution Island *Stephens Island *Stewart Island / Rakiura *Tiritiri Matangi Island *Ulva Island *Whakaari / White Island =Mainland islands= The Department of Conservation have set up five mainland islands: *Boundary Stream Mainland Island *Paengaroa Mainland Island *Rotoiti Mainland Island *Te Urewera Mainland Island *Trounson Kauri Park Mainland Island =Marine reserves= New Zealand has over three dozen marine reserves spread around the North and South Islands, and two on outlying island groups.

Some have historic values and others have ecological values. =Regional parks= Regional parks of New Zealand are administered by regional councils. =Scenic reserves= Scenic reserves are the most common protected area in New Zealand and most are relatively small ‚Äì many are less than 1 square kilometre, though some are more than 10 square kilometres. Most scenic reserves are visually attractive remnant areas of native forest close to roads. Statutory control of scenic reserves was earlier provided by the Scenery Preservation Act 1903 and now by the Reserves Act 1977. = Esplanade Reserves = Esplanade Reserves are strips of land beside the sea, rivers and lakes. They were usually wide when created; hence often known as the 'Queen's Chain'. s.229 of the RMA requires that esplanade reserves contribute to the protection of conservation values, by supporting the natural functioning of an adjacent waterway, its water quality, aquatic habitats, natural values, mitigating natural hazards, or allowing public access, proving access is compatible with conservation values. District Plans can set reserve widths and the size of subdivision for which they're required. = Local Reserves = Local reserves can be created for, \\"utility, road, street, access way, esplanade, service lane, playcentre, kindergarten, plunket room, or other like purpose\\"Reserves Act 1977 s.16 They cover a wide range of purposes, many of them not for conservation, such as water reserves to protect reservoir catchments, quarry reserves, pilot reserves, and aerodrome reserves. =Wetlands= New Zealand is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, and as of 2008 there are six Ramsar-registered sites in New Zealand: * Farewell Spit * Firth of Thames * Kopuatai Peat Dome * Manawatu River mouth and estuary * Awarua Wetland * Whangamarino Travis Wetland is an ecological restoration project in Christchurch that was purchased by the city council as a nature reserve. =World Heritage sites= There are three World Heritage Sites in New Zealand: *Te Wahipounamu *Tongariro National Park *New Zealand Subantarctic Islands =Private reserves= *Hinewai Reserve =Other protected areas= *JM Barker (Hapupu) Historic Reserve *Zealandia (wildlife sanctuary), Wellington *Maungatautari Restoration Project *Mount Tutu Eco- Sanctuary *Nugget Point *Orokonui Ecosanctuary *Lake Rotokare, Taranaki *Brook Waimarama Sanctuary See also *Protected areas References External links *Department of Conservation *Protected areas databases at Landcare Research Category:Lists of tourist attractions in New Zealand ","title":"Protected areas of New Zealand"},{"id":"1919200","text":"Michelle Alexander (born October 7, 1967) is a writer, civil rights advocate, and visiting professor at Union Theological Seminary (New York City). She is best known for her 2010 book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, and is an opinion columnist for The New York Times. Early life Alexander was born on October 7, 1967 in Chicago, Illinois to an interracial couple, John Alexander and Sandra Alexander (Huck) who were wed in 1965. In 1975, the family moved to the San Francisco area, where her father worked as a salesman for IBM.

In 2018, she was hired as an opinion columnist at The New York Times. =The New Jim Crow= Alexander published her book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in 2010. In it, she argued that systemic racial discrimination in the United States resumed following the Civil Rights Movement, and that the resumption is embedded in the US War on Drugs and other governmental policies and is having devastating social consequences. She considered the scope and impact of this to be comparable with that of the Jim Crow laws of the 19th and 20th centuries. Her book concentrated on the high rate of incarceration of African-American men for various crimes.Alexander, Michelle, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (New York: The New Press, 2010), . Alexander wrote, \\"Race plays a major role‚Äîindeed, a defining role‚Äîin the current system, but not because of what is commonly understood as old-fashioned, hostile bigotry. This system of control depends far more on racial indifference (defined as a lack of compassion and caring about race and racial groups) than racial hostility ‚Äì a feature it actually shares with its predecessors.\\"Alexander, The New Jim Crow, p. 198. The New Jim Crow described how she believes oppressed minorities are \\"subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, public benefits, and jury service, just as their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents once were\\". Alexander argued the harsh penalty of how \\"people whose only crime is drug addiction or possession of a small amount of drugs for recreational use find themselves locked out of the mainstream society‚Äîpermanently‚Äîand also highlights the inequality presented from the fact that \\"blacks are admitted to prison on drug charges at a rate from twenty to fifty-seven times greater than that of white men\\". The New Jim Crow was re-released in paperback in 2012. As of March 2012 it had been on The New York Times Best Seller list for six weeks and it also reached number 1 on the Washington Post bestseller list in 2012. The book has also been the subject of scholarly debate and criticism. In the fall of 2015, all freshmen enrolled at Brown University read The New Jim Crow as part of the campus's First Readings Program initiated by the Office of the Dean of the College and voted on by the faculty.\\"About The Book\\", Brown University Library. Yale University clinical law professor James Forman Jr., while acknowledging many similarities and insights in the Jim Crow analogy, has argued that Alexander overstates her case for decarceration, and leaves out important ways in which the newer system of mass incarceration is different. Forman Jr. identifies Alexander as one of a number of authors who have overstated and misstated their case. He asserts that her framework over- emphasizes the War on Drugs, and ignores violent crimes, asserting that Alexander's analysis is demographically simplistic. Alexander refers to electronic ankle monitoring practices as the \\"Newest Jim Crow,\\" increasingly segregating people of color under bail reform laws that \\"look good on paper\\" but are based on a presumption of guilt and replace bail with shackles as pre- trial detainees consent to electronic monitoring in order to be released from jail. =Hidden Colors 2 = Alexander appeared in a 2012 documentary Hidden Colors 2: The Triumph of Melanin, in which she discussed the impact of mass incarceration in melanoid communities. Alexander said: \\"Today there are more African American adults, under correctional control, in prison or jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850 a decade before the Civil War began. = 13th = Alexander appeared in the 2016 documentary 13th directed by Ava DuVernay. As a guest expert interviewee, Alexander described the evolution of racial disparity in the United States of America through its evolution from slavery, the Jim Crow laws, the War on Drugs, to mass incarceration. Alexander said, \\"So many aspects of the Old Jim Crow are suddenly legal again once you've been branded a felon. And so it seems that in America, we haven't so much ended racial caste but simply redesigned it\\". Personal life In 2002, Alexander married Carter Mitchell Stewart, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School.

It is based on the novel If I Die Before I Wake by Sherwood King. Although The Lady from Shanghai initially received mixed reviews, it has grown in stature over the years, and many critics have praised its set designs and camerawork. In 2018, The Lady from Shanghai was selected for the United States National Film Registry as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot Irish sailor Michael O'Hara meets the beautiful blonde Elsa as she rides a horse-drawn coach in Central Park. Three hooligans waylay the coach. Michael rescues Elsa and escorts her home. Michael reveals he is a seaman and learns Elsa and her husband, disabled criminal defense attorney Arthur Bannister, are newly arrived in New York City from Shanghai. They are on their way to San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Michael, attracted to Elsa despite misgivings, agrees to sign on as an able seaman aboard Bannister's yacht. They are joined on the boat by Bannister's partner, George Grisby, who proposes that Michael \\"murder\\" him in a plot to fake his own death. He promises Michael $5,000 and explains that since he would not really be dead and since there would be no corpse, Michael could not be convicted of murder (reflecting corpus delicti laws at the time). Michael agrees, intending to use the money to run away with Elsa. Grisby has Michael sign a confession. Welles as Michael O'Hara in The Lady from Shanghai (1947) On the night of the crime, Sydney Broome, a private investigator who has been following Elsa on her husband's orders, confronts Grisby. Broome has learned of Grisby's plan to murder Bannister, frame Michael, and escape by pretending to have also been murdered. Grisby shoots Broome and leaves him for dead. Unaware of what has happened, Michael proceeds with the night's arrangement and sees Grisby off on a motorboat before shooting a gun into the air to draw attention to himself. Meanwhile, Broome, mortally wounded but still alive, asks Elsa for help. He warns her that Grisby intends to kill her husband. Michael makes a phone call to Elsa, but finds Broome on the other end of the line. Broome warns Michael that Grisby was setting him up. Michael rushes to Bannister's office in time to see Bannister is alive, but that the police are removing Grisby's body from the premises. The police find evidence implicating Michael, including his confession, and take him away. At trial, Bannister acts as Michael's attorney. He feels he can win the case if Michael pleads justifiable homicide. During the trial, Bannister learns of his wife's relationship with Michael. He ultimately takes pleasure in his suspicion that they will lose the case. Bannister also indicates that he knows the real killer's identity. Before the verdict, Michael escapes by feigning a suicide attempt (swallowing pain relief pills Bannister takes for his disability), causing a commotion in which he slips out of the building with the jury for another case. Elsa follows. Michael and she hide in a Chinatown theater. Elsa calls some Chinese friends to meet her. As Michael and Elsa wait and pretend to watch the show, Michael realizes that she killed Grisby. Michael passes out from the pills he took just as Elsa's Chinese friends arrive; they carry the unconscious Michael to an empty fun house. When he wakes, he realizes that Grisby and Elsa had been planning to murder Bannister and frame him for the crime, but that Broome's involvement ruined the scheme and that Elsa had to kill Grisby for her own protection. The film features a unique climactic shootout in a hall of mirrors involving a multitude of false and real mirrored images in the Magic Mirror Maze, in which Elsa is mortally wounded and Bannister is killed. Heartbroken, and ignoring Elsa's pleas to save her life, Michael leaves presuming that events which have unfolded since the trial will clear him of any crimes. \\"Maybe I would live so long I'd forget her. Maybe I'd die trying\\". Cast Production In the summer of 1946, Welles was directing Around the World, a musical stage adaptation of the Jules Verne novel Around the World in Eighty Days, with a comedic and ironic book by Welles, incidental music and songs by Cole Porter, and production by Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful film version with David Niven. When Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, Welles financed it. When he ran out of money and urgently needed $55,000 to release costumes that were being held, he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send him the money to continue the show and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce and direct a film for Cohn for no further fee. As Welles tells it, on the spur of the moment, he suggested the film be based on a book that he happened to see in front of him during his call with Cohn, one a girl in the theatre box office was reading at the time. Welles had never read it.Interview with Orson Welles, 1982, Arena, BBC Television However, according to the daughter of William Castle, it was her father who had purchased the film adaptation rights for the novel and who then asked Welles to pitch it to Cohn, with Castle hoping to receive the directoral assignment himself. She described her father as greatly respecting Welles' talents, but feeling nonetheless disappointed at being relegated to serve merely as Welles' assistant director on the film.Documentary. Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story (2007) Director: Jeffrey Schwarz Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth shortly before her lush auburn hair was bleached and cut for The Lady from Shanghai (1946) The Lady from Shanghai began filming on 2 October 1946, and originally finished filming on 27 February 1947, with studio-ordered retakes continuing through March 1947‚Äîbut it was not released in the U.S. until 9 June 1948. Cohn strongly disliked Welles' rough cut, particularly what he considered to be a confusing plot and lack of close-ups (Welles had deliberately avoided these, as a stylistic device), and was not in sympathy with Welles' Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. He also objected to the appearance of the film‚ÄîWelles had aimed for documentary-style authenticity by shooting one of the first major Hollywood pictures almost entirely on location (in Acapulco, Pie de la Cuesta, Sausalito and San Francisco) using long takes, and Cohn preferred the more tightly-controlled look of footage lit and shot in a studio. Release was delayed due to Cohn's order for extensive editing and reshoots. Whereas Welles had delivered his cut of the film on time and under budget, the reshoots Welles was ordered to do meant that the film ended up over budget by a third, contributing to the director's reputation for going over budget. Once the reshoots were over, the heavy editing ordered by Cohn took over a year to complete; editor Viola Lawrence cut about an hour from Welles' rough cut. Welles was appalled at the musical score and particularly aggrieved by the cuts to the climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse at the end of the film. Intended as a climactic tour-de-force of editing and production design, the scene was cut to fewer than three minutes out of an intended running time of twenty. As with many of Welles' films over which he did not have control over the final cut, the missing footage has not been found and is presumed to have been destroyed. Surviving production stills show elaborate and expensive sets built for the sequence which were entirely cut from the film.Jean-Paul Berthom√© and Francois Thomas, Orson Welles at Work, London: Phaidon Press, 2008, pp. 128‚Äì142. Welles cast his wife Rita Hayworth as Elsa and caused controversy when he instructed her to cut her long red hair and bleach it blonde for the role. \\"Orson was trying something new with me, but Harry Cohn wanted The Image‚ÄîThe Image he was gonna make me 'til I was 90,\\" Rita Hayworth recalled. \\"The Lady from Shanghai was a very good picture. So what does Harry Cohn say when he sees it? 'He's ruined you‚Äîhe cut your hair off!'\\" The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of its release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become one of the touchstones of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce. A remake of the film came close to production at the turn of the century from a screenplay written by Jeff Vintar, based both on the Orson Welles script and the original pulp novel, produced by John Woo and Terence Chang, and starring Brendan Fraser, who wanted Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones to co-star. Although the screenplay was considered highly successful, and Fraser was coming off the highly praised Gods and Monsters, the project was abandoned when the head of Sony Pictures, Amy Pascal, decided to concentrate on teen films. =Filming locations= In addition to the Columbia Pictures studios, the film was partly shot on location in San Francisco. It features the Sausalito waterfront and Sally Stanford's Valhalla waterfront bar and cafe, the front, interior, and a courtroom scene of the old Kearny Street Hall of Justice, and shots of Welles running across Portsmouth Square, escaping to a long scene in a theater in Chinatown, then the Steinhart Aquarium in Golden Gate Park, and Whitney's Playland-at-the-Beach amusement park at Ocean Beach for the hall of mirrors scene, for which interiors were shot on a soundstage. Other scenes were filmed in Acapulco. The yacht , on which many scenes take place, was owned by actor Errol Flynn, who skippered the yacht in between takes and can also be seen in the background in one scene at a cantina in Acapulco. Critical reaction Reviews for The Lady from Shanghai were initially mixed. Variety magazine found the script wordy and noted that the \\"rambling style used by Orson Welles has occasional flashes of imagination, particularly in the tricky backgrounds he uses to unfold the yarn, but effects, while good on their own, are distracting to the murder plot.\\" Satyajit Ray called it the first atonal film made in the history of cinema. A more recent Time Out Film Guide review states that Welles simply didn't care enough to make the narrative seamless: \\"the principal pleasure of The Lady from Shanghai is its tongue-in-cheek approach to story-telling.\\" One recent book on film noir praises the film for its pervasive atmosphere of malaise and its impressive, extraordinary technical mastery. Although The Lady From Shanghai was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until several decades later. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% approval from critics, and an average rating of 8.12/10. Influential modern critics including David Kehr have subsequently declared it a masterpiece, with Kehr calling it \\"the weirdest great movie ever made.\\" In the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll, six critics each ranked it one of the 10 greatest films of all time. Preservation The Lady from Shanghai was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with Sony Pictures, in 2000. In popular culture * In the 1984 Sergio Leone film Once Upon A Time In America, Robert DeNiro's character Noodles hides out in a Chinese theatre, a front for an opium den, alluding to a scene in which Orson Welles' character hides out in a Chinese theatre to evade the law. *In the 1989 movie Ghostbusters II (1989), Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, and Sigourney Weaver's characters are watching The Lady from Shanghai on the TV in Bill Murray's character's apartment. Moranis and Potts were discussing the relationship between Welles and Hayworth. * The Woody Allen film Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), a comedy film noir, features a tribute to the film, with its climactic gun battle being set in a cinema behind the screen while it is projecting the shoot-out from The Lady From Shanghai. * In the Jim Jarmusch film The Limits of Control (2009), Tilda Swinton's character says that the movie makes no sense. =Hall of mirrors sequence= The climactic hall of mirrors sequence has entered the narrative of cinema as a trope, replicated countless times in both film and television. Examples include: * The 1965 television episode of The Avengers entitled \\"Too Many Christmas Trees\\", and broadcast on Christmas Day in the UK, features Steed (Patrick Macnee) and Mrs Peel (Diana Rigg) confronting their nemesis in a hall of mirrors shoot-out. * In the 1970 television episode of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) entitled \\"Vendetta for a Dead Man\\", Eric Jansen (George Sewell) menaces Jeannie Hopkirk (Annette Andre) in a hall of mirrors. * In the 1973 Robert Clouse film Enter the Dragon, Bruce Lee's character fights the villain Mr. Han in a hall of mirrors. * In the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun, Bond and the villain, Francisco Scaramanga, have a climactic shootout in a hall of mirrors. * The 1989 MacGyver episode \\"Brainwashed\\" has a scene involving MacGyver's brainwashed friend, Jack Dalton, shooting at him in a hall of mirrors. Episode writer John Sheppard credited The Lady From Shanghai as an influence. *On the cartoon Batman:The Animated Series \\"Baby Doll\\" (1994) Mary Dahl shoots out all the Hall of Mirrors while hiding from Batman. * In the Chad Stahelski film John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), Keanu Reeves's character fights the pre-final showdown in a museum's hall of mirrors.

While the rest of the constitution theoretically assured the public freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of press these rights were rendered less meaningful by the reservation of article 6 that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was the \\"leading and guiding force of the Soviet society\\". The text of the article follows in English translation. > The leading and guiding force of the Soviet society and the nucleus of its > political system, of all state organisations and public organisations, is > the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU exists for the people and > serves the people.

All party organisations shall function within the framework of > the Constitution of the USSR. This provision was used to justify the banning of opposition parties, as well as harsh measures against opposition of any sort. The theory was that since the CPSU was the vanguard of the state, its right to rule could not be legitimately questioned. The \\"leading role\\" of the CPSU was first enshrined in Article 126 of the Stalin Constitution, which described the Party as \\"the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the socialist system and is the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state.\\" On March 14, 1990 Article 6 was amended by the 3rd Extraordinary Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, to read as follows: > The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, other political parties as well as > labor, youth and other public organisations and mass movements, through > their representatives elected to the Councils of People's Deputies and in > other forms participate in the policy-making of the Soviet state, in the > management of state and public affairs. This move was introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev in tandem with the creation of the office of the president of the USSR (which he viewed largely as an office for himself), and as a means to formalize the transition to a multi-party political system. After the amending of Article 6 of the Constitution, the CPSU effectively lost its right to rule the Soviet Union's government apparatus; paving the way towards a multi-party democracy.

Its native range is from southern Florida to southern Brazil. It generally grows on the unshaded twigs of trees, and has been shown experimentally to trap more insects in its tank than other bromeliads of comparable size. There are several other species in the genus, none of which is believed to be carnivorous. Characteristics Catopsis berteroniana is an epiphytic insectivorous plant with elongate leaves. These erect leaves overlap to form tube-like structures characteristic of many tank bromeliads. Rainwater falls and lands in the tubes, forming pools of water called phytotelmata, an aqueous medium filled with copious amounts of nutrients available for the plant to absorb. This medium is slightly acidic, but very close to neutral; according to algae in bromeliads, the pH of the phytotelmata of Catopsis berteroniana is 6.8. This species has sessile glands located on the plant epidermis that are used to absorb nutrients. Other species of carnivorous plants, such as Cephalotus follicularis, use these glands to secrete enzymes to break down detritus and trap prey. However, C. berteroniana lacks enzyme production, so this plant breaks down materials using other methods. An important feature located on the leaves of Catopsis berteroniana is the presence of a white powder. This powder is released from the leaves of the plant. It is very slippery and reflects ultraviolet light. =Epiphytes= Catopsis berteroniana is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on another host. However, the plant does not receive nutrients from its host via its roots. Instead, the roots attach to the tree in order to provide stability. In turn, nutrients are obtained from its leaves. According to Fish, 1976, plants have moved away from root absorption in relation to adaptations and moved toward foliar procurement and nutrient absorption. Distribution Catopsis berteroniana is found in the neotropics, from southern Florida to southern Brazil. It grows above the tree canopies where it is exposed to a high amount of sunlight. According to Fish, 1976, due to the location of Catopsis berteroniana above the tree canopies, this species dodges direct competition with other species because they do not need to receive any nutrients from the soil or tree canopies. In Everglades National Park in southern Florida, these plants were found at the apex of red mangroves and in areas of limited shade. One of the major reasons this species is restricted to the neotropics is because the phytotelmata are limited to humid environments. This is because the plant does not have enough energy available to make up for the excessive evaporation that occurs in very dry climates. Microhabitat Phytotelmata of Catopsis berteroniana serve as homes for many organisms, called inquilines. Many types of larvae develop in this medium. This is a very interesting feature because the major function of phytotelmata is to catch prey, not to support life forms. According to Adlassnig, Peroutka & Lendl, 2010, this plant hosts 11 inquiline species. Wyeomyia mitchellii is a species of mosquito that develops in the medium of the phytotelmata. It takes about 2 weeks for the larvae to fully develop. Once they develop, the mosquitoes can escape from the plant without getting trapped by the powder. Mutualism occurs between Catopsis berteroniana and these larvae: the plant provides a habitat for the larvae while the larvae help break down nitrogenous nutrients for faster absorption by the plant. There are also parasitic relationships that affect the bromeliad. Metamasius callizona, a weevil, will feed on the meristematic tissue of the Catopsis species, which will inevitably kill the plant. Other organisms that use phytotelmata as a home are algae. These organisms are essential to the plant itself. There is an entire food web within the phytotelmata: through anemophilous nutrition, the plant obtains its nutrients from the wind. Algae use these nutrients to grow and then become a food source for other organisms. Sunlight is a major factor that determines algal growth within the tanks: an increase in transmitted light results in an increase in algal growth. It shapes the entire food web because algae make up 30% of the living carbon within the bromeliad tanks located in an area with a high amount of sunlight. Carnivory Trapping prey is the main mechanism for obtaining nutrients for Catopsis berteroniana. This species uses a passive trap, called a tank, to trap and digest the target. Because this species is insectivorous, the typical prey that get trapped are insects. The purpose of these traps is to obtain inorganic nutrients from the degradation of insects, most commonly nitrogen and phosphorus. This species is an epiphyte, so most of the insects that get caught in the trap are winged insects. They are lured to the plant by a white powder that is located on the leaves. This powder reflects UV light, so the insect sees the UV reflection better than visual light, because pollen reflects these wavelengths. The organism falls into the fluid where it cannot escape due to the slippery powder on the leaves. The fluid's purpose is to drown the organisms because most cannot survive in the fluid.

The martyrs take their name from Scilla (or Scillium), a town in Numidia. The Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs are considered to be the earliest documents of the church of Africa and also the earliest specimen of Christian Latin. It was the last of the persecutions during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, which is best known from the sufferings of the churches of Vienne and Lyon in South Gaul. Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March of the year in question, and persecution ceased sometime after the accession of his son Commodus. A group of sufferers called the Madaurian martyrs seems to belong to the same period: for in the correspondence of St Augustine, Namphamo, one of their number, is spoken of as \\"archimartyr,\\" which appears to mean protomartyr of Africa. The martyrs The martyrs' trial and execution took place in Carthage under the proconsul Publius Vigellius Saturninus, whom Tertullian declares to have been the first persecutor of Christians in Africa. The Scillitan sufferers were twelve in all‚Äîseven men and five women. Their names were Speratus, Nartzalus, Cintinus (Cittinus), Veturius, Felix, Aquilinus, Laetantius, Januaria, Generosa, Vestia, Donata, and Secunda. Two of these bear Punic names (Nartzalus, Cintinus), but the rest are Latin names. Six had already been tried: of the remainder, to whom these Acta primarily relate, Speratus was the principal spokesman. He claimed for himself and his companions that they had lived a quiet and moral life, paying their dues and doing no wrong to their neighbors. But when called upon to swear by the name of the emperor, he replied \\"I recognize not the empire of this world; but rather do I serve that God whom no man hath seen, nor with these eyes can see.\\" The response was a reference to the language of 1 Tim. vi. 16. In reply to the question, \\"What are the things in your satchel?\\", he said \\"Books and letters of Paul, a just man.\\" The martyrs were offered a delay of 30 days to reconsider their decision, which they all refused. The fame of the martyrs led to the building of a basilica in their honor at Carthage\\"Scillitan Martyrs, in North Africa\\", Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese and their annual commemoration required that the brevity and obscurity of their Acta should be supplemented and explained to make them suitable for public recitation. Veneration Agobard, archbishop of Lyons (c. 779‚Äì840) stated that the relics of Speratus, and those of Cyprian, were translated by Charlemagne's orders from Carthage to Lyons. The historical questions connected with these martyrs were addressed by bishop Joseph Barber Lightfoot in Epistles of Ignatius and Polycarp, 1885.An English translation with bibliography can be found in See also * Libellus Notes References * Further reading * Stokes, G.T., \\"Scillitan Martyrs\\", Dictionary of Christian Biography, (Henry Wace ed.), John Murray, London, 1911 * H.

It was first serialized in the magazine Pilote, issues 126‚Äì168, in 1962. Plot summary While stopping at the Roman Camp of Compendium, Prefect 'Odius Asparagus' wants one of the indomitable Gauls as a present for Julius Caesar. Because none of the others can be captured, Centurion Gracchus Armisurplus decides on Cacofonix the bard. Soldiers sent by the centurion, although driven away by Cacofonix's singing at first, counteract this by stuffing parsley in their ears and capture him easily. A young boy from the village raises the alarm to Asterix and Obelix, and the Gauls attack Compendium; but learn that the prefect has already left in his galley with Cacofonix. Asterix and Obelix therefore board a ship with Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant, who agrees to take them to Rome after they save him from the pirates. In Rome, after Cacofonix has subjected the slaves in the prefect's galley to his bad singing, the prefect presents him to Julius Caesar; but when Caius Fatuous, the gladiators' trainer, declares Cacofonix unfit to serve as a gladiator, Caesar decides to throw the bard to the lions. Upon arrival in Rome, Asterix and Obelix befriend Instantmix (a Gaulish cook working in Rome) and visit the public baths. There, Caius Fatuous decides they would be perfect candidates for the gladiators' fights in the Circus Maximus, and he arranges to have them captured. That night, Asterix and Obelix visit Instantmix in his insula, where he identifies the location of Cacofonix. The next morning, the Gauls' first attempt at rescuing the bard fails when they raid the Circus prison and discover that Cacofonix has been transferred to a lower basement. Caius Fatuous has his men try to ambush them in groups of three, but Asterix and Obelix defeat them with ease, and apparently without taking notice. Caius Fatuous then offers a reward of 10,000 sestertii to any citizen who captures Asterix and Obelix; but the two of them volunteer as gladiators to infiltrate the following Games, and Fatuous places them in training under his assistant Insalubrius. Soon, the Gauls demoralize Insalubrius and irritate Caius Fatuous by having the other gladiators play guessing-games instead of training. Later, when Fatuous plans the Games to Julius Caesar, the Gauls go on a stroll, with Caius Fatuous (reluctantly) as their guide. On the eve before the games, Asterix and Obelix visit Cacofonix in his cell and inform him of their intentions to free him and the gladiators. The next day, during the chariot races, Asterix and Obelix substitute themselves for an inebriated contestant, and win the race. As Cacofonix is put into the arena to be killed by the lions, he sings to the Romans, and thus frightens the lions into retreat; whereupon Caesar orders the gladiators' competition to begin. When Asterix, Obelix, and the gladiators introduce Caesar to their guessing-game, and Caesar insists on a martial contest, Asterix challenges a cohort of Caesar's own guard, and the two Gauls win easily. Seeing that the audience are amused, Caesar releases the three Gauls and grants them Fatuous as a prisoner. Soon afterwards, the four men meet back up with Ekonomikrisis, and Asterix surprises him and his men by having Caius Fatuous row the ship back to the Gaulish Village alone. After a brief journey (plus a second run in with the pirates, which sinks their ship), the Gauls arrive home and Ekonomikrisis keeps his promise to return Caius Fatuous to Rome. The villagers then celebrate the return of their heroes with a banquet, only with Cacofonix having to sit it out bound and gagged after offering to sing a song to celebrate his triumphant return. This book is noteworthy in the Asterix series as the first in which Obelix says his famous catchphrase \\"These Romans are crazy!\\" An audiobook of Asterix the Gladiator adapted by Anthea Bell and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on EMI Records Listen for Pleasure label in 1988.

He is widely regarded as one of the best English cricketers of the 20th century. Bedser played first-class cricket for Surrey from 1939 to 1960 alongside his identical twin brother Eric. He took 1924 first-class wickets in 485 matches. He played Test cricket for England from 1946 to 1955, taking 236 wickets in 51 Test matches. He passed Clarrie Grimmett's world record for Test wickets in 1953. He held the record until his final tally was passed by Brian Statham in 1963. After retirement as an active cricketer, Bedser became the chairman of selectors for the English national cricket team, and was the president of Surrey County Cricket Club. He was knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours. Early life and career Bedser was born in Reading, Berkshire, ten minutes after his identical twin brother Eric (1918‚Äì2006). His father was a bricklayer, but had been stationed in Reading with the Royal Air Force during the First World War. The brothers remained inseparable through their lives: they often dressed identically, and shared a bank account; neither married.Alec Bedser ‚Äì Cricketer of the Year 1947 (Accessed 21 May 2005) (Excerpt from Wisden Cricketer's Almanack 1947)Rob Steen, ‚ÄòBedser, Sir Alec Victor (1918‚Äì2010)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2014 accessed 14 February 2014 Within six months the family moved to Horsell, Surrey, where, at the age of seven, the brothers played their first organised cricket. The family moved to Knaphill, Surrey and then to a house they helped their father to build in Woking. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and then Monument Hill Central School in Woking. Over the next decade, the twin brothers played cricket together for Monument Hill School and Woking Cricket Club. They also both played football for Monument Hill School, both as full backs. After leaving school, Eric and Alec became clerks at the same firm of solicitors in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted practising in the nets for Woking Cricket Club by Surrey coach Alan Peach, and he recruited them to the staff at the Oval in 1938. Initially, they were both medium-fast bowlers, but (after Alec won a toss of a coin) Eric became an off spinner instead. They made their first-class d√©buts for Surrey against Oxford University in June 1939. Second World War Their cricket careers were soon interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War. They both joined the RAF police, and were sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force. They both narrowly escaped being shot before being evacuated from Dunkirk, and later served in North Africa, Italy and Austria. Eric was promoted to Warrant Officer, but Alec refused a similar promotion, staying a flight sergeant so they could continue to serve together. They were demobilised in 1946.

In his first full season for Surrey, in 1946, he passed 100 wickets before July and established himself as a bowler in the England Test team. In each of his first two Tests, against the visiting Indians, he took eleven wickets: 11 for 139 in his d√©but at Lord's, including 7 in the first innings, and 11 for 96 in the next game at Old Trafford, Manchester. His amazing season resulted in his nomination as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1947. He was selected for the 1946‚Äì47 Ashes series in Australia and for most of the next decade \\"carried England's bowling attack\\".Alec Bedser. ESPNCricinfo In Australia he was overbowled and exhausted and found that his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this he gripped the ball across the seam like a spinner and the result was an in-swinging leg-break which would be known as Bedser's \\"Special Ball\\". Don Bradman wrote \\"the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps.\\"Swanton, E.W. (1975) Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946‚Äì1975, Fontana/Collins. p. 65. . Meanwhile, his brother Eric became an all-rounder in the Surrey team, concentrating on his batting as the team also included spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock. The two were difficult to tell apart, both 6'3\\" tall and just over 15 stone. Playing for Surrey against an England representative team in 1946, they are reputed to have shared an over ‚Äì Alec bowling the first three balls and then swapping with Eric fielding at mid-on for Eric to complete the over ‚Äì without being detected by the batsman, Frank Woolley. In the 1950-51 Ashes series, Alec began his dominance of Australian batsmen, taking 30 wickets at an average of 16.06 and 10 for 105 in the Fifth Test when he ended Australia's unbeaten run of 26 Tests since 1938. In 1953 at 35, an age by which many fast bowlers have retired from first-class cricket, Bedser demonstrated his longevity by helping England regain the Ashes. He took 39 wickets at an average of 17.48 at home to Australia, including career-best match figures of 14 for 99 in the Nottingham Test. Bedser founded his success on accuracy of line and length, bowled at a medium pace from a short run-up, using his powerful shoulders and large hands to achieve sharp inswing and surprising batsmen with occasional leg cutters. Bedser was aged 36 by the first Test of the 1954‚Äì55 tour of Australia. He took 1 for 131 as seven catches were dropped off his bowling, including Arthur Morris (153) before he had scored ‚Äì and England lost by an innings. He was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from shingles and despite a recovery and a green wicket tailor-made for his bowling in the second Test he was dropped from the side, and watched as the younger Frank Tyson and Brian Statham bowled England to victory. He was recalled for one Test against South Africa in 1955. In a Test career extending from 1946 to 1955, Bedser played 51 matches and took 236 wickets (average 24.89), at the time the most wickets taken in Test cricket. He was England's post-war bowling spearhead. He had 14 new ball partners, and took five wickets in an innings 15 times and ten wickets in a match 5 times. His entire first-class career spanned 485 matches, in which he helped Surrey to eight County Championships between 1950 and 1958. Bedser occasionally captained the side in place of Stuart Surridge or Peter May. He took 100 wickets in a county season eleven times, figures that place him high amongst the game's greats. He took five or more wickets in an innings 96 times, and ten wickets or more in a match 16 times. Bedser retired from cricket in 1960, and his brother Eric retired in 1962. After retirement Statue of Alec Bedser by Allan Sly in Woking After retiring from playing cricket, Bedser went into business with his brother. Among other business interests, they co-operated with Ronald Straker in a successful stationery firm, Straker-Bedser, which was later taken over by Ryman in 1977. Bedser served as a national team selector from 1962 to 1985, and was chairman of selectors from 1968 to 1981. He was on the board of selectors who controversially left Basil d'Oliveira out of the England team for 1968's tour of South Africa. England won ten of the 18 series while Bedser was chairman of selectors. Bedser also managed two England overseas tours. Bedser was made president of Surrey in 1987 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the county's cricketing fortunes over the previous five decades. He was knighted for his services to cricket in the 1997 New Year Honours. In October 2004 Bedser was selected in 'England's Greatest Post-War XI' by The Wisden Cricketer, an authoritative monthly cricket magazine. In May 2009, Christopher Martin-Jenkins ranked Bedser 29th in picking his 100 greatest cricketers of all time. Outside of cricket, Bedser was a founding member of the right-wing pressure group, the Freedom Association during the 1970s, which advocated the maintenance of sporting relations with South Africa during the apartheid era. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1964, advanced to Commander (CBE) in 1982, and in 1996 he became the first (and still only) England bowler to be knighted for services to cricket. Neither Alec nor his brother Eric ever married. They lived together in Woking until Eric's death in 2006.

He was also one of the great thinkers about cricket and his wisdom was one of the great untapped resources of the modern game.\\" For three months following the death of Arthur McIntyre on 26 December 2009, Bedser was the oldest surviving England Test cricketer. On Bedser's death, that distinction passed to Reg Simpson.

In the episode \\"Honour Thy Father And Thy Mother\\" (17 September 1984), the bat is mauled by a dog off-screen, much to Chance's annoyance.

Musically, however, The Return differs from the rest of the band's discography by being their most overtly ska-based, featuring some of the surf music influences which characterized their early material but little of the new wave or punk rock elements which would eventually become the core of the band's sound on future releases. The Aquabats independently released The Return on their own record label Horchata Records in July 1996, pressing and selling the CDs themselves. As the band's local notoriety began to rise with the commercial resurgence of ska music, they eventually sold an impressive 24,000 copies without any distribution. By the end of the 1990s, The Return eventually fell out of print, and the album was re-issued and distributed by Fearless Records in 2002. The Return was the only Aquabats album to feature original guitarist The Brain (Ben Bergeson), keyboardist Nacho (Chad Parkin) and drummer Roddy B.

History On May 15, 1928, a local professional fraternity by the name of Gamma Theta Upsilon was formed at Illinois State University under the guidance of Dr. R. G. Buzzard. Before that it was the Geography Club at Illinois State Normal University. After three years letters were sent out to other geography clubs suggesting the formation of a national fraternity. On May 15, 1931, the organization, consisting of four chapters, was announced. On March 5, 1936, Gamma Theta Upsilon was incorporated, then with ten chapters, as a professional fraternity in geography under the laws of Illinois. Gamma Theta Upsilon became an International Honorary Geographical Society in January 1969. The organization is a college honor society, and has been a member of the Association of College Honor Societies since 1976. Badge The badge of Gamma Theta Upsilon is a key, significant of achievement of quality in a field of science. The symbolism of the key is as follows: The base or body of the key is a seven sided shield, the bevel of which carries on each side the initial of one of the great land masses of the earth. Beginning with Europe at the top, to the right is Asia, Africa and Australia, the great land masses of the Old or Eastern World. To the left on the key is North America, South America, and Antarctica, the three great land masses brought into geographical knowledge as man expanded westward from Europe, the so-called New World. Spread across the base of the key are five wavy blue lines, significant of the five great bodies of water which have carried man out from Europe to the lands of the earth, -the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Antarctic Ocean or Great Southern Ocean. Above the waves significant of the oceans is placed a white star, symbolic of Polaris, the great guide to man as he pushed out from Europe over the uncharted vastness of the ocean. At the top of the key the Greek-letters, Gamma, Theta, and Upsilon, the initials of the three Greek words, (Ge), (Thalatta), and (Hypaithrios), meaning earth, sea, and atmosphere-placed there to remind you of the three great environmental domains with which geography deals. The purposes of GTU To further professional interest in geography by affording a common organization for those interested in this field. To strengthen student and professional training through academic experiences other than those of the classroom and laboratory. To advance the status of geography as a cultural and practical discipline for study and investigation. To encourage student research of high quality and to promote an outlet for publication. To create and administer funds for furthering graduate study and/or research in the field of geography. Chapters and Membership Local Chapters are chartered by Gamma Theta Upsilon at colleges and universities. A petition for a new chapter must be submitted by the faculty member who will serve as chapter sponsor or by the department chair and a letter of support from the department chair (if not the petitioner) or an appropriate administrator is required. An on-line form is available at http://www.gammathetaupsilon.org/petition-for- charter.html. As of December 2012, there are 163 active chapters (http://www.gammathetaupsilon.org/chapters.html). Once a chapter has been established, members can be initiated into the society. Initiates must have completed a minimum of 3 geography courses, must have a GPA of at least 3.3 overall and in geography, and must have completed at least 3 semesters or 5 quarters of college course work. Scholarships Five scholarships (four for undergraduates and one for a graduate student) are awarded on an annual basis. In evaluating scholarship applications, consideration is given to cumulative GPA, geography GPA, letters of recommendation, the applicant‚Äôs contribution to local GTU chapter and the department, as well as the applicant‚Äôs own appraisal of how the scholarship will help him or her personally and professionally. The Scholarships are: * The Buzzard Undergraduate Scholarship * The Maxfield Undergraduate Scholarship * The Rechlin Undergraduate Scholarship * The Richason Undergraduate Scholarship * The Buzzard Graduate Scholarship. Previous recipients of the Scholarships can be found at http://www.gammathetaupsilon.org/scholarships-awarded.html. The Geographical Bulletin This scholarly journal is published twice a year by GTU. Articles concerning any area of geographical interest are solicited from students and faculty. Initiates receive two free issues after initiation and may subsequently renew their subscription. Visiting Geographical Scientist Program (VGSP) The Visiting Geographical Scientist Program, funded by GTU and administered by the Association of American Geographers (AAG), provides an opportunity for chapters to host a distinguished geographer on their campus. The visiting geographer will give a lecture on a topic in geography and meet with faculty, students and administrators.

Angostura bitters () is a concentrated bitters (herbal alcoholic preparation) based on gentian, herbs, and spices, by House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. It is typically used for flavouring beverages or, less often, food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bol√≠var, Venezuela), hence the name, but do not contain angostura bark. The bottle is recognisable by its distinctive over-sized label. Angostura is Spanish for narrowing, the town of Angostura having been located at the first narrowing of the Orinoco River. History The recipe was developed as a tonic by Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert,Siegert v. Gandolfi et al., reported in The Federal Reporter 149 1907:100ff. a German surgeon general in Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's army in Venezuela. Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830.1830 date given as testimony in Siegert v. Findlater, 1876, reported in N.C. Moak,Reports of Cases Decided by the English Courts: \\"8. Chancery Division\\" (Albany, NY, 1880) pp21ff. Siegert was based in the town of Angostura and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians.Raymond, J.\\"Mysteries in Angostura Museum: Story of founder Dr. Siegert comes to life\\", Trinidad Guardian January 10, 2000 The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains.Siegert v. Findlater; Siegert v. Gandolfi. Angostura won a medal at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien. The medal is still depicted on the over-sized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in profile. The exact formula is a closely guarded secret, with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily. Since 2007, Angostura has also produced Angostura Orange, an orange bitters with bright floral notes and fresh orange peel. Angostura Orange has not dominated the orange bitters market in the same way that its aromatic bitters have become a go-to product for bars and consumers. In 2009 there was a shortage of Angostura bitters; the company reported that this was caused primarily by a problem in their supply of bottles. There were incorrect rumours of a product recall, or that production of the bitters had stopped at the plant in Trinidad. The shortage was the subject of many news articles and blogs, particularly in the cocktail industry. Uses Angostura bitters are extremely concentrated and may be an acquired taste; though 44.7% alcohol by volume, bitters are not normally ingested undiluted, but instead are used in small amounts as flavouring. =Medicinal= Angostura bitters are alleged to have restorative properties. Angostura bitters is often incorrectly believed to have poisonous qualities because it is associated with angostura bark (although it does not actually contain any), which, although not toxic, during its use as a medicine was often adulterated by unscrupulous sellers, who padded out the sacks of bark with cheaper, poisonous Strychnos nux-vomica or copalchi bark. Angostura is still often used by Trinidadians to treat digestive problems, under the assumption that the containing gentian may aid indigestion. =Cocktails= Angostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with gin. The mix stuck in the form of a pink gin, and is also used in many other cocktails such as long vodka, consisting of vodka, bitters, and lemonade. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: old fashioneds, made with whiskey, bitters, sugar, and water, and Manhattans, made usually with rye whiskey and red vermouth. In a pisco sour, a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a champagne cocktail, a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube. In Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local gunner cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the mojito cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \\"soft\\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is lemon, lime and bitters. In Malawi, bitters are added to a mix of crushed ice, ginger ale, and Sprite to make a rock shandy. Among certain bartending communities (especially in Malaysia), shots of Angostura are taken as the bartender's handshake either during or after the shift is done. The largest purveyor of Angostura bitters in the world is Nelsen's Hall Bitters Pub on Washington Island off the northeast tip of Door Peninsula in Door County, Wisconsin. The pub began selling shots of bitters as a stomach tonic for medicinal purposes under a pharmaceutical license during Prohibition in the United States. The practice, which helped the pub to become the oldest continuously operating tavern in Wisconsin, remained a tradition after the repeal of Prohibition. As of 2018, the pub hosts a Bitters Club, incorporates bitters into food menu items, and sells upwards of 10,000 shots per year. =Popular recipes= * Brut cocktail * Champagne cocktail * Fallen angel * Gunner * Manhattan * Old fashioned * Pink gin * Pisco sour * Prince of Wales * Rob Roy * Rum punch * Singapore sling * Zombie See also * Gentian (spirit) * Meinhard's Bitters References Further reading * Angostura Bitters Drink Guide, a promotional booklet of 1908, reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.

The clergy who benefit by the foundation are the incumbents of the City parishes, of parishes which adjoined the city bounds when the college was founded, and of parishes subsequently formed out of these. History King Charles I in 1630. The original buildings in London Wall were on a site previously occupied by Elsing Spital, a hospital for the blind founded in 1329, and earlier still by a nunnery. They comprised the almshouses, a hall and chapel, and the library added to the foundation by Dr John Simson, rector of St Olave Hart Street, one of White's executors. There were also, at least originally, apartments for students. The site was bounded by London Wall, Philip Lane, and Gayspur Lane (now Aldermanbury),Pearce, p. 14. roughly where Aldermanbury Square now stands. The first Court (committee) from 1630 consisted of John Gifford (President), Thomas Worrall and John Simson (Deans), and Francis Dee, Cornelius Burges, Edward Abbott and Thomas Wood (Assistants).Pearce, pp. 35‚Äì6. In the 1640s Sion College was regarded as a stronghold of the London presbyterians, their \\"de facto headquarters\\", and it took on a collective role from around 1645.Francis J. Bremer, Tom Webster, Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia (2006), p. 39. The administration of the College fell into the hands of the parliamentarian side during 1643, as John Sedgwick of St Alphage London Wall took on the royalists President James Marsh, archdeacon of Chichester, and Edward Sparke.Pearce, Ch. VI. A work from 1646 by Anthony Burges claimed support from College members including the President Arthur Jackson,Jason Peacey, Politicians and Pamphleteers (2004), p. 78. There were attacks on the College by the Independents John Goodwin (Sion-Colledg visited and Neophytopresbyteros) and John Price (1625?‚Äì1691) (The Pulpit Incendiary, 1648), and it was defended by Cornelius Burges (Sion College what it is, and doeth, 1648). William Jenkyn also attacked Goodwin (The Busie Bishop, or the Visitor Visited, and The Blind Guide, or Doling Doctor, 1648). Sion College, the North Front (1800) From 1647 to 1659 the provincial synod met there, leading to the name \\"Sion College Conclave\\";Pearce, p. 110. There was a practical distinction, the London Provincial Assembly consisting of elders rather than all ministers. The first synod took particular aim at John Milton's divorce tracts, beginning a polemic relationship with Milton. The Serious and Faithfull Representation (January 1649) of 47 London ministers, a work against Oliver Cromwell, arose from an assembly in the College; Milton's The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates from February of that year is in part an answer, and snipes at the ministers. The former Sion College building on Victoria Embankment The College was badly damaged in the Great Fire of London. In 1884 the almshouses were abolished, and the almsfolk became out-pensioners. It was subsequently found possible to extend their numbers from the original number of two men and two women to 40 in all, and to increase the pension. In 1886 Sion College was moved to new buildings at 56 Victoria Embankment, between Carmelite Street and John Carpenter Street. It became principally known for its theological library which served as a lending library to members of the college, and was accessible to the public. A governing body appointed by the members to administer the foundation includes a president, two deans and four assistants. In 1996, the college disposed of its large Victorian premises on the banks of the River Thames. The building has been converted into offices. The library was closed June 1996, with the manuscripts, pamphlets, and pre-1850 printed books going to Lambeth Palace Library, and newer books to The Maughan Library, King's College London. Its activities now take place in a variety of locations. Presidents Source: Pearce, Appendix A. =Charter to 1699= *Charter. John Gifford D.D. Rector of St Michael Bassishaw. *1631, 1632.

Consequently, calcifuges grown on alkaline soils often develop the symptoms of iron deficiency, i.e. interveinal chlorosis of new growth.

He was the elder identical twin brother of Alec Bedser (1918‚Äì2010), widely regarded as one of England's top bowlers of the 20th century. Eric was an all-rounder, a useful right-handed batsman and right-arm off-spin bowler. Eric Bedser was born in Reading, Berkshire 10 minutes before his twin brother Alec. The twins were regarded as 'inseparable' throughout their lives, and they often dressed identically. Their father served in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, later becoming a bricklayer. He also played cricket and football. The Bedser brothers began playing cricket together at age seven for local school sides and Woking Cricket Club. Both twins also played football for Surrey Boys, and considered a professional career in that sport. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and Monument Hill Central School. From the age of 14, the twins worked as clerks at a solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted by Surrey coach Alan Peach in 1938 and joined the Surrey county squad staff at the Oval, making their first-class debuts in the same match in June 1939. There is a famous story that when Eric and Alec were first selected for Surrey, they agreed they couldn't both be fast bowlers, as at that time they were. A flip of the coin saw Alec win the toss, and Eric consequently took up off-spin bowling, at which he became very adept in a Surrey county team that was dominated by famous spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and concentrated on his batting. The pair were called up for duty with the Royal Air Force in 1939, serving in France and being evacuated from Dunkirk. They later served variously together throughout the war, in North Africa and Italy. Eric was promoted to Warrant Officer (and Alec refused a similar promotion, staying a flight sergeant so they could stay together), and both being demobilised in 1946, and returned to cricket at Surrey. Statue of Eric Bedser by Allan Sly in Woking Bedser enjoyed a successful first-class career, a member of the Surrey team that won seven successive County Championships from 1952 to 1958, despite many of the side's best players being away playing for England. Despite being called to a Test Trial in 1950, in which Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs, one of which was scored by Eric, he was never called to play in a Test himself: he played for England only once, in a first-class tour match in Tasmania. As a result, Eric's record will always be lacking when compared with Alec's, who played in 51 Test matches, although Eric often accompanied Alec on overseas tours. In a first-class career that lasted twenty-three years, Bedser played in 457 matches for Surrey, scoring 14,716 runs at the useful batting average of 24.00, and taking 833 wickets at the good bowling average of 24.95. He passed 1,000 runs in six seasons. After retiring from playing cricket he went into business with his brother. Among other business interests, they co-operated with Ronald Straker in a successful stationery firm, Straker-Bedser, which was later taken over by Ryman in 1977. While Alec became a selector for England, Eric served on various committees at Surrey. He was president of Surrey County Cricket Club in 1990. Neither twin married, living together in a house that they built with their father in 1953 in Woking, until Eric died aged 87 in Woking.

It emphasized human dignity and equality among all people, and made mention of issues such as the rights of women, nuclear non-proliferation, and the United Nations, all of which it endorsed. It was the last encyclical drafted by John XXIII, who had been diagnosed with cancer in September 1962 and died two months after the encyclical's completion. Biographer Peter Hebblethwaite called it Pope John's \\"last will and testament\\". Published on Holy Thursday, the Pope called it his \\"Easter gift\\". Due to its importance and popularity, Pacem in Terris is deposited at the UN archives. Title The full title of the encyclical is On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty. The short title Pacem in terris is derived from the opening words of the encyclical, as is customary with papal documents: :Pacem in terris, quam homines universi cupidissime quovis tempore appetiverunt, condi confirmarique non posse constat, nisi ordine, quem Deus constituit, sancte servato.\\" :(\\"Peace on earth, for which all men of every era have most eagerly yearned, cannot be firmly established unless the order which God laid down is dutifully observed.\\") History German Stamp 1969 Pacem in terris was the first encyclical that a pope addressed to \\"all men of good will\\", rather than only to Catholics, quoting the praise to God as said by the heavenly army above the manger of Bethlehem (Latin Vulgate: in terra pax in hominibus bonae voluntatis, Luke ; English translation: ).Other translations did not follow the Latin version or, as in the case of the CEI, have stopped following it with the 1973 revised edition of the Jerusalem Bible: compare the Italian text of the encyclical's address and the different translation subsequently introduced by the Italian bishops. Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, Mary Ann Glendon, interprets this to mean, \\"He was insisting that the responsibility for setting conditions for peace does not just belong to the great and powerful of the world‚Äîit belongs to each and every one of us.\\" In theological terms, it marked a major shift in papal teaching from reliance on classical scholastic categories of natural law to a more inductive approach based on the signs of the times. In this work, John XXIII reacted to the political situation in the middle of the Cold War. Coming just months after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, during which the Vatican served as an intermediary between the White House and the Kremlin, the document also reflected the Pope's experience of 1960 in trying to resolve difficulties arising out the four-power occupation of Berlin. The \\"peace encyclical\\" was issued only two years after the erection of the Berlin Wall. It also draws on Pope John's reading of Saint Augustines The City of God and Thomas Aquinas' view of Eternal Law.Hittinger, Russell. \\"Quinquagesimo Ante: Reflections on Pacem in Terris Fifty Years Later\\", The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis. Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013 In this it echoes the Gospel's core values and principles of patristic and medieval thought, while reflecting the historical period in which it was written.Sanchez Sorondo, Marcelo. \\"The Magnitude of 'Walking in the Truth' (3 Jn 1)\\", The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis. Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013 Sociologist Monsignor Pietro Pavan and a small group of theologians helped draft it.Murphy, Francis X., \\"Cardinal Pietro Pavan: inveterate optimist\\", America, February 1996 In Pavan's view Pacem in terris would present the teachings of Leo XIII on the eternal law, \\"in light of the changing tides of history, and allow them to resonate with a much wider audience\\". The Pope explains in this encyclical that conflicts \\"should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather by negotiation\\". He further emphasizes the importance of respect of human rights as an essential consequence of the Christian understanding of men. He clearly establishes \\"that every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity, and to the means which are suitable for the proper development of life.\\" Pacem in terris is an extended reflection on the moral order. The document is divided into four sections. *The first section of the encyclical establishes the relationship between individuals and humankind, encompassing the issues of human rights and moral duties. *The second section addresses the relationship between man and state, dwelling on the collective authority of the latter. *The third section establishes the need for equality amongst nations and the need for the state to be subject to rights and duties that the individual must abide by. *The final section presents the need for greater relations between nations, thus resulting in collective states assisting other states. The encyclical ends with the urging of Catholics to assist non-Christians and non-Catholics in political and social aspects. Reception ‚ÄúPacem in Terris was more than an encyclical‚Äîit was an event,\\" recalls Glendon. Pacem in Terris was the first papal encyclical published in its entirety in the New York Times.Mannion, Gerard. \\"Pacem in Terris@50: Gifts Old and New for Church and Society in Recent Times\\", Pacem in Terris Conference 2013, Georgetown University The Washington Post said, \\"Pacem in terris is not just the voice of an old priest, nor just that of an ancient Church; it is the voice of the conscience of the world.\\" According to the periodical Catholic World Report, \\"Two years later, it was the subject of a conference at the United Nations attended by over 2,000 statespersons and scholars.\\" Legacy F. Russell Hittinger describes the encyclical \\"as a kind of magna carta of the Catholic Church's position on human rights and natural law\\". Pope John XXIII's 1963 encyclical Pacem in terris (\\"Peace on Earth\\") radically affected Catholic social teaching not only on war and peace, but on church-state relations, women's rights, religious freedom, international relations and other major issues. Fr. J. Bryan Hehir called Pacem in terris \\"a pivotal text in [papal] encyclical history\\" that played a major role in the development of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom and its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, and on Pope John Paul II's encyclical Centesimus annus (\\"The Hundredth Year\\"), which marked the centennial of Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical on labor, Rerum Novarum. It also influenced the 1965 Declaration on Religious Freedom (Dignitatis humanae). In commemoration of this encyclical, the annual Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom award was instituted in 1964, first by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport and later by the Quad Cities Pacem in Terris Coalition. During an event held on May 6, 2019, in Bulgaria, where John XXIII gained a reputation for protecting Jews when serving as the country's Vatican representative, Pope Francis invoked the encyclical as a \\"code of conduct\\" for peace between Catholics and other religions.

Montm√©dy soon became the capital of his territory ‚Äì later it belonged to Luxembourg, Burgundy, Austria and Spain. The original castle was replaced with a fortress by Charles V in the 16th Century. After Marville and Stenay had been occupied by the French, 30,000 soldiers, including King Louis XIV, attacked Montm√©dy, whilst 756 were defending it in 1657. They held it for 57 days and surrendered only after the death of the governor Jean V of Allamont. The military engineer Vauban advanced the outer fortifications, the moats and the walls after the siege of 1657. During the French Revolution in 1791, the fortress was the anticipated destination of King Louis XVI and his family in their unsuccessful attempt to escape from the growing radical republicanism of Paris. The area at that time was overwhelmingly pro-monarchy. The royal party never arrived, however, because they were discovered en route at Varennes and escorted back to the capital city. The King had hoped to establish a counter-revolutionary military base of operations in the citadel from which he could reclaim the country. The citadel has also been used as a fortress during both World Wars. Buildings, including a church dating back to the 17th century, can be found inside the citadel itself; it still is used as a place to live. Most of the buildings are derelict or already collapsed; some of them are still in use as tenements. An Office de Tourisme (Tourist Office) can be found in the citadel. Geography The river Othain joins the Chiers in the eastern part of the commune. The village lies on the right bank of the Chiers. Notable people A museum is devoted to the painter Jules Bastien-Lepage. The eccentric harpist and composer Nicolas-Charles Bochsa (1789‚Äì1856) was born in Montm√©dy where his father Karl Bochsa was an oboist belonging to the Army. Future President Fran√ßois Mitterrand was stationed as a soldier at Montm√©dy in 1939.

Several series of conferences in 2019, 2020, and 2021 are devoted to this topic. Quarks are liberated into quark matter at extremely high temperatures and/or densities, and some of them are still only theoretical as they require conditions so extreme that they can not be produced in any laboratory, especially not at equilibrium conditions. Under these extreme conditions, the familiar structure of matter, where the basic constituents are nuclei (consisting of nucleons which are bound states of quarks) and electrons, is disrupted. In quark matter it is more appropriate to treat the quarks themselves as the basic degrees of freedom. In the standard model of particle physics, the strong force is described by the theory of QCD. At ordinary temperatures or densities this force just confines the quarks into composite particles (hadrons) of size around 10‚àí15 m = 1 femtometer = 1 fm (corresponding to the QCD energy scale ŒõQCD ‚âà 200 MeV) and its effects are not noticeable at longer distances. However, when the temperature reaches the QCD energy scale (T of order 1012 kelvins) or the density rises to the point where the average inter-quark separation is less than 1 fm (quark chemical potential Œº around 400 MeV), the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, and the strong interaction becomes the dominant feature of the physics. Such phases are called quark matter or QCD matter. The strength of the color force makes the properties of quark matter unlike gas or plasma, instead leading to a state of matter more reminiscent of a liquid. At high densities, quark matter is a Fermi liquid, but is predicted to exhibit color superconductivity at high densities and temperatures below 1012 K. Occurrence =Natural occurrence= * According to the Big Bang theory, in the early universe at high temperatures when the universe was only a few tens of microseconds old, the phase of matter took the form of a hot phase of quark matter called the quark‚Äìgluon plasma (QGP).See \\"Hadrons and quark-gluon plasma\\" for example. * Compact stars (neutron stars). A neutron star is much cooler than 1012 K, but gravitational collapse has compressed it to such high densities, that it is reasonable to surmise that quark matter may exist in the core.Shapiro and Teukolsky: Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars: The Physics of Compact Objects, Wiley 2008 Compact stars composed mostly or entirely of quark matter are called quark stars or strange stars. At this time no star with properties expected of these objects has been observed, although some evidence has been provided for quark matter in the cores of large neutron stars. * Strangelets. These are theoretically postulated (but as yet unobserved) lumps of strange matter comprising nearly equal amounts of up, down and strange quarks. Strangelets are supposed to be present in the galactic flux of high energy particles and should therefore theoretically be detectable in cosmic rays here on Earth, but no strangelet has been detected with certainty. * Cosmic ray impacts. Cosmic rays comprise a lot of different particles, including highly accelerated atomic nuclei, particularly that of iron. Laboratory experiments suggests that the inevitable interaction with heavy noble gas nuclei in the upper atmosphere would lead to quark‚Äìgluon plasma formation. * Quark matter with baryon number over about 300 may be more stable than nuclear matter. This form of baryonic matter could possibly form a continent of stability. =Laboratory experiments= ALICE detector. The extremely brief appearance of quark matter in the point of collision is inferred from the statistics of the trajectories. Even though quark-gluon plasma can only occur under quite extreme conditions of temperature and/or pressure, it is being actively studied at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In these collisions, the plasma only occurs for a very short time before it spontaneously disintegrates. The plasma's physical characteristics are studied by detecting the debris emanating from the collision region with large particle detectors See \\"Hunting the quark gluoan plasma\\" as an example of the research at RHIC. Heavy-ion collisions at very high energies can produce small short-lived regions of space whose energy density is comparable to that of the 20-micro-second-old universe. This has been achieved by colliding heavy nuclei such as lead nuclei at high speeds, and a first time claim of formation of quark‚Äìgluon plasma came from the SPS accelerator at CERN in February 2000. This work has been continued at more powerful accelerators, such as RHIC in the US, and as of 2010 at the European LHC at CERN located in the border area of Switzerland and France. There is good evidence that the quark‚Äìgluon plasma has also been produced at RHIC. Thermodynamics The context for understanding the thermodynamics of quark matter is the standard model of particle physics, which contains six different flavors of quarks, as well as leptons like electrons and neutrinos. These interact via the strong interaction, electromagnetism, and also the weak interaction which allows one flavor of quark to turn into another. Electromagnetic interactions occur between particles that carry electrical charge; strong interactions occur between particles that carry color charge. The correct thermodynamic treatment of quark matter depends on the physical context. For large quantities that exist for long periods of time (the \\"thermodynamic limit\\"), we must take into account the fact that the only conserved charges in the standard model are quark number (equivalent to baryon number), electric charge, the eight color charges, and lepton number. Each of these can have an associated chemical potential. However, large volumes of matter must be electrically and color- neutral, which determines the electric and color charge chemical potentials. This leaves a three-dimensional phase space, parameterized by quark chemical potential, lepton chemical potential, and temperature. In compact stars quark matter would occupy cubic kilometers and exist for millions of years, so the thermodynamic limit is appropriate. However, the neutrinos escape, violating lepton number, so the phase space for quark matter in compact stars only has two dimensions, temperature (T) and quark number chemical potential Œº. A strangelet is not in the thermodynamic limit of large volume, so it is like an exotic nucleus: it may carry electric charge. A heavy-ion collision is in neither the thermodynamic limit of large volumes nor long times. Putting aside questions of whether it is sufficiently equilibrated for thermodynamics to be applicable, there is certainly not enough time for weak interactions to occur, so flavor is conserved, and there are independent chemical potentials for all six quark flavors. The initial conditions (the impact parameter of the collision, the number of up and down quarks in the colliding nuclei, and the fact that they contain no quarks of other flavors) determine the chemical potentials. (Reference for this section:,). Phase diagram Conjectured form of the phase diagram of QCD matter, with temperature on the vertical axis and quark chemical potential on the horizontal axis, both in mega-electron volts. The phase diagram of quark matter is not well known, either experimentally or theoretically. A commonly conjectured form of the phase diagram is shown in the figure to the right. It is applicable to matter in a compact star, where the only relevant thermodynamic potentials are quark chemical potential Œº and temperature T. For guidance it also shows the typical values of Œº and T in heavy-ion collisions and in the early universe. For readers who are not familiar with the concept of a chemical potential, it is helpful to think of Œº as a measure of the imbalance between quarks and antiquarks in the system. Higher Œº means a stronger bias favoring quarks over antiquarks. At low temperatures there are no antiquarks, and then higher Œº generally means a higher density of quarks. Ordinary atomic matter as we know it is really a mixed phase, droplets of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at Œº = 310 MeV and T close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase Œº) keeping the temperature low, we move into a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of Œº, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color- superconducting quark matter. At intermediate densities we expect some other phases (labelled \\"non-CFL quark liquid\\" in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown,. They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different. Now, imagine starting at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where Œº = T = 0\\\\. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T = 150 MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), to the state of the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks). The line that rises up from the nuclear/quark matter transition and then bends back towards the T axis, with its end marked by a star, is the conjectured boundary between confined and unconfined phases. Until recently it was also believed to be a boundary between phases where chiral symmetry is broken (low temperature and density) and phases where it is unbroken (high temperature and density). It is now known that the CFL phase exhibits chiral symmetry breaking, and other quark matter phases may also break chiral symmetry, so it is not clear whether this is really a chiral transition line. The line ends at the \\"chiral critical point\\", marked by a star in this figure, which is a special temperature and density at which striking physical phenomena, analogous to critical opalescence, are expected. (Reference for this section:,). For a complete description of phase diagram it is required that one must have complete understanding of dense, strongly interacting hadronic matter and strongly interacting quark matter from some underlying theory e.g. quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, because such a description requires the proper understanding of QCD in its non-perturbative regime, which is still far from being completely understood, any theoretical advance remains very challenging. Theoretical challenges: calculation techniques The phase structure of quark matter remains mostly conjectural because it is difficult to perform calculations predicting the properties of quark matter. The reason is that QCD, the theory describing the dominant interaction between quarks, is strongly coupled at the densities and temperatures of greatest physical interest, and hence it is very hard to obtain any predictions from it. Here are brief descriptions of some of the standard approaches. =Lattice gauge theory= The only first-principles calculational tool currently available is lattice QCD, i.e. brute-force computer calculations. Because of a technical obstacle known as the fermion sign problem, this method can only be used at low density and high temperature (Œº < T), and it predicts that the crossover to the quark‚Äìgluon plasma will occur around T = 150 MeV However, it cannot be used to investigate the interesting color-superconducting phase structure at high density and low temperature. =Weak coupling theory= Because QCD is asymptotically free it becomes weakly coupled at unrealistically high densities, and diagrammatic methods can be used. Such methods show that the CFL phase occurs at very high density. At high temperatures, however, diagrammatic methods are still not under full control. =Models= To obtain a rough idea of what phases might occur, one can use a model that has some of the same properties as QCD, but is easier to manipulate. Many physicists use Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, which contain no gluons, and replace the strong interaction with a four-fermion interaction. Mean-field methods are commonly used to analyse the phases. Another approach is the bag model, in which the effects of confinement are simulated by an additive energy density that penalizes unconfined quark matter. =Effective theories= Many physicists simply give up on a microscopic approach, and make informed guesses of the expected phases (perhaps based on NJL model results). For each phase, they then write down an effective theory for the low-energy excitations, in terms of a small number of parameters, and use it to make predictions that could allow those parameters to be fixed by experimental observations. =Other approaches= There are other methods that are sometimes used to shed light on QCD, but for various reasons have not yet yielded useful results in studying quark matter. 1/N expansion Treat the number of colors N, which is actually 3, as a large number, and expand in powers of 1/N. It turns out that at high density the higher-order corrections are large, and the expansion gives misleading results. Supersymmetry Adding scalar quarks (squarks) and fermionic gluons (gluinos) to the theory makes it more tractable, but the thermodynamics of quark matter depends crucially on the fact that only fermions can carry quark number, and on the number of degrees of freedom in general. Experimental challenges Experimentally, it is hard to map the phase diagram of quark matter because it has been rather difficult to learn how to tune to high enough temperatures and density in the laboratory experiment using collisions of relativistic heavy ions as experimental tools. However, these collisions ultimately will provide information about the crossover from hadronic matter to QGP. It has been suggested that the observations of compact stars may also constrain the information about the high-density low-temperature region. Models of the cooling, spin-down, and precession of these stars offer information about the relevant properties of their interior. As observations become more precise, physicists hope to learn more. One of the natural subjects for future research is the search for the exact location of the chiral critical point. Some ambitious lattice QCD calculations may have found evidence for it, and future calculations will clarify the situation. Heavy-ion collisions might be able to measure its position experimentally, but this will require scanning across a range of values of Œº and T.  Evidence  In 2020, evidence was provided that the cores of neutron stars with mass ~2M‚äô were likely composed of quark matter. Their result was based on neutron-star tidal deformability during a neutron star merger as measured by gravitational-wave observatories, leading to an estimate of star radius, combined with calculations of the equation of state relating the pressure and energy density of the star's core. The evidence was strongly suggestive but did not conclusively prove the existence of quark matter.

The original Broadway production played in 1961‚Äì62. The musical was inspired by an article about subway homelessness in the March 1956 issue of Harper's magazine and a subsequent 1957 book based on it, both by Edmund G. Love, who slept on subway trains throughout the 1950s and encountered many unique individuals. With the profits from his book, Love then embarked on a bizarre hobby: over the course of several years, he ate dinner at every restaurant listed in the Manhattan yellow pages directory, visiting them in alphabetical order. A previous adaptation of the Harper's article was aired August 3, 1956 on CBS Radio Workshop.Audio Classics Synopsis Angie McKay is a magazine writer assigned to write a story about a group of well-dressed homeless people sleeping in the New York subway system. Their leader is Tom Bailey, a one-man employment agency who finds other drifters odd jobs and sleeping quarters. To help research her story, Angie goes undercover and pretends to be a stranded girl from out-of-town. Trouble ensues when Tom discovers her real identity. Broadway production After two previews, the Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd, opened on December 27, 1961 at the St. James Theatre, where it ran for 205 performances. The cast included Orson Bean, Sydney Chaplin, Carol Lawrence, Gordon Connell, Grayson Hall, and Green's wife Phyllis Newman (whose costume, consisting solely of a towel, was probably Freddy Wittop's easiest design in his distinguished career), with newcomers Michael Bennett and Valerie Harper in the chorus. Subways Are for Sleeping opened to mostly negative reviews. The show already was hampered by a lack of publicity, since the New York City Transit Authority refused to post advertisements on the city's buses and in subway trains and stations for fear they would be perceived as officially sanctioning the right of vagrants to use these facilities as overnight accommodations. The advertisement Producer David Merrick and press agent Harvey Sabinson decided to invite individuals with the same names as prominent theatre critics (such as Walter Kerr, Richard Watts, Jr. and Howard Taubman) to see the show, and afterwards used their favorable comments in print ads. Thanks to photographs of the seven \\"critics\\" accompanying their blurbs (the well-known real Richard Watts was not African American), the ad was discovered to be a deception. It was pulled from most newspapers, but not before running in an early edition of the New York Herald Tribune. However, the clever publicity stunt allowed the musical to continue to run and it eventually turned a small profit. Newman won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and nominations went to Bean for Best Featured Actor and Kidd's choreography. An original cast recording was released by Columbia Records. A revival production was briefly mounted in 2009.

The Vulcan name has been used by Kawasaki for their custom or cruiser motorcycles since 1984, model designation VN, using mostly V-twin engines ranging from . Model history =1984‚Äì2006: Vulcan 750 series= In 1985 Kawasaki launched, worldwide, the Vulcan VN700A, its first cruiser powered by its first V-twin engine. The VN700A has a shaft drive. Kawasaki also made the now rare VZ 750 variant with chromed wheel arches and other subtle differences. To avoid United States tariffs on Japanese motorcycles over 700cc, the initial US model was limited to 699 cc but in 1986, the tariff was lifted so the engine capacity was increased to 749 cc. Apart from paint schemes the Vulcan remained largely unchanged throughout its 22-year production run with only minor adjustments to components. =1986‚Äì2004: Vulcan 400 series= Kawasaki introduced the Vulcan 400 in 1986 as an entry level cruiser. For a first series, The Vulcan 400 featured a 398 cc liquid-cooled twin engine, and was fitted with a belt drive and six-speed transmission. The series 2 Vulcan 400 featured a 399 cc liquid-cooled V-twin engine similar in design to the 750. The series 2 was fitted with a chain drive and five-speed transmission to reduce cost and was produced in both Classic and Drifter variations. =1990‚Äì2009: Vulcan 500 series= The Vulcan 500 (EN500A) introduced in 1990 was the successor to the Kawasaki 454 LTD. The EN500A was fitted with a parallel twin 498 cc engine nearly identical to the Kawasaki Ninja 500R. It had a 6 speed transmission and belt final drive. The EN500A was discontinued after 1996 and replaced with the Vulcan 500 LTD (EN500C). Both versions were available as 1996 models. With the EN500C the ergonomics changed as well as the engine tuning. New cam shaft profiles and slightly lower compression pistons moved the power band down to increase low end torque. Also the carburetors were downsized from 34mm to 32mm. The belt final drive was replaced with a chain. The Vulcan 500 LTD was discontinued after the 2009 model year for a nearly 20 year production run. = 2015-present: Vulcan 650 S Series = The Vulcan 650 S (EN650AF/BF) is designated as a Sport cruiser. Introduced in 2015 with an Ergo-Fit system designed for better custom comfort adjustability for different rider sizes.

It has a seat height, wide handlebar, forward-mounted floorboards. The Vulcan 1500 Drifter ceased production in 2005. The Vulcan 88, with its 1464 cc liquid-cooled V-twin design was produced from 1987 through 1999. A four speed transmission was blended with the, \\"large for its time motor\\" and offered consumers a big-bore metric cruiser that was comfortable and relatively light-weight at just over 600 lbs when \\"rider ready\\". The 1500 Meanstreak was introduced in 2002 and lasted 2 years, before giving way to the 1600 Meanstreak. This performance version of the 1500 had the same basic engine as the 1500FI, but sported several upgrades including new camshafts, larger valves, larger fuel injection throttle bodies, new high compression pistons, and re-designed combustion chamber. It also had a slimmed down narrower gas tank. This meant an increase to 72 hp at 5500rpm and 90 ft-lbs at 3000rpm, while weighing in at a mere 637 lbs dry.http://www.motorcycledaily.com/2001/08/31aug01kawasaki2002meanstreak/ =1995‚Äì2006: Vulcan 800 series= Two models of the Vulcan were discontinued in 2006 with the introduction of the VN900.

The game stars Tails from the Sonic the Hedgehog series in a solo adventure, as he collects an array of items to help him explore Tails Island and defeat the enemies inhabiting it. The gameplay is more slow-paced than other Sonic games, with Tails only capable of walking and flying at a moderate speed. The stages are explored in a non-linear fashion, with newly collected items opening up pathways in previous areas. Along with Tails' Skypatrol, the game is one of two on the Game Gear to star Tails in a solo role. Tails Adventure received mixed reviews, with critics finding the game unoriginal and too slow-paced compared to previous Sonic offerings. Retrospective reviews commended the game for trying something different and compared the gameplay to the Metroid series, but disliked what they felt was repetitive backtracking. Tails Adventure was included in Sonic Adventure DX (2003), Sonic Gems Collection (2005), and re-released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013.  Premise  Tails Adventure storyline differs slightly depending on the region it was released. In the Japanese version, it was as a prequel to Tails' first appearance in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (explaining why he lacks his spinning attacks throughout the game). Conversely, the English version tells that Sonic and Tails are simply taking a break from dual adventuring and Tails has come to Cocoa Island to relax. Gameplay Tails, equipped with bombs, looks on at an enemy Contrary to the classic speedy gameplay in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, Tails Adventure is a slow-paced platformer with an emphasis on exploration. The player controls Tails in a story set before he befriended Sonic, as he adventures to save Tails Island from an invasion of the Kukku Army. He cannot run, but only walk at a steady pace. The player explores twelve non-linear stages, collecting new items and abilities to open up new path ways in previous stages. A total of 26 items can be collected, including some to defeat enemies and others to aid in exploration. Along with using items, Tails can fly for a short period of time. His fly duration can be extended by locating Chaos Emeralds. Rings are collected as a form of health, and unlike other Sonic games, only a few rings are lost when touching a hazard. This gameplay has been compared to Metroidvania games. Tails finds several different kinds of gadgets on his adventures. Some of these items are weapons used to defeat enemies, like bombs and hammers. Some items aid in exploration, such as a small robot which Tails can control to scout ahead and squeeze into tight spaces. Tails can only carry four tools when entering a stage. Only one item can be equipped at a time, the player must pause the game to change items. If the player finds that they cannot advance because they require another item, they must find a stage exit, swap items, and re-enter the stage from the beginning.  Development and release  Tails Adventure was developed for the Game Gear by Aspect and published by Sega. Along with Tails Skypatrol, it is one of two Sonic the Hedgehog games on the Game Gear to star Tails. The soundtrack was composed by Koijro Mikusa, who also wrote music for Sonic Blast. Tails Adventure was released for the Game Gear on September 22, 1995 in Japan. It was released in Europe in October, and in North America in November. The game was first re-released through Sonic Adventure DX in 2003 as an unlockable bonus game, and later in the Sonic Gems Collection compilation in 2005. It was also re-released on the Nintendo 3DS via the eShop worldwide in 2013 along with several other Sonic games for the Game Gear.  Reception  Critics felt Tails Adventure was too similar to other platform games, and its slow pace made it weaker than other Sonic offerings. Famitsu felt it lacked any surprising elements and was disappointed it was much more standard than other Sonic games. Mean Machines Sega agreed, calling it \\"decidedly unoriginal\\", but believed secret areas and a steep learning curve made it interesting enough to continue playing. Electronic Gaming Monthly compared the game to Super Mario platforming titles and also enjoyed finding hidden areas. Critics generally liked the graphics and controls, however the graphics did receive some criticism. Mean Machines Sega felt some of the background textures repeated too much, Famitsu criticized the screen's narrow field of vision, and Electronic Gaming Monthly noted some screen blur issues. In retrospective reviews, both Nintendo World Report and Nintendo Life felt the game was a significant contrast to the other Sonic Game Gear games. They believed the game exchanged the speed of previous series installments for exploratory gameplay more akin to the Metroid series and Gargoyle's Quest (1990). USgamer recommended the game, calling it a departure from the Sonic series, and the closest a Sonic game ever felt to a Nintendo franchise. Nintendo Life enjoyed the variety of gadgets and level designs, but criticized the dark environments and repeating background textures. Along with Nintendo World Report, they criticized the game's poor handling of inventory. The journalists would often explore large portions of a level only to learn they were missing a necessary item, and would need to restart the stage. The game's presence in Sonic Gems Collection was welcomed as a modern convenience, but was criticized along with other Game Gear inclusions for graphical glitches and poor emulation. Some felt the portable games were merely supplemental to the more substantial games in the collection and dismissed them. 1UP.com called Tails Adventure and Tails Skypatrol \\"the bottom of the barrel [...] nigh-unplayable portable titles from an era best forgotten.\\" Notes References Category:Aspect Co. games Category:Metroidvania games Category:Platform games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sega video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Video game spin-offs Category:Video game prequels Category:Virtual Console games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:1995 video games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Tails Adventure"},{"id":"1919399","text":"Sasa or Sassa () is a kibbutz in the Upper Galilee area of northern Israel.

The Mukhtar of Sassa had fled, and his 2000 Arab villagers with him. By November 1949, 120 young American-born Jews had supplanted them, and the old village roosting on a Galilean hilltop had begun to acquire a Western flavor. The Mukhtar's home was being plastered and cemented into a communal shower. Power-driven lathes, imported from the United States, were turning out furniture for the new Jewish settlements which mushroomed in the Galilee. Prefabricated barracks with beaverboard interiors, fresh-painted American tractors, and an experimental windmill which resembled a radar antenna provided more accouterments of progress.

Throughout his career he advocated, on behalf of all First Nation peoples, for the right to be \\"the red tile in the Canadian mosaic.\\" Cardinal was a lifelong student of First Nations law as practised by Cree and other Aboriginal Elders; he complemented this with extensive study of law in mainstream educational institutions. He was also a mentor and inspiration to many Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students, professionals, and political leaders. He died of lung cancer in 2005 at the age of 60. Early life and education Cardinal was born in High Prairie, Alberta to Frank and Agnes (Cunningham) Cardinal. He grew up on the Sucker Creek Reserve. He attended high school in Edmonton, and studied sociology at St. Patrick's College in Ottawa.  Political career  Cardinal's activism began early in life; he was elected president of the Canadian Indian Youth Council in 1966.\\"Council President says youth refuse passive\\". Regina Leader Post, Oct 13, 1966 His leadership qualities began to surface in 1968 when, at age 23, he was elected leader of the Indian Association of Alberta for an unprecedented nine terms, during which he was instrumental in the formation of the National Indian Brotherhood (the forerunner of the Assembly of First Nations). Cardinal then served the people of his home community, the Sucker Creek Indian Band, as their Chief. Cardinal served as the Vice Chief of the Assembly of First Nations during the period of the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in the early 1980s. Cardinal was instrumental in the creation, in 1984, of the Prairie Treaty Nations Alliance, representing all First Nations of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to advance issues of concern to those First Nations with particular emphasis on their treaties with the Crown. Cardinal also participated in Canadian federal politics, in 2000 running unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Liberal Party in the riding of Athabasca. He ran against David Chatters, who had been accused of being anti- Native, in explicit opposition to the apparent revival of popular and political support for policies of Aboriginal assimilation.  The \\"White Paper\\" and The Unjust Society  Cardinal rose to national prominence in the late 1960s. In 1968, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau proclaimed Canada to be a \\"just society.\\" However, after a promising round of consultations between the government of Canada and aboriginal leaders in which issues of Aboriginal and Treaty rights and the right of self-government were prominently discussed, Aboriginal people were outraged when Trudeau's Minister of Indian Affairs, the Hon. Jean Chr√©tien (later Prime Minister of Canada) introduced a \\"White Paper\\" which advocated the elimination of separate legal status for native people in Canada. The white paper amounted to an assimilation program which, if implemented, would have repealed the Indian Act, transferred responsibility for Indian Affairs to the provinces and terminated the rights of Indians under the various treaties they had made with the Crown. In 1969, Cardinal wrote his first book The Unjust Society, (cf. Just Society, intending to \\"sweep back the buckskin curtain\\" between aboriginal people and mainstream society. The Unjust Society was Cardinal's personal response to the Trudeau White Paper.\\"Hiding Behind the Myth of One ‚ÄòRule of Law‚Äô\\". The Tyee, Paige Raibmon 18 Feb 2020 It became an immediate Canadian best-seller and was reprinted in 2000 with a new introduction by Cardinal. The Unjust Society was instrumental in causing the Canadian government to abandon the policy of the White Paper. Cardinal was also the principal author of the Indian Association of Alberta's response to the White Paper, entitled Citizens Plus, also known as The Red Paper. Cardinal's words galvanized the First Nations of Canada into action. The result was a complete about-face by the federal government on the policies of the White Paper and the establishment of joint meetings between First Nations and the federal cabinet in the early 1970.Crane Bear, Leon. \\"The Indian Association of Alberta's 1970Red paper published as a response to the Canadian Federal Government'sproposed 1969 White paper on Indian policy\\". University of Lethbridge Research Repositor, 2015 His second book, published in 1977, was The Rebirth of Canada's Indians. Cardinal's gift for satire was displayed in his early writings, turning Trudeau's promise of a \\"just society\\" into an \\"unjust society\\" and a \\"white paper\\" into \\"red paper\\", and then equating the brutal slaughter of American Indians by the U.S. Cavalry with bayonet and guns with the cultural genocide which the Canadian government was perpetrating on aboriginal people with paper. Cardinal's lifelong demand for radical changes in policy on aboriginal rights, education, social programs and economic development was a beacon of hope for Canada's First Nations people.  Intellectual legacy  In 1969, along with Indigenous communities, Elders, and other leaders, Cardinal radically questioned the hegemony of the nation state through his efforts to stop The White Paper, which culminated in his book The Unjust Society. The book was instrumental in bringing Indigenous people's voices and issues to a centre stage in Canadian life; it also critically engaged the theoretical foundation and practice of Canadian liberalism as found in then Prime Minister Trudeau's conceptualizations of a \\"just society\\" where all citizens would be considered \\"equal\\" in the context of the current nation state. Cardinal argued the state's premise of equality and justice was a false one because it failed to take into account the historical conditions under which the nation state was created: conditions that denied Indigenous people's rights as entrenched in the treaties and conditions that, subsequently, oppressed and subjugated them. Cardinal was not only an architect of change on the political level, he was also instrumental in engaging and redefining the manner in which Indigenous and non-Indigenous people related to one another. One of the foundations of his life work was the insistence of the need for mutual recognition, understanding, and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. While he acknowledged difference, he still fundamentally believed in the power of relationship: \\"Two more disparate people, speaking in different tongues, speaking from different worlds, would be hard to find anywhere, and yet their dreams, their visions, their hopes, and their aspirations could not find any greater fusion\\"(Cardinal,1977, p.-). Cardinal is also one of the first Indigenous scholars who actively sought \\"‚Ä¶a convergence between the knowledge systems of the Cree people and other First Nations and the knowledge systems found in Western educational institutions\\" (Cardinal,2007, p. 65). Upon recognition of the power of colonization over both societies, Cardinal foresaw a bridge of understanding between them. Cardinal's influence was widely within Indigenous communities. He was one of the first contemporary Indigenous scholars to articulate the notion that Indigenous people could still hold onto traditions while fully engaging in modernity. Cardinal also opened the mindset of the Canadian public to the idea that Indigenous Elders were effectively \\"public intellectuals,\\" tacitly, raising the profile of Indigenous knowledge. He made further intellectual road maps between Indigenous scholarship and traditional knowledge by articulating the Elders' desires to see Indigenous scholars become familiar with conceptual and theoretical frameworks of Indigenous thought through Indigenous languages in order to maintain cultural strength.  Professional life  In the 1970s, Cardinal was the first Aboriginal person to be appointed to the post of regional director general of Indian Affairs. His tenure was brief and controversial. In 1984, Cardinal was appointed by the chiefs of Treaty 8 to negotiate an agreement to \\"renovate\\" that treaty. The failure of the negotiations after a promising beginning caused Cardinal to undertake a lengthy period of personal reflection, including much study with elders. Cardinal also acted as a negotiator and consultant to many First Nations relating to land and other issues, usually relating to treaty rights. Cardinal made a significant contribution to the work of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, as well as the work of the Assembly of First Nations, particularly on the need for recognition of the sovereignty of First Nations as expressed through their treaties with the Crown. His lifelong position has been that the spirit and intent of the treaties must be the principal instrument governing relations between First Nations and the Crown.  Legal career  After a career in First Nations politics and extensive study with First Nation elders, Cardinal undertook the formal study of law in his 40s. While studying law at the University of Saskatchewan he also served as an assistant professor at that University. He completed his LLM at Harvard University. A Doctorate in Law from the University of British Columbia was awarded to Cardinal days before his death in June, 2005. On November 4, 2004, two months before his 60th birthday, Cardinal was admitted to the Bar of Alberta.  Other honours  In 1999, Cardinal received an honorary doctor of laws from the University of Alberta in recognition of his unique achievements in leadership, public policy and law. In 2001 Cardinal received a National Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, lifetime achievement award.

The village suffered two massacres committed by Haganah forces: one in mid- February 1948 and the other at the end of October the same year.Khalidi, 1992, p. 495Papp√©, 2006, p. 77 ff.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 153 Its place has been taken since 1949 by Sasa, an Israeli kibbutz. History Sa'sa' was built on the site of a Bronze Age (early second millennium B.C.) settlement whose remains (walls, tombs, cisterns, and olive and wine presses), have been unearthed. One village house had foundations which has been dated back to fourth century by archaeologists. Another excavated in 2003 yielded ceramics dated to the fourteenth‚Äìfifteenth centuries CE.Bron, 2006, Sasa The Arab geographer Ab≈´ 'Ubayd 'Abd AllƒÅh al-Bakrƒ´ (d.1094) reported that one passed through Sa'sa' when travelling from Dayr al-Qasi to Safad. =Ottoman era= In 1516 Sa'sa', with the rest of Palestine, came under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Shortly after, Sa'sa' was made a checkpoint where a toll was collected on various goods and travellers; the first records of such taxes are from 1525/6.Cohen and Lewis, 1998, pp. 57, 58 In 1596 Sa'sa' was classified as a village in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jira, part of liwa' (\\"district\\") of Safad, with a population of 457. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives and fruits, as well as on goats, beehives, and vineyards.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 176. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 495 According to this tax records, all the villagers were Muslim.Petersen, 2001, p. 274 In the eighteenth century Sa'sa' in mentioned as one of the fortified villages of Galilee controlled by Zahir al-Umar's son, Ali. After the defeat of Zahir al- Umar in 1775 Ali continued to resist the Ottoman authorities and defeated an army sent against him at Sa'sa'.Cohen, 1973, p. 93, 97. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 274 Excavations in 1972 on the west side of the hill revealed the remains of a large rectangular structure (15m x 41 m) with 2m thick walls made out of rubble stone with ashlar facing. At the south-west corner of the building there was a solid semi-circular tower (diameter 7m). The main part of the structure is a rectangular hall divided into two rows of five bays. There was a central row of four piers and two half-piers which would probably have supported a cross-vaulted roof. In a later phase an outer skin (2m wide) was added, making the wall a total of 4m thick. At the same time the round tower was converted into a square plan. According to the excavators, the place was occupied for a \\"fairly long\\" period, and suggest that it was probably part of the fortress built by Ali, (son of Zahir al-Umar) in the eighteenth century.Gibson and Braun, 1972. Cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 274 The design of the building is quite compatible with other fortresses of the period, like Qalat Jiddin and Dayr Hanna. In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin found it to be a Muslim village with about 350 inhabitants.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 93-94 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Sa'sa' as a village with a population of 300, built on a slight hill that was surrounded by vineyards and olive and fig trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 200.

It is an influential work in sociology and Elias' most important work. It was first published in Basel, Switzerland in two volumes in 1939 in German as √úber den Proze√ü der Zivilisation. Because of World War II, it was virtually ignored, but gained popularity when it was republished in 1969 and translated into English. Covering European history from roughly 800 AD to 1900 AD, it is the first formal analysis and theory of civilization. Elias proposes a double sociogenesis of the state: the social development of the state has two sides, a mental and political. The civilisation process that Elias describes results in a profound change in human behaviour. It leads to the construction of the modern state and transition of man from the warrior of the Middle Ages to the civil man of the end of the 19th c. The Civilizing Process is today regarded as the founding work of figurational sociology. In 1998 the International Sociological Association listed the work as the seventh most important sociological book of the 20th century.  Themes  The first volume, The History of Manners, traces the historical developments of the European habitus, or \\"second nature\\", the particular individual psychic structures molded by social attitudes. Elias traced how post-medieval European standards regarding violence, sexual behaviour, bodily functions, table manners and forms of speech were gradually transformed by increasing thresholds of shame and repugnance, working outward from a nucleus in court etiquette. The internalized \\"self-restraint\\" imposed by increasingly complex networks of social connections developed the \\"psychological\\" self-perceptions that Freud recognized as the \\"super-ego\\". The second volume, State Formation and Civilization, looks into the formation of the state and the theory of civilisation. First, Elias explains that throughout time, social unity increased its control over military and fiscal power until possessing the monopoly over it. The progressive monopolisation of the military and taxation were feeding another (the political power was using tax money to pay its army and using the army to collect the taxes). Elias describes several steps of the creation of the State: * From the 11th to the 13th c.: there was an open competition between different houses where everyone was fighting to maintain and extend its power. For instance, after the death of Charles IV of France (1328), France formed a powerful agglomeration of territories. However, one cannot speak of a coherent kingdom yet because regional consciousness was still predominant, the interests of each territory and seigneury were prevailing. * From the 14th to the 16th c.: the courts were progressively established, and vassals gathered around important lords. The feudality was princely (it was seigneurial before) because only the most powerful houses had maintained their power and extended it by taking over the territory of smaller houses. * After the 16th c.: the royal house is victorious and has a monopoly of power. It created a central administration and institutions. The competitions were now regulated: it takes place peacefully within the state to access a high position in the administration. At the end of the process, the State is created and possessed the monopoly of legitimate physical violence. Elias also describes that the \\"absolutist mechanism\\": the state became the supreme body that coordinates the different interdependent group of the society. In parallel of the sociogeneses of the state, Elias notes the change in the way to manage the bodily functions. Individuals tried to repress in themselves what is perceived to be part of animal nature, repress in a sphere that appears through time, intimacy. Hence, new feelings appeared: embarrassment and prudishness.  Reception  When Elias' work found a larger audience in the 1960s, at first his analysis of the process was misunderstood as an extension of discredited \\"social Darwinism\\", the idea of upward \\"progress\\" was dismissed by reading it as consecutive history rather than a metaphor for a social process. It soon became obvious that Elias had intended no moral \\"superiority\\". Instead he describes the increasing structuring and restraining of human behavior in European history, a process termed as \\"civilization\\" by its own protagonists. Elias had merely intended to analyze this concept and process dubbed civilization, and researched into its origins, patterns, and methods. A particular criticism of The Civilizing Process was formulated by German ethnologist and cultural anthropologist Hans Peter Duerr in his 5-volume Der Mythos vom Zivilisationsproze√ü (1988‚Äì2002), pointing out there existed plenty of social restrictions and regulations in Western culture and elsewhere since long before the Medieval period. Elias and his supporters responded that he had never intended to claim that social regulations or self- restraining psychological agents would be institutions singular to Western modernity, it is just that Western culture developed particularly sophisticated, concise, comprehensive, and rigid institutions apparent for instance in its decisive technological advances when compared to other cultures.Lilienthal, Markus:Interpretation.

He is best known for his roles as PC/DC Jim Carver in The Bill and EastEnders as Mike Swann, Hollyoaks as Frank Symons and Heartbeat as Terry Molloy. Acting career Wingett was born in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. His father was an officer in the Royal Navy, and the family moved to wherever he was stationed, including Malta and Singapore, but mostly in Portsmouth. Wingett wanted to act from his youth and joined the National Youth Theatre. His film debut came in 1979 when he played Dave, a reckless and rebellious mod, in Quadrophenia. Because the film was X-rated, he was too young to watch it legally. In 1983 he made his first appearance as PC Jim Carver in \\"Woodentop\\", which became the pilot episode for The Bill. He was one of four actors in \\"Woodentop\\" who returned in the series' first complete season. He played Jim Carver in around 780 episodes, from 1984 until his departure in 2005 which ended 21 years on The Bill. Jim Carver was central to several major plotlines on The Bill, including the character's struggles with alcoholism, gambling and as a victim of domestic violence. Wingett made a brief return in March 2007 to coincide with the departure of Trudie Goodwin, then the only other remaining original cast member. In 2005 he appeared in the BBC One soap opera EastEnders as Mike Swann, the father of Mickey Miller and Dawn Swann, initially for a week-long stint. He returned to the soap in late 2005, leaving in March 2006. Also in 2005 he appeared as Terry Molloy, a London gangster who had turned Queen's evidence on his cohorts following a robbery in the Heartbeat episode A Fresh Start. Wingett provides the voiceover for the British television version of the hit American TV series American Chopper aired on the Discovery Channel. He also appeared in the \\"Spartacus\\" episode of the BBC's Heroes and Villains as the gladiator trainer Lentulus Batiatus. In 2009, he appeared in the BBC daytime series Missing as Danny Hayworth alongside Pauline Quirke, returning to the programme for its second series in 2010. In addition to acting, Wingett has directed several stage productions. In 2010, he directed the play Good to Firm by Ed Waugh and Trevor Wood at the Customs House, South Shields. In 2000, Wingett directed the play Lone Star by James McLure, in a production which toured Australia and starred his fellow Bill cast members Russell Boulter and Huw Higginson.McKew, Maxine: The Bill turns 16, The 7.30 Report (ABC TV), 18 October 2000.

The couple separated in 2000 after Yvonne Williams, a fire-eater who had appeared on The Bill as an extra, went to the press detailing her affair with Wingett over a number of years, but had reconciled by 2003 after a two-year separation. They both worked on the 2012 film Snow White and the Huntsman, with Martin as head of the makeup department and Wingett playing the character of Thomas.Index to Motion Picture Credits: SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, 2012.

It was founded in 1123 and is currently run by Barts Health NHS Trust. History =Early history= Barts was founded in 1123 by Rahere (died 1144, and entombed in the nearby Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great), a favourite courtier of King Henry I. The Dissolution of the Monasteries did not affect the running of Barts as a hospital, but left it in a precarious position by removing its income. It was refounded by King Henry VIII in December 1546, on the signing of an agreement granting the hospital to the Corporation of London.St Bartholomew's Hospital, Old and New London: Volume 2 (1878), pp. 359‚Äì363. Retrieved 30 January 2009 The hospital became legally styled as the \\"House of the Poore in Farringdon in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII's Foundation\\", although the title was never used by the general public. The first Superintendent of the hospital was Thomas Vicary, sergeant-surgeon to King Henry, and an early writer on anatomy. It was here that William Harvey conducted his research on the circulatory system in the 17th century, Percivall Pott and John Abernethy developed important principles of modern surgery in the 18th century, and Mrs Bedford Fenwick worked to advance the nursing profession in the late 19th century.James O. Robinson, \\"The Royal and Ancient Hospital of St Bartholomew (Founded 1123)\\", Journal of Medical Biography (1993) 1#1 pp. 23‚Äì30 From 1839 to 1872, the mortality reports show that surgical trauma and postoperative infection were the greatest causes of death. Tuberculosis, however, remained the most fatal nontraumatic cause of death.Thomas R. Forbes, \\"Mortality at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, 1839‚Äì72\\", Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences (1983) 38#4 pp 432‚Äì449 Nurses were expected to work 12 hours a day, and sometimes 14, with meal breaks in 1890. They had 2 weeks annual holiday. Upon the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, it officially became known as St Bartholomew's Hospital. =Buildings= Barts is the oldest hospital in Britain still providing medical services which occupies the site it was originally built on, and has an important current role as well as a long history and architecturally important buildings. The so-named Henry VIII entrance to the hospital continues to be the main public entrance; and the statue of King Henry VIII above the gate is the only remaining statue of him in London. Its main square was designed by James Gibbs in the 1730s. Of the four original blocks only three survive; they include the block containing the Great Hall and two flanking blocks that contained wards. The first wing to be built was the North Wing, in 1732, which includes the Great Hall and the murals by William Hogarth. The South Wing followed in 1740, the West in 1752 and finally the East Wing in 1769. In 1859, a fountain was placed at the square's centre with a small garden. St Bartholomew's Hospital has existed on the same site since its founding in the 12th century, surviving both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz. Its museum, which is open Tuesdays to Fridays every week, shows how medical care has developed over this time and explains the history of the hospital. Part-way around the exhibition is a door which opens on to the hospital's official entrance hall. On the walls of the staircase are two murals painted by William Hogarth, The Pool of Bethesda (1736) and The Good Samaritan (1737). They can only be seen at close quarters on Friday afternoons. Hogarth was so outraged by the news that the hospital was commissioning art from Italian painters that he insisted on doing these murals free of charge, as a demonstration that English painting was equal to the task. The Pool of Bethesda is of particular medical interest, as it depicts a scene in which Christ cures the sick: display material on the first floor speculates in modern medical terms about the ailments from which Christ's patients in the painting are suffering. Hogarth's mural of Christ at the Pool of Bethesda. The room to which the staircase leads is the hospital's Great Hall, a double-height room in Baroque-style. Although there are a few paintings inside the Great Hall, nearly all are on movable stands: the walls themselves are mostly given over to the display of the very many large, painted plaques which list, in detail, the sums of money given to the hospital by its benefactors. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the hospital precincts of the ancient priory were redesignated as an Anglican ecclesiastical parish, with St Bartholomew-the-Less becoming the parish church ‚Äì a unique situation amongst English hospital foundations. St Barts-the-Less is the only survivor of five chapels originally within the hospital's estate, the others failing to survive the Reformation. The church has a 15th-century tower and vestry, and its connections with the hospital can be seen not only in its early-20th century stained glass window of a nurse, a gift from the Worshipful Company of Glaziers, but also in commemorative plaques adorning its interior.St Bartholomew the Less parish (AIM25) accessed 30 January 2009 Throughout the whole of the 19th century, the Hardwick family were major benefactors of the hospital. Thomas Hardwick Jr. (1752‚Äì1825), Philip Hardwick (1792‚Äì1870), and Philip Charles Hardwick (1822‚Äì1892) were all architects/surveyors to Barts Hospital. Philip Hardwick, a Royal Academician, was also engaged in the rebuilding of the Church of St Bartholomew-the-Less in 1823 and donated the fountain in the hospital's courtyard. By 1872, Barts contained 676 beds. About 6,000 in-patients were admitted every year, as well as 101,000 out-patients. The average income of the hospital was ¬£40,000 (derived chiefly from rents and funded property) and the number of governors exceeded 300. =Threatened closure= Barts' courtyard in the early 19th century The Great Hall at Barts A memorial tablet on Barts north wall stating that 5,406 soldiers passed through its wards during the First World War. In 1993 the controversial Tomlinson Review of London hospitals was published and concluded that there were too many hospitals in central London. It recommended that the service should be delivered closer to where people lived. Barts was identified as a hospital with a catchment area that had a low populationThe population of the City had fallen since the turn of the century; and by 1991 was less than 6,000 people ‚Äì mainly residents of the Barbican and office caretakers.

Barts continues to be associated with excellence at its medical school's significant research and teaching facilities on the Charterhouse Square site. Barts, along with the Royal London Hospital and London Chest Hospital, was part of Barts and The London NHS Trust. There are 388 beds in Barts, 675 beds in the Royal London and 109 in the London Chest Hospital. These hospitals amalgamated with Whipps Cross and Newham hospitals on 1 March 2012 to form the Barts Health NHS Trust. = Nuffield Health at St Bartholomew‚Äôs Hospital = In 2018, Nuffield Health, a not-for-profit healthcare organisation, was granted planning permission to redevelop the former pathology and residential staff quarters building into a new private hospital. It will be the only private hospital in the City of London, and will have 48 beds and 4 operating theatres. It is expected to open in 2021, at a cost of ¬£60 million. It will be physically and operationally separate from the rest of the hospital, and will be known as Nuffield Health at St Bartholomew's Hospital.  Teaching  St Bartholomew's Hospital, looking towards Farringdon In 1843, St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College was established to train medics although considered to have been started by John Abernethy when the hospital built a theatre for his lectures at the beginning of the century.Barts was involved in the criminal activities of the London Burkers in 1831, as one of the hospitals where 'cadavers of unknown provenance' were accepted by surgeons for anatomy training. In 1995 the college, along with that attached to the Royal London, merged into Queen Mary University of London, but maintains a distinctive identity to this day. It is now known as Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. It occupies some space at the Barts site in Farringdon, with a presence a short walk away at Charterhouse Square. The main preclinical teaching domain of the medical school is at Whitechapel in the award-winning Blizard Building. The present School of Nursing and Midwifery was formed in 1994 from merging the Schools from St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital to become the St Bartholomew School of Nursing & Midwifery. In 1995 the new School was incorporated into the City University. Both Schools have a strong and respected history dating back over 120 years and have produced many nurse leaders and educators. The School has since been incorporated into the School of Health Sciences, City University London. Hospital museum The Barts Museum tells the historical narrative of the hospital and its work in caring for the sick and injured. The museum collections include historic surgical instruments, sculptures, medieval archives, and works of art, including paintings by William Hogarth. The museum is part of the London Museums of Health & Medicine group, and has been described as one of the world's \\"10 weirdest medical museums.\\" The museum is located under the North Wing archway and is open from Tuesday to Friday from 10 am to 4 pm. Admission is free, but donations are welcome. The collections are searchable on the Barts Health NHS Trust online catalogue, which contains information on over 50,000 entries and covering an 800-year span. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson A chemical laboratory at Barts was the location of the initial meeting of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in Arthur Conan Doyle's 1887 novel A Study in Scarlet. Barts was Watson's alma mater.

For a full century after her death, she filled a larger place in United States and British hymnals than any other woman. At an early age, Steele showed a taste for literature, and would often entertain her friends by her poetical compositions. To a fervour of devotion, which increased as she got older, she developed a fondness for sacred literature, which led her to compose a considerable number of pieces in prose and verse. These works were published using the pseudonym, \\"Theodosia\\". Portions of these spiritual lyrics soon found their way into collections, while the diffidence of the authoress because of her pen name, left her comparatively unknown beyond the circle of her personal friends. In 1760, two volumes, appeared under the title of Poems on Subjects chiefly Devotional, by Theodosia. After her death, which occurred in 1778, a new edition was published with an additional volume and a Preface by the Rev. Dr. Caleb Evans of Bristol (Bristol, 1780). In the three volumes, there are 144 hymns, 34 Psalms in verse, and about 30 short poems. They were reprinted in one volume by D. Sedgwick, 1863. Steele's hymns were first made available for congregational use in 1769, 62 of them being then introduced into the Bristol Baptist Collections of Ash & Evans, the letter T for \\"Theodosia\\" being affixed; 47 were also given in Dr. Rippon's Selections, 1787, and 26 in Dr. W. B. Collyer's Collections, 1812. The original edition of \\"Theodosia\\"‚Äòs works are kept in the Library of the Baptist College, Bristol. Early years Anne (\\"Nanny\\") Steele was born at Broughton, Hampshire, in 1717. She was descended from a family of Puritans. Her father, William Steele, was the minister of a community of Baptists, and he himself was descended from preachers. At an early age, Steele manifested a pious disposition, and at the age of fourteen, had become a member of the church of which her father was pastor. Owing to an accident in childhood, she was always an invalid, and often confined to her chamber. Career Steele discovered in early life her love of the Muses, and often entertained her friends with her poetical and pious writing. But it was not without extreme reluctance that she finally submitted any of them to be read by the public. Her father's diary mentions Steele's first publication in 1757:‚Äî \\"1757, Nov. 29. This day Nanny sent a part of her compositions to London to be printed.\\" Again: \\"Her brother brought with him her poetry, not yet bound.\\" Steele's stepmother, the second Mrs. Steele, shared the father's admiration, but they were anxious that any public expression of Steele's abilities as a writer should not injure her character. They prayed that she would remain humble. It was not till she was 44 that she consented to the publication of her hymns, that they might be available for public use. \\"The works of Mrs. Anne Steele\\", 1808 In 1760, she published Poems on Subjects Chiefly Devotional under the name Theodosia. This book had a second edition (3 vols. Bristol, 1780), for which Caleb Evans wrote a preface. Her complete works were published in one volume by Daniel Sedgwick (London, 1863), as Hymns, Psalms, and Poems by Anne Steele, with a memoir by John Sheppard. It comprised 144 hymns, thirty-four metrical psalms and fifty moral poems. Some of them, e.g. \\"Father of mercies, in Thy word,\\" have found their way into the collections of other churches. She has been called the Frances Ridley Havergal of the 18th-century. Several of Anne Steele's hymns appear in the Sacred Harp. In 1780, a new edition of the Poems, comprising a third and posthumous volume of Miscellanies, was published by Dr. Caleb Evans, the profits of which were to be given to the ‚ÄúBristol Education Society\\", also known as the Baptist College of Bristol, of which he was at that time President; to that volume, the Editor prefixed a biography of \\"Mrs. Steele\\", as she was more commonly called. A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship, a hymn book compiled by William Gadsby and first published in 1814, includes twenty-seven of the hymns by Anne Steele.A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship, List of authors This book is used mainly by some of the Calvinistic Strict Baptist churches in England. Steele, like the Welsh poet, William Williams Pantycelyn, wrote missionary hymns before modern missionary and Bible societies were established. She also wrote a well-known Sunday school hymn before Sunday schools were established. Personal life It has often been written that the drowning of her betrothed, Robert Elscourt, a few hours before the time fixed for her marriage, deeply affected an otherwise quiet life. However, modern research refutes the details of this story. One man did ask for the hand of Anne Steele, in 1742. This was Benjamin Beddome, but she turned him down, and remained unmarried. Steele loved the retirement of her Hampshire home. A quiet life suited her best. She said of herself:‚Äî \\"I enjoy a calm evening on the terrace walk, and I wish, though in vain, for numbers sweet as the lovely prospect, and gentle as the vernal breeze, to describe the beauties of charming spring; but the reflection how soon these blooming pleasures will vanish, spreads a melancholy gloom, till the mind rises by a delightful transition to the celestial Eden‚Äîthe scenes of undecaying pleasure and immutable perfection.\\" She sometimes wrote hymns on creation and providence; and although these lack the powerful originality of those of classical hymnists, they were full of warm, tender, thankful feeling. Always of a delicate constitution, it appears that Steele's habits were very reclusive. For many years, she was confined to her room because of illness, during which period, she was engaged in writing essays, principally of a religious nature, in prose and verse. In 1769, Steele's father died, and it is said that she never recovered from the shock. After the death of her father, she spent the remaining nine years of her life in the house of her brother, William, which he had built very near the old family home. Unlike most authors of her day, Steele was in a financial position which enabled her to devote the profits of her books to religious and charitable uses, and the same course was pursued by her surviving relatives. No portrait of Steele was ever made. She died in her native village, on 11 November 1778, at the age of 62, and was interred in the family vault at Broughton Church cemetery. Style Steele's hymns included class religious terms, which had a charm to those familiar with them, and who belonged to the \\"favoured\\" class, but had an unpleasant technical character to the ordinary reader. For example, the words 'dear' and 'dearest' were used till they seemed weak, and wearied the reader. Themes Steele's hymns, which were much used by Baptists, emphasized the less optimistic phases of Christian experience. Among Baptist hymnwriters, Steele stood at the head, if regarded either by the number of her hymns which found a place in the hymnals of the nineteenth century, or the frequency with which they were sung. Although few of them could be placed in the first rank of lyrical compositions, they were almost uniformly simple in language, natural and pleasing in imagery, and full of genuine Christian feeling. Steele may not inappropriately be compared with Frances Ridley Havergal. In both, there was the same evangelic fervour, in both the same intense personal devotion to Jesus. But whilst Steele seemed to think of Him more frequently as her \\"bleeding, dying Lord \\"‚Äîdwelling on His sufferings in their physical aspect, Havergal more often referred to His living help and sympathy, recognized with gladness His present claims as \\"Master\\" and \\" King,\\" and anticipated almost with ecstasy His second coming. Looking at the whole of Steele's hymns, there is a wider range of thought than in Miss Havergal's compositions. Steele treats a greater variety of subjects.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 14, 1996. In the episode, George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States (voiced by Harry Shearer), moves across the street from the Simpsons. Homer seeks revenge after the former President spanks Bart for his bad behavior. The episode was written by Ken Keeler and directed by Wes Archer. It was inspired by the animosity towards the show by the Bushes from earlier in the series' run. It features cultural references to the 1959 television series Dennis the Menace and Cheap Trick's 1979 song \\"Dream Police\\". Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics, and Vanity Fair named it the fifth best episode of the show. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.9, and was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara move into the empty house across the street from the Simpsons and take a liking to Ned Flanders. Although Barbara takes a liking to Bart, Bart's pranks and irreverant spirit annoy George, who spanks the boy after he accidentally shreds his memoirs and trashes the house with an outboard motor. Despite Barbara's suggestion that he apologize, George refuses after Homer confronts him for spanking Bart. Homer launches bottle rockets at George's window after Bush displays a banner reading \\"Two Bad Neighbors\\" to refer to Bart and Homer. Homer tears down cardboard likenesses of George and Barbara's sons, George Jr. and Jeb, displayed on their porch. He also glues a rainbow-colored wig on George's head as he is about to give a speech at a local club. George retaliates by destroying the Simpsons' lawn with his car. George spots Homer and Bart moving through underground sewers to release locusts in his house. He climbs below the street to confront them. After Homer and George brawl, Bart releases the locusts, which attack George. Former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev arrives to deliver a housewarming present for the Bushes. After pressure from his wife, George reluctantly apologizes to Homer in front of Gorbachev. The Bushes eventually move and sell their house to former President Gerald Ford. Ford invites Homer for beer and nachos during a football game broadcast at his house. Homer and Gerald find they share common ground because they are both accident-prone. Production =Background= George H. W. Bush and his wife had a feud with The Simpsons that eventually led to this episode. The show had a feud with the Bushes that eventually led to the idea for this episode. In the October 1, 1990 edition of People, Barbara Bush called The Simpsons \\"the dumbest thing [she] had ever seen\\", which had led to the writers sending a letter to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized.Brooks, James L. (2004). \\"Bush vs. Simpsons\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re- election campaign that reignited the feud between The Simpsons and the Bushes. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, to which effect he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington, D.C.: \\"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons\\". The next broadcast of The Simpsons was a rerun of \\"Stark Raving Dad\\" on January 30, 1992. It included a new opening, which was a response to Bush's speech. The scene begins in the Simpsons' living room. Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Patty and Selma all stare at the television and watch Bush's speech. After Bush's statement Bart replies, \\"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression too.\\" =Writing= alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer Bill Oakley, who was a writer on The Simpsons at the time, came up with the idea for \\"Two Bad Neighbors\\" two years before production began. Oakley got the inspiration for the episode after the feud between the Bushes and the Simpson family, and two years later when he and Josh Weinstein became showrunners of The Simpsons, they assigned Ken Keeler to write it. Oakley said that Bill Clinton had been President of the United States for two years at the point when the episode went into production, so the feud had \\"faded off into oblivion\\". The staff therefore thought it would be funny if the two parties encountered each other again. Weinstein said that the episode is often misunderstood. Many audiences expected a political satire, while the writers made special effort to keep the parody apolitical. Oakley stresses that \\"it's not a political attack, it's a personal attack\\", and instead of criticizing Bush for his policies, the episode instead pokes fun at his \\"crotchetiness\\". Oakley considered the episode to lack many \\"zany\\" jokes common for the show at that time, and described the episode as a companion piece to the season eight episode \\"Homer's Enemy\\", in that a realistic character (Frank Grimes in that case) is placed in the unrealistic Simpsons universe and juxtaposed alongside Homer, creating conflict. In an interview with the fan site NoHomers.net, Weinstein was asked if there had been any stories that he had come up with that did not make it into the show, to which he replied: \\"The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like 'Two Bad Neighbors' and 'Homer's Enemy' we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us.\\" At the end of the episode, Gerald Ford moves into the house across the street after Bush leaves. When originally conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut. The episode features the first appearance of Disco Stu, who became a recurring character in the series. Stu was originally designed as a withered, old, John Travolta- esque figure and was to be voiced by repeat guest star Phil Hartman. However, when the animators remodeled the character, Hartman was not available to dub the voice and so Hank Azaria took over the role. =Merchandise= \\"Two Bad Neighbors\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 14, 1996. The episode was selected for release in a 2000 video collection of selected political episodes of the show, titled: The Simpsons Political Party. The episode appeared on the second volume of the collection, together with the episode \\"Duffless\\" from season four. The episode was included in The Simpsons season seven DVD set, which was released on December 13, 2005. Keeler, Oakley, and Weinstein participated in the DVD's audio commentary, alongside Matt Groening and the director of the episode, Wes Archer. Cultural references Grampa claims to have been spanked by Grover Cleveland. The relationship between Bart and George is a homage to the United States television series Dennis the Menace from 1959, with the Bushes standing in for Dennis's elderly neighbors, the Wilsons. In response to George spanking Bart, Grandpa says: \\"Big deal! When I was a pup, we got spanked by Presidents till the cows came home. Grover Cleveland spanked me on two non-consecutive occasions\\", referring to Grover Cleveland, the only president to have served two non-consecutive terms in office. When Homer and Bart hand out fliers for the upcoming garage sale, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon is seen washing his car while singing Cheap Trick's 1979 song \\"Dream Police\\". Homer's song at the rummage sale is set to the tune of the songs \\"Big Spender\\" and \\"Stayin' Alive\\". Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Two Bad Neighbors\\" finished 52nd in the ratings for the week of January 7 to January 14, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 9.9. Retrieved on December 21, 2008. The episode was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following the Post Game NFC Championship. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. It was named by Vanity Fair's John Ortved as the show's fifth best episode. Ortved said, \\"While the Simpsons people have always claimed evenhandedness in their satire, the show is, after all, hardly right-leaning, and it is hard to miss how gleefully the former President is mocked here.\\" Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, wrote: \\"Very strange, this episode takes The Simpsons into a whole new dimension of political satire. The lampooning of a single public figure is a startling move. Works much better for Americans, we're told.\\" Dave Foster of DVD Times said: \\"Once again showing the mischievous relationship Bart and Homer share their pranks and the inevitable confrontations with George Bush Senior are as hilarious as they are implausible and frequent, but there is much to love about this episode in which the writers think out loud and paint The Simpsons and its characters as Bush once did.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it \\"offers the kind of episode that only The Simpsons could pull off well. The idea of bringing a president to live in Springfield is high-concept to say the least, and it could ‚Äì and probably should ‚Äì have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show.\\" John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the second best episode of the series, and Rich Weir of AskMen.com named it the ninth best episode.

Kopassus was founded on 16 April 1952. It gained worldwide attention after several operations such as the Indonesian invasion of East Timor and the release of hostages from Garuda Indonesia Flight 206. The Special Forces spearheaded some of the government's military campaigns: putting down regional rebellions in the late 1950s, the Operation Trikora (Western New Guinea campaign) in 1961‚Äì1962, the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation from 1962‚Äì1966, the massacres of alleged communists in 1965, the East Timor invasion in 1975, and subsequent campaigns against separatists in various provinces. Kopassus is reported by national and international media, human rights-affiliated NGOs and researchers to have committed violations of human rights in East Timor, Aceh, Riau and Papua and the capital Jakarta. Published articles in mainstream media may include epithets such as \\"the notorious Kopassus\\" or \\"abusive Indonesian unit\\".Jones, Tony; Griffiths, Emma (12 August 2003) \\"Al Qaeda claim could be authentic: Howard\\". (transcript) Lateline, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Retrieved 12 July 2013 History On 15 April 1952, Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang began to form Kesatuan Komando Tentara Territorium III/Siliwangi (Kesko TT), the early name of Kopassus and the basis for this historic special forces unit. Not long after, Colonel Kawilarang with the use of military intelligence located and met with Major Rokus Bernardus Visser‚Äîa former member of the Dutch Special Forces who had remained in newly independent Indonesia, settled in West Java, married an Indonesian woman, and was known locally as Mochammad Idjon Djanbi. He was the first recruit for the Indonesian special forces, as well as its first commander. Due to him, the unit which later became Kopassus wear red berets (color traditionally favored by airborne troops in Europe) instead of the distinctive green beret.\\"Kopassus: Inside Indonesia's Special Forces\\" At that time, Indonesia's special force name was 3rd Territorial Army Command Commando Unit (Indonesian: Kesatuan Komando Teritorium Tiga (Kesko TT)). Kopassus was the final result of five name changes: KTT, KKAD (KK Angkatan Darat, Army Commando Forces Unit), RPKAD, Puspassus (Army Special Forces Department) and Kopassandha.Komando Pasukan Sandi Yudha; Sandhi Yudha roughly translated as \\"secret or covert warrior\\", translated as Special Forces Corps. The first generation of this force was only around a hundred soldiers or one company, headquartered in Bandung. Among its pioneer instructors was a young veteran of the Indonesian National Revolution, future Minister of Defense Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani, who later became a battalion commander and later led his paratroopers to crush the two twin rebellions in 1957-58 by the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia and Permesta. As the RPKAD (Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat, Army Para-Commando Regiment),a name used in the 1960s, and expanded into a three-battalion special forces airborne regiment, the para-military force was involved in the widespread killings during Gen. Suharto's rise to power. An estimated half-a million people were killed in the anti-communist purge with strong communal overtones. The RPKAD was involved in wiping out entire villages such as Kesiman (east of Denpasar) in Bali, many of them in beach areas which later becomes major tourist resorts. p. 167 The unit also saw action during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation when in 1965, Indonesia launched a war for control of North Borneo (Sabah/Sarawak) during Malaysian independence, particularly in the Battle of Sungei Koemba. In 1981, with Moerdani yet again at the lead, a Kopassandha company was deployed to Bangkok as part of the efforts to rescue Garuda Indonesia Flight 206 from hijackers. In 2017 Kopassus was sent to Afghanistan to guard the Indonesia embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.https://en.antaranews.com/news/113959/indonesia-to-deploy- military-personnel-at-its-embassy-in- kabul&sa;=U&ved;=2ahUKEwik6PjIqIjrAhWEbn0KHfAvCg4QFjAAegQIARAB&usg;=AOvVaw14RLQ4FYXHLMqOycAd3De7http://www.asianews.eu/content/indonesia- send-troops-kabul- mission-63617&sa;=U&ved;=2ahUKEwjGvdXDp4jrAhUZcCsKHUpwD7YQFjARegQIAxAB&usg;=AOvVaw2UtgDMvoCEzZPRDPFOCDWp Organization Kopassus' Groups Kopassus organizational structure is different from the infantry units in general. Although Kopassus members generally came from the Infantry Corps, Kopassus created its own structure, which is different from infantry units. Kopassus units intentionally do not use the nomenclature of standard infantry units. This is apparent in their units called Groups. With this unit, Kopassus can deploy a brigade plus size (about 5,000 personnel), or fewer. There are Five (5) groups of Kopassus which are: *Special Forces Training and Education Center (\\"Pusdikpassus\\") - located in Batujajar, West Java *1st Para Commandos Group *2nd Para Commandos Group *Group 4 Sandi Yudha (Clandestine) *SAT-81 Gultor Counter-terrorism Group Except for Pusdikpassus, which serves as an educational center, other Groups have combat oriented operational functions. Each Group (except Pusdikpassus) is subdivided into battalions, for example: Yon 11, 12, 13 and 14 (from Group 1), and Yon 21, 22 and 23 (from Group 2). =Group 1 Para Commandos= Kopassus commando Kopassus commandos in fast roping demonstration Group 1 Para Commando (\\"GRUP 1 PARA KOMANDO\\") is a unit of Brigade level which is part of the Army Special Forces Command and was established on 23 March 1963. The group was first commanded by Major L.B. Moerdani. The unit's motto known as Dhuaja is Eka Wastu Baladhika, then created by Corporal Suyanto. It has a total of 3,274 personnel.COMMANDO Magazine, Volume II No. 1 July‚ÄìAugust 2005. Jakarta: Gramedia, 2005. The unit's internal organization consists of the group headquarters and four battalions which are: #11th Battalion / \\"Atulo Sena Bhaladhika\\" #12th Battalion / \\"Asabha Sena Baladhika\\" #13th Battalion / \\"Thikkaviro Sena Bhaladhika\\" #14th Battalion / \\"Bhadrika Sena Bhaladhika\\" Each battalion consists of 3 companies. Each company is broken into 3 platoons, each of which consisted of 39 people. And each platoon consists of 3 small units called a squad of 10 men. The 1st Group, with its 4 battalions, is the largest brigade of the Kopassus. =Group 2 Para Commandos= Group 2 Para Commando (\\"GRUP 2 PARA KOMANDO\\") is a unit of Brigade level, which is part of the Special Forces Command of the Army and was established in 1962.

Commando Training Kopassus commandos are trained in multiple martial arts and self defense knowledge. Shown here are Kopassus commandos demonstrating Merpati Putih The Commando education and training lasts for approximately seven months (28 weeks) which is divided into three stages. The first phase of the implementation of the education is conducted on the base for 18 weeks, the second stage all participants will be released in the forest and the mountains twice each for 6 weeks, and the next stage of the third stage ends with a 4-week sea-swamp stage. The 97th batch of the Commando Education had first initial participants as many as 251 personnel, who successfully passed through commando education and inaugurated as a special forces commando of 214 personnel. Phases are as shown below: *Phase I (Base training) 10 Weeks with individual ability points in Batujajar.

In the year 2016 followed by 153 commando students, which consists of ranks of 41 Officers, 101 NCOs, and 11 Enlisted. The command officers who successfully complete the 7-month Command Course well are entitled to wear the qualified commando brevet issued to their clothing/uniform. Aside from Kopassus commandos, the SFTEC also trains SF-ready combat personnel of the Army Raider Infantry battalions within the structure of the territorial region commands or KODAMs Army-wide and within Kostrad compotent units. =Group 4 Combat Intelligence= Group 4 / Sandhi Yudha is a Kopassus unit that has the specification of \\"Clandestine operation\\" 'secret warfare', including combat Intel and counter-insurgency. Group 4 was formed on 24 July 1967, headquartered at Cijantung Kopassus Headquarters, East Jakarta. Prospective Personnel in this Group are strictly selected internally ranging from prospective soldiers who are still educated to personnel who have active duty in unity but have an intelligence talent that will then be trained again. The motto of this unit is \\"Chatur Kottaman Wira Naraca Byuha\\". The Group is organized as follows: #Group HQ #31st Battalion/Eka Sandhi Yudha Utama #32nd Battalion/Apta Sandhi Prayudha Utama #33rd Battalion/Wira Sandhi Yudha Sakti Conducted Training The basic training is the same as other Kopassus soldiers (2.5 months), Command School (7 months) plus other courses such as PH (Jungle Warfare), PJD (Close Combat), Spursus (Special combat school )and Dakibu (Climber,) but after that the candidates of combat-intelligence is educated more specifically for the education of \\"Sandhi Yudha\\" in \\"Pusdiklatassus\\" located in Batujajar whose education materials are intelligence and supporting knowledge for intelligence in the field of operation such as disguise, navigation, special martial, Special tools of intelligence and others. Even some selected personnel from this Group are sent abroad to schools of Military Intelligence Education Centers such as in the United States, Germany, Britain and even Israel. Among all types of soldiers in \\"Kopassus\\", the most specific form of education and training is the Group 4 / Sandhi Yudha combat intelligence unit. =SAT-81 Gultor Counter-terrorism group= Sat-81 Kopassus counter terrorism group Unit 81 / Counter Terror or abbreviated as Sat-81 / Gultor is a unit in Kopassus which is equvalent to a group level formation and is composed of the best chosen personnel within the whole of the Indonesian Army special forces. The strength of this unit is not publicly publicized on the number of personnel or types of weapons. The Sat 81 gultor is incorporated in the BNPT Crisis Control Center (\\"Pusdalsis\\") which consists of a combination of special units, such as the Denjaka from the Indonesian Navy, the Bravo Detachment 90 of the Indonesian Air Force, and the 1st Gegana Command of the Brimob Corps, Indonesian National Police. \\"Pusdalsis\\" is organized of a combination of elite units within the Indonesian National Armed Forces and Police which is assigned as a counter-terrorist formation to be sent when the activities of terrorism may be conducted such as aircraft hijacking.

It was first used during a ceremony on 5 October 1954. This emblem consists of a bayonet, anchors representing abilities in the sea and wings as high mobility. The beret emblem used in 1968 until now with slight changes from the initial design, the bayonet is more slender than the Commando knife and the wingspan is more wing coat like the Wing of the Army designs. The iconic Kopassus Camouflage pattern called Loreng Darah Mengalir (Flowing Blood pattern), introduced in 1964 pattern was originally intended to be a copy of the WW2 era British Denison brushstroke camouflage for issue to the RPKAD. However, an error at the original manufacturing plant resulted in the vertical, vine-like stripes that characterize this unique pattern.The original version illustrated, with some variation in color and type of fabric, saw service between 1964 and 1986 (at which time the entire Armed Forces were outfitted in a copy of British DPM). The second pattern shown was revived for issue to Kopassus in 1995 but in a slightly varied design, worn for ceremonial & training purposes only. For other purpose regular TNI patern (DPM) was used instead. =Commando Brevet= The Commando qualification brevet used since 1966 until now was designed by Major Djajadiningrat. This brevet is used by all graduates of Commando training and Education from Batujajar. Colonel Sarwo Edhie Wibowo in a demonstration of \\"Show Of Force\\" at Senayan's parking lot on 4 January 1966 used the new Commando Brevet qualification to show the public of the Corps' new appearance. =Paratrooper Badges= Jump Master Wings Jump Master Wing badge Jump Master Wings are issued to commandos of Kopassus who have graduated from advanced paratrooper jump master courses conducted by the Commando training and educational center. Free Fall Wing The Kopassus (RPKAD) military freefall wing insignia, designed by HH.Djajadiningrat and first issued in 1962 depicts a free fall paratrooper hanging under a circle consisting of small parachutes. Stated by the first free fall instructors of the Yugoslavia: Mladen Milicetic, Stoyan Jovic and Dobel Stanej in Bandung during the first free fall graduation ceremony of Kopassus (RPKAD) on 26 October 1962.https://muhammadsubchi.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/kopassus-6-atribut- kopassus-pendidikan-komando-rekrutmen/ Assassination activity List of assassination known conduct by Kopassus: *Nicolau dos Reis Lobato, East Timorese politician. *Balibo Five, group of Australian journalists in East Timor.

Militia force List of militia or proxy force known trained by kopassus: *North Kalimantan Communist Party *Kokam (id) *Pro-Indonesia militia *Laskar Jihad Human rights Kopassus has been accused by NGOs, Western politicians, and researchers of human rights violations. Amnesty International and Indonesian human rights groups including the official National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) have cited abuses by members of Kopassus. Kopassus has also been associated with illegal economic activities, like involvement in the trade of Agarwood and illegal gold mining in West Papua and other areas, and the trade in drugs. In 1975, five Australian journalists, known as the Balibo Five, were killed by members of Kopassus in the town of Balibo during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. The Indonesian military has always maintained that the men were killed in a cross-fire during the battle for the town. Arnold Ap was a West Papuan cultural leader, anthropologist and musician. Arnold was the leader of the group Mambesak, and Curator of the Cenderawasih University Museum. In November 1983, he was arrested by Kopassus and imprisoned and tortured for suspected sympathies with the Free Papua Movement, although no charges were laid. In April 1984, he was killed by a gunshot to his back. Official accounts claim he was trying to escape. Many supporters believe Ap was executed by Kopassus.Vickers, Adrian. 2005.

During the May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Kopassus members were involved in organising and carrying out acts of murder and violence against Chinese Indonesians. This included involvement in mass gang- rapes of Sino-Indonesian women and girls across Jakarta. Kopassus has also been considered responsible for the 1997‚Äì98 activists kidnappings in Indonesia. According to the Federation of American Scientists, a number of activists were kidnapped by KOPASSUS troops in the last months of the Suharto regime, and at least 23 government critics disappeared.https://fas.org/irp/world/indonesia/kopassus.htm In 2001, four Kopassus members were convicted of the strangulation of Theys Eluay, the former chairman of the Papua Presidium Council. They were part of a group which had killed Theys after ambushing him and his driver. The group's leader, Lt-Col Hatono, and another soldier received prison sentences of three and a half years while two others received three years. A further two officers had their charges dismissed. The men were all Kopassus members from Group V (Jakarta) and were not based in Jayapura or West Papua. They faced a court- martial, which found them not guilty on the more serious charges of premeditated murder, because the Kopassus are legally exempt from the jurisdiction of civil law. Indonesian Army Chief, General Ryamizard Ryacudu (2002‚Äì05), accepted the men had to be prosecuted \\"because Indonesia is a State based on law\\" but he affirmed their defence's view that they were heroes who had killed a rebel leader. In 2002 kopassus accused killed three teachers (two of whom were American and one Indonesian) and wounded 12 others in an ambush near the Freeport mine.For this, the US Congress extended its existing ban on contact with the Indonesian military.There is also suspicion that the attack was aimed at blackmailing mine owners into paying protection money. From 2000 to 2002, Freeport McMoRan paid the TNI $10.7 million in protection money, but the company shut down the payments shortly before the ambush.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/world/us-links-indonesian-troops-to- deaths-of-2-americans.htmlhttps://ips- dc.org/getting_into_bed_with_the_devil_in_indonesia/https://www.theage.com.au/national/we- must-not-get-back-in-bed-with-kopassus-20030814-gdw74j.html& Yustinus Murib was a West Papuan rebel who was the leader of the Free Papua Movement, a separatist group that since the 1960s has been fighting for independence from Indonesia. Shortly before being killed Murib sent letters to a few different world leaders and the UN, calling for an independent nation to be a mediator between Megawati Sukarnoputri and the West Papua Movement. He and leaders of the separatist movement had called for peace talks with Jakarta, but on November 6, 2003 Kopassus troops killed him and nine of his men.

Ten people drowned in their attempts to flee the ship that had run aground and get to shore in the United States. The survivors were taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and were held in various prisons throughout the U.S. while they applied for the right of asylum. Roughly 10% were granted asylum after U.S. Representative William Goodling entreated President Bill Clinton; minors were released, while about half the remainder were deported (some being accepted by South American countries). Some remained in immigration prison for years fighting their cases, the majority in York, Pennsylvania. The final 52 persons were released by President Clinton on February 27, 1997, after four years in prison.Golden Venture, dir. Peter Cohn, Hillcrest Films, 2006 This case was an early test of the system of detaining asylum-seekers in prisons, a practice that continues in the U.S., Australia, and the United Kingdom. It was also notable because some detainees created more than 10,000 folk art sculptures or Chinese paper folding, papier-m√¢ch√©, and recycled materials while in York County Prison; these were later exhibited throughout the U.S. and sold to offset legal costs. The journey The immigrants paid $40,000 on average in whole or in part before departing China on foot through Myanmar then to Bangkok where they were kept in a staging house for two months. In February 1993, the ship departed, and on its way stopped by Mombasa, Kenya to pick up passengers left stranded by a previous boat that had run aground there. Rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the ship was caught in a hurricane but survived, and headed toward Boston. The immigrants held in the cramped hold of the freighter were forced to live on a diet of rice, peanuts, dirty water, and spoiled food as it sailed on its 4-month voyage to New York City. There were beatings by the gang enforcers on board and several incidents of rape. The ship was supposed to rendezvous with smaller ships before landing. However, this didn't happen due to the gang in charge being arrested around that time. The smugglers on board directed the ship to New York City. Golden Venture ran aground on the beach at Fort Tilden in Rockaway Beach in Queens, New York on June 6, 1993, at around 2 a.m. after a mutiny of sorts by one smuggler who had locked up the captain.Faison, Seth. 12 Indicted on Charges of Smuggling Aliens. The New York Times ‚Äì June 22, 1993 Ten people drowned in the city early morning water in their attempts to flee the stranded ship and in their excitement get to shore in the United States. The survivors, 262 men, 24 women, and 14 children, were taken into custody by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)--six escaped‚Äîand were held in various prisons throughout the U.S. while they applied for the right of asylum. Roughly 10 percent were granted asylum after Pennsylvania congressman William Goodling entreated President Bill Clinton; minors were released, while about half the remainder were deported (some being accepted by South American countries). Some remained in immigration prison for years fighting their cases, 119 in York, Pennsylvania in a medium security prison. It was argued that this tactic was a method of isolating the prisoners from lawyers and rights groups. A number of individuals in York volunteered their time as legal aid, and in the last years there was a weekly vigil held outside the prison. Criminal leaders Lee Peng Fei, also known as Lee Hsiao Kuang and Char Lee was described at his trial as the 'mastermind' behind Golden Venture. He had not been on board the ship but had ordered the grounding from his Chinatown apartment. The Taiwan citizen was arrested in Thailand and later sentence to 20 years. One of those behind Golden Venture was a Chinese gang leader named Guo Liang Chi, known mainly by his street name of Ah Kay.Faison, Seth. Chinatown Gang Leader to Be Returned to U.S. The New York Times ‚Äì April 12, 1994 He was the leader of the Fuk Ching gang, which up to early 1993, had been the most powerful Asian gang in New York City.Faison, Seth. 18 Are Indicted In Smuggling Of Immigrants.

The Snakehead: An Epic Tale of the Chinatown Underworld and the American Dream (New York: Doubleday, 2009) Kay was arrested in Hong Kong and eventually extradited to the U.S. Federal investigators acknowledged that they were less interested in prosecuting Guo than in hearing what he had to say. After he cooperated with the US government in at least 15 different federal criminal cases over a period of many years, including the prosecution of 35 Chinatown gang members, he eventually received a light sentence. By contrast, on June 22, 2005 Cheng Chui Ping (known within some communities as \\"Sister Ping\\" or \\"Big Sister Ping\\") was convicted for smuggling illegal immigrants and for money laundering from this case. Ah Kay testified against her during her May‚ÄìJune 2005 trial. Cheng became a snakehead, primarily as an investor, charging up to per person for the voyage from Asia to New York City in the suffocating hold of the rogue vessel. Although Cheng provided cash to buy the aging vessel in Thailand, trial evidence showed that she did not view Golden Venture's voyage as an important business deal,Preston, Julia.

She owned restaurants, a clothing store, real estate in Chinatown, apartments in Hong Kong, and a farm in South Africa. Evidence revealed that her main, multimillion-dollar business was an underground banking network that stretched from New York to Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China. On March 17, 2006, she was sentenced to the maximum of 35 years in federal prison despite her protests that she was forced to carry out the work by Triad gangs. The federal judge pointed out the inhumane travel conditions forced on the immigrants and her use of gangsters to collect debts and ransoms in justifying the sentence.Keefe, Patrick Radden. \\"The Snakehead: The Criminal Odyssey of Chinatown's Sister Ping\\".

He was trained in Argos and then worked in Athens at the time of the Peloponnesian war, as a follower of the idealistic portraiture of Myron. He is best known for his statue Pericles with the Corinthian helmet. Biography Kresilas hailed from the city-state of Kydonia, on the island of Crete.Hurwit, p. 131; Politt, p. 69; Furtw√§ngler, pp. 115‚Äì116. He was trained in Argos as a student of Dorotheos, with whom he worked at Delphi and Hermione.Giuliano 1987, p. 686 Between 450 and 420 BC he worked mainly in Athens, as a follower of Myron's school and in the post- Phidias period he brought elements of compactness due to the Peloponnesian period. Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote of a competition between the four sculptors Polykleitos, Phidias, Kresilas, and Phradmon, on the best statues of Amazons for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Each sculptor placed himself at first place, but Phidias, Kresilas, and Phradmon had all put Polykleitos at second place, thus, Polykleitos won, Pheidias came second, and Kresilas third.Hurwit, p. 154; Politt, p. 226; Pliny, Natural History 34.53 (pp. 166‚Äì167); The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide 7. \\"Wounded Amazon\\" p. 306; Furtw√§ngler, pp. 128‚Äì141 Work Herm of ‚ÄúPericles, son of Xanthippus, Athenian‚Äù, Roman copy of the original by Kresilas, Vatican Museums (no. 269). In Athens he created, for example, a bronze statue of Pericles (440‚Äì430 BC) with the Corinthian helmet upon the head as a sign of his position as strategos. Pliny the Elder said of it: \\"a work worthy of the title; it is a marvellous thing about this art that it can make famous men even more famous\\".Politt, p. 69; Pliny, Natural History 34.74‚Äì75 (pp. 182‚Äì183). Its base was found in the Athenian Acropolis; it was doubtless the bronze that Pausanias saw there (Pausanias I.25.1, I.28.2). It seems the series of Pericles portrait busts derive from it, of which there are examples at the Vatican Museums, British Museum (found at Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, and owned by Charles Townley) and Altes Museum. Kresilas also created the wounded men and a dying Amazon for Ephesus in concurrence (in a competition with Phidias and Polykleitos), possibly the model for many copies, one of which is the wounded Amazon of Kresilas (volnerata; Pliny, Nat. Hist. xxxiv. 75) in the Vatican Museums. He has also been identified as the originator of the Velletri type of Athena statue (Athena of Velletri). He created a Diomedes statue according to Homer's description. =\\"Cresilla\\"= In 1804 CE, Kresilas was mistakenly identified as a woman named \\"Cresilla\\" by Matilda Betham, who thought \\"she\\" had placed third behind Polykleitos and Phidias in a competition to sculpt seven Amazons for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. As a result, Kresilas was mistakenly included in artist Judy Chicago's symbolic history of women in Western civilization, The Dinner Party.

The first king from the House of Eric was Eric IX of Sweden, also known as Saint Eric, from whom it got its name. Almost all the subsequent kings of Sweden have been descendants of the House of Eric. The House of Eric favored the Varnhem Abbey, and several of its members are interred there. Foremother of the dynasty was Eric IX's wife Christina Bj√∂rnsdotter, whom legend claims to have been the maternal granddaughter of King Inge I of Sweden, who abolished paganism. The female first name Catherine seems to have been favored within the Erik dynasty. History Two branches of the dynasty came into conflict in 1226. Canute the Tall, allegedly the adult heir of Filip, younger son of Eric IX, deposed the underage Eric XI, the Lisp and Lame (l√§spe och halte), who resumed the kingship in 1234. Conflict continued between the royal senior branch and Canute's two sons until the sons were executed in 1248 and 1251. Eric XI was the last king of the agnatic line of this dynasty. He died in 1250 and apparently left no surviving children. Though some romantic genealogies, and later research influenced by them, have attributed one or two daughters to him, they were more likely daughters of his sister and Birger jarl. Eric XI's nephew, the then underage son of his sister Ingeborg, was elected king Valdemar I of Sweden, under the regency of his father Birger Jarl. Descent from this house was regarded as such hard currency in medieval and early modern power games that some aspirants (most notably Charles VIII of Sweden) even fabricated a descent (see Tofta, Adels√∂) to show that they too were heirs of the House of Erik.

Her younger brother, Thomas Nesbitt, Jr., acted in one film in 1925, before his death in South Africa in 1927 from an apparent heart attack. She made her debut in London in the stage revival of Arthur Wing Pinero's The Cabinet Minister (1910). She acted in countless plays after that. In 1911, she joined the Irish Players, went to the United States and debuted on Broadway in The Well of the Saints. She also was in the cast of John Millington Synge's The Playboy of the Western World with the Irish Players when the whole cast was pelted with fruits and vegetables by the offended Irish American Catholic audience. She became the love of English poet Rupert Brooke in 1912. Brooke wrote love sonnets to her, and they were engaged to be married when he died during World War I. Nesbitt returned to the US and appeared on Broadway in Quinneys (1915) and John Galsworthy's Justice (1916) as John Barrymore's leading lady in his first dramatic stage role. After five other plays there, she returned to England. For the rest of the decade she performed in London; her roles included the title role in a revival of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. Her film debut was in the silent A Star Over Night (1919). She then performed in The Faithful Heart (1922). She did not appear in a film again until 1930, when she played the role of Anne Lymes in Canaries Sometimes Sing, which was an early talkie. In 1932, she appeared in The Frightened Lady. She appeared in the 1938 film version of Pygmalion as \\"a lady\\" who attends the Embassy ball. In the opening credits her first name was spelled as \\"Kathleen\\", but as \\"Cathleen\\" at the end of the film. She played the part of Mother in the 1949 BBC TV remake of the drama film Elizabeth of Ladymead. Nesbitt's first Hollywood film was Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), in which she played the character role of La Principessa. This was followed that same year by Black Widow, in which she played Lucia Colletti. She was Cary Grant's Grandmother Janou in 1957's An Affair to Remember (though she was, in fact, only 16 years older than Grant) and, the following year, was part of the ensemble cast of Separate Tables. She also appeared in The Parent Trap (1961), and Promise Her Anything (1965). Gigi in 1952 Other Broadway appearances included Aunt Alicia in the original Anita Loos adaptation of Gigi (1951), Sabrina Fair (1953), and Anastasia (1954). In 1956, she played Mrs. Higgins in My Fair Lady starring Rex Harrison. Nesbitt reprised the role in 1981, in her 90s, in a Broadway revival, opposite Harrison, who was in his 70s. She played Agatha Morley on the TV series The Farmer's Daughter from 1963 to 1966, playing the mother of a Congressman (played by William Windom). She guest starred on such shows as The United States Steel Hour; Wagon Train; Naked City, Dr. Kildare and Upstairs, Downstairs (as Rachel Gurney's mother, Mabel, Countess of Southwold). In 1969 she played Richard Burton's mother in the film Staircase and again in Villain two years later. She had a small but memorable role as an elderly drug addict in French Connection II (1975) alongside Gene Hackman. Her next film was Hitchcock's Family Plot (1976), in which she played Julia Rainbird. She then appeared as the grandmother in Julia (1977). Her final film was Never Never Land (1980) as Edith Forbes. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1980 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Personal life Nesbitt in The Parent Trap (1961 film) Nesbitt became the love of English poet Rupert Brooke in 1912, who wrote love sonnets to her. They were engaged to be married, but he died in 1915 at age 27 of blood poisoning, the result of a bite from an infected mosquito while he served in the Royal Navy during World War I. In 1921 Nesbitt married World War I Military Cross-winner and barrister turned actor Cecil Ramage. They had two children. She and Ramage were separated for many years but remained legally married until her death in 1982. Nesbitt lived for many years in the United States, but returned to the United Kingdom where she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1978.London Gazette notice of Nesbitt's CBE Her autobiography, A Little Love and Good Company, was published in 1973.

Suso is thought to have been born on March 21, 1295. An important author in both Latin and Middle High German, he is also notable for defending Meister Eckhart's legacy after Eckhart was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1329. He died in Ulm on 25 January 1366, and was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1831.  Biography  Suso was born Heinrich von Berg, a member of the ruling family of Berg. He was born in either the Free imperial city of √úberlingen on Lake Constance or nearby Constance, on 21 March 1295 (or perhaps on that date up to 1297‚Äì99).Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p. 197. Later, out of humility and devotion to his mother, he took her family name, which was Sus (or S√ºs). At 13 years of age he was admitted to the novitiate of the Dominican Order at their priory in Constance. After completing that year of probation, he advanced to do his preparatory, philosophical, and theological studies there. In the prologue to his Life, Suso recounts how, after about five years in the monastery (in other words, when he was about 18 years old), he experienced a conversion to a deeper form of religious life through the intervention of Divine Wisdom. He made himself \\"the Servant of Eternal Wisdom\\", which he identified with the divine essence and, in more specific terms, with divine Eternal Wisdom made man in Christ. From this point forward in his account of his spiritual life, a burning love for Eternal Wisdom dominated his thoughts and controlled his actions; his spiritual journey culminated in a mystical marriage to Christ in the form of the Eternal Wisdom.Barbara Newman, God and the Goddesses (2003), pp. 12‚Äì14 =Career= Suso was then sent on for further studies in philosophy and theology, probably first at the Dominican monastery in Strasbourg, perhaps between 1319 and 1321, and then from 1324 to 1327 he took a supplementary course in theology in the Dominican Studium Generale in Cologne, where he would have come into contact with Meister Eckhart, and probably also Johannes Tauler, both celebrated mystics.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p. 198. Returning to his home priory at Constance in about 1327, Suso was appointed to the office of lector (lecturer). His teaching, however, aroused criticism ‚Äì most likely because of his connection with Eckhart in the wake of the latter's trial and condemnation in 1326‚Äì29. Suso's Little Book of Truth, a short defence of Eckhart's teaching, probably dates from this time, perhaps 1329. In 1330 this treatise, and another, were denounced as heretical by enemies in the Order. Suso traveled to the Dominican General Chapter held at Maastricht in 1330 to defend himself. The consequence is not entirely known ‚Äì at some point between 1329 and 1334 he was removed from his lectorship in Constance, though he was not personally condemned. Knowledge of Suso's activities in subsequent years is somewhat sketchy. It is known that he served as prior of the Constance convent ‚Äì most likely between 1330 and 1334, though possibly in the 1340s. It is also known that he had various devoted disciples, a group including both men and women, especially those connected to the Friends of God movement. His influence was especially strong in many religious communities of women, particularly in the Dominican Monastery of St. Katharinental in the Argau, a famous nursery of mysticism in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the mid-1330s, during his visits to various communities of Dominican nuns and Beguines, Suso became acquainted with Elsbeth Stagel, prioress of the monastery of Dominican nuns in T√∂ss. The two became close friends. She translated some of his Latin writings into German, collected and preserved most of his extant letters, and at some point began gathering the materials that Suso eventually put together into his Life of the Servant. Suso shared in the exile of the Dominican community from Constance between 1339 and 1346, during the most heated years of the quarrel between Pope John XXII and the Holy Roman Emperor. He was transferred to the monastery at Ulm in about 1348. He seems to have remained there for the rest of his life. Here, during his final years (possibly 1361‚Äì63), he edited his four vernacular works into The Exemplar. Suso died in Ulm on 25 January 1366. =Mortifications= Early in his life, Suso subjected himself to extreme forms of mortifications; later on he reported that God told him they were unnecessary. During this period, Suso devised for himself several painful devices. Some of these were: an undergarment studded with a hundred and fifty brass nails, a very uncomfortable door to sleep on, and a cross with thirty protruding needles and nails under his body as he slept. In the autobiographical text in which he reports these, however, he ultimately concludes that they are unnecessary distractions from the love of God.http://www.philosophy , r. o. (2004). \\"Internal Suffering and Christianity.\\" available from Writings Suso and Johannes Tauler were students of Meister Eckhart, forming the nucleus of the Rhineland school of mysticism. As a lyric poet and \\"troubadour of divine wisdom,\\" Suso explored with psychological intensity the spiritual truths of Eckhart‚Äôs mystical philosophy. Suso's first work was the B√ºchlein der Wahrheit (Little Book of Truth) written between 1328 and 1334 in Constance. This was a short defence of the teaching of Meister Eckhart, who had been tried for heresy and condemned in 1328‚Äì29. In 1330 this treatise and another (possibly the Little Book of Eternal Wisdom) were denounced as heretical by Dominican opponents, leading Suso to travel to the Dominican General Chapter held at Maastricht in 1330 to defend himself. Suso's next book, Das B√ºchlein der ewigen Weisheit (The Little Book of Eternal Wisdom), written around 1328‚Äì1330, is less speculative and more practical. At some point between 1334 and 1337 Suso translated this work into Latin, but in doing so added considerably to its contents, and made of it an almost entirely new book, which he called the Horologium Sapientiae (Clock of Wisdom). This book was dedicated to the new Dominican Master General, Hugh of Vaucemain, who appears to have been a supporter of his. At some point in the following decades, Stagel formed a collection of 28 of Suso's letters in the Grosses Briefbuch (Great Book of Letters), which survives. Suso also wrote a long text purporting to tell the story of his spiritual life and ascetic practices (variously referred to as the Life of the Servant, Life, Vita, or Leben Seuses), and revised the B√ºchlein der Wahrheit and the B√ºchlein der ewigen Weisheit. At some point in his later years, perhaps 1361‚Äì63, he collected these works, together with 11 of his letters (the Briefb√ºchlein, or Little Book of Letters, a selection of letters from the Grosses Briefbuch), and wrote a prologue, to form one book he referred to as The Exemplar.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p. 204. There are also various sermons attributed to Suso, although only two appear to be authentic. A treatise known as the Minneb√ºchlein (Little Book of Love) is sometimes, but probably incorrectly, attributed to Suso. Suso was very widely read in the later Middle Ages. There are 232 extant manuscripts of the Middle High German Little Book of Eternal Wisdom. The Latin Clock of Wisdom was even more popular: over four hundred manuscripts in Latin, and over two hundred manuscripts in various medieval translations (it was translated into eight languages, including Dutch, French, Italian, Swedish, Czech, and English). Many early printings survive as well. The Clock was therefore second only to the Imitation of Christ in popularity among spiritual writings of the later Middle Ages.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), pp. 199, 201 Among his many readers and admirers were Thomas √† Kempis and John Fisher. Wolfgang Wackernagel and others have called Suso a \\"Minnesinger in prose and in the spiritual order\\" or a \\"Minnesinger of the Love of God\\" both for his use of images and themes from secular, courtly, romantic poetry and for his rich musical vocabulary. The mutual love of God and man which is his principal theme gives warmth and color to his style. He used the full and flexible Alemannic idiom with rare skill, and contributed much to the formation of good German prose, especially by giving new shades of meaning to words employed to describe inner sensations. Legacy and veneration In the world Suso was esteemed as a preacher, and was heard in the cities and towns of Swabia, Switzerland, Alsace, and the Netherlands. His apostolate, however, was not with the masses, but rather with individuals of all classes who were drawn to him by his singularly attractive personality, and to whom he became a personal director in the spiritual life. Suso was reported to have established among the Friends of God a society which he called the Brotherhood of the Eternal Wisdom. The so-called Rule of the Brotherhood of the Eternal Wisdom is but a free translation of a chapter of his Horologium Sapientiae, and did not make its appearance until the fifteenth century. Suso was beatified in 1831 by Pope Gregory XVI, who assigned 2 March as his feast day, celebrated within the Dominican Order. The Dominicans now celebrate his feast on 23 January, the feria, or \\"free\\" day, nearest the day of his death. The words of the Christmas song In dulci jubilo are attributed to Suso.

Elect (King) of Wag, \\"my courageous one\\"; died circa 1873, was N…ôgus√§ N√§g√§st (Emperor) of Ethiopia from 1868 to 1871. Emperor Tekle Giorgis II based his claim to the Imperial throne on a dual heritage: his mother, Princess Ayichesh Tedla, was a descendant of Emperor Iyasu I also known as Atse Adiyam Saggad or Emperor Iyasu the Great, who was the grandson of Emperor Fasilides of the Gondar-Lasta branch of the Solomonic dynasty; and via his father Wagshum Gebre Medhin, he was the heir to the old Zagwe throne and the rulers of Wag province. Tekle Giyorgis II's mother, Princess Ayichesh Tedla, was the daughter of the then-popular Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, of the Gondar Solomonic line, heir of Lasta, and one of twelve Amhara nobles who were executed during Tewodros II's rule. Dejazmach Tedla's death had caused a rebellion in Wollo. Nearly a century prior to the reign of Tekle Giyorgis II, Emperor Iyasu I's great-granddaughter, Princess Yeworqweha, had been married to Dejazmach Wand Bewossen, a renowned 18th-century warlord and ruling Zemene Mesafint prince who nearly established full control of the Ethiopian Empire and governed the provinces of Lasta and Begemeder until he died in battle in 1777. Their son and heir, Prince Ras Hailu Wand Bewossen, the successor of his father Wand Bewossen and sovereign of Lasta, of the Gondarine Solomonic bloodline, and father of the Gondar-Lasta House of the Solomonic dynasty, begot Princess Ayichesh's father, Dejazmach Tedla Hailu. Princess Ayichesh was also the paternal grandmother of Leul Ras Kassa Haile Darge. Leul Ras Kassa's father, Dejazmach Hailu, was her younger son and the half brother of Tekle Giyorgis II to whom she had given birth from a remarriage with an influential Lasta Ecclesiastic and nobleman, Dejazmach Megabe Woldekiros. Princess Ayichesh remarried after the execution of her husband, the then-King of Wag province, and father of Tekle Giyorgis II, Wagshum Gebremedhin. Tekle Giyorgis II's uncles, the sons of Dejazmach Tedla Hailu, played significant roles as members of the Gondar-Lasta Imperial House, brothers of his mother, whom he referred to as his brothers in surviving Imperial letters. They interceded as high Imperial officials and his generals during his rise to the throne and throughout his three-year-reign until his fall. Prince Ras Meshesha Tedla is known to have ruled Wag province, and Dejazmach Serawit Tedla, Dejazmach Yimam Tedla, Dejazmach Yesufe Tedla, Dejazmach Yimer Tedla were notable princes of the Gondar-Lasta Solomonic bloodline of Emperors Fasilides, Yohannes I, and Iyasu I. Dejazmach Yimer Tedla fathered Princess Menen Yimer, the maternal ancestress of Lij Tedla Melaku, a philosopher, author, and Abyssinian royalist. Emperor Tekle Giorgis II's principal rivals for sole rule were Menelik II (who was at the time king of Shewa), and Dejazmach Kassai (the future Emperor Yohannes IV). Tekle Giyorgis II married the sister of the latter, Dinqinesh Mercha. Despite that Tekle Giyorgis ruled Ethiopia for over three years, some lists of the Emperors of Ethiopia omit his name. In Ethiopia today, little is known of him, in contrast to his celebrated predecessor and successor, Yohannes IV. Life Gobeze, prior to his enthronement as Tekle Giyorgis II, enters the historical record when he raised the banner of rebellion in Lasta in 1864, six years after his father Wagshum Gebre Medhin had been executed by Emperor Tewodros II for accusations of supporting the rebel Agew Niguse.Sven Rubenson, King of Kings: Tewodros of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1966), pp. 75f, 80f Gobeze made his opening move even before the suicide of Emperor Tewodros II at the end of the British Expedition to Ethiopia. Towards the end of 1867, he began to march on Tewodros' fortress at Maqdala, but stopped about away then turned to fight Tiso Gobeze, who had revolted against Tewodros and had control of Begemder.Hormuzd Rassam, Narrative of the British Mission to Theodore of Abyssinia (London, 1869), vol. 2 pp. 251f Tiso was killed in battle at Qwila. In August 1868, Wagshum Gobeze was proclaimed Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II of Ethiopia at Soqota in his district of Wag and crowned at Debre Zebit, where his father had been executed. Because Abuna Salama, head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church died in October 1867, he was crowned by the Ethiopian Echege (·ä•·å®·åå), the principal head and Abun of all monasteries and churches of the land. Castle of Emperor Fasiledes at Gondar. Tekle Giyorgis II invested greatly on the restoration of Gondar city and its monuments. Donald Crummey comments on Gobeze's motivation for adopting \\"Tekle Giyorgis\\" as his regnal name \\"was unmistakable, and would have been clear to each peasant, let alone the learned. The previous ruler of that throne name had reigned off and on during the last two decades of the 18th century and had entered tradition with the nickname Fatsame Mangest, 'Ender of the Kingdom', or, very loosely, 'Last of the Line'\\".Crummey, \\"Imperial Legitimacy and the Creation of Neo-Solomonic Ideology in 19th-Century Ethiopia (L√©gitimit√© imp√©riale et cr√©ation d'une id√©ologie n√©o-salomonienne en √âthiopie au XIXe si√®cle)\\", Cahiers d'√âtudes Africaines, Cahier 109, M√©moires, Histoires, Identit√©s 2, 28 (1988), p. 23 Tekle Giyorgis II linked himself to the last independent Emperors of the Gondar line through his mother. In addition, Tekle Giyorgis sought the support of the Ethiopian Church, which had been alienated by Tewodros' behavior, by restoring to the churches of Gondar the lands his predecessor had taken away, gave them generous quantities of equipment, and arranged for a special burial and commemoration for Abuna Salama. Crummey quotes the words of the chronicler, \\"After Fasil there was no one who did for Gondar as Ase Takla Giyorgis did.\\" Diplomatic appeals to Tekle Giyorgis' rivals failed to gain their acknowledgment of his new rank, although none of them were secure enough in their own territories to confront him. In Gojjam, Tekle Giyorgis placed replaced the head of the local branch of the Solomonic dynasty, with his own favored princeling, Ras Adal, and tied Adal more closely to him by marrying him to his sister Woizero Laqech Gebre Medhin. In Shewa, Tekle Giyorgis arranged for his half brother Hailu Wolde Kiros to marry Woizero Tisseme Darge, daughter of Ras Darge Sahle Selassie and thus first cousin to the King of Shewa, Menelik. Tekle Giyorgis himself was married to Dinqinesh Mercha, sister of his Tigrean rival Dejazmatch Kassai. None of these ties of marriage would ultimately help solidify his hold on the throne.Tekle Tsadik Mekuria, \\"Atse Yohannes ina Ye Ityopia Andinet\\" (Amharic - Emperor Yohannes and Ethiopian Unity), (Addis Ababa, Berhanena Selam Press 1989) Dejazmach Kassai enlisted the services of John Kirkham to train his army in the weapons the British had left him, and in 1870, having gained access to the sea, an advantage none of the Dejazmach's rivals had successfully obtained a new Abuna. Meanwhile, Menelik busied himself in Shewa, having decided according to Harold Marcus to allow his two rivals fight it out, despite Tekle Giyorgis' threatening march through Wollo to the borders of Shewa.Harold G. Marcus, The Life and Times of Menelik II: Ethiopia 1844-1913, 1975 (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1995), pp. 43f Emperor Tekle Giyorgis knew he must stand alone against Kassai, but did not move until June 1871 when he crossed the Takazze River in Tigray. On 21 June the two armies met at Maikol'u to fight a day-long battle; although Dejazmach Kassai had the smaller force it was better disciplined, and as Kirkham later wrote, \\"with 12 guns and 800 musketmen the battle was won against an undisciplined lot of men with matchlock guns and spears.\\"Quoted in Marcus, Menelik II, p. 35 Tekle Giyorgis came off the worse and retreated to the Mareb River the next day. However, the Dejazmach took another route, outflanked his opponent, and forced him into a cul-de-sac at Adwa, where they fought the final battle on 11 July. \\"Leading a cavalry charge into the midst of Kasa's force, Tekla Giyorgis was wounded, had his mount killed under him, and was taken prisoner,\\" Marcus recounts. \\"His demoralized army collapsed and all his generals were captured with thousands of soldiers and camp followers.\\"Marcus, Menelik II, p. 35 On 21 January 1872, Kassai proclaimed himself Emperor of Ethiopia with the name of Yohannes IV. Tekle Giyorgis was blinded and imprisoned with his brother and mother at the Abba Garima Monastery near Adwa, where he died or was executed some years later.Marcus, Menelik II p. 35, claims that he was imprisoned on an amba or mountaintop.

It is a part-fact, part-fiction autobiography that charts the author's progress through Europe in a depoliticized 1930s, wearing nothing but rags and enduring hunger, contempt, fatigue and vice. The main character encounters bars, dives, flophouses, robbery, prison and expulsion in Spain, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Nazi Germany and Belgium. The novel is structured around a series of homosexual love affairs and male prostitution between the author/anti-hero and various criminals, con artists, pimps, and a detective. A common theme is the inversion of ideals: betrayal is the ultimate form of devotion, petty delinquency is brazen heroism, and confinement is freedom. Under the inspiration of Being and Nothingness, the novel is dedicated to Jean-Paul Sartre and \\"Castor\\", i.e. Simone de Beauvoir. Sartre wrote his essay \\"Saint Genet\\", influenced by this work, in 1952. Genet appropriates Christian language and concepts to pursue an alternative form of \\"sainthood\\" with its own trinity of \\"virtues\\" ‚Äì homosexuality, theft, and betrayal.

He is the lead guitarist and co-founder of the alternative rock band Coldplay. Early life Jonathan Mark Buckland was born on 11 September 1977 in Islington, London. He lived there until the age of four, when his family moved to Pantymwyn in Flintshire, Wales. Buckland started playing the guitar at the age of eleven, inspired by The Stone Roses, Ride, George Harrison, U2, and My Bloody Valentine, and also encouraged by his older brother Tim. He was a student at Ysgol y Waun and Alun School, the latter located in the Welsh town of Mold. He went on to study astronomy and mathematics at University College London, where he met future bandmates Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, and Will Champion, as well as their future manager Phil Harvey, and formed Coldplay. Buckland is noted for his sparse arrangements and use of slide. His stylistic chiming and ringing sound have led to some comparisons with the playing of U2's The Edge. Solo work Buckland has guest starred on Ian McCulloch's solo album Slideling and made a cameo appearance with bandmate Chris Martin in the film Shaun of the Dead. Guitar style Buckland performing during Coldplay's 2008 Viva la Vida Tour. Buckland largely uses the Telecaster Thinline 72' as his main electric guitar, as seen mainly in the albums Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, X&Y;, and Mylo Xyloto. Buckland uses the Fender Stratocaster for his secondary guitar, but he has made clear that the Telecaster series is his favorite. Buckland's guitar style is mainly based on U2's The Edge's guitar sound, which consists mainly of ringing, conservative notation, various amps and distorters, and musical rawness. Buckland's guitar-playing style has in turn inspired many other bands to adopt a similar technique, such as The Fray's Joe King, The Killers' David Keuning, and Pat Monahan from Train on some songs. The Edge himself stated in an interview at Glastonbury: \\"[Jonny Buckland] is an inspiration to guitar players everywhere, and I am proud to know that I was one of his main influences. (laughs) It makes me feel like a real rock star.\\" Personal life Buckland is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur. Buckland was a vegetarian for some time, but eventually gave up after spending some time in Japan and, after not being able to communicate that he didn't eat meat, was served beef and found that he really liked it. Buckland's brother Tim and his band The Domino State supported Coldplay at the O2 in December 2008. Buckland married Chloe Evans in 2009, and the pair have a daughter, Violet, born in May, 2007 and a son, Jonah, born in November, 2011.

He was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870. Sturgis was born in Baltimore County, Maryland. His parents were Russell Sturgis, a New York shipping merchant living temporarily in Baltimore, and Margaret Dawes (Appleton) Sturgis. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Sturgis (1755-1821), who served as a Private in Captain Micah Hamlin's Company, Colonel Simeon Cary's Regiment (1776) and was the younger brother of the merchant Russell Sturgis (1750-1826), and Elizabeth (Jackson) Sturgis (1768-1844)). Sturgis is, therefore, a second cousin to the merchant and banker Russell Sturgis (1805‚Äì1887). Educated in the public schools of New York City, Sturgis was graduated from the Free Academy in New York (now the College of the City of New York) in 1856, and later studied architecture under Leopold Eidlitz. For about a year and a half he also studied in Munich. In 1862 he returned to the United States. He was associated with Peter Bonnett Wight from 1863 to 1868 and then practiced alone until 1880. in 1863 Sturgis together with the painter John William Hill, art critic Clarence Cook, and geologist and art critic Clarence King helped to found the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art which published a journal The New Path. The articles written by Sturgis provided an early glimpse of his critical interest in art and architecture, made amply clear in his later writings. On May 26, 1864, he married Sarah Maria Barney, daughter of Danford N. Barney of New York City. Her father served as president of Wells Fargo & Company from 1853 to 1866. Russell and Sarah Sturgis were the parents of four sons and three daughters, of whom one son died in infancy.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. IX, p. 331.Noel M. Loomis, Wells Fargo, p. 43. New York: Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1968. Career as architect Between 1865 and 1880 he designed Battell Chapel and Lawrance, Farnham and Durfee Halls at Yale; the Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital, New York City; the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of Albany; and churches, commercial buildings, and residences in New York City, Albany, Aurora, Tarrytown and Watertown, New York; New Haven, Farmington and Litchfield, Connecticut; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon the reorganization of the American Institute of Architects in 1868, Sturgis was elected secretary, while Richard Upjohn was president and R.G. Hatfield treasurer. Also in 1868, Sturgis published his Manual of the Jarves Collection of Early American Pictures in the Yale School of Fine Arts. When the Metropolitan Museum of Art was established in 1870, Sturgis was a trustee and a member of the executive committee until 1876, also serving as corresponding secretary from 1870 to 1873.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, op. cit. He designed the First Baptist Church at Tarrytown, New York about 1875. During the Exposition Universelle of 1878, Sturgis spent some months in France, and upon his return accepted the chair of architecture and the arts of design at the College of the City of New York. He was the co-author, with Charles Eliot Norton, of a Catalogue of Ancient and Modern Engravings, Woodcuts and Illustrated Books, Parts of the Collections of C.E. Norton and R. Sturgis (1879). On account of ill health he left his professorship and retired from business in 1880 and went to Europe. Residing chiefly in Paris and Florence, he remained abroad until 1884. For a short time after his return he was secretary of the New York Municipal Civil Service Board, but resigned out of dislike for the political complications involved in the position.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. IX, p. 330. He trained architect Arthur Bates Jennings. On December 30, 1886, Sturgis and his eldest son, Appleton, represented the family at the funeral of his wife's uncle, Ashbel H. Barney, retired president (1869‚Äì70) of Wells Fargo & Company.\\"Ashbel H. Barney Buried\\", The New York Times, December 31, 1886. Author and critic Sturgis was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and of the National Academy of Design; an honorary fellow of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences; a fellow in perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; life member of the American Numismatic and Archaeological Society; honorary member of the National Society of Mural Painters; and a member of the Architectural League of New York (president in 1889-93), the Grolier Club, the Municipal Art Society, Archaeological Institute of America, National Sculpture Society, the Japan Society, the Fine Arts Federation of New York (first president, 1895‚Äì97); member of the University, Century and Players clubs of New York City; and a member of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in London. He lectured on art at Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Peabody Institute of Baltimore and the Art Institute of Chicago; his Scammon Lectures of 1904-05 in Chicago were published under the title The Interdependence of the Arts of Design (1905). Sturgis received the honorary degrees of MA from Yale in 1870 and PhD from the College of the City of New York in 1893. A disciple of John Ruskin, Sturgis intensely disliked the trend toward neoclassic eclecticism at the end of the 19th century and hailed Louis H. Sullivan's work as the most significant that was being done in America. A leading authority on the history of architecture and art, Sturgis was editor for decorative art and medieval archaeology of the Century Dictionary, editor of architecture and fine art for Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia (1893‚Äì95); and compiler (for the American Library Association) of the Annotated Bibliography of Fine Art (1897). In January 1897 he became editor of The Field of Art, a department of Scribner's Magazine, which he continued until his death. He is best known as a writer on art and architecture, making many contributions to dictionaries, encyclopedias and periodicals. He was editor- in-chief of A Dictionary of Architecture and Building (3 vols, 1901‚Äì1902). Sturgis edited and revised the English version of Wilhelm Luebke's Outlines of the History of Art (2 vols, 1904), and was editor on fine arts for the Encyclopedia Americana (1904‚Äì05). He wrote: * European Architecture: A Historical Study (1896). * The Etchings of Piranesi (1900). * How to Judge Architecture (1903). * The Appreciation of Sculpture (1904). * The Appreciation of Pictures (1905). * A Study of the Artist's Way of Working in the Various Handicrafts and Arts of Design (2 vols, 1905). * The Interdependence of the Arts of Design (1905). * Ruskin on Architecture (1906). * History of Architecture (4 vols., 1906‚Äì1915; Vols.

One of the country's most important domestic architects of his time, he is noted mainly for his Arts and Crafts- influenced houses. Chapman-Taylor was also a skilled craftsman, builder, furniture designer and photographer, and had a keen interest in astrology.  Early days  James Walter Chapman-Taylor was born in London in 1878 to Theodore Chapman-Taylor and his wife, Ada Thomas. In 1879 Theodore migrated to New Zealand where he purchased land a few miles south of Stratford in the Taranaki region. Ada, James and a younger brother joined him in June 1880, with the family subsequently becoming dairy farmers.  Career choices  By his teenage years Chapman-Taylor had decided against farming as a career and became an apprentice to a local builder. After completing his apprenticeship, he constructed his first building, a single- storied timber house for his parents on their Stratford property. On 12 April 1900 he married Mary Gibson at Stratford and in 1903 he enrolled himself in an architecture and design course with the International Correspondence Schools of Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1904 he moved to Wellington after working on the construction of the Taihape railway station. From around 1907 he used the surname Chapman- Taylor.  Travel  In 1909 Chapman-Taylor travelled to England to study and meet first hand the works of C.F.A. Voysey, Baille Scott, and Parker and Unwin whose names were famous in the field of domestic architecture. Upon his return to New Zealand Chapman-Taylor was determined to follow the basic principles on which good domestic architecture had been developed ‚Äì designing and building houses with skill and sensitivity. He was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement's interpretation of rural English cottage construction and style and returned to New Zealand to integrate this into New Zealand materials and settings.  Mature phase  As a mature style emerged, Chapman-Taylor's designs became more cohesive. Concrete was used as the preferred building material, finishing the outside walls in a roughcast plaster. Following in the footsteps and adhering to principles first exposed by John Ruskin and William Morris the consistency in his work became a result of his loyalty to their creed. Chapman-Taylor showed confidence to express his individuality and sense of freedom to explore and experiment. Chapman-Taylor's houses were designed through to the smallest detail. Many of his surviving buildings include pieces of his furniture designs. Whare Ra, built 1915, Havelock North, New Zealand. Exteriors were characterised by high roofs with Marseille tiles, plain roughcast walls and small paned windows. The extensive use of hand shaped timbers in the interiors of the houses further defined his work. Chapman- Taylor ºs houses revealed his distinctive touch and his interpretation of the English cottage style that the Arts and Crafts Movement promoted. Chapman- Taylor designed many houses and they can be found throughout New Zealand. Several examples can be found in Taranaki, including the building fondly known as Wilkie's Castle, situated at Wai-iti in North Taranaki. In Havelock North he designed the Whare Ra building for the Stella Matutina order. Chapman- Taylor died on 28 October 1958 at the age of 80 from a sudden illness. \\"All Chapman-Taylor‚Äôs houses are economical in their use of space, intimate in detailing, and extremely satisfying to live in.\\" ‚ÄîJ.

Dinitrophenylhydrazine is a red to orange solid. It is a substituted hydrazine, and is often used to qualitatively test for carbonyl groups associated with aldehydes and ketones. The hydrazone derivatives can also be used as evidence toward the identity of the original compound. The melting point of the derivative is often used, with reference to a database of values, to determine the identity of a specific carbonyl compound. It is relatively sensitive to shock and friction; it is a shock explosive so care must be taken with its use. To reduce its explosive hazard, it is usually supplied wet. Guaranteed known to be used for hydrazone formation in the synthesis of Sivifene. Synthesis 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine is commercially available usually as a wet powder. It can be prepared by the reaction of hydrazine sulfate with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene: :300px Brady's reagent is prepared by dissolving 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in a solution containing methanol and some concentrated sulfuric acid. The medium should be slightly acidic. Brady's test 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine can be used to qualitatively detect the carbonyl functionality of a ketone or aldehyde functional group. A positive test is signalled by the formation of brick red precipitate (known as a dinitrophenylhydrazone). If the carbonyl compound is aromatic, then the precipitate will be red; if aliphatic, then the precipitate will have a more yellow color.http://wiki.colby.edu/download/attachments/110920618/Experiment+%232.pdf?version=1&modificationDate;=1265312071267 The reaction between 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and a generic ketone to form a hydrazone :RR'C=O \\\\+ C6H3(NO2)2NHNH2 ‚Üí C6H3(NO2)2NHN=CRR' \\\\+ H2O This reaction is, overall, a condensation reaction as two molecules joining together with loss of water. Mechanistically, it is an example of addition- elimination reaction: nucleophilic addition of the -NH2 group to the C=O carbonyl group, followed by the elimination of a H2O molecule:Adapted from Chemistry in Context, 4th Edition, 2000, Graham Hill and John Holman :Reaction mechanism When 3-heptanone is added to a solution of 2,4-DNPH and heated, an orange-red precipitate forms. Crystals of different hydrazones have characteristic melting and boiling points, allowing the identity of a substance to be determined in a method known as derivatization. In particular, the use of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine was developed by Brady and Elsmie. Modern spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques have superseded these techniques. Dinitrophenylhydrazine does not react with other carbonyl- containing functional groups such as carboxylic acids, amides, and esters, for which there is resonance-associated stability as a lone-pair of electrons interacts with the p orbital of the carbonyl carbon resulting in increased delocalization in the molecule. This stability would be lost by addition of a reagent to the carbonyl group. Hence, these compounds are more resistant to addition reactions. Also, with carboxylic acids, there is the effect of the compound acting as a base, leaving the resulting carboxylate negatively charged and hence no longer vulnerable to nucleophilic attack.

Gas leaks can be hazardous to health and the environment. Even a small leak into a building or other confined space may gradually build up an explosive or lethal concentration of gas. Leaks of natural gas and refrigerant gas into the atmosphere are especially harmful due to their global warming potential and ozone depletion potential. Leaks of gases associated with industrial operations and equipment are also generally known as fugitive emissions. Natural gas leaks from fossil fuel extraction and use are known as fugitive gas emissions. Such unintended leaks should not be confused with similar intentional types of gas release, such as: * gas venting emissions which are controlled releases, and often practised as a part of routine operations, or * \\"emergency pressure releases\\" which are intended to prevent equipment damage and safeguard life. Gas leaks should also not be confused with \\"gas seepage\\" from the earth or oceans - either natural or due to human activity. Fire and explosion safety Pure natural gas is colorless and odorless, and is composed primarily of methane. Unpleasant scents in the form of traces of mercaptans are usually added, to assist in identifying leaks. This odor may be perceived as rotting eggs, or a faintly unpleasant skunk smell. Persons detecting the odor must evacuate the area and abstain from using open flames or operating electrical equipment, to reduce the risk of fire and explosion. As a result of the Pipeline Safety Improvement ActText of H.R. 3609 (107th): Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) - GovTrack.us of 2002 passed in the United States, federal safety standards require companies providing natural gas to conduct safety inspections for gas leaks in homes and other buildings receiving natural gas. The gas company is required to inspect gas meters and inside gas piping from the point of entry into the building to the outlet side of the gas meter for gas leaks. This may require entry into private homes by the natural gas companies to check for hazardous conditions. Harm to vegetation Gas leaks can damage or kill plants. In addition to leaks from natural gas pipes, methane and other gases migrating from landfill garbage disposal sites can also cause chlorosis and necrosis in grass, weeds, or trees. In some cases, leaking gas may migrate as far as from the source of the leak to an affected tree. Harm to animals Methane is an asphyxiant gas which can reduce the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air. Small animals and birds are also more sensitive to toxic gas like carbon monoxide that are sometimes present with natural gas. The expression \\"canary in a coal mine\\" derives from the historical practice of using a canary as an animal sentinel to detect dangerously high concentrations of naturally occurring coal gas. Greenhouse gas emissions Methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is up to 120 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide. Thus, the release of unburned natural gas produces much stronger effects than the carbon dioxide that would have been released if the gas had been burned as intended. Leak grades In the United States, most state and federal agencies have adopted the Gas Piping and Technology Committee (GPTC) standards for grading natural gas leaks. A Grade 1 leak is a leak that represents an existing or probable hazard to persons or property, and requires immediate repair or continuous action until the conditions are no longer hazardous. Examples of a Grade 1 leak are: * Any leak which, in the judgment of operating personnel at the scene, is regarded as an immediate hazard. * Escaping gas that has ignited. * Any indication of gas which has migrated into or under a building, or into a tunnel. * Any reading at the outside wall of a building, or where gas would likely migrate to an outside wall of a building. * Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater, in a confined space. * Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater in small substructures (other than gas associated sub structures) from which gas would likely migrate to the outside wall of a building. * Any leak that can be seen, heard, or felt, and which is in a location that may endanger the general public or property. A Grade 2 leak is a leak that is recognized as being non-hazardous at the time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future hazard. Examples of a Grade 2 Leak are: * Leaks Requiring Action Ahead of Ground Freezing or Other Adverse Changes in Venting Conditions. Any leak which, under frozen or other adverse soil conditions, would likely migrate to the outside wall of a building. * Leaks requiring action within six months * Any reading of 40% LEL, or greater, under a sidewalk in a wall-to-wall paved area that does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak. * Any reading of 100% LEL, or greater, under a street in a wall-to- wall paved area that has significant gas migration and does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak. * Any reading less than 80% LEL in small substructures (other than gas associated substructures) from which gas would likely migrate creating a probable future hazard. * Any reading between 20% LEL and 80% LEL in a confined space. * Any reading on a pipeline operating at 30 percent specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) or greater, in a class 3 or 4 location, which does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak. * Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater, in gas associated sub-structures. * Any leak which, in the judgment of operating personnel at the scene, is of sufficient magnitude to justify scheduled repair. A Grade 3 leak is non-hazardous at the time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous. Examples of a Grade 3 Leak are: * Any reading of less than 80% LEL in small gas associated substructures. * Any reading under a street in areas without wall-to-wall paving where it is unlikely the gas could migrate to the out-side wall of a building. * Any reading of less than 20% LEL in a confined space. Studies In 2012, Boston University professor Nathan Phillips and his students drove along all of Boston roads with a gas sensor, identifying 3300 leaks. The Conservation Law Foundation produced a map showing around 4000 leaks reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. In July 2014, the Environmental Defense Fund released an interactive online map based on gas sensors attached to three mapping cars which already were being driven along Boston streets to update Google Earth Street View. This survey differed from the previous studies in that an estimate of leak severity was produced, rather than just leak detection. This map should help the gas utility to prioritize leak repairs, as well as raising public awareness of the problem. In 2017, Rhode Island released an estimated 15.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, about a third of which comes from leaks in natural gas pipes. This figure, published in 2019, was calculated based on an assumed leakage rate of 2.7% (as that is the rate of leakage in the nearby city of Boston). The study's authors estimated that fixing the leaks would incur an annual cost of $1.6 billion to $4 billion. Regulation =Massachusetts= Legislation passed in 2014Acts of 2014, Chapter 149: AN ACT RELATIVE TO NATURAL GAS LEAKS requires gas suppliers to make greater efforts to control some of the 20,000 documented leaks in the US state of Massachusetts. The new law requires grade 1 and 2 leaks to be repaired if the street above a gas pipe is dug up, and requires priority be given to leaks near schools. It provides a mechanism for increased revenue from ratepayers (up to 1.5% without further approval) to cover the cost of repairs and replacement of leak-prone materials (like cast iron and non-cathodically protected steel) on an accelerated basis. The law sets a target of 20 years for replacement of pipes made from leak-prone materials if feasible given the revenue cap; , Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (formerly named \\"Bay State Gas\\"), Berkshire Gas, Liberty Utilities, National Grid, and Unitil say they will meet this target, but NSTAR says it will take 25 years to complete.Gas System Enhancement Plan Orders Leaks, statistics on leak-prone materials, and financial statements are reported annually to the Department of Public Utilities, which also has responsibility for rate- setting. Additional proposals not included in the law would have required grade 3 leaks to be repaired during road construction, and priority for leaks which are killing trees or which were near hospitals or churches. An attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation stated that the leaks were worth $38.8 million in lost natural gas, which also contributes 4% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions. A federal study prompted by US Senator Edward J. Markey concluded that Massachusetts consumers paid approximately $1.5 billion from 2000‚Äì2011 for gas which leaked and benefited no one. Markey has also backed legislation that would implement similar requirements at the national level, along with financing provisions for repairs. History Catastrophic gas leaks, such as the Bhopal disaster are well-recognized as problems, but the more-subtle effects of chronic low-level leaks have been slower to gain recognition. Other contexts In work with dangerous gases (such as in a lab or industrial setting), a gas leak may require hazmat emergency response, especially if the leaked material is flammable, explosive, corrosive, or toxic.

In household accidents, the principal explosive gases are those used for heating or cooking purposes such as natural gas, methane, propane, butane. In industrial explosions many other gases, like hydrogen, as well as evaporated (gaseous) gasoline (American English)/petrol (British English) or ethanol play an important role. Industrial gas explosions can be prevented with the use of intrinsic safety barriers to prevent ignition. Lower and upper explosive limits Whether a mixture of air and gas is combustible depends on the air- to-fuel ratio. For each fuel, ignition occurs only within a certain range of concentration, known as the upper and lower flammability limits. For example, for methane and gasoline vapor, this range is 5-15% and 1.4-7.6% gas to air, respectively. An explosion can only occur when fuel concentration is within these limits.

The original mower engines are retained, but blades are removed for safety. The sport attracts all ages, and is usually entered into in a spirit of fun rather than extreme competitiveness, though many participants do take it seriously. In the United Kingdom The earliest record of an organised race involving lawnmowers in the United Kingdom is in 1968 when the Ashton on Mersey Cricket Club organised a sporting event by the name \\"Lawn Mower Grand Prix\\" for the benefit fund of Lancashire cricketer Ken Higgs. The event consisted of a dash over 880 yards and was sponsored by Esso and Player's No. 6 cigarettes. The event was won by Daily Mirror journalist Roy Allett and Jimmy Savile came third. Savile reportedly prayed before competing and remarked that he has never driven a lawn mower before, \\"How can you mow in a council flat?\\"Ernest Dewhurst, 'Cutting a Dash in the Mowing Grand Prix', The Guardian, 7 October 1968, p. 5 The British Lawn Mower Racing Association (BLMRA) was formed in 1973 by Rally co-driver Jim Gavin. Jim and a bunch of fellow sporting enthusiasts were bemoaning the prohibitive costs of getting involved in any kind of motor sport whilst enjoying a pint at The Cricketers Arms in Wisborough Green, West Sussex. They looked across the village green and noticed the groundsman mowing the cricket pitch. Realising that everyone had a lawn mower in their garden shed they asked themselves: Why not race them? A local venue was found and 80 mowers turned up for that first meeting. There are now several Lawn Mower Racing clubs in the UK with slightly differing construction rules but a similar ethos that events should be professionally run and costs kept to a minimum. Racing tends to take place in bare fields, with the track marked in a temporary fashion typically using bales or plastic blocks. The racing format is generally either sprint or endurance, although fun races take various formats including relay and last man standing. There are various championships held throughout the racing season. Initially mowers were self propelled models such as the Suffolk Punch which were re-geared and required the operator to run behind. These quickly gave way to larger cylinder mowers with towed seats which are now referred to as Group 2. Groups 3 and 4 followed in time, these are wheel driven ride-on mowers, Group 3 being an open engined garden rider (typically the Westwood Lawnbug) and Group 4 being a lawn tractor. All mowers must have their blades removed, retain specified original components such as their chassis, bonnet and drive configuration. Engine regulations vary between clubs, but these are standard lawn mower type engines with little or no modification or tuning. Given the right track conditions mowers can reach speeds of up to 50mph although track design serves to limit this and ensure that driver skill remains an important element of the sport. One of the best known events is the annual BLMRA 12 hour endurance race which has been held near Wisborough Green since 1978. The first such event was won by Sir Stirling Moss, Derek Bell and Tony Hazlewood (designer and builder of the Westwood Lawnbug). Actor Oliver Reed also participated. The event attracts participants from other British clubs and from all over the world, including competitors from France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Finland and the United States. 2018 saw the win taken by an overseas entrant for the first time in the event's history when it was won by a team from Luxembourg. The current distance record over the 12 hours sits at 354.5 miles. In the United States Young competitors, such as this 10-year-old boy, race in less powerful mowers. The Twelve Mile 500 is a lawn mower race held in the small town of Twelve Mile, Indiana, organized by the Twelve Mile Lions Club and occurring annually on Independence Day. The tradition began in 1963 as a race for factory-built mowers with their mowing decks removed but in 1996 split into a two-race event with one for four-cycle Briggs lawn mowers and another for modified mowers. The race adopted the \\"Grand Prix\\" style in 1970 and has been held in Plank Hill Park ever since. The race structure has once again changed with the addition of another race. The 2010 race included a superstock race in addition to the briggs and modified races. The Twelve Mile 500 consists of a 15-mile, 60-lap course run on a quarter-mile track in the park, with a maximum of 33 entrants per race. Each participating team consists of a driver, a two-person pit crew and a lap judge, and must meet a speed of approximately 30 mph to qualify just like in NASCAR racing. The sport was taken to the United States by the makers of a petrol stabiliser called Sta-bil, who had visited the UK and witnessed a race meeting. It has since grown to have multiple national organizations, including the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association and the American Racing Mower Association. Lawnmower racing should not be confused with go-karting, wherein lawn mower engines have often been used, especially amongst the amateur participants in go-karting. Lawn mower racing is based firmly around the use of both engines and chassis from regular model mowers. Also, where go-karts are exclusively raced on relatively flat surfaces, lawn mowers can be raced off-road. =In North Carolina= Since the summer of 1984, the North Wilkesporo Rotary Club has played host to lawnmower racing at its Wilkes County Agricultural Fairground facility. Sanctioned by the Allegheny Mower Racing Association,http://www.alleghanymowerracingassociation.com/ oval track racing on the dirt is reminiscent of the beginnings of stock car racing at the North Wilkesboro Speedway and the birth of NASCAR. Crowds have grown from a few hundred to gatherings of thousands on several Saturday nights from June through September. The Wilkes County fairground site is said by many participants to be the premier facility within the AMRA circus. Proceeds from the club's lawnmower racing events are distributed throughout the year to the many activities supported by the North Wilkesboro Rotary Club. The club contributes to most local United Way agencies, provides annual scholarships to local high school students, holds a Christmas Party for the county's foster children, while also supporting worldwide relief efforts of Rotary International. =In Missouri= Starting in the spring of 2013 lawn mower racing has been held every other Saturday in Patton, Missouri. Racers from all over Southeast Missouri and parts of Arkansas come to the Patton Saddle Club to race their racing machines. The races are held due to a merging of the Southeast Missouri Lawn Mower Racing Association (SMLMRA for short) and the Patton Lions Club. Hundreds of fans come to watch the races at only five dollars a car load. All proceeds are taken care of by the Lions Club. Racers vary in age from six to seventy in five separate classes. Kids (6‚Äì12 years old) run in the Youth Class. Their mowers are limited to a stock lawn mower engine with a governor set to no more than 3650 rpm and a 10:1 gear ratio. Adults classes are split by running time trials. Time trials are set up like a qualifying run in NASCAR. A-Class is the mowers that run the fastest times. D-Class is the mowers that run the slowest during time trials. B and C-Class are in between the other two. Mowers are unlimited to engine sizes; however, safety is a big role in the rules. All racers are expected to wear full-face helmets, gloves, boots, a long-sleeve racing shirt, and a neck restraint. Mowers must be equipped with back bumpers (no front bumpers), leg protectors where the feet would be on the mower, a kill switch to turn off the engine in case of an accident, working brakes, cupholders, and a plate on the right-hand side of the hood to keep starters from blowing out of the sides if an engine were to blow up. The first female youth lawn mower racer came from Missouri. Her name was Gabby. She raced her first race Fall of 2006 and at the age of 6. Many female racers have come after her. She began racing to spend time with her father then began to love the sport herself. =In New Mexico= Another popular destination for this form of Motorsport is New Mexico. Contrary to other regions, there are strict rules concerning the class of lawnmower as well as the manner in which they are operated. Starting in January 1983, the lawnmowers used were primarily John Deere, however, due to the dangerous horsepower produced by these engines, this class of lawnmower was no longer found acceptable to race. In 2012, Craftsmen was declared the most used lawnmower brand in New Mexico. Craftsmen had reported 290 racers using this brand in the 127 races in New Mexico that year. Later in 2015 new rules were imposed lied on the lawn mower racing system In New Mexico preventing lawn mower racing to occur in populated locations. In Australia Australia's first mower race was dreamt up in a small, country pub in Harrietville, Victoria in 1978. Five men challenged each other to a race around the local hills of the area after an alcohol-related argument. They chugged up the steep slopes belching smoke from their unmodified Briggs & Strattons (popular lawnmower brands), rounded a nominated gum tree, then flew down in \\"Angel Gear\\" - Australian outback slang for neutral - to the finish line. \\"Half the town's 100 people, 300 sheep and 150 dogs were there,\\" according to Brian Ross, six-time president of the Australian Ride-On Lawn Mower Racing Association (AROLMRA) References External links * Category:Auto racing by type Category:Tool racing ","title":"Lawn mower racing"},{"id":"1919643","text":":For other uses, see Sunday Best Sunday's Best was an American emo band formed in 1997.

Early life and education  Bill was born in Winterthur. After an apprenticeship as a silversmith during 1924‚Äì1927, Bill took up studies at the Bauhaus in Dessau under many teachers including Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee and Oskar Schlemmer from 1927 to 1929, after which he moved to Zurich.  Work  Building Ulm HfG, photography by Hans G. Conrad. Junghans clock, design by Max Bill Pavillon-Skulptur (1983), Z√ºrich, by Max Bill = Art and design = After working on graphic designs for the few modern buildings being constructed, he built his first work, his own house and studio (1932‚Äì3) in Zurich-H√∂ngg.Max Bill Museum of Modern Art, New York. From 1937 onwards he was a prime mover behind the Allianz group of Swiss artists.Leonardo biography Bill is widely considered the single most decisive influence on Swiss graphic design beginning in the 1950s with his theoretical writing and progressive work.Hollis, R., Swiss Graphic Design, 1920-1965, (2006), New Haven: Yale University Press. His connection to the days of the Modern Movement gave him special authority. As an industrial designer, his work is characterized by a clarity of design and precise proportions.Krippendorf, K., The Semantic Turn, (2005), New York: CRC Press. Examples are the elegant clocks and watches designed for Junghans, a long-term client. Among Bill's most notable product designs is the \\"Ulmer Hocker\\" of 1954, a stool that can also be used as a shelf element, a speaker's desk, a tablet or a side table. Although the stool was a creation of Bill and Ulm school designer Hans Gugelot, it is often called \\"Bill Hocker\\" because the first sketch on a cocktail napkin was Bill's work. As a designer and artist, Bill sought to create forms which visually represent the New Physics of the early 20th century. He sought to create objects so that the new science of form could be understood by the senses: that is as a concrete art. Thus Bill is not a rationalist ‚Äì as is typically thought ‚Äì but rather a phenomenologist. One who understands embodiment as the ultimate expression of a concrete art. In this way he is not so much extending as re-interpreting Bauhaus theory. Yet curiously Bill's critical interpreters have not really grasped this fundamental issue. He made spare geometric paintings and spherical sculptures, some based on the M√∂bius strip, in stone, wood, metal and plaster.Work in Baltimore sculpture gardenRoberta Smith (December 14, 1994), Max Bill, 85, Painter, Sculptor And Architect in Austere Style New York Times. His architectural work included an office building in Germany, a radio studio in Zurich, and a bridge in eastern Switzerland.Max Bill, 85; Controversial Swiss : Artist, Sculptor and Writer Los Angeles Times, December 14, 1994. He continued to produce architectural designs, such as those for a museum of contemporary art (1981) in Florence and for the Bauhaus Archive (1987) in Berlin. In 1982 he also entered a competition for an addition to the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, built to a design by Mies van der Rohe. Pavillon-Skulptur (1979‚Äì83), a large granite sculpture, was installed adjacent to the Bahnhofstrasse, Z√ºrich in 1983. As is often the case with modern art in public places, the installation generated some controversy. Endlose Treppe (1991), a sculpture made of North American granite, was designed for the philosopher Ernst Bloch. In 1982 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists. = Teaching = In 1944, Bill became a professor at the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich. In 1953, alongside Inge Aicher-Scholl and Otl Aicher, he founded the Ulm School of Design (German: Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung - HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school initially created in the tradition of the Bauhaus and which later developed a new design education approach integrating art and science. The school was notable for its inclusion of semiotics as a field of study. The school closed in 1968. Faculty and students included Tom√°s Maldonado, Otl Aicher, Josef Albers, Johannes Itten, John Lottes, Walter Zeischegg, and Peter Seitz. Bill was a professor at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg and chair of Environmental Design from 1967 to 1974. In 1973 he became an associate member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Science, Literature and Fine Art in Brussels. In 1976 he became a member of the Berlin Academy of Arts. In addition to his teaching, Bill wrote and lectured extensively on art, architecture and design, appearing at symposiums and design conferences around the world. In particular, he wrote books about Le Corbusier, Kandinsky, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and artistic theory.  Exhibitions  Bill executed many public sculptures in Europe and exhibited extensively in galleries and museums, including a retrospective at the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich in 1968‚Äì69. He had his first exhibition in the United States at the Staempfli Gallery in New York City in 1963 and was the subject of retrospectives at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1974, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City in 1988. He participated in documentas I (1955), II (1959), and III (1964). In 1993, he received the Praemium Imperiale for sculpture, awarded by the Emperor of Japan. Bill is credited with having been \\"the spark that lighted the fuse of Brazil's artistic revolution\\" and the country's \\"movement toward concrete art\\"Pepe Carmel (January 20, 1995), Gathering Up the Rich Strands of the Brazilian Avant-Garde New York Times. with his 1951 retrospective at the S√£o Paulo Museum of Modern Art. He strongly influenced Brazilian artists like Franz Weissmann.Ken Johnson (July 25, 2005), Franz Weissmann, Leading Brazilian Sculptor, Dies at 93 New York Times.  Private life  After a liaison with Nusch √âluard, Bill married the cellist and photographer Binia Mathilde Spoerri in January 1931.Thomas, A., max bill und seine zeit, vol. 1: mit subversivem glanz, (2008), Z√ºrich: Scheidegger & Spiess, p. 255. (marriage) She died in 1988. From 1974 he was living together with art historian Angela Thomas; they married in 1991. Bill was also involved in politics. He was elected to the Zurich municipal council in 1961. From 1967 to 1971, he served as a member of the Swiss National Council. Bill died en route to a hospital after collapsing from a heart attack at Berlin Tegel Airport. He was 85 and lived in Zumikon, a Z√ºrich suburb. In 1996, Jakob Bill, the son of Max, founded the Swiss Max Bill Foundation (max, binia + jakob bill stiftung\\"max, binia + jakob bill stiftung\\" website) and implemented the idea of his father. The purpose of the foundation is to collect and take care of the works in possession of the Bill family, as well as the promotion of scientific research.

The trunkline runs through residential areas south of St. Joseph and through the central business districts of the twin cities. Further north, M-63 runs along the Lake Michigan shoreline. All of M-63's routing was part of US 33 before that highway's truncation south of Niles in 1986. A previous designation of M-63 was used farther north in Lake and Osceola counties from 1919 until 1961. Since the current designation was created, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has worked on reconfiguring parts of the roadway in the early part of the 21st century. The bridge M-63 uses to cross the St. Joseph River, the Blossomland Bridge, has been identified as an historic structure using a rare design. The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s. Route description M-63 begins at the intersection of Niles, Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in Royalton Township. M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection. M-63 follows Miners Road west and then Niles Road northwest of the junction, parallel to the St. Joseph River through residential areas on the outskirts of the twin cities. The highway meets Interstate 94 (I-94) at the latter's exit 27 and continues through St. Joseph Township to the city of St. Joseph. In the city, after Washington Avenue, Niles Road becomes Niles Avenue and turns north. As part of its maintenance duties, the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any day of a year. The roadway segment along Niles Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263 vehicles. M-63 at the junction with Blue Star Highway north of Hagar Shores At Main Street, Niles Avenue ends, and M-63 joins Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on Main Street into and through the downtown business district. The two highways continue together running concurrently to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a one-way pair running east to carry BL I-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into Benton Harbor, Michigan where it follows the Lake Michigan shoreline along a short expressway segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near the headquarters of the Whirlpool Corporation. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the shoreline to the community of Lake Michigan Beach. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with I-196/US 31\\\\. The shoreline roadway continues northeast as A-2 (Blue Star Highway) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US 31. This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855 vehicles. Various highways in the United States are listed as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. M-63 has been listed as a part of the NHS from its southern terminus to the northern junction with BL I-94 in St. Joseph. As the closest state highway to Lake Michigan in the area, M-63 from the southern junction with BL I-94 to its northern terminus has been used as a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour, a tourist route that circles Lake Michigan. History =Previous designation= M-63 originally ran from Peacock in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 (later US 131) in Osceola County on July 1, 1919. This highway was extended in 1930 along US 131 to Tustin and then to a terminus with M-66 in Marion. At the same time, M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of Peacock. This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61. A short connector roadway, M-179, was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US 131, forming a small triangle of highways. The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock. The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system. M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control. =Current designation= The current designation of M-63 was created in 1986. Before the designation, US 33 ran north into Michigan south of Niles. From there it followed US 31 north to Scottdale and ran alone to St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. When US 33 was truncated back to Niles, M-63 was commissioned in its place along the route it now follows. The numbering change happened in September 1986. The expressway portion of M-63 is a relic of a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph‚ÄìBenton Harbor area. The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000‚Äì2002, with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001, and one of the two grade-separated interchanges, at Klock Road, demolished and downgraded to an at-grade intersection in 2002. Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway. In 2016, all of M-63 was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. =Blossomland Bridge= The Blossomland Bridge over the St. Joseph River is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The span is a Scherzer rolling-lift bascule, a type of moveable bridge. The bridge was built as part of a 1940s plan to relocate US 31 through St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. Those plans were delayed by World War II. The bridge was completed in late 1948 using the rare design prepared by a firm from Chicago that specialized in bascule bridges. The state paid a total of $1.3 million for what was called \\"the largest bridge ever built under the auspices of the State Highway Department\\".

History On August 1, 1995, Pulaski County, Arkansas, voters approved a one-year, one-cent sales tax for the purpose of building a multi-purpose arena, expanding the Statehouse Convention Center in Little Rock, and making renovations to the Main Street bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock. $20 million of the sales tax proceeds went toward the Convention Center expansion, with the remainder used to build the arena. That money, combined with a $20 million contribution from the State of Arkansas, $17 million from private sources and $7 million from Little Rock-based Alltel Corporation paid for the construction of a arena, which cost nearly $80 million to build. When the doors opened in 1999, the facility was paid for and there was no public indebtedness. Two sites in North Little Rock drew interest from county officials for the proposed arena. The first was a commercial site west of Interstate 30, which contained a strip mall, a Kroger and an abandoned Kmart storefront. The second site was an plot at the foot of the Broadway Bridge. The Pulaski County Multipurpose Civic Center Facilities Board selected the larger site for the arena in 1996 and paid $3.7 million for the land, some of which was acquired through eminent domain, a move protested in court by several landowners. Although located in North Little Rock, Simmons Bank Arena can be seen across the Arkansas River from a number of locations in Little Rock. The second site later would be chosen for the new baseball stadium, Dickey-Stephens Park, constructed for the Arkansas Travelers. The Class AA minor-league baseball team moved from the then 73-year-old Ray Winder Field in Little Rock to a new $28 million home in North Little Rock at the start of the 2007 season. The arena was the home of the 2003, 2006, and 2009 Southeastern Conference women's basketball tournament and the 2000 Sun Belt Conference men‚Äôs basketball tournament. The arena holds the all-time attendance record for an SEC Women's Tournament when 43,642 people attended the event in 2003. The arena hosted portions of the first and second rounds of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in March 2008 and the SEC Gymnastics Championships in 2007. The arena is also used for other events: concerts (seating capacity is between 15,000 and 18,000 for end-stage concerts; the arena has an 80-by-40-foot portable stage); rodeos and auto racing (seating capacity is 14,000); and trade shows and conventions (there are of arena floor space plus of meeting space and of pre-function space). As a concert venue, its location prompted Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to play one of its most rarely performed numbers, 1973's \\"Mary Queen of Arkansas\\", during a March 2000 show on their Reunion Tour. The arena is owned by the Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board for Pulaski County. The arena was designed by the Civic Center Design Team (CCDT), Burt Taggart & Associates, Architects/Engineers, The Wilcox Group, Garver & Garver Engineering and Rosser International of Atlanta. The arena held the 2004, 2007 and 2009 American Idols LIVE! Tour concerts on August 13, 2004, July 13, 2007 and July 25, 2009, respectively. The arena's 20-year naming rights were part of a $28.1 billion sale of Alltel to Verizon Wireless, effective on June 30, 2009, with Alltel Arena renamed as Verizon Arena. Fleetwood Mac performed at Verizon Arena May 4, 2013 with surprise guests former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton attending the show. Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood introduced the couple, who were seated in an arena suite, to the sold-out audience and dedicated the song \\"Don't Stop\\" to them, which was appropriately Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential election campaign song. On October 5, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions. With expiration of initial naming rights due in 2019, new naming rights for the arena were purchased by Arkansas-based Simmons Bank in a deal announced in November 9, 2018. The name change became official on October 3, 2019. https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/sep/30/verizon-arena-change-name- simmons-bank-arena/ References External links * Category:American Basketball Association (2000‚Äìpresent) venues Category:Arena football venues Category:Little Rock Trojans men's basketball Category:Basketball venues in Arkansas Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:Convention centers in Arkansas Category:Defunct basketball venues in the United States Category:Defunct indoor ice hockey venues in the United States Category:Gymnastics venues in the United States Category:Indoor arenas in Arkansas Category:Sports in Little Rock, Arkansas Category:Sports venues in Arkansas Category:Verizon Communications Category:Buildings and structures in Pulaski County, Arkansas Category:Tourist attractions in Pulaski County, Arkansas Category:1999 establishments in Arkansas Category:Sports venues completed in 1999 ","title":"Simmons Bank Arena"},{"id":"1919700","text":"Arena-Auditorium is a 15,028-seat multi-purpose arena in Laramie, Wyoming.

The arena, which opened in 1969, is best known as the former home of the Auburn men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and wrestling teams. The teams finished their stays at the facility at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season, with all of its tenants moving into the new Auburn Arena opening in time for the 2010‚Äì11 season. In addition to sports, numerous concerts were held in the facility.http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/bemc- timeline.html The coliseum continues to house athletics offices as well as classrooms and office space for Auburn's Department of Geosciences. The building's exterior is primarily nondescript concrete, but its entry plaza was recognizable for the large \\"War Eagle\\" statue which faced not only the rest of the university, but also nearby Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium. Naming history The building was approved by the state legislature in 1965 to replace the Auburn Sports Arena, a small on-campus building in use from 1946 until the building of the Coliseum. The state supplied the majority of the funds, with the federal government, the University and an athletics department pledge drive making up the rest of the $6,033,597 needed. It was originally named the Memorial Coliseum, in memory of the Auburn war dead of the 20th century. The coliseum opened January 11, 1969 for a basketball game against Louisiana State University. Auburn upset the Pistol Pete Maravich-led LSU team. In 1987, it was renamed for Joel H. Eaves, a former basketball player and coach who guided the Tigers to their first Southeastern Conference title in 1960 and is the school's all-time winningest coach. It received its current name six years later, adding the name of Jeff Beard, athletic director from 1951 to 1972 during some of Auburn's best years athletically. Originally, the arena seated 12,500 people. Due to Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, it was downsized to 10,108 in 1994. Since 1998, it has seated 10,500. Notable events On March 25‚Äì27, 1971, the Memorial Coliseum hosted the 41st Annual NCAA Wrestling Championships. On March 5, 1974, Elvis Presley performed a sold-out show at the Memorial Coliseum.

Coleman Coliseum is a 15,383-seat multi-purpose arena in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on the campus of the University of Alabama. It is the current home of the Alabama Crimson Tide men's and women's basketball and women's gymnastics teams, and previously served as the home of the women's volleyball program. Opened in 1968 as Memorial Coliseum as a replacement for Foster Auditorium (the current name was adopted in 1988), the coliseum is located at the center of the University of Alabama's athletic complex, which also includes Sewell-Thomas Stadium, Sam Bailey Track & Field Stadium, the Hank Crisp Indoor Facility, the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility and the football building and practice fields. In addition to its primary duties as an athletic facility, the coliseum has on numerous occasions served as a venue for artistic performances, musical concerts, and presidential appearances. History Coleman Coliseum is named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent University of Alabama alumnus. Jefferson Coleman was the first pledge of Theta Sigma Fraternity that would later become the basis for starting the current National Delta Chi Fraternity Chapter at The University on February 12, 1927. Jefferson went on to serve The University in many capacities, from Business Manager of the football team to Director of Alumni Affairs, for almost 50 years. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1926. In 1988, The University honored him by renaming Memorial Coliseum after him. In addition, he served Delta Chi nationally by serving in various positions, most notably as ‚ÄúAA‚Äù from 1954 to 1956. For his meritorious and inconspicuous service, Jeff was inducted into The Order of the White Carnation. The coliseum opened its doors for the first time on January 30, 1968, for the traveling Broadway show The Roar of the Greasepaint - The Smell of the Crowd. Two days later, the men's basketball team hosted its game at the arena, against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. On November 14, 1971, Elvis Presley performed an afternoon show at the arena. He returned to the arena on June 3, 1975. The last time he performed at the arena was on August 30, 1976, a year before he died. Led Zeppelin performed a sold-out show at Memorial Coliseum on May 10, 1973, the fourth stop on their 1973 North American tour. On May 17, 1977, American jam band the Grateful Dead played a two set (plus encore) show at the venue, their one and only appearance in Tuscaloosa.Grateful Dead concert set list from the Coleman Coliseum showGrateful Dead concert photos from the Coleman Coliseum show President Ronald Reagan visited Coleman Coliseum during his 1984 presidential re- election campaign.Ronald Reagan in Tuscaloosa Since the City of Tuscaloosa does not have a municipal civic center, the demand for events grew rapidly and the Coliseum doubled its capacity in the 1970s due to this. In the 1990s marquee concerts and events that the arena had seen in the previous two decades grew scarce as the facility became more outdated and became mostly devoted to Crimson Tide athletic events. In the hope that the University could pull more excitement for events at the facility, the Coliseum underwent a significant renovation in 2005, which cost over $24 million. Coleman Coliseum is also noted for the historic Alabama-LSU basketball game that took place on February 7, 1970. LSU's Pete Maravich scored a career-high 69 points in a 106‚Äì104 loss to Alabama. Maravich came into the game against Alabama with two pulled muscles and late in the contest, he injured an ankle. Despite the injuries, LSU's senior guard scored 47 points in the second half to finish with 69, setting an NCAA record for most points against a Division I opponent. Maravich broke the record of 68 established by Niagara's Calvin Murphy 14 months earlier. Maravich completed 26 of 57 field goals (45.6 percent) and completed 17 of 21 free throws (81.0 percent). After the game, Maravich pursued a fan before being restrained. Press Maravich, LSU's coach and Pete's father, stated that the fan had hit Pete on the back. Maravich's record lasted almost 21 years, until Kevin Bradshaw of US International scored 72 against Loyola Marymount on January 5, 1991. Uses and features Effective with the 2016‚Äì17 school year, Coleman Coliseum is home to both Crimson Tide basketball teams, as well as the women's gymnastics team. The women's basketball team, which played at Foster Auditorium in its first season of 1974‚Äì75, began splitting home games between the two venues the following season, and moved its entire home schedule to the Coliseum in 1981. The team returned to Foster late in the 2010‚Äì11 season, and used that venue as its regular home until returning to the Coliseum in 2016. Women's volleyball, which also originally called Foster Auditorium home, moved to the Coliseum in 1995. In 2000, the team moved to the \\"CAVE\\" (Coleman Auxiliary Volleyball Extension), and it returned to Foster Auditorium in 2011. In addition to sports, Coleman Coliseum has been used for other events including concerts (seating capacity 16,000), commencement ceremonies, alumni gatherings, student convocations, operas, ballets and political rallies. The Coliseum has been used as an annual bass tournament weigh-in spot, and a Travis Tritt music video was filmed here. The stadium hosted the NCAA Basketball Tournament three times, as a regional site in 1974 and as a sub-regional in 1975 and 1981. The Coliseum houses the athletic department offices for all varsity sports with three exceptions. The women's basketball and volleyball offices are located at Foster Auditorium while the football offices are housed in the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility. It features an elegant suite that serves as the President's reception area, an equipment room, weight rooms, a steam bath, a training room, food service areas, the athletic department's photo studio, and locker room for staff and the athletes. Coleman is also home to the UA athletic department's ticket office. It is recognizable on television for its \\"striped\\" ceiling (a result of bands of acoustical tiles) and the two scoreboards behind each end line, both of which intersperse ads, video boards and scoring information with the familiar \\"R-O-L-L T-I-D-E\\" in large illuminated letters. The letters formerly served as a noise meter during games, with the \\"E\\" in \\"TIDE\\" being red, as a sort of overload light. Now, all eight letters on both ends are constantly illuminated, and the final E is white, like the rest of the letters. Before the 2009-10 season, the facility underwent major renovations and these boards were removed and replaced with a center-hung scoreboard.

The arena was built to replace Ahearn Field House, K-State's basketball facility from 1950 to 1988. Construction of Bramlage Coliseum began with a groundbreaking on October 18, 1986, and was completed in 1988. The construction was funded entirely by student fees and donations from alumni and friends of the University. It was named for Junction City businessman Fred Bramlage, who played a major role in raising the funds needed to build the arena.https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/fred-bramlage/18155 On November 26, 1988, Kansas State University officially opened Bramlage Coliseum with an 81‚Äì77 victory over Purdue University in a rematch from the Sweet 16 of the 1988 NCAA tournament. The first basketball game actually played in the arena, however, was an NBA exhibition game between the Dallas Mavericks, led by former K-State standout Rolando Blackman, and the San Antonio Spurs on October 21, 1988. Entering the 2018-19 season, the Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team has posted a 366‚Äì116 (.759) record in Bramlage Coliseum. Over the previous 13 seasons, the home record is 165‚Äì36 (.821). The facility hosted women's NCAA basketball tournament games in 2002 and 2003. Kansas State played in Bramlage Coliseum in both tournament years. Bramlage has also been home to the Kansas State High School Activities Association Class 2A boys and girls state championship tournaments since 1990. =Historical displays= The concourse around the arena is decorated with pictures of Wildcat greats and trophies won by the men's and women's teams over the years. A painted border around the top of the walls inside the Coliseum shows the years the Wildcat basketball programs won conference crowns or participated in the NCAA Tournament or NIT (WNIT). Hanging from the rafters in Bramlage are the retired numbers of former Wildcat greats including: Ernie Barrett, Rolando Blackman, Mitch Richmond, Bob Boozer, Mike Evans, Dick Knostman, Lon Kruger, Jack Parr, Chuckie Williams, Nicole Ohlde, Kendra Wecker and Shalee Lehning. Traditions The unofficial nickname for Bramlage Coliseum is the \\"Octagon of Doom\\", due to the octagon shape of the arena. The nickname was popularized in the media during the 2009-2010 season, but it was first used in on-line internet forums in early 2007. K-State students bring octagonal shaped signs with \\"Doom\\" written on them and wear \\"Doom\\" T-shirts to games. Before every game, the crowd sings Wildcat Victory, the Kansas State fight song, and then rocks back and forth to the Wabash Cannonball. This had been touted as one of the best traditions in college sports by ESPN and other Sports Broadcasting outlets. As the K-State players make their way from the locker room to the court, the crowd chants, \\"Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats.\\" When the Cats hit the floor the crowd erupts and rises to their feet. While the opposing team's starting lineup is announced, the student section shakes newspapers, and after each name chants, \\"So What\\" \\"Who Cares\\" \\"Who's He?\\" \\"Big Deal\\" \\"Go Home,\\" and then rips the papers and throws them in the air at the beginning of the introduction of the Kansas State starting lineup. Each time an opposing player commits a foul the student section chants the number of fouls that player has, and every time a K-State player sinks a three-point basket, the announcer says the name of the player followed by \\"for\\", and then the crowd echoes \\"three!\\" Following a K-State victory, the crowd performs a \\"K-S-U Wildcats\\" chant. If an opposing team's player fouls out of the game, the crowd chants \\"left, right, left\\" for each step. If he stands, they chant \\"standing, standing\\" until the player sits down, at which time the crowd yells \\"Sit down!\\" Seating capacity Seating capacity in Bramlage was originally 13,500. Adjustments for fire codes lowered this number to 13,340 in the 2000s, and construction prior to the 2007-2008 season eliminated another approximately 800 seats to add luxury boxes and bring handicap seating up to compliance.

It is located on the southeast corner of 21st and Hillside on the campus of Wichita State University in northeast Wichita. The arena is home of the Wichita State Shockers men's basketball, women's basketball, and women's volleyball teams. History Charles Koch Arena Interior of Charles Koch Arena The arena was originally built in 1953 as the University of Wichita Field House by what was then the Municipal University of Wichita. It was considered several years ahead of its time because of its circular design, which gave nearly every fan a clear sight line and put the seats very close to the action. As a result, it was quickly nicknamed \\"The Roundhouse,\\" a name that has stuck to this day. When Wichita joined the state university system in 1964, the arena was renamed the WSU Field House. In 1969, the arena was officially renamed Levitt Arena after Wichita department store magnate Henry Levitt, who had recently died. Levitt's Wichita clothing store sponsored basketball team won three consecutive national Amateur Athletic Union titles in the 1930s at a time when colleges and corporate-sponsored teams competed in the same tournament. Following a $6 million endowment from Charles Koch\\"Koch gives $6 million to update WSU Areana ‚Äì the donation, the largest in the university's history, helps make possible a complete renovation of the Levitt Arena, which will reopen as Koch Arena in 2003\\" ‚Äì Wichita Eagle ‚Äì November 1, 2000 the arena underwent a $25 million renovation in 2002‚Äì03, popularly known as the \\"Roundhouse Renaissance.\\" The old arena concourse was completely demolished and a new one built around the original playing/seating area. A portion of the seating bowl was remodeled to make for more legroom. All new seating was installed as well as a video scoreboard, and virtually every surface that was not renovated was given a fresh coat of paint. The Shocker basketball teams played at the Kansas Coliseum for the 2002‚Äì03 season while the arena was rebuilt, while the volleyball team played at the Heskett Center on the WSU campus. In December 2012, ESPN ranked Charles Koch Arena at number 10 in the nation in a poll on home-court advantages in College Basketball. In January 2013, ESPN's Jason King listed Koch Arena as the 7th best home court advantage in college basketball. Events Elvis Presley gave 3 performances at the arena with the first concert there happening on June 19, 1972. The other two times were October 7, 1974 and December 27, 1976, with the latter occurring almost 7 months before his death on August 16, 1977. It hosted the 1977 and 1989 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament title game. It also hosted games for the opening rounds of the 1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In addition to concerts, the arena has also hosted the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, Disney on Ice and Champions on Ice as both Levitt Arena and Koch Arena. American Idols Live! has performed annually at Koch Arena since 2003. Koch Arena hosted the 2008 Kansas State High School Activities Association Class 6A state wrestling tournament. The arena also hosts numerous high school basketball games involving schools from the Wichita City League. The KSHSAA Class 6A boys and girls basketball state tournaments moved to Koch Arena from Emporia State University's William L. White Auditorium in 2011.

First events The building's inaugural event in 1973 was the university's commencement exercises on Its first sporting event was an NBA exhibition game between Seattle and Portland on September 25, 1973. The first major concert was Three Dog Night on Friday, October 5; tickets were five dollars. The first collegiate sporting event was a men's varsity basketball game against LSU on December 1, immediately preceded by a freshman game.This Week in Cougar History The visiting Tigers were led by second-year head coach Dale Brown, previously an assistant at WSU (1971‚Äì72). Intercollegiate basketball was formerly played in Bohler Gymnasium, which opened in 1928 and is now home to Cougar volleyball. Friel Court Located on the east side of campus, the building includes the home arena for Cougars men's and women's basketball. It is named Friel Court in honor of the longtime head coach of the WSU men's basketball team, who led the Cougars to 495 victories in 30 seasons. Friel stepped down as head coach in 1958 and five years later became the first commissioner of the Big Sky Conference, originally based in Pullman (from 1963 to 1971), because that's where he lived. The court was named for Friel in late April 1977, announced by President Glenn Terrell at a meeting of the board the dedication ceremony was at halftime on The court surface was tartan (polyurethane) for its first decade; a traditional hardwood floor debuted in the fall =NCAA tournament= The Coliseum has hosted the sub-regionals of the NCAA men's basketball tournament three times: 1975, 1982, and 1984. The 1975 tournament had 32 teams and the sub-regional had just two games: Big Sky champion Montana and second- ranked UCLA advanced on Saturday night before 10,500. Pac-8 champion UCLA trailed Big Ten runner-up Michigan by four at halftime and needed overtime to win In the opener, WSU alumnus Jud Heathcote's Montana beat independent Utah State Five days later in the Sweet Sixteen in Portland, UCLA defeated the Grizzlies by a mere the Bruins continued on and won a tenth national title in 12 seasons, and hall of fame head coach John Wooden retired. By 1982, the tournament had 48 teams and its Pullman sub-regional had four games with six teams, headlined by the Northwest's top two teams, fourth-ranked Oregon State and #8 Idaho Both were seeded with first-round byes and advanced: Oregon State dispatched Pepperdine and Palouse neighbor Idaho outlasted Iowa in overtime to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, with 12,340 in attendance on Sunday The next week in Provo, Utah, OSU eliminated Idaho, then was defeated by Georgetown, the eventual runner-up. The 1984 tournament had 53 teams and six played in Pullman on the new hardwood. WSU's archrival Washington beat Nevada then upset third-seeded while eventual champion Georgetown outlasted SMU before over 10,500 spectators on Sunday With the opening of Spokane Arena in 1995, Spokane has hosted NCAA tournament games in 2003, 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2016. Entertainment The building's full name reflects the fact that it is used not only for concerts, big-name speakers, dinners, and commencement, but also for basketball as mentioned above. The building may be reconfigured for seating capacities of 12,000 in the round to 9,000 in an end-stage configuration for concerts, to 2,500 in a theater configuration using an extensive system of fly-in curtains, an adjustable cloth scrim ceiling, and a portable proscenium stored under the floor. The original opera house/theater configuration featured one of the first synthesized acoustical environments using surround speaker systems. An onsite reverberation chamber tuned with fiberglass panels for the specific acoustical configuration was combined with the first commercial use of a digital delay line, the Lexicon DD1, then fed to the side and overhead speakers. When properly set up, it was capable producing a very convincing acoustical rendition of a theater, an opera house, or by changing the delay settings and retuning the reverb chamber, even a cathedral. Unfortunately, a sewer drain line had been installed from the southeast corner restroom facilities through the reverb chamber, and if a toilet flushed when the system was in operation, the resulting sound effect was extraordinary. After discovering that, locking the restroom was a management priority whenever the theater was prepared for surround sound use. More recently full digital reverberation replaced the chamber. The Coliseum's Hall of Fame‚Äîfamous entertainers who have performed there‚Äîinclude comedians such as Bill Cosby, Jay Leno, and Whoopi Goldberg, and musical stars or shows such as The Beach Boys, The 5th Dimension, Tony Orlando and Dawn, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Elton John, Def Leppard, Metallica, Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Dana Carvey, Drew Carey, Montgomery Gentry, Bill Engvall, Howie Mandel, Grease & Cats. The Harlem Globetrotters have performed there five times.

The original structure on this site dated back to 1842. The first Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Henry Pottinger resided there from 1843 to 1846. His successor, John Francis Davis also lived there for a while, before moving to Caine Road. The building likely served as one of the earlier homes of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong during this period (1843‚Äì1846). The building then had several owners, including Emanuel R. Belilios, and was occupied among others by the tai-pans of Augustine Heard and Company, a trading firm that went bankrupt in 1876. It was also used by HSBC and was home to the Russian Consulate in the 1870s. The government then leased the building from 1879 and, by 1911, the Sanitary Board and Registrar-General's offices were located in the building. Entrance as the Court of Final Appeal (left). In 1915, it was acquired by the Paris Foreign Missions Society, which commissioned a major renovation. The architects were Leigh & Orange. In the process, a chapel topped by a cupola was added in the north-west corner, and the building was refaced with red bricks. It reopened in 1917 and became known as the \\"French Mission Building\\".Consulate General of France in Hong Kong & Macau: 16 stories about Hong Kong-France relations In 1953, it was sold back to the Hong Kong Government.

It is home to the Virginia Tech Hokies men's and women's basketball teams, wrestling team, and volleyball team. History Cassell Coliseum under construction. Cassell Coliseum in 1964 Built as a replacement for the much smaller War Memorial Gymnasium, the Coliseum's construction began in 1961. It was fully completed in December 1964 at a cost of $2.7 million. It was designed by Carneal and Johnston (now Ballou Justice Upton Architects, Richmond, Va) and built by T.C. Brittain and Company of Decatur, Georgia. Originally just referred to as \\"the Coliseum,\\" it was dedicated on September 17, 1977 to the late Stuart K. Cassell, former school business manager, first Vice President of Administration, and major supporter of the building of the arena. The first game was on January 3, 1962, when the Hokies played Alabama. The Hokies won 91-67. Unfortunately, the crowd sat on the bare concrete risers to watch the game because the seats had not arrived. Cassell Coliseum In the early years of the Coliseum, the Hokies frequently saw capacity crowds pack the venue. However, student and alumni interest in basketball decreased in the 1990s due to the Hokies' lack of a stable basketball conference home (the Hokies were in three different conferences in nine seasons) and due to the success of the football team. Fan support has begun to gain momentum under coach Seth Greenberg and the school's recent move to the ACC. A raucous student section, nicknamed the \\"Cassell Guard,\\" has helped transform the Coliseum into a difficult venue for opposing teams in an athletic conference ripe with intimidating basketball arenas. On June 27, 1996, a 27 year old construction worker fell to his death on the coliseum floor. Dewey Wayne Duncan, of Pulaski, VA, who was working outside the coliseum for a contractor making repairs to the roof, stepped on a section of the roof that was covered only by a ceiling tile. The tile collapsed, and Duncan fell through the roof.http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA- news/WDBJ-7/script_archives/96/0696/062896/062896.a.htm On April 17, 2007, a memorial convocation was held there in response to the shootings of 32 students and faculty on the Virginia Tech campus the previous day. President George W. Bush and his wife Laura attended the event. Over the years, Cassell has undergone various updates, most recently those being a new sound system, new lights inside building over the court, as well as a refinished court. On August 5, 2015, it was reported that Carilion Clinic has bought naming rights to the arena's court for $500,000 a year for the next 10 years. The Virginia Tech Carilion Court at Cassell Coliseum was dedicated in December 2015. Prior to the 2017-18 season, half of the old wooden seats were replaced with larger plastic seats, reducing the capacity. The rest of the seats were replaced prior to the 2020-21 season, bringing the capacity down to 9,275. Major games On January 10, 1983, the Virginia Tech men's basketball team defeated the number one ranked Memphis State Tigers 69-56 in front of 10,000 fans. It was the first time a number one team had played in Cassell Coliseum and the Hokies first win over a number one ranked team. On February 17, 2005, during Virginia Tech's first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Blue Devils were ranked 7th nationally. By the end of the night, the Blue Devils were handed a 67-65 loss by the Hokies in front of 9,847 fans. It was the first time that Virginia Tech had beaten Duke since 1966. On January 13, 2007, Virginia Tech defeated the number one ranked North Carolina Tar Heels 94-88. At one point in the game, the Hokies led by 29 points. They were able to hold off a strong surge by the Tar Heels to seal the victory. On March 22, 2010, Virginia Tech beat UConn in Cassell on national television in the second round of the NIT tournament. Trailing 63-62, the Hokies' defense pressured Connecticut into a backcourt violation. With 14.1 seconds remaining, the Hokies took the lead with a Dorenzo Hudson jump shot. The Hokies' defense was able to stop Connecticut from scoring for a 65-62 victory. On February 26, 2011, Duke fell to Virginia Tech 64-60. At the time Duke was the number one ranked team in the country. It was Virginia Tech's fourth upset of a number one ranked team under Seth Greenberg. New York Giant, David Wilson was seen doing back flips on the court with classmate and track & field star, Nick McLaughlin following a halftime award ceremony recognizing the 2011 ACC Indoor Track and Field Champions.

He was most noted for his uilleann pipe playing and was partly responsible for the revival of the instrument during the twentieth century, having co-founded Na P√≠obair√≠ Uilleann, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of the uilleann pipes and its music. He is recognised for having preserved almost 2,000 Irish songs and dance-tunes as part of the work he did with the Irish Folklore Commission. Ennis is widely regarded as one of the greatest uilleann pipers of all time. Early years James Ennis, S√©amus's father, worked as a civil servant in Naul, County Dublin. In 1908, James Ennis was in a pawn-shop in London. He bought a bag containing the pieces of a set of old uilleann pipes. They were made in the mid nineteenth century by Coyne Pipemakers of Thomas Street in Dublin. In 1912, he came first in the Oireachtas competition for warpipes and second in the uilleann pipes. He was also a prize-winning dancer. In 1916, he married Mary Josephine McCabe, an accomplished fiddle player from County Monaghan. They had six children, Angela, S√©amus, Barbara, and twins, Cormac and Ursula (Pixie) and Desmond. S√©amus was born on 5 May 1919 in Jamestown in Finglas, North Dublin City. James Ennis was a member of the Fingal trio, which included Frank O'Higgins on fiddle and John Cawley on flute and performed regularly with them on the radio. At the age of thirteen, S√©amus started receiving lessons on the pipes from his father. He attended a Gaelscoil, Cholmcille, and a Gaelchol√°iste, Col√°iste Mhuire, which gave him a knowledge of the Irish language that would serve him well in later life. He sat an exam to become Employment Exchange clerk but was too far down the list to be offered a job. He was twenty and unemployed. Three Candles Press Colm √ì Lochlainn was editor of Irish Street Ballads and a friend of the Ennis family. In 1938 S√©amus confided in Colm that he intended to move to England to join the British Army. Colm immediately offered him a job at The Three Candles Press. There S√©amus learned all aspects of the printing trade. This included writing down slow airs for printed scores ‚Äì a skill which later proved important. Colm was director of an Irish language choir, An Claisceadal, which S√©amus joined. In 1942, during The Emergency, shortages and rationing meant that things became difficult in the printing trade. Professor Seamus √ì Duilearge of the Irish Folklore Commission hired the 23-year-old to collect songs. He was given \\"pen, paper and pushbike\\" and a salary of three pounds per week. Off he went to Connemara. Song collector From 1942 to 1947, working for the Irish Folklore Commission, S√©amus collected songs in West Munster, Galway, Cavan, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry, the Aran Islands and the Scottish Hebrides. His knowledge of Scots Gaelic enabled him to transcribe much of the John Lorne Campbell collection of songs. Elizabeth Cronin of Baile Mhuirne, County Cork was so keen to chat to S√©amus on his visits that she wrote down her own songs and handed them over as he arrived, and then got down to conversation. He had a natural empathy with the musicians and singers he met. In August 1947 he started work as an outside broadcast officer with Raidi√≥ √âireann. He was a presenter and recorded Willie Clancy, Sean Reid and Micho Russell for the first time. There was an air of authority in his voice. In 1951, Alan Lomax and Jean Ritchie arrived from America to record Irish songs and tunes. The tables were turned as S√©amus became the subject of someone else's collection. There is a photograph from 1952/53 showing Jean huddled over the tape recorder while S√©amus plays Uilleann pipes. As I Roved Out Late in 1951, he joined the BBC. He moved to London to work with producer Brian George. In 1952 he married Margaret Glynn. They had two children, Catherine and Christopher. His job was to record the traditional music of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and to present it on the BBC Home Service. The programme was called As I Roved Out and ran until 1958. Meeting up with Alan Lomax again, S√©amus was largely responsible for the album Folk and Primitive Music (volume on Ireland) on the Columbia label. Full time musician In 1958, after his contract with the BBC was not renewed, he started doing freelance work, first in England then back in Ireland, with the new TV station Teilifis √âireann. Soon he was relying totally on his musical ability to make a living. About this time his marriage broke down and he returned to Ireland. He suffered from tuberculosis and was ill for some time. In 1964, he performed at the Newport Folk Festival. His father gave him the pipes he had bought in 1908. Although most pipers can be classed as playing in a tight style or an open style, S√©amus was in between. S√©amus was a master of the slow air, knowing how to decorate long notes with taste and discreet variation. Two events will live in legend among pipers. The first was in Bettystown in 1968, when the society of Irish pipers, Na P√≠obair√≠ Uilleann, was formed. Breand√°n Breathnach was playing a tape of his own piping. S√©amus asked \\"What year?\\" Brendan replied \\"1948\\". S√©amus said \\"So I thought\\". For a couple of hours the younger players performed while S√©amus sat in silence. Eventually he was asked to play. Slowly he took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves. He spent 20 minutes tuning up his 130-year-old pipes. He then asked the gathering whether all the tape recorders were ready and proceeded to play for over an hour. To everyone's astonishment he then offered his precious pipes to Willie Clancy to play a set. Willie demurred but eventually gave in. Next Liam O'Flynn (Liam √ìg √ì Floinn) was asked to play them, and so on, round the room. The second unforgettable session was in Dowlings' pub in Prosperous in County Kildare. Christy Moore was there, as well as most of the future members of Planxty. S√©amus never ran any school of piping but his enthusiasm infused everyone he met. In the early seventies, he shared a house with Liam O'Flynn for almost three years. Finally he bought a piece of land in Naul and lived in a mobile home there. One of his last performances was at the Willie Clancy Summer School in 1982. He died on 5 October 1982. His pipes were bequeathed to Liam O'Flynn. Radio producer Peter Browne produced a compilation of his performances, called The Return from Fingal, spanning 40 years. Commemoration Seamus Ennis statue in Naul, Dublin S√©amus Ennis Road in his native Finglas is named in his honour. The S√©amus Ennis Cultural Centre in Naul is additionally named after him.

Conte Forum, commonly known as Conte Forum, Kelley Rink (for ice hockey games), or simply Conte, is an 8,606-seat multi-purpose arena which opened in 1988 on the campus of Boston College in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. Conte Forum is home to the Boston College Eagles men's and women's basketball and ice hockey teams as well as the Boston College Marching Band. History Conte Forum is named for former United States congressman Silvio O. Conte, an alumnus of Boston College and Boston College Law School. The ice rink is named in honor of long-time BC hockey coach John \\"Snooks\\" Kelley. The entire arena is traditionally called \\"Kelley Rink\\" during hockey games. Before the arena opened in 1988, the BC basketball teams played their home games in Roberts Center to the immediate southwest of Alumni Stadium, on the site of the present-day Merkert Chemistry Center. Games expected to draw more than its 4,400 capacity were moved off- campus to Boston Garden. The Eagles hockey teams played at McHugh Forum which was positioned parallel to Alumni Stadium. Conte Forum was built on the site of McHugh Forum, and is situated perpendicular to the football stadium. The arena is directly adjacent to Alumni, with some luxury boxes overlooking both the football field and arena floors. Conte Forum seats 8,606 spectators in its basketball configuration and 7,884 when set up for hockey. The facility also houses 950-seat Power Gym which is used for BC volleyball games and as an auxiliary basketball court.CONTE FORUM As the largest indoor venue on the BC campus, Conte Forum hosts larger university-related events including conferences and debates. It is the site of the annual \\"Pops-on-the-Heights\\" during the annual Parents' Weekend in the fall, a gala concert featuring the Boston Pops Orchestra which raises over $1.5 million for BC's academic scholarship fund. In the event of inclement weather, Conte Forum also hosts the university's commencement exercises. Since 2008, Conte Forum has also hosted the Boston College AHANA Leadership Council (ALC) Showdown in the spring, an increasingly popular dance competition between BC's various dance and cultural organizations. Conte has also hosted numerous concerts, including in recent years Akon, Third Eye Blind, hellogoodbye, The Roots, Kanye West, and The Academy Is, as well as Will Ferrell's Funny or Die Comedy Tour. On January 5, 2014, the Conte Forum was the venue for Boston mayor Marty Walsh's inauguration.https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/01/05/walsh-choice- inaugural-venue-break-with-more-than-century-tradition In Boston's proposed bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, Conte Forum was selected as a potential venue for various events, such as Wrestling and Judo. However, the city eventually withdrew the bid. Gallery File:Conte Forum Hoops.jpgConte Forum during a BC vs. West Virginia basketball game. File:BC vs. Duke 2010.jpgBC vs. Duke men's basketball game.

Opened in 1979, it is home to the Colorado Buffaloes men's and women's basketball teams and women's volleyball of the Pac-12 Conference. The building is an eight-sided concrete structure, with three levels: arena floor, service level, and the concourse level. Single-tiered inside, it replaced the Balch Fieldhouse, the current home of the indoor track and field team located directly adjacent to Folsom Field. The approximate elevation at street level is above sea level. History The venue was initially called the CU Events/Conference Center and was renamed to the Coors Events/Conference Center in September 1990 after the Coors family, in recognition of a $5 million gift from the Adolph Coors Foundation.\\"Coors Events Center History\\" In 2008 with the addition of the basketball offices to the building on the service level, the \\"Conference\\" was removed from the name as there were no longer conference rooms in the building. Although the naming agreement with the Coors Foundation had long expired, the Coors name remained on the building until 2018, when it was renamed the CU Events Center. At the time, the CU athletic department announced it was actively seeking a new naming rights partner. On December 9, 1981, the Grateful Dead played their last Boulder show at the then-named \\"CUC.\\" It is the highest indoor arena in the Pac-12 Conference, approximately above the Huntsman Center Improvements The most dramatic changes since the building has been opened have come since 2008. After the 2007-08 basketball seasons, the CEC underwent a $200,000 \\"Floor Lift\\" with a permanent maple surface was installed that has technology to reduce injuries and fatigue. In April 2008, the men's and women's basketball offices were relocated to the CEC from Folsom Field second level where the conference rooms were previously located. In the summer of 2010, two new video boards were installed in the southwest and northeast corners. With the new video boards and as part of the new practice facility, a new state-of-the-art production facility was built for the department's award-winning BuffVision office. The production room controls the video boards at both the Coors Events Center and Folsom Field. A new practice facility was opened in August 2011 for volleyball and basketball. The building was just the second athletic facility in the nation and third on CU's campus to earn LEED Platinum Certification, the highest possible by the internationally recognized system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. In August 2013, a video room for the men's and women's basketball teams was opened for the first time, giving both teams additional meeting space and the ability to watch film more efficiently. In February 2014, a new weight room was finished in the remaining space on the second level where the conference rooms were once located, adjacent to the basketball offices that were relocated in 2008.

The mixtape was produced by the two artists at Diplo's home studio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was not officially released, but was distributed at M.I.A.'s live shows and via the internet to promote the release of her much-delayed debut album. Despite its unofficial status, the mixtape received general acclaim among critics. Several music publications included the mixtape in their listings of the best albums of 2004. Recording Recording sessions for Arular, the debut album by M.I.A., took place during 2003 and 2004, and the album was originally scheduled to be released in September 2004. Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release, however, first to December and then into 2005. During the recording process, M.I.A. met DJ Diplo, and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album. Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless, Diplo conceived the idea of using the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full-length album. M.I.A. extended her stay in the United States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio. Music and artwork Diplo, who mixed the recording The mixtape includes early mixes of the vocals intended for Arular, mashed up with samples of tracks including \\"Walk Like an Egyptian\\" by The Bangles, \\"Big Pimpin'\\" by Jay-Z and \\"Push It\\" by Salt-n-Pepa. Tunes by Baby, dead Prez, Missy Elliott, Ciara, LL Cool J and Cutty Ranks are also included. Necessary legal clearance for the use of these samples was not obtained, with the result that the mixtape could not be sold in record shops and could only be distributed by word of mouth. In addition to pop and hip hop, global music styles are included in the mix. The track \\"Galang\\" incorporates elements of reggaeton, and three tracks consist of Brazilian baile funk. The cover features a photograph of M.I.A. wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \\"Complaints Department\\" placed above a picture of a hand grenade. Arranged around the title are a series of smaller pictures depicting dancers, rioters and riot police. According to Diplo, the pressing was handled by a \\"little storefront-house\\" which specialises in producing mixtapes. Release and reception An initial pressing of 1,000 copies of the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo to ask for the remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he felt was a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 copies of the recording were produced in total. The mixtape received general acclaim among music critics, despite not being an official release. In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said he was more interested in hearing M.I.A.'s own original music than a mashup: \\"I find more fascination‚Äîand pleasure, if not variety‚Äîin M.I.A. juxtaposed against herself than in, for instance, favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'. Which isn't to deny I also find all these good things in favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'.\\" Rollie Pemberton from Stylus Magazine called Piracy Funds Terrorism \\"a genre-bending adventure in shattered preconceptions and club killing beats\\" and said that, based on the strength of the mixtape, M.I.A.'s first official album had a lot to live up to. Village Voice critic Tom Breihan later expressed relief that M.I.A.'s aesthetic and her debut album did not have much input from Diplo. Piracy Funds Terrorism was voted the 23rd best album of 2004 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Pitchfork ranked it at number 12 on their year-end albums list, and later at number 103 on their decade-end list of top 200 albums from the 2000s. Track listing The first pressing of Piracy Funds Terrorism had an incorrect track listing, which was fixed for the second pressing, the track listing for which is as follows:Track listing as per cover of Piracy Funds Terrorism For the third pressing, two tracks featuring beats created by Cavemen were replaced with new material due to legal issues.

The character first appears in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \\"The Empty Child\\" and subsequently features in the remaining episodes of the first series (2005) as a companion to the series' protagonist, The Doctor. Subsequent to this, Jack became the central character in the adult-themed Torchwood, which aired from 2006 to 2011. Barrowman reprised the role for guest appearances in Doctor Who in its third and fourth series, the two-part special \\"The End of Time\\" and the twelfth series episode \\"Fugitive of the Judoon\\". In contrast to The Doctor, Jack is more of a conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which The Doctor would view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the Series 1 finale, \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th-century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstory--both prior to meeting The Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earth--are gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue. Jack was the first openly non-heterosexual character in the history of televised Doctor Who. The popularity of the character amongst multiple audiences directly influenced the development of the spin-off series Torchwood. The character became a figure of the British public consciousness, rapidly gaining fame for actor Barrowman. As an ongoing depiction of bisexuality in mainstream British television, the character became a role model for young gay and bisexual people in the UK. Jack is featured in various Doctor Who and Torchwood books and has action figures created in his likeness. Appearances =Television= Jack Harkness first appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who two-part story, \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances\\", when Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a companion of the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), meets him during the London Blitz. Although posing as an American volunteering in the Royal Air Force, Jack is actually a former \\"Time Agent\\" from the 51st century who left the agency after inexplicably losing two years of his memory. Now working as a con man, Jack is responsible for unwittingly releasing a plague in London in 1941. After The Doctor cures the plague, Jack redeems himself by taking an unexploded bomb into his ship; The Doctor and Rose rescue him moments before it explodes. He subsequently travels with The Doctor and Rose in The Doctor's time traveling spacecraft, the TARDIS. During his time with The Doctor, Jack matures into a hero, and in his final 2005 appearance, he sacrifices himself fighting the evil alien Daleks. Rose brings him back to life while suffused with the power of the time vortex, but when the power leaves her she doesn't remember doing it. She and The Doctor subsequently leave Jack behind on Satellite 5. Jack returned in 2006 as a character of the spin-off series Torchwood, in which he is a member of the Cardiff-based Torchwood Three in combating alien threats and monitoring a spacetime rift which runs through Cardiff. Jack is re-introduced as a changed man, reluctantly immortal, having spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with The Doctor. Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to the team of experts after she discovers them; there are hints of romantic feelings between the two, but Gwen has a boyfriend and Jack enters a sexual relationship with the team's general factotum Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd). Despite having worked with him for some time, his present-day colleagues know very little about him; over the course of the series they discover that he cannot die. Jack was once a prisoner of war, and was an interrogator who used torture. In the Torchwood Series 1 finale \\"End of Days\\", Jack returns to the TARDIS. This immediately leads into the 2007 Doctor Who episode \\"Utopia\\", where he joins the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). Jack explains he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by traveling to 1869 via vortex manipulator, and lived through the 20th century waiting for The Doctor. By the series finale, having spent a year in an alternate timeline enslaved by The Master (John Simm), Jack opts to return to his team in Cardiff. Before departing, Jack speculates about his immortality and reminisces about his youth on the Boeshane Peninsula, revealing that his nickname had been the \\"Face of Boe\\", suggesting that he may one day become the non-humanoid recurring character of the same name, voiced by Struan Rodger. In Torchwood's second series (2008), Jack returns with a lighter attitude, and finds his team have continued working in his absence. They are also more insistent to learn of his past, especially after meeting his former partner, the unscrupulous Captain John Hart (James Marsters). The episode \\"Adam\\" explores Jack's childhood in the Boeshane Peninsula, revealing through flashback sequences how his father Franklin (Demetri Goritsas) died and young Jack (Jack Montgomery) lost his younger brother Gray (Ethan Brooke) during an alien invasion. Flashbacks in the series' penultimate episode \\"Fragments\\" depict Jack's capture by Torchwood in the late 19th century. Initially their prisoner, Jack is coerced into becoming a freelance agent for the organization, and eventually becomes leader of Torchwood Three at midnight on 1 January 2000. The series finale features the return of Captain John and Jack's brother Gray (Lachlan Nieboer), who, after a lifetime of torture by aliens, wants revenge on Jack. While Jack manages to repair his friendship with Captain John to some degree, he is forced to place his brother in cryogenic stasis after Gray kills his teammates Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and Owen Harper (Burn Gorman). Jack subsequently appears alongside the casts of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures in the two-part crossover finale of the 2008 Doctor Who series, \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\". Jack is summoned along with other former companions of The Doctor to assist him in defeating the mad scientist Davros (Julian Bleach) and his creation, the Daleks. Jack parts company from the Doctor once again, having helped save the universe from destruction. Torchwood's third series (2009) is a five-part serial entitled Children of Earth. Aliens known as the 4-5-6 announce they are coming to Earth. Civil servant John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi) orders the destruction of Torchwood to cover a conspiracy; in 1965, the British government had authorized Jack to sacrifice twelve children to the 4-5-6, which is shown in flashbacks. Jack is blown apart in an explosion, but painfully reconstitutes from an incomplete pile of body parts; Gwen and Ianto escape and later rescue Jack from a concrete grave. Jack's daughter Alice (Lucy Cohu) and grandson Steven (Bear McCausland) are taken into custody by the assassins. The 4-5-6 demand ten percent of the world's children. Although he handed over twelve children in 1965, Jack refuses to give up any this time around. The 4-5-6 release a fatal virus; Ianto dies in Jack's arms. To create the signal that will destroy the 4-5-6, Jack sacrifices Steven. Six months later, having lost his lover, his grandson and his daughter, he bids farewell to Gwen and is transported aboard an alien ship to leave Earth for parts unknown. In the closing scenes of 2010 Doctor Who special \\"The End of Time\\", the critically injured Doctor gives each companion a farewell before his impending regeneration. Finding Jack in an exotic alien bar, he leaves him a note containing the name of Titanic crew member Alonso Frame (Russell Tovey), sitting on Jack's left side; the two proceed to flirt. The fourth series, Miracle Day (2011), an American co-production, sees Jack return to Earth to investigate a phenomenon where humans can no longer die; Jack discovers that he has become mortal. Investigating their connection to the so-called \\"miracle\\", CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) renditions Jack and Gwen to America, but joins the team along with CIA colleague Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins) after conspirators within the CIA betray them. Jack's investigations into the miracle repeatedly turn up dead-ends, indicating a decades-old conspiracy to manipulate the global economy, as well as political institutions, for unknown purposes. Flashbacks in \\"Immortal Sins\\" depict Jack's relationship with Italian thief Angelo Colasanto (Daniele Favilli) in late 1920s New York City, ending in heartbreak after Jack is killed, bled and tortured repeatedly by the local community. In the present day, Angelo's granddaughter Olivia (Nana Visitor) explains that the descendants of three local businessmen who wished to purchase Jack's powers‚Äî\\"the Three Families\\"‚Äîare responsible for the miracle, using Jack's blood in conjunction with what they call \\"the Blessing\\". In \\"The Gathering\\", the team ultimately track down the Families and the Blessing, which is revealed to be an antipodal geological formation connected to the Earth's morphic field running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires; the team divide, attempting to reach both access points. To end the miracle, in \\"The Blood Line\\", Jack has Gwen kill him so that his mortal blood can reset the human morphic field; Gwen kills him with a bullet through the chest, while Rex‚Äîwho transfused himself with Jack's blood to keep it safe‚Äîallows the Blessing to drain him too, in Buenos Aires. Rex survives, and with the morphic field restored, Jack resurrects. At Esther's funeral however, they discover that Rex has acquired self-healing abilities just like Jack's. After a ten-year absence from the show, Jack returned in the twelfth series of Doctor Who in the episode \\"Fugitive of the Judoon\\" (2020), where he attempts to contact the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker). Using a stolen alien craft, he transports the Doctor's companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole) and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill), mistaking each of them for the Doctor. Learning of their identity and the Doctor's recent regeneration into a woman, he returns them to Earth, passing them a warning to give to the Doctor about the \\"lone Cyberman\\", before he teleports away after the ship's onboard nanogenes attack him. =Literature= Jack features in the BBC Books \\"New Series Adventures\\" Doctor Who novels The Deviant Strain, The Stealers of Dreams, and Only Human. These novels take place between episodes of the 2005 series of Doctor Who. In The Stealers of Dreams, Jack refers to the Face of Boe as a famous figure in his home era; the producers of the series had not conceptualized the possibility of a Jack and Boe connection until mid-way into the production of the 2007 series. The first wave of BBC Books Torchwood novels, Another Life, Border Princes, and Slow Decay (published January 2007), are set between episodes of the first series of Torchwood. The novels Trace Memory, The Twilight Streets, and Something in the Water (published March 2008), are set during the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood. The Twilight Streets suggests Jack was a freelance Torchwood agent in the 1940s, who disagreed with their methods but was persuaded by the love of an ex-boyfriend, Greg. The novel also explained that during the events of the Doctor Who episode \\"Boom Town\\" (which was set in Cardiff), Jack placed a lockdown on Torchwood activity so as not to create a paradox involving his past self. Trace Memory similarly depicts Jack as a freelance Torchwood agent, living and working in the late 1960s. Pack Animals, SkyPoint, and Almost Perfect (October 2008), are made up of more second series adventures, apart from Almost Perfect which is set after Series Two finale \\"Exit Wounds\\". Into the Silence, Bay of the Dead, and The House that Jack Built (May 2009), similarly are set between the second and third series of the show. The House that Jack Built focuses partly on Jack's life in 1906. Risk Assessment, The Undertaker's Gift, and Consequences (October 2009), are likewise set between \\"Exit Wounds\\" and Children of Earth. Jack as he appears in the first Torchwood comic book, art by SL Gallant; the character is featured in a number of different media. First published in January 2008, the monthly Torchwood Magazine began occasionally including Torchwood comic strips, in which Jack also appears. One such comic, written in 2009 by John Barrowman and sister Carole E. Barrowman, \\"Captain Jack and the Selkie\\", expands on Captain Jack's characterisation. Barrowman comments that \\"We‚Äôd already agreed to tell a story that showed a side of Jack and a part of his history that hadn‚Äôt been explored too much in other media. I wanted to give fans something original about Jack.\\" Torchwood Magazine also ran with the ten- part Rift War! storyline from April to December 2008. The first Torchwood comic \\"Jetsam\\" was later collected along with Rift War! in a graphic novel. The Torchwood Archives, published after the second series in 2008, is a companion book written by Gary Russell which gives an \\"insider's look\\" into the life of Jack and the Torchwood team. The book collects and re-publishes ancillary material which appeared on the Torchwood website in the first two seasons, and provides new material such as rough dates for things like Jack's marriage as relayed by the book's fictional narrator. The book is composed of fictitious archive notes, personnel forms, photographs, newspaper clippings and staff memos, and offers revelations about the character which would later be confirmed by the television series. For example, Archives first mention Jack's lover Lucia Moretti, who is mentioned in Children of Earth. In a similar vein to The Torchwood Archives but from a real-world perspective, Gary Russell's The Torchwood Encyclopedia (2009) expands on \\"every fact and figure\\" for Jack and the Torchwood world. The character is also mentioned Dave Stone's 2006 Judge Dredd novel Psykogeddon, where a Mega-City News announcer relays a disclaimer from pornographer Jason Kane ‚Äì a character Stone created for the 1996 Doctor Who novel Death and Diplomacy ‚Äì stating that any similarity between Kane and \\"the notorious Cursed Earth brigand 'Captain' Jack Harkness is a purely unfortunate coincidence\\". =Online media= During the first series of Torchwood, the Torchwood website, located at torchwood.org.uk, recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an alternate reality game made up of electronic literature in the form of fictional intercepted blogs, newspaper cutouts and confidential letters and IM conversations between members of the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood. For the second series in 2008, a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures. The BBC America Torchwood also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website. During Series Four of Doctor Who, the BBC's website also included a section called \\"Captain Jack's Monster Files\\" featuring weekly webcast videos narrated by John Barrowman in character as Captain Jack giving \\"top secret\\" facts collected by Torchwood about Doctor Who monsters, such as the Slitheen. A Christmas special 2008 Monster File features Barrowman in new footage as Jack, as does the Cybermen edition added following the airing of \\"The Next Doctor\\" on Christmas Day. For Dr Fiona Hobden, the Monster Files' mock-documentary format give an \\"additional twist\\" to the interplay between history and fiction. Because Captain Jack narrates, \\"the story unfolds in the tradition of contemporary historical documentary, the docudrama\\"; in the Monster File for \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\", Harkness' commentary moves the 'reality' of the episode away from the explosion of Vesuvius and the human experience, and to the story itself. From Series Five onwards, the Monster Files are instead presented by River Song (Alex Kingston). Jack also appears in the web-based motion comic series Torchwood: Web of Lies (2011), which ties into Miracle Day. The story depicts a series two-set adventure where Jack is kidnapped by unknown assailants and pursued by Gwen. Investigations by a woman named Holly (voice of Eliza Dushku) establish that Jack was kidnapped by the Three Families so they could acquire entire vats of his blood, which she destroys. =Audio drama= In addition to the paperback novels, Jack also appears in Torchwood audio books, the first four being Hidden written by Steven Savile and narrated by Naoko Mori, Everyone Says Hello written by Dan Abnett and narrated by Burn Gorman, released February 2008, In the Shadows by Joseph Lidster and narrated by Eve Myles, released September 2008, and The Sin Eaters written by Brian Minchin and narrated by Gareth David-Lloyd, released September 2008. Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama, \\"Lost Souls\\" which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Freema Agyeman. Set after the events of the 2008 series, Jack and his team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva, as part of Radio 4's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on. The special radio episode's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite, as well as the team's mourning of Toshiko and Owen's recent deaths. Between 1 and 3 July, Radio 4 aired three further audio dramas in The Afternoon Play slot, bridging the gap between Series 2 and 3. \\"Golden Age\\" introduced Jack's ex-lover Duchess Eleanor (Jasmine Hyde), the leader of Torchwood India, which Jack closed down in 1924. \\"The Dead Line\\" features another ex-girlfriend of Jack's, Stella Courtney (Do√±a Croll). 2011 audio drama series The Lost Files was released to tie in with Miracle Day. \\"The Devil and Miss Carew\\" and \\"Submission\\" are set in the same period as the previous audio dramas. \\"House of the Dead\\", however, reveals itself in its final act to be set six months after Ianto's death; Jack visited the House of the Dead to make contact with Ianto, who is unaware that he is dead. Jack and Ianto say a final goodbye and tell each other they love one another for the first time. Jack attempts to return to the land of the living alongside Ianto, but Ianto stays behind to close the Cardiff spacetime rift forever with Jack's device. In 2015, BBC Worldwide granted Big Finish Productions the licence to produce Torchwood audio plays, including new stories set in Cardiff following Miracle Day. As of April 2018, Barrowman has reprised his role of Harkness in eleven releases. In 2017, Big Finish Productions released The Lives of Captain Jack audio series, containing four plays depicting encounters from Jack's life. These cover the year he spent on a devastated Earth, following \\"The Parting of the Ways\\"; his romantic encounter with Alonso Frame, following \\"The End of Time\\"; an adventure he shared with Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri), during the time he waited on Earth for the Doctor to return; and a story from his days as a Time Agent and before he took the name Jack. The final story of this collection, \\"Month 25\\", reveals Jack's backstory with the Time Agency, detailing how he lost two years of his memories, and revealing his real name: Javic Piotr Thane. Characterisation =Concept and creation= In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies drew inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, \\"Is he a force for good or ill?\\" Actor John Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack. Barrowman says that at the time of his initial casting, Davies and co- executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they \\"basically wrote the character around [John]\\". Davies had singled out Barrowman for the part. On meeting him, Barrowman tried out the character using his native Scottish accent, his normal American accent, and an English accent; Davies decided it \\"made it bigger if it was an American accent\\". Barrowman recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a \\"matin√©e idol quality\\", telling him that \\"the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you\\". A number of television critics have compared Barrowman's performances as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise. The character's introduction served to posit him as a secondary hero and a rival to the series protagonist, the Doctor, simultaneously paralleling the Doctor's detached alien nature with Jack's humanity and \\"heart\\". John Barrowman describes the character in his initial appearance as \\"an intergalactic conman\\" and also a \\"rogue Time Agent\\" which he defines as \\"part of a kind of space CIA\\" and alludes to the moral ambiguity of having \\"done something in his past\\" and not knowing \\"whether it is good or bad because his memory has been erased\\". Writer Stephen James Walker notes similarities have been found between Jack and Angel (David Boreanaz), the heroic vampire from America's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that \\"Back alley fights, knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are only a few of the correlations between the two characters.\\" Jack has also been compared to the title character of America's Xena: Warrior Princess, which featured lesbian subtext between Xena (Lucy Lawless) and her close friend Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor). Polina Skibinskaya, writing for AfterElton.com, an American gay men's website, notes both are \\"complex characters\\" haunted by their past misdeeds. Furthermore, like Xena, Jack is \\"a gay basher‚Äôs worst nightmare: a queer weapon-wielding, ass-kicking superhero gleefully chewing his way through awesome fight scenes\\". One academic article refers to Jack as \\"an indestructible Captain Scarlet figure\\". In a comparative contrast, where the Doctor is a pacifist, Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends. The BBC News website refers to Jack's role within Doctor Who as \\"[continuing] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan\\". Whereas in the classic series the female \\"companions\\" were sometimes exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences, the producers could reverse this dynamic with Jack, citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to \\"look at good looking men\\". John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this. Jack is bisexual, and is the first televised Doctor Who character to be openly anything other than heterosexual. In Jack's first appearance, the Doctor suggests that Jack's orientation is more common in the 51st century, when humankind will deal with multiple alien species and becomes more sexually flexible. Within Doctor Who's narrative, Jack's sexual orientation is not specifically labelled as that could \\"make it an issue\\". On creating Jack, Davies comments \\"I thought: 'It's time you introduce bisexuals properly into mainstream television,'\\" with a focus on making Jack fun and swashbuckling as opposed to negative and angsty. Davies also expresses that he didn't make the character bisexual \\"from any principle\\", but rather because \\"it would be interesting from a narrative point of view.\\" The bisexuality-related labels \\"pansexual\\" and \\"omnisexual\\" are also frequently applied to the character. Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack's mind; Moffat also comments \\"It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone.\\" Within Torchwood, the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as \\"quaint\\". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, John Barrowman explained that \\"[He]‚Äôs bisexual, but in the realm of the show, we call him omnisexual, because on the show, [the characters] also have sex with aliens who take human form, and sex with male- male, women-women, all sorts of combinations.\\" The term is also used once, in- universe, in the novel The House that Jack Built, when Ianto comments to a woman's remark about Jack, \\"He prefers the term 'omnisexual'.\\" =Costume= John Barrowman in Captain Jack's distinctive World War Two greatcoat during Torchwood filming. While in his first several Doctor Who appearances, Jack did not have a set costume, Torchwood established a continual look for Jack which recalled that of his first Doctor Who appearance. The design has been described as \\"an iconic piece of sci-fi culture\\". A writer for Wired attributes much of Jack's appeal to the coat: \\"I think it has lots to do with that coat he always wears. Coats are cool, just like fezzes and bow ties and Stetsons. The only difference is that Captain Jack doesn't ever tell you his coat is cool. It just is.\\" In fact, in her essay \\"Fashioning Masculinity and Desire\\", Sarah Gilligan attributes Torchwoods popularity‚Äîas well as that of the character‚Äîto the costume. She credits the greatcoat with helping to fashion the character's masculinity, and argues that Jack's costume creates its own discourse \\"through which costume drama and Post Heritage cinema's escapism flows\\". During Jack's initial appearances in Doctor Who, Russell T Davies held a \\"half-hearted\\" theory that Jack would dress specific to the time period he was in, to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes. He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode \\"Boom Town\\" and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits that this was a \\"bit of a lame idea\\" and decided that Jack \\"never looked better than when he was in his World War II outfit\\". From the pilot of Torchwood onwards, Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that \\"We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour.\\" Because the character was expected to \\"be running around a lot\\", Holman redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less \\"weighty\\". Jack's other costumes are \\"loosely wartime based\\", such as the trousers are \\"getting more and more styled to suit his figure\\". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The \\"hero version\\" is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with pre-shrunk fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two \\"stunt coats\\" that had been \\"hero coats\\" in the first series.\\" Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character \\"likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity\\". Julie Gardner describes the coat as \\"epic and classic and dramatic\\", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack \\"a sweep and a presence\\". For Miracle Day, Davies commissioned new costume designer Shawna Trpcic (previously costume designer for Angel, Firefly and Dollhouse) to create a new greatcoat design. This was partially motivated by Los Angeles' warmer climate; shooting in Wales had necessitated Barrowman be fit in much warmer clothing. The new coat is custom made by Italian designers, and is actually cashmere-blend wool where the previous one had been cotton. Trpcic says that she \\"just wanted to modernise it, give it a more modern fit, but leave the drape and keep it cape-like\\". Trpcic felt prepared for the job of redesigning the coat because of her prior work on Firefly, tailoring for Nathan Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds: \\"I'm kind of used to iconic captain's coats and the importance of staying loyal to what the fans expect and to what we need\\". Journalist Maureen Ryan commented that the new coat is \\"greatly improved\\" and the redesign \\"gives the coat the kind of movement and swagger Jack brings with him on every adventure\\". =Development= The character is described as both \\"lethally charming ... good looking and utterly captivating\\", as well as \\"flirtatious, cunning, clever and a bit of an action man\\". Within Doctor Who, Jack's personality is relatively light-hearted, although this changes in Torchwood's first series, where he becomes a darker character. In Torchwood's first series, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof. In Torchwood, he would occasionally inquire or muse about the afterlife and religion, sympathising with a man's desire to die. Returning in Doctor Who Series Three, Jack indicates he now maintains a less suicidal outlook than before. In the second series of Torchwood, Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again, after appearances in Doctor Who where he was reunited with the Doctor. In the third series of Torchwood, the audience sees some of Jack's \\"darker side\\", as well as \\"the secrets that Jack has, the pressures, drama and the trauma he's carrying on his shoulders\\". Lynnette Porter comments on Jack's relation to scholar Lord Raglan's theses on 'the hero' in fiction. Because Jack is immortal and always comes back from the dead, Porter argues that Jack cannot literally fulfil the \\"physical death aspect\\" of Raglan's criteria for a hero. However, Jack instead has several symbolic deaths. For instance, in the last scene of Children of Earth. Porter observes that camera angles emphasise Jack's profile as solitary man atop a hill in Cardiff, departing. This scene of \\"going away for good\\" against the backdrop of the city he has long protected, hints at the death of the Captain Jack persona; in Porter's words, \\"the immortal captain \\"dies\\" at the top of a hill in Wales at the conclusion of the \\"epic\\" miniseries\\", \\"epic\\" traditionally being the genre of heroism. The American political blog Daily Kos states Jack \\"can certainly be characterised as a Byronic hero, a tragic figure with a streak of melancholy, heroic yet misunderstood, bold yet rash. Most importantly, his sexuality is one single aspect of a much more complex, flawed character.\\" G. Todd Davis examines the ways in which Jack conforms to the Byronic hero character trope. Physically, he identifies Jack as dark-haired and strikingly handsome, with masculine physique; he is intelligent and aware of it, to the point of a superiority complex; he demands unquestioning loyalty, has guilty secrets in his past, and is self-sacrificing. For this, Davis lists Jack alongside Milton's Satan from Paradise Lost, Shelley's Prometheus, and also Angel from Buffy, amongst others. As a show, Torchwood is highly intertextual. The consequence of this is that many sides of Jack are shown across various media. One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes. The character's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences, would later shape his appearances both as a traditional \\"action hero\\" and as a positive role model for younger viewers. Barrowman also remarks that \\"The beauty of Captain Jack, and one of the reasons why I think, as an actor, I've landed on my feet, is that he's popular with one audience in Torchwood and with another in Doctor Who.\\" Moral ambiguity In several instances in Torchwood, Jack displays no qualms about killing a person of any species, which within Doctor Who, allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot. Barrowman remarks, \\"He'll do things the Doctor won't do ... [such as] fight. Jack will kill. And the Doctor, in a way, knows that, so he lets Jack do it. I'd say Jack's the companion-hero.\\" A flashback in the third series of Torchwood shows Captain Jack sacrificing twelve children to aliens in order to save millions of lives. Davies feels that the third series of Torchwood is a \\"tale of retribution and perhaps redemption\\" for Captain Jack, who experiences \\"maximum damage\\" when his lover Ianto is killed. Davies chose to have Ianto die so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his grandson in order to destroy the same aliens. When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series of Doctor Who, he is told \\"don't you dare\\" when pointing a gun, and scolded when contemplating snapping the Master's neck. Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen in Torchwood, Jack shoots his killer in the forehead, killing him in an act of swift revenge. Whilst the Doctor scolds Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute (an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive), Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor's image; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th-century Torchwood. Actor Gareth David-Lloyd describes the 19th century Torchwood as \\"quite ruthless and quite evil\\" and \\"on the other side\\" from Jack and the Doctor. Through Jack, whose perspective is widened by his experiences in other planets and times, the organisation was able to grow less jingoistic. One academic article, which compares Torchwood to the American drama series 24, opines that Jack's attitudes make the show's ethos largely antithetical to that of 24. Because Jack explores the \\"complexity of negotiating differing worldviews, cultural values, beliefs, and moral codes\\" through a framework established by the Doctor, to \\"value life, support democratic principles and egalitarianism, and protect those who cannot protect themselves\\", consequently \\"The world of Torchwood is depicted, not as the dichotomous \\"us\\" (or United States) and \\"other\\" of Jack Bauer's 24, but as the omnipolitical, omnisexual, omnicultural world of Jack Harkness.\\" Porter finds, however, that like Bauer, Jack saves the world using similarly morally grey means when he tortures Beth the sleeper agent, in \\"Sleeper\\", in order to avert an interplanetary attack. Although science fiction heroes have, Porter argues, \\"grown greyer over time\\", Jack represents as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, resulting in a full \\"devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero\\". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says \\"when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I had to look at it from the point of view of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'.\\" For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him \\"a benchmark for [morally] grey heroes\\"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as \\"villainous or downright monstrous.\\" Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he \\"loved\\" the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying \\"He saved every single child in the world! If you would fail to do that then you‚Äôre the monster, frankly. It‚Äôs this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get.\\" When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled \\"Redemption\\", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial. Face of Boe Russell T Davies referred to a scene in \\"Last of the Time Lords\\" as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character \\"the Face of Boe\\" (a large, mysterious disembodied head in a glass case) as a consequence of his immortality and slow aging. The Face first appeared in the 2005 episode \\"The End of the World\\", appearing three times and maintaining a presence through to the end of the 2007 series. Barrowman described himself and David Tennant as being \\"so excited\\" to the extent where they \\"jumped up screaming\\" when they read Jack's line regarding the Face of Boe, remarking \\"It was probably the most excitable moment we had during the shooting of that series.\\" The Face of Boe had originally been a throwaway line in a script for \\"The End of the World\\"; because creating the character seemed expensive, the Face of Boe was nearly discarded and replaced. However, special effects designer Neil Gorton loved the idea and pushed to make sure the character lived. Davies loved Gorton's design and to his surprise, the character was written into future episodes and became pivotal in the third series. In a spin-off novel, The Stealer of Dreams (2005), Captain Jack makes a reference to the Face of Boe as a famous figure. Davies conceived the idea that the two characters might be connected midway through the production of the 2007 series. Barrowman states that when fans ask him if Jack is really the Face of Boe, he tells them he believes he is and states that he and Davies hold it to be true \\"in [their] little world\\"; the link is \\"unconfirmed\\" within the text of the show. As to how Jack becomes the Face, Barrowman feels the answer doesn't matter as it is intentionally mysterious. Barrowman likes the characters being connected because it means in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack, \\"Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information\\" which he feels is a \\"wonderful twist of events\\". However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack really is the Face of Boe, stating \\"the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies\\". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two. In relationship to Miracle Day, where Jack becomes mortal, critics approached Barrowman and Davies about the implications of such a move for Jack's potential future as the Face of Boe. Barrowman stated that the open-ended rules of the science fiction genre meant that Jack could still become the Face of Boe even after Miracle Day. By contrast, Davies was keen to emphasise that the possibility of Jack becoming the Face of Boe remained \\"conjecture\\", and that the possibility remained that Jack would not survive Miracle Day, adding \\"You know how I love killing people off.\\" =Relationships= Ianto In a Doctor Who Magazine interview, Barrowman described Jack's love for Ianto as \\"lustful\\", and explained \\"I don't think he'd settle down with Ianto. He might do, but he'd let Ianto know that he [Jack] has to play around on the side\\". The Torchwood Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date, after finding out Gwen is engaged. John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined in an interview at Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman said in an interview that Ianto \\"brings out the \\"human\\" in [Jack]\\" and \\"brings out more ... empathy because he‚Äôs actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... [which] makes him warm to other people ... [and] makes him more approachable.\\" In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that \\"I think Ianto‚Äôs always made him care and that is really the heart of the show.\\" However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is \\"serious and committed\\", but while dancing with Gwen in \\"Something Borrowed\\", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a \\"recreational activity\\", and considers it \\"obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen\\".Walker, pg 197 The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is \\"just a shag\\", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his \\"boyfriend\\". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play \\"The Dead Line\\" (just prior to Children of Earth), however, Jack insists \\"You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones. Not to me.\\" Just as Jack and Ianto's relationship is developing, Ianto dies, in Children of Earth (2009). While some fans felt \\"cheated\\" at not seeing the relationship develop further, Davies explains his intention was to heighten the tragedy by it also being a loss of potential, stating \\"You grieve over everything they could have been. Everything you hoped for them.\\" For dramatic purposes within the story, Davies explains that Ianto's death was necessary so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his own grandson. Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the lack of resolution for the love story is \\"part of the tragedy\\". Lynnette Porter feels that Ianto's demise is intended as a watershed moment where Jack loses his effectiveness as a hero. At least for a time, a grieving Jack loses his focus and gives up; within a few months, Jack flees Earth and his role as the expected hero. Some fans were displeased by Ianto's death scene and the end of the relationship, and some even accused one the writers of \\"deliberately egging on the shippers'\\". Subsequent to Ianto's death, in \\"The End of Time\\" (2010), the Doctor sets up Jack with a new romantic interest, Alonso Frame (Tovey). Fans of Ianto, who felt cheated by the character's death, disliked this development. GayNZ.com compared the situation to Buffy fans' reaction to Willow's relationship with Kennedy (Iyari Limon) in Buffys seventh season, following Tara's death in the show's sixth. Ianto makes a post-death appearance in 2011 audio drama \\"The House of the Dead\\". Encountering Ianto's spirit at a haunted location in Wales, Jack and Ianto are permitted a final goodbye. Without Ianto in his life, Jack wishes to be swept up into the Cardiff spacetime rift as it closes in an attempt at suicide. Ianto tricks Jack into leaving the House of the Dead, however, despite the possibility of resurrection. As they are forced to part forever by the closing of the rift, the couple declare their love for one another for the first and last time. Gwen Barrowman states in a behind-the-scenes featurette that Gwen brings a \\"little bit of soul\\" back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a \\"palpable love\\" and opines that \\"with Jack and Gwen, it‚Äôs the real thing and they‚Äôre going to make you wait for that.\\" The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode \\"Ghost Machine\\" as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of \\"her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour\\", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: \\"the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him ‚Äì it'd be hard not to\\". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a \\"compelling trickster\\", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his \\"outrageous flirting\\". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of \\"steady prince\\" for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, \\"he'd have to commit completely\\"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could \\"never afford to do anything more\\". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, \\"there‚Äôs two different sorts of love going on there\\", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy. A press release for Torchwood Series Four states that Jack is brought back to Earth because of his \\"unstated love\\" for Gwen, who in turn still feels for Jack and misses the exciting life she once led beside him.Torchwood The New World, Press Release. Starz.com. Whilst Miracle Day lead writer Russell T Davies states in response to a question posed by AfterElton that he \\"hates\\" the idea of romantic tension between Gwen and Jack, executive producer Julie Gardner answers by stating \\"They love each other. Of course they do.\\" Myles believes that in series four, Gwen and Jack have a \\"love-hate-love relationship\\" resembling in different ways a sibling relationship, a marital relationship and also \\"the strongest friendship\\". Episode seven of Miracle Day features a scene where Jack threatens Gwen with violence after she states she would have him killed to save her daughter. Writer Jane Espenson explains that the two characters have different needs and that this means they inevitably \\"clash like steel blades\\". Simon Brew of Den of Geek praises the dynamic between Gwen and Jack in series four, describing them as \\"a terrific double act\\" and states that \\"Torchwood is at, or near, its best when the two of them are working in tandem\\". Other Discussing whether his character could ever find \\"The One\\", John Barrowman asserts that Jack \\"likes everybody, and his love for each person is different\\". Barrowman believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but \\"would never take that beyond infatuation\\" and \\"would never let the Doctor know\\". Barrowman claims that Jack also \\"fancies\\" fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her \\"tenacity\\" and willingness to \\"spat with him\\", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as \\"fatherly\\", stating \\"He was guiding them. That's why it was so devastating for him to lose them.\\" The second series of Torchwood also introduced Jack's ex-lover, Captain John. Head writer Chris Chibnall introduced John to act as a \\"proper nemesis, somebody to really test [Jack], to push him, and to reveal something about Jack's character\\". In the use of Captain John as a literary foil, Chibnall comments \\"you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably did, for a little while\\" which underlines how \\"Jack, in his experiences with the Doctor and Torchwood, made a very conscious decision to move away from that behaviour.\\" In their academic publication, Queer TV, Glyn Davis and Gary Needham discuss Jack's role within Torchwood as a post-gay, romantic hero. Noting Torchwood's central gay themes, they comment that \\"it is through the character of Captain Jack that Torchwood is able to mine its queerness.\\" Discussing Jack's brief romance with his namesake, the real Captain Jack (Matt Rippy), academic critics have noted that \\"The Captain Jacks both share the same name and are quite similar in physical appearance, thus literalising the homo-ness of the situation. Through the time-travel device this points to a narcissistic self-fascination, the old clich√© that homosexuality is the love for sameness.\\" Other relationships which have been described or alluded to (both in the television series and other media) include ex-girlfriends Estelle Cole, Duchess Eleanor, Stella Courtney, and Lucia Moretti, ex-boyfriends and Angelo Colasanto, as well as an unnamed ex-wife. Describing the patterns of his relationships throughout the series, Davis and Needham draw the conclusion that \\"while Captain Jack desires both men and women, his long-term love affairs and onscreen kisses are mostly with men in the past and present.\\" Davies himself laments that this one of the pitfalls of writing a bisexual character, commenting \\"The trap you fall into with bisexual men is only having them sleep with men.\\" Commenting on the show's postmodern attitude towards bisexuality, or in what Russell T Davies calls \\"omnisexuality\\", they continue to remark that \\"His character brushes against definitions of queer sexuality in that he resists any sort of classification based on sexual orientation.\\" They also comment on the subtexts of particular episodes, such as gay time-travel romance episode \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\", and within that the relevance of time-travelling Jack Harkness to tackle the question of forbidden gay attraction in what is post-Brokeback television. In Understanding TV Texts by Phil Wickham, Wickham opines that Captain Jack explicitly \\"brings to the fore\\" with his \\"brazen bisexuality\\", \\"something we have to come to expect [from Russell T Davies] as viewers of his work\\". Fans expressed fear that an Americanized fourth series of the show would mean the show would no longer portray Jack's bisexuality, but Davies assured interviewers that Jack's interests in both men and women would be honoured. Critical reception and impact Portraying Harkness has raised John Barrowman's profile. Following the character's initial introduction in the revived series 1 of Doctor Who, the character became incredibly popular with fans, to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin-off series, Torchwood, primarily centred around the character. The Times described the undeniable success of the character as having propelled actor John Barrowman to \\"National Treasure status\\". For his role as Captain Jack, John Barrowman was nominated for Best Actor at the 2007 BAFTA Cymru Awards, and again for Children of Earth at the 2010 TV Choice Awards, against Eleventh Doctor actor Matt Smith. Harkness was also listed number nine in TV Squad's \\"Ten Most mysterious characters on television\\", behind the Tenth Doctor, who was listed number three. John Barrowman, who is himself gay, has ranked in the Independent on Sunday Pink List, a list of the most influential gay people in Britain, in 2007, 2008, and 2009 with the Independent commenting that \\"Proof of his popularity came with the continued runaway success of his bisexual Captain Jack Harkness on Russell T Davies's Torchwood\\". Part of Jack's mystique was his sex appeal, swashbuckling heroism and sexual appetite. In anticipation of the character's return to Doctor Who in series 3 after a successful run in the first series of Torchwood, mainstream media hailed his return. Captain Jack has gone on to become a recognisable figure in the British public consciousness, and has attracted some parody. These parodies frequently echo criticisms both of the character and of Barrowman's portrayal. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers. Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campness, as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him. In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen, a race of cyborgs from Doctor Who. Satirical technology columnist Verity Stob wrote a parody of Torchwood Season One in the style of Dylan Thomas's radio play Under Milk Wood, called Under Torch Wood. This parody described Captain Jack as \\"the insomniac bicon; snug as a hobbit, pretty as a choirboy, immortal as carbon dioxide, wooden as a horse.\\" Barrowman's ubiquity, however, has even provoked criticism of the character. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror, in his review of Children of Earth, said \\"Unlike David Tennant's Doctor, Barrowman's endless appearances on friendly drivel like Tonight's the Night, The Kids Are All Right and Any Dream Will Do, is so over- exposed, 'Captain Jack' is about as intriguing or alien as a Weetabix and twice as irritating. Unlike Tennant, as an actor he is just not good enough.\\" Television journalist Charlie Brooker, in his Screenwipe review of 2009 criticised Barrowman, with focus on his acting. \\"Harkness is of course a man of mystery. You can't tell what he's thinking just by looking at his face... no matter how hard Barrowman tries.\\" The character's recognisability extends outside the UK. In a Halloween episode of the 2008 series of American drama Knight Rider, character Billy Morgan (Paul Campbell) dresses up as Captain Jack, whom he refers to as \\"the time-travelling bisexual\\". Jack represents a new character archetype, which other writers have begun to draw from. For example, comic book writer Peter David reflects that in writing Marvel Comics character Shatterstar, he \\"to some degree... key[s] his personality off Captain Jack Harkness\\" insofar as he is \\"swashbuckling, enthusiastic and sexually curious about anything with a pulse\\". In 2009, Barrowman's variety show Tonight's the Night broadcast a specially written humorous Doctor Who scene scripted by Russell T Davies. In the scene, Barrowman appears initially as Captain Jack confronting an alien on board the TARDIS who claims to be the Doctor. However, David Tennant appears as himself and John Barrowman is revealed as playing Captain Jack in the TARDIS set. Action figures have also been created in the actor's likeness, which Barrowman says was a \\"longtime dream\\". In the media, Jack is described as both the \\"first openly gay companion\\" and as a \\"hunky bisexual\\". Jack's notability is largely due to his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television, for whom sexual identity is \\"matter-of-fact\\", and not an issue. The ordinariness with which Jack's orientation is regarded within Doctor Who embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of homosexuality. The distinct flexibility of Jack's sexuality contributed directly towards the character's popularity and public interest. The overtness of Jack's sexuality broke new grounds, the labels \\"pansexual\\" and \\"omnisexual\\" being applied to the character on occasion. In \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips, the latter being the first same-sex kiss in the history of the program. Despite the boldness of the first lesbian, gay or bisexual character in the series' run, there has been very little uproar about the character, although there was some controversy at the time of Jack's introduction. Speculating, Barrowman tries to link Jack's popularity with this portrayal, noting \\"I think audiences just get Jack because he's honest ... to finally see a character who doesn't care who he flirts with, I think is a bit refreshing.\\" The presence of the character in prime time television sparked discussion of the nature of bisexuality in a number of outlets where normally it is dismissed or overlooked. Channel4.com cites Jack as a positive role model for gay and bisexual teenagers, where little had been present for this audience in years gone by and subsequently leading to a greater culture of tolerance. Dr Meg-John Barker writes for the Journal of Bisexuality that although \\"the b word does not actually get used during the show\\", Jack is one of the first positive and clearly bisexual characters on British television. She does point out however that Jack retains some elements of bisexual stereotyping, particularly in his \\"flamboyant\\" promiscuity. Jack has also been cited in America to contrast the portrayals of non-heterosexual characters in mainstream television in the US and the UK. Gary Scott Thompson, producer of the 2008 revival of Knight Rider, said, \\"If I could use Jack in Torchwood as a role model‚ÄîI would absolutely use him as a role model‚ÄîI love his conflictedness about ... everybody\\". Readers of AfterElton.com voted Jack the tenth best gay or bisexual television character of all time, the poll itself ultimately being won by Brian Kinney, a character from the North American version of Queer as Folk which was developed by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman from the British series created by Russell T Davies. The website praised Jack‚Äîone of only two bisexual characters on the list of 25‚Äîfor being having both \\"tough\\" and \\"tender\\" sides to his personality, as seen in the Torchwood episode \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\". Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating Hellblazer's John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a \\"'post-gay' approach to sexual themes\\" and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance. For the AfterElton 2008 Visibility Awards, Jack won the award for Favourite TV Character. The website commented that \\"unlike virtually every other TV sci-fi character, lead or supporting, Captain Jack is also openly bisexual. Ironically, this \\"small\\" change served to help make the science fiction genre, long the ultimate bastion of straight men, accessible not just to LGBT people, but also straight women, who also enjoy the show‚Äôs alternate take on sexuality.\\" The third award won for Torchwood, after Favourite TV Drama and Character, was won by Jack and Ianto for Best Couple, for which the editor commented \\"Torchwood is revolutionary not just because the producers dare to put openly bisexual (or in Jack's case \\"omnisexual\\") characters in the formerly sacrosanct setting of sci-fi; it's also that it presents these bisexual characters in such an amazingly matter-of-fact way. There's no apologi[s]ing, no minimi[s]ing, and no morali[s]ing‚Äîjust good, old- fashioned romance and adventure.\\" References External links * Captain Jack Harkness on the BBC's Doctor Who website * Captain Jack Harkness on the BBC's Torchwood website Category:Doctor Who companions Category:Fictional pansexuals Category:Fictional military captains Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional characters who committed familicide Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing Category:Fictional characters with death or rebirth abilities Category:Fictional con artists Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Fictional World War I veterans Category:Fictional World War II veterans Category:Fictional characters from the 6th millennium Category:Male characters in television Category:Torchwood characters Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Fictional bisexual males Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional LGBT characters in literature Category:LGBT characters in comics ","title":"Jack Harkness"},{"id":"1919763","text":"General James White Memorial Civic Auditorium and Coliseum (usually shortened to Knoxville Civic Coliseum) is a multi-purpose events facility in Knoxville, Tennessee, owned by the Knoxville city government and managed by SMG.

At one time, the facility also hosted ETSU's football team, but the school discontinued its football program at the end of the 2003 season as a cost-cutting measure. The football team was reinstated in 2015, but did not return to the facility; the Buccaneers played the 2015 and 2016 seasons at Kermit Tipton Stadium, a local high school facility, before opening the new William B.

Interior of ETSU/MSHA Athletic Center History Dominating the campus skyline, the building was opened in 1977 largely as an attempt to increase attendance at the university's struggling football program and to help its recruiting, but also as a large, multi-purpose campus building. The contract ran both well over budget and the allotted time, with the eventual opening occurring two football seasons later than had been planned. The building has had its successes but never truly put the Buccaneer football program on the map, despite being one of very few on-campus domed stadiums in the United States. The decision was made by ETSU president Dr. Paul Stanton for ETSU to drop football following the conclusion of the 2003 season. For the 2006‚Äì2007 academic year and basketball season, the Mini-Dome's occupancy was decreased to around 6,800 due to fire code restrictions. Efforts are underway to build a true basketball arena on campus, but the Mini-Dome will likely remain intact due to the large number of offices and training facilities it contains, as well as the enormous cost of demolition. In 2006‚Äì2007, ETSU made an attempt to bring back the football program, but it failed when the student body voted down an increase in the athletic fee that was needed to fund it. The Mini-Dome was not considered as a possible venue for the new program.

Hilton Coliseum, commonly Hilton Coliseum, is a 14,384-seat multi- purpose arena located in Ames, Iowa. The arena opened in 1971. It is home to the Iowa State University Cyclones men's and women's basketball teams, wrestling, gymnastics and volleyball teams. Overview The building was constructed in 1971 as part of the Iowa State Center, an athletic and cultural events area located southeast of the main campus. The Coliseum was named after Dr. James H. Hilton, ISU's president from 1953 to 1965, who pushed for the construction of the facility. The Iowa State Center also includes Jack Trice Stadium, C.Y. Stephens Auditorium, Fisher Theater and Scheman Continuing Education Building. Hilton Coliseum and Jack Trice Stadium replaced the Iowa State Armory and Clyde Williams Stadium, at the corner of Union Dr. & Sheldon Ave. The first band to ever perform at the Hilton Coliseum was Meloncolony, a band composed of Midwest natives: Chuck Vail (singer), Wayne Groff (organ), Matt Peterson (bass), Clint Dudley (guitar), and Bob Curtis (drums). The band performed at an event organized by the YMCA to both entertain and encourage 2,300 locals to register to vote. Of the 2,300, 200 people registered that night. Phish played the arena in both 1996 and 1999. The arena hosted the 1972 NCAA basketball tournament Midwest Regionals, as well as the 1982, 1988 and 1993 NCAA wrestling championships. The arena is also the site of the annual Iowa All State Music Festival. It has also hosted commencements, concerts, conventions and other assemblies. A record basketball crowd of 15,000 saw the Cyclones post a 97-94 win over Iowa in 1971. Until Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines was built, Hilton Coliseum was Central Iowa's premier entertainment venue.  Hilton Magic  \\"Hilton Magic\\", the power of the Coliseum faithful to produce unexpected victories, was first recognized by Des Moines Register sportswriter Buck Turnbull. On a Feb. 14, 1989, showdown with No. 3 Missouri, the Cyclones conjured up the spirit of the Hilton crowd to produce a stunning 82‚Äì75 victory. The following day‚Äôs headline read ‚ÄúHilton Magic Spells ‚ÄòUpset‚Äô One More Time.‚Äù In the article, Turnbull called for more ‚ÄúHilton Magic‚Äù in the Cyclones‚Äô upcoming bout with Oklahoma State, which had pummeled ISU, 102‚Äì74, just three weeks earlier. On cue, ‚ÄúHilton Magic‚Äù displayed its powers, as the Cyclones defeated the Cowboys, 90‚Äì81, marking a 37-point reversal from the season‚Äôs prior meeting. Hilton Coliseum was specifically built to hold in sound with a solid concrete structure, steel doors, and a crowd that sits just a few feet from the court. With a fan base that frequently ranks among the nation's largest crowds, players from opposing teams, as well as Iowa State, have said that the floor has shaken due to the loudness of the crowd. After more than two decades, the term ‚ÄúHilton Magic‚Äù still applies today. This reality was never more apparent than ISU‚Äôs school-record 39-game homecourt winning streak that ended during the 2001-02 season. The streak, which spanned four different basketball seasons, was the second-longest in the nation at the time. In 2003-04, Iowa State went 17‚Äì1 in Hilton, recording the second-best single-season home win total in school history. In 2011-12, Iowa State went 16‚Äì2 with second year head coach and Iowa State alum, \\"The Mayor\\" Fred Hoiberg.

Hilton also houses a weight room, training room, media room, and the newly refurbished offices of the women's volleyball team. Men and women's basketball offices were relocated to the Sukup Practice Facility on its completion. The men‚Äôs team has compiled a 112‚Äì24 (.824 winning percentage) home record during the last eight years. Iowa State has posted 10 or more home victories in the last 14 seasons. Hilton Magic has been ever-present recently, helping the Cyclones tally a school-record 39 consecutive wins in the facility. The Cyclones went undefeated at home during the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons and increased their winning streak to 30 games at the beginning of the 2001-02 campaign. Iowa State and Hilton broke NIT attendance marks in 2004. The Cyclones drew 12,196 and 14,020 fans in their two NIT games they hosted, averaging 13,144 fans per contest.

It was created by German figure skater Werner Rittberger, and is often called the Rittberger in Europe. It also gets its name from the shape the blade would leave on the ice if the skater performed the rotation without leaving the ice. The skater executes it by taking off from the back outside edge of the skating foot, turning one rotation in the air, and landing on the back outside edge of the same foot. It is often performed as the second jump in a combination. History The loop jump is an edge jump in the sport of figure skating. It was created by German figure skater Werner Rittberger, and is often called the Rittberger in Europe.Media Guide, p. 13 According to U.S. Figure Skating, the loop jump is \\"the most fundamental of all the jumps\\". According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, the jump also gets its name from the shape the blade would leave on the ice if the skater performed the rotation without leaving the ice.Kestnbaum, p. 285 In competitions, the base value of the single loop jump is 0.50; the base value of a double loop is 1.70; the base value of a triple loop is 4.90; and the base value of a quadruple loop is 10.50. =Firsts= Russian figure skater Evgeni Plushenko (2005) The first triple loop was completed by American Dick Button during the 1952 Winter Olympics. The first woman to perform a triple loop was Gabriele Seyfert, from East Germany, in 1968. Russian skater Evgeni Plushenko was the first to complete a loop jump in combination, a double loop, with a quadruple toe loop and a triple toe loop, at the 1999 NHK Trophy. Plushenko was also the first to complete a triple loop jump in combination, with a quadruple toe loop and a triple toe loop, at the Cup of Russia in 2002.Media Guide, p. 14 Yuzuru Hanyu from Japan was the first skater to complete the quadruple loop, at the Autumn Classic International in 2016. Execution The loop jump is an edge jump.Kestnbaum, p. 284 The skater executes it by taking off from the back outside edge of the skating foot, turning one rotation in the air, and landing on the back outside edge of the same foot. Atlantic Monthly, in its description of all jumps, states, \\"An easy way to remember this jump is that it's basically a toe loop without the assist of the toe pick\\". The jump is usually approached directly from back crossovers, which allows the skater to establish his or her upper body position while gliding backwards on his or her right outside edge before springing into the air. The loop is more difficult than the toe loop and salchow because the free leg is already crossed at takeoff, so the rotation is begun from the edge of the skating foot and the upper body. The coordination and weight shift does not need to be exact while performing the loop, so many skaters consider it an easier jump than the flip and Lutz. It is often performed as the second jump in a combination because it takes off from the same edge as \\"the standard jump landing\\". Kestnbaum states, \\"The fact that the free leg remains in front makes both controlling the landing of the first jump and generating the lift and rotation for the second more difficult than when a toe loop is used as the second jump\\". A loop jump is considered incorrectly done if the takeoff is two-footed, meaning that the free foot does not leave the ice before the takeoff.

Nicknamed The Hump, it is home to the Mississippi State Bulldogs men's and women's basketball teams. It is the largest on-campus basketball arena in the state of Mississippi. The building is the equivalent of seven stories high and is in the shape of an oval 318' long by 268' wide. The outside is marked by regular concrete columns and Mississippi red brick siding, and the school seal adorns the front of the building. In 2004, a center hung scoreboard was provided by the Henry Mize Foundation. The scoreboard featured four sides, each with a video screen. It was replaced in 2015 by a similar but updated scoreboard that includes two ring displays along with four main video displays. The current court design was announced in 2016, with the court itself installed in 2017. It features many design details highlighting the school's local ties. The playing area is surrounded by lettering that lists all 82 counties in the state, all appearing in gray except for the school's home of Oktibbeha County, which is in white lettering at midcourt between the team benches. Directly above the Oktibbeha County name is a white outline of the state with an \\"X\\" marking Starkville's location, which is also the point at which substitutes report to enter the game. Also, the city nickname of \\"Starkvegas\\" appears in large all-caps lettering at the baseline in front of the student section. In addition to basketball, the arena is a popular venue for concerts, graduation ceremonies, and other events. It was named for George Duke Humphrey, president of Mississippi State from 1934 to 1945. It replaced Mississippi State Gymnasium (now known as McCarthy Gymnasium), which was built in 1950 and has since been converted to an indoor tennis center.

It is home to the Clemson University Tigers men's and women's basketball teams. It is also the site of Clemson graduations and the Clemson Career Fair. It is owned and operated by Clemson University and hosts more than 150 events per year including concerts, trade shows, galas, and sporting events. History Littlejohn Coliseum was first opened in 1968.\\"Coliseum to be new, improved and ready to go\\". By Dan Hope, Anderson Independent Mail, July 03, 2016 It was named for James Corcoran Littlejohn, class of 1908, the school's first business manager, who was instrumental in many of the school's early building projects, including the building it replaced, Clemson Field House, and Memorial Stadium. He was an avid supporter of Clemson athletics. Littlejohn Coliseum from the inside (2003-2015 configuration) Littlejohn Coliseum from the outside The Tigers played their home games in the coliseum, at times giving the ACC powers Duke and North Carolina close games. The record for attendance was 13,863 when Clemson won over first place Duke in overtime on January 9, 1980. Until the 1998 completion of the Bi-Lo Center in Greenville, it was the largest arena in the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson market. Littlejohn Coliseum has been the scene of 43 Clemson wins over ranked teams, including a victory over #1 Duke in 1980, a 75‚Äì65 victory over #1 North Carolina in 2001, and a 74‚Äì47 victory over #3 Duke in 2009. Both the men's and women's basketball teams have won roughly 75% of their games played in Littlejohn. In January 2010, it hosted ESPN's College Gameday for a game against Duke. Littlejohn Coliseum was renovated and reopened on January 5, 2003. The overall building square footage was increased from 95,000 to 167,500. The square footage for both the training room and weight room was increased eightfold, while the media facility was increased by 3.5 times. Over of curtain wall as well as a new 700-ton roof were added. Fan amenities were also renovated, as restrooms were tripled and concessions areas were doubled. The renovations included all new purple cushion seats with orange tiger paws and a new playing floor. The cost of the renovation ‚Äì $31 million ‚Äì was approximately ten times that of the original building cost. As well as sports, in its 50 year history, Littlejohn Coliseum has hosted many concerts by musical groups, including Allman Brothers Band, Chicago, R.E.M., Def Leppard, Huey Lewis and the News, Fleetwood Mac, David Lee Roth, Rod Stewart, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice in Chains, 311, Fall Out Boy with Plain White T's and Young Wild Things Tour, Evanescence, Lee Brice, and many others. It annually hosted FM 93.3 The Planet's \\"Birthday Bash.\\" In 2011, Clemson announced a $50 million athletic building plan. As a part of this plan, Littlejohn Coliseum was renovated. An additional practice facility was built at the southwest corner of Littlejohn Coliseum. Cost for the project was estimated at $5 million. The renovation was completed with an opening ceremony on October 14, 2016. The construction project cost a total of $63.5 million.\\"Top-seeded Kansas to face upstart Clemson in Midwest\\".

It is home to the BYU Cougars men's and women's basketball teams. The seating capacity for basketball games at the Marriott Center is officially 18,987. The largest basketball arena in the West Coast Conference (in which BYU competes for most sports, except football), it is among the largest on-campus basketball arenas in the nation. In addition to basketball, the Marriott Center is used for weekly devotionals and forums. The elevation of the court is approximately above sea level. History The Marriott Center was named in honor of benefactor and hotel tycoon J. Willard Marriott, founder of the Marriott Corporation. When the arena opened in 1971, it passed the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena as the largest college basketball arena in the nation. It was also the largest venue in the nation built for basketball, larger than any NBA (or ABA) arena at that time. It lost both distinctions when the University of Kentucky opened Rupp Arena in 1976, but remained as the largest basketball-specific facility on a U.S. college campus until 1987, when the University of Tennessee opened Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena. The Marriott Center, circa 1971 Prior to 1971, the Cougars played basketball games at Smith Fieldhouse, which remains the primary venue for volleyball and gymnastics. The court was replaced in 2003 with a permanent floor. The Marriott Center hosted the West Regionals of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament four times (1972, 1977, 1979, 1982), and the Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament in 1988.

Joyce Athletic & Convocation Center, often called the Joyce Center, formerly the Athletic & Convocation Center, is a 9,149-seat multi- purpose arena in Notre Dame, Indiana just north of South Bend. The arena opened in 1968. It is home to the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish basketball and volleyball teams. The main arena, Phillip J. Purcell Pavilion, is located in the southern portion of the facility. The northern portion housed a hockey rink until October 2011. It also houses the Castellan Family Fencing Center and Rolfs Aquatic Center (which was added on in 1985) in the rear of the building. Location It is located across a pedestrian arcade from Notre Dame Stadium, and the center's two domes could easily be seen rising above the stadium's east side prior to its expansion. History The building, designed by architects at Ellerbe Architects of Saint Paul, Minnesota, was built in 29 months, and opened the first week of December 1968 as the Athletic & Convocation Center. It was renamed in 1987 to honor the Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C., Notre Dame's executive vice president from 1952 to 1987. Prior to the building of the Joyce Center, the basketball team played in the Notre Dame Fieldhouse, which opened in 1900. The Fighting Irish Hockey team played in the North dome from 1968 to 2011. They moved to the Compton Family Ice Arena in October 2011. The last hockey game at the Joyce Center was played on October 15, 2011 (Ohio State beat Notre Dame 4-3). ND's Austin Wuthrich scored the last goal at the Joyce Center. =Renovation= The Purcell Pavilion in 2013. In the fall of 2006, the university announced major renovation plans for the Joyce Center. In 2009, the south dome, which houses the basketball arena, underwent a $24.6 million renovation and was renamed Purcell Pavilion, after Philip J. Purcell, a Notre Dame alumnus, trustee, and current chair of the athletic affairs committee. Architectural firm HNTB studied the center after the university began considering renovations in 2001 and worked on the project. Phase 1 of the project was completed in October 2009, with its first event, the women's volleyball \\"Dig Pink\\" match for Breast Cancer between Notre Dame and Seton Hall, taking place on Halloween. The first basketball game took place the following night as the Fighting Irish men's squad faced Lewis University in an exhibition contest. Due to the renovation, the capacity of Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center dropped from 11,418 to 9,149.Notre Dame Basketball Quick Facts A new video scoreboard over center court was installed prior to the 2010‚Äì2011 basketball season. Major upsets Notre Dame has a rich tradition of ending winning streaks at the Joyce Center, with victories over eventual national champions, defending NCAA titlists, and number-one-ranked teams. Some of the notable streaks the Irish have ended include: *In 1971, the Irish gave UCLA its only loss of the season. *3 years later, after UCLA had won 88 straight games since the 1971 ND victory, the Irish again beat the Bruins and ended UCLA's NCAA record 88-game winning streak. *In 1977, the Irish upset previously undefeated #1-ranked University of San Francisco. *In 1980, the Irish upset previously undefeated #1-ranked DePaul. *In 1987, the Irish upset #1-ranked North Carolina 60-58. *In 1991, the Irish upset #2-ranked UCLA. *In 2005, the Irish ended Boston College's Big East record 20-game winning streak to start the season. *In 2011, the Irish ended a 21-game losing streak against the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers. *In 2012, the Irish upset previously undefeated #1-ranked Syracuse, 67-58. *In 2013, the Irish beat the Louisville Cardinals 104-101 in a 5-overtime game.

Cagliari, Sardinia Lucifer of Cagliari (, ; died 20 May 370 or 371) was a bishop of Cagliari in Sardinia known for his passionate opposition to Arianism. He is venerated as a Saint in Sardinia, though his status remains controversial. Life Lucifer first appears in history as an envoy from Pope Liberius to the Emperor Constantius II, requesting the convening of a church council.\\"Lucifer (bishop of Cagliari).\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Available online . At the Council of Milan in 355, he defended Athanasius of Alexandria against Arian attempts to secure his condemnation by Western bishops. It was reported that Constantius II, a supporter of Arian theology, confined Lucifer for three days in the Imperial Palace, where Lucifer continued to argue vehemently on behalf of Athanasius.Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone. \\"Lucifer.\\" Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (pp. 841). Second Edition. New York: Oxford University Press, 1984.

McGraw-Hill Co., New York, 1967. Copyright by The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. He was banished first to Germanicia, the see of bishop Eudoxius, thereafter to Palestine and finally to the Thebais in Egypt. While in exile, he wrote fiery pamphlets to the Emperor in which he proclaimed himself to be ready to suffer martyrdom for his beliefs. Disciple of St Eusebius of Rome, he became a scholar in Greek and Hebrew languages, and then was baptized by the Pope Eusebius. St Lucifer wrote a well documented Vita S. Eusebii Vercellensis (from Latin, \\"Life of Saint Eusebius of Vercelli\\"). After the death of Constantius and the accession of Julian the Apostate, Lucifer and other expatriated bishops were allowed to return from exile in 361 or 362.Schaff, Philip. \\"Principal Works of St. Jerome.\\" Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church (Volume VI, pp. 319).

However, he would not be reconciled to former Arians.LECLERCQ, H. \\"Lucifer of Cagliari.\\" Catholic Encyclopedia (Volume IX, pp. 410). Robert Appleton Company. New York, 1907. Available online <>. He opposed the Bishop Meletius, who came to accept the Nicene creed (and for that was driven out by Arians). Although Meletius had the support of many proponents of Nicene theology at Antioch, Lucifer put his support behind the Eustathian party which had unflinchingly stood by the Nicene creed, and prolonged the schism between Meletians and Eustathians by consecrating without licence a Eustathian, Paulinus, as bishop. He subsequently returned to Cagliari where, according to Jerome, he died in 370.Jerome, Chron. Ol. CCLXXXVII 2 He may have been excommunicated as is hinted in the writings of Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of Hippo, as well as Jerome, who refers to his followers as Luciferians. There is extant a work known as Libellus precum, which was written by two Luciferian clergy called Faustinus and Marcellinus. Jerome discusses Lucifer and his supporters in his polemic Altercatio Luciferiani et orthodoxi (\\"Altercation of a Luciferian and an Orthodox\\"), as well as describing the bishop's career in De Viris Illustribus (chapter 95). Alban Butler writes on the life of Athanasius of Alexandria, that Lucifer of Cagliari and some other bishops refused to accept back the bishops who accepted the Arian position. The lapsed, not withstanding their repentance, could no longer be admitted in the rank of bishop or priest. St. Athanasius condemned this excessive severity; and in 362 assembled the Council of Alexandria, at which assisted St Eusebius of Vercelli, in his return from banishment from Thebais, and St. Asterius of Petra. This synod condemned those who denied the divinity of the Holy Ghost, and decreed that the authors of the Arian heresy should be deposed, and upon their repentance received only to the lay-communion; but those prelates who had fallen into it only by compulsion, and for a short time, should, upon their repentance, retain their sees. (Conc. t. vii. pp. 73 and 680.) Butler, Alban, Butler's Lives of The Saints, \\"St. Athanasius\\" Alban Butler writes of the life of Saint Jerome as he reflects on the history of the Council of Alexandria in 362: This indulgence, of forgiveness offered to the repentant Bishops, displeased Lucifer, Bishop of Cagliari, a person famous for his zeal and writings against the Arians, in the reign of Constantius. St. Jerome composed a dialogue against the Luciferians, in which he plainly demonstrates, by the acts of the Council of Rimini, that in it the bishops were imposed upon.Butler, Alban, Butler's Lives of The Saints, \\"St. Jerom\\" Constantius, for the purpose of wearying out the orthodox bishops (Sulpitius Severus says: E.H.., ii, 41), delayed allowing the bishops home, keeping them there for several months until they finally accepted the Sirmian Creed.T. Gilmartin, Manual of Church History, Vol.1, Ch XVII, 1890 Works Lucifer of Cagliari's surviving writings, all of which date from the period of his exile, are directed against Arianism and reconciliation with heresy. His works are written in the form of speeches delivered directly to Constantius and repeatedly address the emperor in the second person throughout. His main writings are Moriundum esse pro Dei filio (The Necessity of Dying for the Son of God), De non conveniendo cum haereticis (On not Coming Together with Heretics), De regibus apostaticis (On Apostate Kings), De non parcendo in Deum delinquentibus (On not Sparing those who Commit Offences Against God) and the two books of Quia absentem nemo debet iudicare nec damnare, sive De Athanasio (That No One Ought to be Judged or Condemned while Absent, or Concerning Athanasius). His texts quote extensively from the Bible and so are useful as sources for the Vetus Latina. Also extant is a pair of letters which are allegedly correspondence between Lucifer and the emperor's secretary Florentius on the subject of some of Lucifer's inflammatory works that he had sent to Constantius. Veneration Lucifer's status as a Saint is a matter of controversy. According to John Henry Blunt's 1874 Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, Ecclesiastical Parties, and Schools of Religious Thought, A chapel in Cagliari's cathedral is dedicated to a Saint Lucifer. Marie Josephine Louise of Savoy, wife of Louis XVIII of France, is buried there. Opinions about Lucifer vary among Catholics who know of him; some consider him to have been \\"the champion of correct belief against Arianism and friend of St. Athanasius,\\"BENIGNI, U. \\"Cagliari, Archdiocese of.\\" Catholic Encyclopedia (Volume III, pp. 139). Robert Appleton Company. New York, 1907. Available online <>. while others consider him to have been a religious fanatic who ferociously berated his opponents.

Stony Brook men's and women's basketball teams played at Pritchard Gymnasium as the Stony Brook Arena was being renovated. Pritchard Gymnasium became known for its significant home-court advantage. From 2011 to 2014, the Stony Brook's men's basketball team had a 37‚Äì3 record at home. The lobby of the Sports Complex. Stony Brook University Swimming Pool University Pool is the home to Stony Brook's women's swimming & diving program. The pool was recently renovated and opened in April 2017. The Stony Brook University and the Department of Athletics held an official ribbon-cutting ceremony to re-open University Pool on Monday, May 15. The Seawolves' swimming and diving program was placed on competitive hiatus in 2012-13 following the announcement of critical maintenance renovation to University Pool. The renovations began in January of 2015 when the existing pool was completely demolished, including the removal of the existing pool deck level. Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center The Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center was officially opened on June 6, 2012 with a dedication ceremony. The 8,000 square-foot facility is named after Stony Brook alumnus Glenn Dubin, who made a $4.3 million donation for the construction of the project, which is the largest private donation ever to an athletics department within the State University of New York system. The world-class facility is located inside the Indoor Sports Complex and overlooks Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium. The new strength and conditioning facility includes 37,280 pounds of cutting-edge strength & conditioning equipment, a state-of-the-art audio visual system for filming and training, a designated plyometric area for speed and sprint work, a nutritional oasis, a furnished office area, a large storage room and an outdoor patio area.

The \\"O'Dome\\" is located on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus. The Stephen C. O'Connell Center, also known as the O'Dome, is a 10,133-seat multi-purpose arena located on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, Florida. The facility is named for the sixth president of the university, Stephen C. O'Connell, who served from 1967 to 1973. The facility is located on the northern side of the university's campus, between its football field, Ben Hill Griffin Stadium at Florida Field, and the James W. \\"Bill\\" Heavener Complex athletic training center. The entire facility was known as the O'Connell Center from 1980 until 2016. The building underwent a major $64.5 million renovation / reconstruction during that year, and Exactech, a Gainesville medical firm, signed a $5.9 million, 10-year naming rights deal for the main arena, which was officially renamed the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center. Florida Gators home arena The Exactech Arena at the O'Connell Center is the home arena of several of the university's Florida Gators intercollegiate sports teams, including the men's and women's college basketball, gymnastics, swimming and diving, and volleyball teams. The facility was quickly dubbed the \\"O'Dome\\" by students, a nickname that is still in use. ESPN The Magazine nicknamed it the \\"House of Horrors\\" in 1999, a name that the sports teams began using promotionally a few years later. The student section of the stadium has been dubbed the \\"Rowdy Reptiles\\". ESPN commentator Dick Vitale, on assignment at the Florida-Kentucky game in 2006, said that the Rowdy Reptiles make the O'Dome one of the toughest places to play in college basketball. On December 23, 2006, a then-record crowd of 12,621 watched the fifth-ranked Gators defeat the third-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, 86‚Äì60. The two teams would meet again that season for the National Championship game, with the Gators, once again, emerging victorious as the first back-to-back National Champions since Duke in the early 1990s. This attendance record was broken, however, on February 5, 2011 in a 70‚Äì68 Gator victory over the 11th-ranked Kentucky Wildcats, as 12,633 attended the game. Other uses In addition to sports, the O'Connell Center regularly hosts many other events on campus. It is the largest concert venue in North Central Florida and has been the venue for a wide variety of performances, included a 2006 show by Gainesville native Tom Petty that aired on PBS's Soundstage TV series. Other events held at the facility include University of Florida graduation ceremonies, trade shows, career fairs, political rallies, public speeches, and various large banquets and private events.

The Florida Gym was built in 1949, and it was considered a difficult venue for opponents because the seating was very close to the court and, when full, the noise level was \\"deafening\\". However, it was also small, un-air conditioned, and had very few amenities, and it was compared to a \\"dismal and dreary\\" high school gym by observers. By the early 1970s, Florida was the only school in the Southeastern Conference without a modern basketball facility, a factor that affected the recruiting of top players and held back the growth of its long- mediocre basketball program. =UF / USF collaboration= In 1975, the University of Florida Athletic Association decided to seek funds to build a new facility for UF's indoor sports programs. The University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa had also decided to build a large indoor arena at about the same time, so the schools agreed to commission a common architectural design to stretch limited state funding. As originally constructed, USF's Sun Dome (now known as the Yuengling Center) and UF's O'Connell Center featured almost identical inflatable roof systems and main arenas. The primary difference was that the O'Connell Center included training areas and facilities for other sports around the main arena while USF added these facilities to the Sun Dome in a later expansion. The $15.6 million O'Connell Center broke ground in October 1977 in a parking lot across the street from Florida Field. Construction was delayed on both the Sun Dome and the O'Connell Center when cracks appeared in precast concrete support beams. The problems were fixed after several months, and the sister facilities were completed within a few weeks of each other in late 1980 ‚Äì the Sun Dome in November and the O'Connell Center in December.Walbolt, Dan (Interviewee) and Huse, Andrew T. (Interviewer), Dan Walbolt oral history interview by Andrew Huse, July 13, 2004 (2004).Digital Collection ‚Äì USF Historical Archives Oral Histories. Paper 194. The first event at the Stephen C. O'Connell Student Activities Center (as it was originally known) was a Florida men's basketball game held on December 30, 1980. It was officially dedicated a few weeks later in January 1981. =Effect on basketball program= The new arena had an immediate positive effect on Florida's men's basketball program, and its first recruit was former coach Norm Sloan. Sloan had been Florida's coach in the 1960s but had left for North Carolina State, winning a national championship with the Wolfpack in 1974. He returned to Florida in 1980 and was thus the Gators' coach during the first season played in the new O'Connell Center. Sloan explained that he had \\"enjoyed it tremendously when I was here before, and I always felt that if Florida had the proper facility, I would consider coming back.\\" Playing in their new arena under Sloan, the Gators consistently improved and eventually made their first NCAA Tournament in 1986, setting the stage for greater success under subsequent coaches in the years to come. Design and renovations The O'Connell Center was envisioned as a competition and practice facility for most of the university's indoor sports programs, and this has been the case throughout its existence. The large () Exactech Arena is the core of the building, and is surrounded by a basketball practice court, a natatorium, as well as gymnastics practice facilities. =Original roof= When it first opened, the O'Connell Center had an inflatable Teflon roof and a system of blowers and air handlers that kept the inside air pressure high enough to hold the flexible roof in place. This higher air pressure was not noticeable inside of the facility, but opening a door to the outside would result in a rush of air escaping the building, so revolving doors were installed at each of the four main gates to lessen the loss of pressure as thousands of fans entered or exited. Maintenance costs for the inflation system rose over the years, and as part of a $10 million renovation in 1998, the roof was replaced with a more conventional hard shell dome. Though no longer in use, the old blowers and duct work for the inflation system remained in place until the facility was extensively renovated again in 2016. =Minor renovations= After the 1998 redesign of the roof, the facility underwent a smaller renovation in 2006, when the university updated some of the fold-able seating and replaced the four scoreboards located above Gates 1 through 4 in each corner of the arena. The old dot matrix boards were removed and replaced by modern video boards that could display instant replays and video presentations. Following the men's basketball team's victory in the national title game of the 2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, the University Athletic Association (UAA) bought the temporary hardwood floor that had been installed in the now-demolished Indianapolis RCA Dome for the Final Four. Although the national finals logos were removed by sanding, the basketball teams play on the same lumber on which the Gators won their first basketball national championship from 2011 to 2016. The UAA also bought the court used to win their second title from the Georgia Dome in 2007, and displayed it in the O'Connell Center during their championship celebration event, and later sold it in pieces to raise funds for scholarships.Palm Beach Post: April 6, 2007-Floor For Sale =2016 rebuild= In March 2016, the O'Connell Center began a $64.5 million reconstruction / renovation project which included major updates to its layout and design. Led by contractors from Brasfield & Gorrie, the entire interior area of the arena, excluding foundation work, was demolished and rebuilt with the addition of a large hanging scoreboard and a luxury club with box seats. Locker rooms and meeting rooms were upgraded, swimming and gymnastics areas were revamped, and a \\"grand entrance\\" was built facing Ben Hill Griffin Stadium across the street, among many other improvements. When it reopened in December 2016, a naming rights deal with local medical firm Exactech changed the name of the main arena to the Exactech Arena at the Stephen C. O'Connell Center.

Tucker Civic Center, is a multi-purpose indoor arena located on the Florida State University campus in Tallahassee, Florida. The arena has the biggest capacity of any arena in the Florida Panhandle. The arena opened in 1981 and was built at a cost of over $30 million, financed by the city. In 2013, the venue was purchased by the Florida State University Board of Trustees. The facility is located on the southeastern side of the university's campus, between the FSU College of Law and the future home of the FSU College of Business. The arena is also located on the \\"Madison Mile\\", an economic development that connects the venue and Doak Campbell Stadium. About the arena The arena is home to the Florida State Seminoles men's basketball and Florida State Seminoles women's basketball teams. Covering , this versatile Arena can accommodate 1,000 people for banquets and receptions for up to 2,000. The arena has upholstered seats for sporting events, concerts, touring Broadway productions and family shows. The arena can increase the capacity with risers. Risers are usually added on to the side of the arena wall blending in perfectly with the permanent seats. Risers are usually only given out to the events of wrestling, basketball and sometimes, concerts. The arena can be configured in a variety of seating arrangements for each type of event. As a concert venue, the arena can seat between 2,372 and 12,041. As a convention center, it can accommodate 18,900 square feet (1760 m¬≤) in the main arena plus 35,000 square feet (3300 m¬≤) at the adjoining exhibit hall, in addition to 16,000 square feet (1500 m¬≤) of space at the meeting rooms. Concerts, sporting events, trade shows, Broadway shows, conventions, ice shows, circuses, and other events are held here annually. The Centre Theater is a 6,000-seat theater configuration used for small concerts, preaching and other theater type events. The theater provides not only a traditional counterweight system for shows accustomed to a conventional theatre venue, but also a perfect setting for musical artists that prefer a more intimate performance space. It is equipped with a state-of-the-art sound system capable of providing reinforcement for upper level and club seat fill, as well as motorized clusters that may be utilized for additional support. The Centre Theater has been proud to host the Tallahassee Broadway Series for the last 11 years and has presented such tours as Les Mis√©rables, Riverdance, Cats, Beauty and the Beast, Chicago, Fosse and Rent. In addition, numerous musical artists have chosen to perform in this configuration. =Renovations= Prior to the summer of 2014, much of the existing infrastructure and equipment in use had been there since the arena opened in 1981. This included some equipment that was so outdated that it couldn't be replaced. Further deferred maintenance occurred while the arena was owned by Leon County and the City of Tallahassee. FSU gave the arena a major renovation during the summer of 2014. The arena received new seats, Jumbotrons including new LED ribbon boards, and a new floor, all at the cost of $10 million. Before then, the only renovation occurred in 1998, when the facility's roof was replaced. History Banners hanging at the arena The arena was named the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center in 1977 in honor of Donald L. Tucker, Esq., a former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and Special Ambassador for the United States to the Dominican Republic. Upon opening, the venue was named the Tallahassee-Leon County Civic Center. In 2001, the Florida Senate proposed reverting the civic center to its original name; however, this provision was vetoed. The center reverted to its original name in January 2012. The venue was owned by the Tallahassee Leon County Civic Center Authority until 2012. The Civic Center has been the home to many sports teams. It has had WCW Thunder, WWF SmackDown! and WWE Live Events, including men's and women's basketball tournaments. It is also home to the Florida State Seminoles men's and women's basketball teams. Before they moved, it was also host to the Tallahassee Tiger Sharks ice hockey team of the ECHL. Other professional teams that called the center home included the Tallahassee Thunder of AF2 and the Tallahassee Scorpions soccer team of the EISL. In 2007 it was home to the Tallahassee Titans of the American Indoor Football Association. The team then left the AIFL for the World Indoor Football League but then folded after the owner failed to acquire enough capital to finance the team. The WIFL then folded as other members jumped to other leagues. The Tallahassee Tigers were a planned ABA team that could not find a home in the arena due to the Seminoles' basketball season conflicting with the Tigers' schedule. As a result, the team never made their anticipated 2007 debut in the ABA. =Notable shows= * October 11, 1981: The Kinks - Give the People What They Want Tour * October 29, 1981: The Beach Boys * April 9, 1982: Rush - Signals Tour * June 9, 1982: Iron Maiden - The Beast on the Road tour * October 31, 1983: The Police - Synchronicity Tour * April 3, 1985: Prince - Purple Rain Tour * November 7, 1985: Tina Turner - Private Dancer Tour, supported by Mr. Mister * October 10, 1988: AC/DC - Blow Up Your Video Tour * May 10, 1990: Aerosmith - Pump Tour * December 9, 1991: Van Halen - For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour * February 4, 1993: Metallica - Wherever We May Roam Tour * December 2, 1993: Nirvana - In Utero Tour * April 9, 1994: Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream Tour * October 19, 1996: Toni Braxton ‚Äì Secrets Tour * October 29, 1996: Phish * August 13, 1999: The Moody Blues - Strange Times * December 16, 1999: WWE Smackdown * April 1, 2004: Aerosmith - Honkin on Bobo Tour * June 10, 2007: T-Pain - Epiphany Tour * February 10, 2008: Larry the Cable Guy * February 29, 2008: Keith Urban/Carrie Underwood - Love, Pain and the Whole Crazy Carnival Ride Tour * March 23, 2008: Elton John * November 8, 2008: Trans-Siberian Orchestra * December 2, 2008: Avenged Sevenfold/Shinedown - Avenged Sevenfold Tour * January 16, 2009: TobyMac - Portable Sounds Tour * January 27, 2009: 3 Doors Down * May 4, 2010: Carrie Underwood - Play On Tour * February 24, 2012: Drake - Club Paradise Tour * February 28, 2012: Jimmy Buffett - Lounging at the Lagoon Tour * March 9, 2012: Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Beethoven's Last Night Tour * March 24, 2012: Eric Church - The Blood, Sweat & Beers Tour * May 17, 2012: Miranda Lambert - On Fire Tour * October 19, 2012: T.I. - War Chant (FSU Homecoming) * February 21, 2013: Zac Brown Band * February 24, 2013: Jeff Dunham - Disorderly Conduct Tour * September 5, 2013: Jason Aldean - Night Train Tour * January 24, 2014: Brad Paisley - Beat This Winter Tour * October 24, 2014: Jake Owen - Days of Gold Tour * April 21, 2014: Wiz Khalifa * April 25, 2014: Darius Rucker * September 9, 2014: Fitz and The Tantrums * March 26, 2015: Eric Church - The Outsiders Tour * May 7, 2015: Riot Games - The first League of Legends Mid- Season Invitational * November 12, 2015: Zac Brown Band - Jekyll and Hyde Tour * October 28, 2016: Lil Wayne/Rich Homie Quan * January 27, 2017: Florida Georgia Line - Dig Your Roots Tour * February 19, 2017: TobyMac, Matt Maher, Mandisa, Mac Powell, Capital Kings, Ryan Stevenson, Hollyn - Hits Deep Live See also *Florida State Seminoles *List of convention centers in the United States *List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas References External links * Donald L.

The arena opened in 1964. It is home to the University of Georgia Bulldogs basketball and gymnastics teams. It was also the venue of the rhythmic gymnastics and preliminary indoor volleyball matches during the 1996 Summer Olympics, as well as the 1989, 1995, and 2008 NCAA gymnastics championships. As a multi-purpose facility, the Coliseum also hosted a variety of other kinds of events, including many large indoor rock concerts during its early history, as well as the university's Graduate School commencement exercises. At its opening it replaced Woodruff Hall, a 3,000-seat field house built in 1923. Design The ceiling is barrel-shaped, with the Sanford Drive side being curved as well. The resulting inside seating is in a \\"U\\" shape, with the flat end, which includes the scoreboard, not having the upper levels of seating. The Sanford Drive side was decorated with the Olympic insignia and other markings for the 1996 Olympics. Also, the roof is a separate structure from the coliseum itself, and is connected by an aluminum bellows which allows the roof to rise and fall with the temperature. The roof has four outward supports in an arc style, which were often used in fraternity initiations until gated off. The former Georgia Coliseum received its current name on March 2, 1996, in honor of Herman Stegeman, a longtime basketball coach at UGA who was a pioneer in the development of the original Southern Conference basketball tournament in 1921. Renovations The university has undertaken several renovations. Originally, Stegeman Coliseum had a stage at one end. Today, a scoreboard, a new section for student seating and banners commemorating the accomplishments of the teams that call Stegeman Coliseum home occupy that space. In anticipation of the 1996 Olympic Games, Stegeman Coliseum received new scoreboard systems, including the first video replay board in an SEC basketball venue. In 2000, all of the old, wooden seats in the lower level were removed, the concrete was resealed, and new cushioned seats were installed. More recently, new LED \\"ribbon\\" boards have been installed around the upper ring of the Coliseum (not a 360-degree ribbon but three segments of ribbon on each of the non-video-board sides). The building has also undergone several cosmetic changes to the exterior in the past few years. Currently, the university has preliminary plans to undertake a drastic overhaul of the building, including dropping the event level down several feet to increase capacity. In October 2006, an adjoining practice facility for men's and women's basketball and gymnastics was finished. The Coliseum underwent a $13 million expansion and renovation after the 2009‚Äì10 season. The main concourse level of approximately was fully renovated, including modernization and addition of restrooms, upgrades to concession area, a new merchandising area, a first aid room, a new ticket sales area, and new graphics and way finding signage. Also included were of expanded lobby space (including both sides) and of renovated concourse, restrooms, and concessions. Renovations began on May 12, 2010, and were functionally complete in time for the 2010‚Äì11 basketball season. The expansion was officially dedicated on January 18, 2011. Notable events Georgia upset arch-rival Georgia Tech in the Coliseum's first game on February 22, 1964, 81‚Äì68, under the leadership of head coach Harbin \\"Red\\" Lawson. The inaugural game set an attendance record of 13,200 that has never been surpassed. The original design afforded the Coliseum 11,200 seats, but in the excitement of the opening of \\"The Jewel of North Georgia\\", officials let anyone come inside that showed up. This would be the first and the last time that this was done. The Coliseum also hosted the Mideast Regional of the 1971 NCAA men's basketball tournament. The Western Kentucky Hilltoppers won the regional with an 81‚Äì78 win in overtime over the Ohio State Buckeyes. At the close of the 2014-2015 season, Georgia's men's basketball teams had amassed a home record of 484 wins and 221 losses (.686). On April 13‚Äì16, the arena hosted the inaugural FIRST Robotics Competition Peachtree District State Championship. 41 teams from the state of Georgia attended the championship, with Global Dynamics, East Cobb Robotics and Walton Robotics winning the event. In addition, Kell Robotics won the District Championship Chairman's Award, one of the most prestigious awards in the FIRST Robotics Competition.2016 Peachtree District Rankings: http://frc- districtrankings.firstinspires.org/2016/PCH/GACMP They, along with 8 other teams, qualified for the 2016 FIRST Championship2016 Peachtree District State Championship Results: http://frc-districtrankings.firstinspires.org/2016/PCH See also * List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas References Sources *1996 Summer Olympics official report.

For nearly eighty years it was the home ground of Wimbledon Football Club, from September 1912 until May 1991, when the club moved their first team home matches to Selhurst Park as part of a groundshare agreement with Crystal Palace. Both clubs' reserve teams then used Plough Lane as their home ground until 1998, when the site was sold to Safeway. Whilst site redevelopment plans were negotiated, the stadium remained derelict for several years until it was finally demolished in 2002. The site then became a private housing development known as Reynolds Gate, completed in 2008. Plans to build a new stadium for AFC Wimbledon on the nearby site of the Wimbledon Greyhound track, approximately 200 yards from the original Plough Lane stadium, were approved by Merton Council in December 2015. Construction on the 'New Plough Lane' began in 2018. History =As Wimbledon F.C.'s home ground= The leasehold on the disused marshland at the corner of Plough Lane and Haydons Road was purchased by Wimbledon Football Club in 1912. The pitch was consequently fenced in and the playing surface improved, while a dressing room was built. A stand holding 500 spectators was erected, and Wimbledon played their first match at the ground on 7 September 1912, a friendly match against Carshalton Athletic which was drawn 2-2. Improvements continued to be made to the ground during the First World War, and Plough Lane soon became the pride of the club ‚Äî in 1918, Vice-president A. Gill Knight boasted that the club had \\"the finest ground in the southern district\\". During the 1920s, crowds were regularly taken at between five and eight thousand. The South Stand was added in 1923, purchased from Clapton Orient. The terrace in front of the North Stand was improved during 1932-33, and by the start of the Second World War the ground's capacity stood at 30,000. The ground was even used as the site of an amateur international match, when England took on Wales on 19 January 1935. However, damage caused during the Second World War meant that extensive redevelopment was necessary after the club returned in 1944 ‚Äî the South Stand had been bombed, and the incomplete fencing meant the club could not charge for admission. Half-time collections were taken to keep the club operating. The South Stand was restored to its former glory in 1950, and 1950-51 saw the capacity back around the 25,000 mark. Glass panels were fitted at each end of both stands two years later, at the cost of ¬£90, 8s ‚Äî a sum equivalent to ¬£ in 2009. Floodlights were purchased in July 1954, and the North Stand was completely rebuilt before the 1957-58 season. The ground's freehold was purchased from Merton Borough Council by chairman Sydney Black for ¬£8,250 in November 1959, and then donated to the club. Black announced at the same time that the floodlights purchased five years earlier would be erected on eight pylons the next year at the cost of ¬£4,000. Due to inflation, the price paid by Black for the stadium would have been equal to ¬£ in 2009 ‚Äî this became significant as one of the conditions of the sale of the ground was the insertion of a pre-emption clause stating that if the site was ever to be used for any purpose other than sport, the Council would have the right to buy the ground back for the same price it had been paid, regardless of inflation. As the pound sterling's value decreased over the years, this clause became a double-edged sword ‚Äî it protected the club from asset strippers, but also meant that the stadium's value could never grow above the ¬£8,250 that Black had paid in 1959. The first match under the new floodlights took place on 3 October 1960, in a London Charity Cup match against Arsenal. Arsenal beat Wimbledon 4-1. The ground remained largely unchanged until the club's election to the Football League, though during 1971-72 an attempt was made to start a market on the club's grounds to raise funds. The High Court ruled that this plan contravened a statute decreed by Charles I in 1628 forbidding any market within seven miles of Kingston upon Thames's market‚Äî the court reckoned the distance to be five and a half miles, so no market was built. Despite election to the Football League in 1977 and subsequent success, the club was still plagued by financial trouble. To try and ease the strain on the club, in April 1983 Wimbledon bought out the preemption clause inserted back in 1959 for ¬£100,000. A year later, they sold the ground to club chairman Sam Hammam for ¬£3 million. Following the publication of the Taylor Report in 1990, which introduced new safety measures for football stadia including the regulation that the stadia of teams at the highest level be made all-seater by August 1994, the board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be economically redeveloped to meet the new standards. The work required to modernise Plough Lane would have been difficult and expensive, but not impossible as the board claimed. A supposedly temporary groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park was announced the same year, to begin from the start of the 1991-92 season. This arrangement was only expected to last for a few seasons, but it would ultimately last for 12 years and would end in a very different fashion to what might have been expected at the outset. Wimbledon's final first team match at Plough Lane came on 4 May 1991, coincidentally against Crystal Palace. 10,002 spectators saw Crystal Palace beat Wimbledon 3-0, before swarming onto the pitch to bid farewell to the ground. Plans to build a new 20,000-seat stadium in the London Borough of Merton had been approved by the local council in 1988, but the club did not follow this up and the stadium was never built. A public park was later established on its planned site.Over the next decade, numerous options for a new stadium to be built in either the London Borough of Merton or elsewhere were explored, including a controversial plan to relocate to Dublin] in the Republic of Ireland, which emerged in 1995. Finally, Wimbledon relocated to Milton Keynes some 70 miles away in 2003, in a controversial move which had been approved the previous year and sparked the creation of AFC Wimbledon by the majority of the club's fans. The original Wimbledon club was renamed Milton Keynes Dons in 2004. The new Wimbledon club started life in the Combined Counties League and reached the Football League in 2011. =After Wimbledon F.C.= Even after the departure of the Wimbledon first team, Plough Lane continued to be used by both Wimbledon and Crystal Palace as the home ground for their reserve teams' home matches. This was the case until 1998, when Sam Hammam sold the ground to supermarket chain Safeway. Safeway sought to build a supermarket on the site for four years but, after local residents' opposition and local authority objections to their plans, gave up in 2002. They demolished the stadium during the summer of that year and subsequently sold the vacant site to David Wilson Homes in November 2002. Planning permission was granted to the developer in October 2005 to build 570 flats, and the development was completed in 2008. Following lobbying by Wimbledon supporters, the development agreed to adopt a Wimbledon Football Club theme, with the entire site named \\"Reynolds Gate\\" after former player Eddie Reynolds. The six individual blocks that comprise the development were also named after former players, managers and a chairman: Bassett House, Batsford House, Cork House, Lawrie House, Reed House and Stannard House.

Unlike many other facilities, however, the floor was never lowered for additional seating around the court, which left large areas behind press row, the team benches, and the announcer's table empty during games. University Hall was replaced by the John Paul Jones Arena as the home to the men's and women's basketball teams in 2006.

He played all or part of eleven seasons in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers, serving as those teams' closer for most of his seasons from 1985 through 1997. During his playing career, Worrell was a three-time National League (NL) All-Star. Born and raised in Arcadia, California, Worrell attended Biola University. He seldom pitched until his senior year, but his 94 mile-per-hour fastball caught the attention of a scout for the Cardinals, who made him their first round draft pick in 1982. He was expected to be a starting pitcher, but he was moved to the bullpen in 1985, when the Cardinals called him up for the playoff race. Worrell posted a 2.91 earned run average (ERA) in 17 games at the end of the year. In the 1985 World Series, he tied a World Series record by striking out six consecutive hitters, but the Cardinals lost to the Kansas City Royals in seven games. Still considered a rookie in 1986, Worrell led the NL with 36 saves, winning the NL Rookie of the Year Award and the Rolaids Relief Man Award. He became the first pitcher to start his career with back-to-back 30-save seasons in 1987, and he made seven appearances in the playoffs that year, as the Cardinals lost the 1987 World Series to the Minnesota Twins in seven games. He was selected to the NL All-Star team in 1988 and finished third in the NL in saves, but he then injured his ulnar nerve in 1989, forcing him to undergo Tommy John surgery. The recovery from the operation, as well as a later rotator cuff tear, forced him to miss all of 1990 and 1991. Lee Smith had been acquired to close in his absence, but Worrell served as his set-up man in 1992, posting a 2.11 ERA. After the season, he became a free agent. On December 9, 1992, Worrell signed a three-year contract with the Dodgers. Expected to serve as their closer, he battled injuries his first two years in Los Angeles, prompting the Los Angeles Daily News to call him \\"perhaps the biggest free-agent bust in baseball this season\\" in 1993. However, he was selected to the NL All-Star team back-to-back years in 1995 and 1996, recording 32 saves in 1995 and leading the NL in saves with 44 in 1996. That season, he finished fifth in NL Cy Young Award voting and 21st in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting, as the Dodgers reached the playoffs before getting swept in the NL Division Series by the Atlanta Braves. Worrell pitched one final season, recording 35 saves but posting a 5.28 ERA in 1997 before retiring. Early life Worrell was born on September 28, 1959, in Arcadia, California. His middle name, Roland, was also his father's first name. Worrell was raised in Arcadia, and his father frequently took him to Los Angeles Dodgers games at nearby Dodger Stadium when he was growing up. In 1978, he enrolled as a Bible student at Biola University in La Mirada, California, where he also played baseball. At Biola, Worrell played a number of different positions. He was used mostly as a catcher during his junior year, though he also pitched as a long reliever. As a senior, he was used as a pitcher more often, but he played the outfield on days when he was not pitching. He was throwing up to 94 miles per hour (mph) his senior year, when he caught the attention of Steve Flores, a scout for the St. Louis Cardinals who attended a Biola game to watch Tony Woods of Whittier College play. Flores was impressed with how hard Worrell threw, and the Cardinals selected him in the first round of the 1982 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. Professional career =Minor leagues= The Cardinals were hoping Worrell would be a starting pitcher for them in the future. He began his professional career in 1982 with the Erie Cardinals of the Single-A short season New York-Penn League. In nine games (eight starts), he had a 4‚Äì1 record, a 3.31 earned run average (ERA), 57 strikeouts, 15 walks, and 52 hits allowed in innings pitched. By his second professional season, he was already pitching for the Louisville Redbirds of the Triple-A American Association. Manager Jim Fregosi was impressed with the prospect, saying he had not seen a pitcher with a better arm since he managed Nolan Ryan. Worrell had a 4‚Äì2 record in 14 starts for Louisville, but his ERA was 4.74 and he had almost as many walks (42) as strikeouts (46). He also spent part of the year with the Arkansas Travelers of the Double-A Texas League, posting a 5‚Äì2 record and a 3.07 ERA in 10 starts. In 1984, Worrell made 18 starts for Arkansas again, posting a 3‚Äì10 record, a 4.49 ERA, 88 strikeouts, 67 walks, and 109 hits allowed in innings. His ERA was lower (2.09) in eight games (seven starts) with the St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Single-A Florida State League, where he had a 3‚Äì record, 33 strikeouts, 24 walks, and 41 hits allowed in innings. By 1985, he was \\"languishing in the minors,\\" according to Peter Gammons of Sports Illustrated. \\"I'd throw great for three or four innings every start, then something would happen,\\" Worrell said. He began the season with Louisville as a starter once again, but Fregosi grew tired of waiting for him to improve and moved him to the bullpen in the middle of the season. As a relief pitcher, Worrell struck out 43 batters in about 30 innings before being promoted to the majors for the first time on August 27. =St. Louis Cardinals= Worrell joined a Cardinals team that was fighting to make the playoffs. He made his MLB debut on August 28, 1985, pitching scoreless innings in relief in a 7‚Äì6 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Though no runs were charged to him, he allowed two inherited runners to score as the Reds tied the game. After suffering another blown save on September 8, he picked up his first save on September 13 against the Chicago Cubs, striking out four in innings and allowing only one run, a home run to Jody Davis, in a 9‚Äì3 victory. His ERA was 5.68 through September 8, but Worrell posted a 1.76 ERA thereafter, converting five saves in five opportunities through the end of the year as the Cardinals won the National League (NL) East Division title. In 17 games (all in relief), he had a 3‚Äì0 record, a 2.91 ERA, 17 strikeouts, seven walks, and 17 hits allowed in innings. The Cardinals faced the Dodgers in the NL Championship Series (NLCS), and Worrell pitched in four of the six games of the series, making scoreless appearances in Games 1, 3, and 5. Relieving Joaquin Andujar to begin the seventh inning of Game 6, with the score tied at four, Worrell threw a scoreless seventh inning, then gave up a home run to Mike Marshall to start the eighth. He retired the next three hitters he faced, then got the win after Jack Clark hit a three-run home run in the ninth, helping the Cardinals defeat the Dodgers 7‚Äì5 and win the series in six games. In Game 1 of the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Worrell relieved John Tudor with two outs in the seventh and runners on first and third. After walking Lonnie Smith, Worrell got Willie Wilson to pop out to end the inning. In the eighth, he nearly gave up a home run to George Brett, but Andy Van Slyke caught the ball at the fence, and Worrell earned the save as the Cardinals won 3‚Äì1. In Game 5, he struck out all six batters he faced, but the Cardinals lost the game 6‚Äì1. However, he joined Hod Eller and Moe Drabowsky as the only pitchers to strike out six hitters in a row in World Series play. Worrell relieved Ken Dayley to start the ninth inning of Game 6, with the Cardinals leading 1‚Äì0 and one game from clinching a series victory. The leadoff hitter for Kansas City, Jorge Orta, hit a ground ball to the mound that first baseman Clark fielded, then threw to Worrell, who had covered first. The throw narrowly beat Orta to the base, but umpire Don Denkinger mistakenly called him safe. Worrell went on to allow a couple more runners to reach base, then gave up a pinch-hit single to Dane Iorg that won the game for the Royals by a score of 2‚Äì1. The Cardinals went on to lose the World Series in seven games. By 1986, Worrell was the Cardinals' \\"ace reliever,\\" according to Mitch Lawrence of the Dallas Morning News. On April 10, the St. Louis closer relieved Rick Ownbey with two runners on in the seventh inning of a game against the Cubs, with the Cardinals leading 3‚Äì1. Worrell allowed one of the runners to score but pitched three scoreless innings, earning the save as the Cardinals won 4‚Äì2. Against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 21 and 22, he struck out four batters in and four batters in innings, respectively, earning the win in the first game and the save in the second. He entered another game against the Phillies on July 30 with one out in the seventh, the bases loaded, and the Cardinals only up by two runs. Worrell retired Mike Schmidt and Von Hayes on fly balls without any runs scoring, then threw two more scoreless innings for the save when the Cardinals won 6‚Äì3. Still considered a rookie in 1986, Worrell's 2.08 ERA and league-leading 36 saves netted him that year's NL Rookie of the Year Award, as well as the NL Rolaids Relief Man Award. His 36 saves were a record for MLB rookies at the time, though this has since been surpassed by multiple pitchers. In 74 games, the third highest-total in the NL, Worrell had a 9‚Äì10 record and struck out 73 hitters in innings. Though he had 36 saves, he also blew 10 save opportunities as well. Worrell's 1987 season got off to a \\"poor start,\\" according to the Associated Press; he blew saves in three games in a row from April 29 through May 2 and posted a 10.57 ERA through May 4. Thereafter, he posted a 1.80 ERA in 18 more games through June 10, at which point he had 14 saves, a total only surpassed in the NL by Steve Bedrosian's and Lee Smith's 15. Against the Atlanta Braves on August 29, he entered a game in the ninth inning with runners on second and third, two outs, and the Cardinals up 4‚Äì2. After intentionally walking Ken Griffey, Sr., he got Ted Simmons to fly out to end the inning. On September 19, he relieved Joe Magrane in a game against the Cubs with one out in the seventh, the bases loaded, the Cardinals up 5‚Äì3, and Ryne Sandberg at the plate. Worrell struck out Sandberg and Andre Dawson to end the inning with no runs scoring, then threw two more scoreless innings for the save. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Montreal Expos on September 29, Worrell relieved Greg Mathews with no outs in the seventh, runners on first and second, and the Cardinals up 3‚Äì0. He did not allow either of the runners to score and pitched three scoreless innings for the save. Worrell finished the year with 33 saves, becoming the first major league pitcher to have at least 30 saves in each of his first two full seasons. Only Bedrosian (40) and Smith (36) had more saves than Worrell, but he blew 10 saves as well for the second year in a row. In 75 games, he had an 8‚Äì6 record, a 2.66 ERA, 92 strikeouts, 34 walks, and 86 hits allowed in innings pitched. Winners of the NL East in 1987, the Cardinals faced the San Francisco Giants, whom Worrell had posted a 7.36 ERA against, in the NLCS. Worrell entered Game 1 in relief of Mathews with one out on the eighth and a runner on first with the Cardinals leading 5‚Äì2. He got one out but gave up an RBI double to Candy Maldonado and left the bases loaded before getting replaced by Dayley, who finished the game without letting any more runs score to earn the save. He gave up one run in the final three innings of Game 3, earning the save in a 6‚Äì5 Cardinal victory. In Game 6, Worrell relieved Tudor with one out in the eighth and the Cardinals leading 1‚Äì0. He got the last two outs of the inning and the first out of the ninth, then was replaced by Dayley because a left-hander was due up. Thinking he might want to use Worrell later on if right-handed hitters came up later, Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog left Worrell in the game, moving him to right field. He spent the rest of the game there, as Dayley struck out both of the hitters he faced. The Cardinals won the NLCS in seven games, earning a trip to the 1987 World Series, where they faced the Minnesota Twins. Worrell pitched of an inning in an 8‚Äì4 Game 2 loss, then threw two scoreless innings to earn the save in Game 3. He entered Game 5 in the eighth inning with two outs and the Cardinals up 4‚Äì0 but runners on first and second. Worrell gave up a triple to Gary Gaetti that scored both of the runners, but he got Tom Brunansky to fly out to end the inning, then threw a scoreless ninth to earn the save. In Game 7, Worrell entered in the sixth with the game tied at two, no outs, and runners on first and second. He retired two of the first three hitters he faced, but Roy Smalley walked to load the bases. Then, Greg Gagne hit a sharp ground ball and beat the throw to first base for an RBI single that gave the Twins the lead. That run was not charged to Worrell, but he did allow another run in the eighth as the Twins won 4‚Äì2, clinching a World Series championship for Minnesota. On April 27, 1988, Worrell relieved Bob Forsch with one out in the seventh inning, runners on second and third base, and the Cardinals clinging to a 2‚Äì0 lead over the San Diego Padres. He intentionally walked John Kruk to load the bases, then gave up a sacrifice fly to Garry Templeton. However, he struck out Tim Flannery to end the inning, then pitched two more scoreless innings for the save. Against the Braves on May 27, he pitched two scoreless innings to pick up the save in a 5‚Äì2 victory. He retired all six hitters he faced on June 8, earning the save in a 5‚Äì2 victory over the New York Mets. At midseason, he was a part of the All-Star Game for the first time in his career, throwing a scoreless ninth inning in the NL's 2‚Äì1 loss to the American League. He pitched two scoreless innings to earn a save on September 8 in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Phillies. Worrell finished the year with 32 saves in 41 opportunities; the 32 saves helped him rank third in the NL, behind John Franco (39) and Jim Gott (34). In 68 games, he had a 5‚Äì9 record, a 3.00 ERA, 78 strikeouts, 34 walks, and 69 hits allowed in 90 innings. In 1989, Worrell got a \\"whopping\\" raise according to the Associated Press, as his salary was increased from $215,000 to $875,000; Worrell had threatened to take the Cardinals to arbitration if they did not offer him at least $862,500. On April 8, he threw a season-high scoreless innings in an eventual 5‚Äì4, 12-inning loss to the Phillies. He entered a game against the Expos on June 15 with one out in the ninth, runners on first and second, and the Cardinals trailing 3‚Äì2. Worrell finished the inning without allowing a run to score, then pitched a scoreless tenth, becoming the winner when Tom Pagnozzi had an RBI single in the bottom of the tenth to give the Cardinals a 4‚Äì3 victory. Through July 14, his ERA was 1.14. On September 4, Worrell was pitching for his 127th career save, which would have tied him with Bruce Sutter for the Cardinals' career record. While making a pitch, he injured his ulnar nerve, ending his season. Though he only had 20 saves at that point, he had only blown three all season. In 47 games, he had a 3‚Äì5 record, a 2.96 ERA, 41 strikeouts, 26 walks, and 42 hits allowed in innings. On December 1, he underwent Tommy John surgery, performed by Dr. Frank Jobe, to repair the damage; the recovery kept him out for the entire 1990 season. In 1991, as he was attempting to return, he was diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear. He had arthroscopic surgery to repair it on July 31, forcing him to miss the rest of that season as well. By 1992 spring training, Worrell appeared to have recovered; manager Joe Torre said his fastball and slider were back to their normal speeds. Worrell came back in 1992 but just as a set-up man, as the Cardinals had acquired veteran Lee Smith in his absence; Smith had led the NL in saves in 1991 with 47. Used 10 times in April, Worrell pitched 11 scoreless innings. On August 25, he threw a scoreless ninth and tenth inning in an eventual 5‚Äì3, 13-inning win over the Houston Astros. He had back-to-back saves on September 5 and 6 in consecutive victories over the Giants. On September 24, he threw a scoreless ninth and tenth innings as well in an eventual 4‚Äì3, 14-inning win over the Mets. In 67 games, he had a 5‚Äì3 record, a 2.11 ERA, 64 strikeouts, 25 walks, and 45 hits allowed in 64 innings. Though he was not the closer (Smith again led the NL with 43 saves), Worrell had five saves as well. After the season, he became a free agent. Torre said of Worrell's performance in 1992, \\"He's a perfect set- up man for Smith. I'd like to have him back.\\" Worrell had 129 saves with the Cardinals, briefly the team record until Smith broke it in 1993. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Worrell signed a three-year, $9.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 9, 1992. Because they feared the Braves would sign him, the Dodgers allowed Worrell to skip having a physical examination before signing his contract. Shoulder tendinitis limited him to innings pitched in spring training. He began the 1993 season as the team's closer but hurt his right elbow in only the second game of the year and went on the disabled list, losing the closer role to Gott in his absence. Returning on May 28, Worrell had a 14.40 ERA in five games through June 10 before going on the disabled list again, this time not returning until July 17. His ERA rose to 10.54 on August 5 before Worrell posted a 2.74 ERA over his next 20 games. From September 14 through 22, he converted four saves in five opportunities while Gott was resting with an injured shoulder. Worrell made 35 appearances for the Dodgers in 1993, posting a 1‚Äì1 record, a 6.05 ERA, 31 strikeouts, 11 walks, and 46 hits allowed in innings pitched. He converted five saves but blew three. A 1993 article by the Los Angeles Daily News called him \\"perhaps the biggest free-agent bust in baseball this season.\\" In 1994, Worrell was set to assume his role as the closer. However, he went on the disabled list in May and missed 17 games with a rib-cage pull. After pitching a scoreless inning in his return on May 24, he blew saves in two straight games, then was pulled from a game on May 29 with one out in the ninth after allowing a walk and a single. A disappointed Worrell said after the game, \\"I guess the only way I can respond is to say I've never been taken out of a game before as the stopper. The job of the stopper always has been you win or lose with him. At least, that's the way I've been handled in the past.\\" After that comment, he stopped talking to reporters for about a month. On August 8, after pitching in three straight games, Worrell entered a game against the Colorado Rockies in the ninth inning with the Dodgers leading 6‚Äì3. He allowed three runs before getting removed, and Gott allowed another one of his runners to score, giving him the loss as Colorado won 7‚Äì6. After the game, Worrell finally spoke to reporters again but was critical, saying, \\"If you knew anything about baseball, you wouldn‚Äôt have to hide behind players' quotes.\\" In 38 games, Worrell had a 6‚Äì5 record, a 4.29 ERA, 44 strikeouts, 12 walks, and 37 hits allowed in 42 innings. He converted 11 saves but blew eight as well. In 1995, Worrell opened the year with a scoreless streak, not allowing a run until July. Counting his final game of the 1994 season, he threw scoreless innings, a streak not broken until he gave up a two-run home run to Andres Galarraga on July 1. The Dodger closer again, he had just four saves entering June but saved eight games that month, without blowing an opportunity. For the first time since 1988, he was selected to the NL All-Star team for the second time, though he did not pitch in the game. On July 23, against the Florida Marlins, he entered the game with one out in the eighth, one runner on base, and the Dodgers leading 3‚Äì1. Worrell struck out Jeff Conine but then walked the next two hitters to load the bases. However, he struck out Tommy Gregg to end the inning, then allowed just one run in the ninth, preserving the lead as the Dodgers won 4‚Äì2. He threw a scoreless inning on September 25 to pick up the save in a 4‚Äì3 victory over Colorado. Worrell converted 32 saves in 36 opportunities, ranking fourth in the NL in saves. In 59 games, he had a 4‚Äì1 record, a 2.02 ERA, 61 strikeouts, 19 walks, and 50 walks in innings. Worrell enjoyed what reporter Jason Reid called \\"his best season\\" in 1996. Dating back to September 2 of the previous year, he had a streak of 24 scoreless innings that lasted until Jeff King had an RBI single against him in a 4‚Äì2 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 5. He saved five games from June 13 through June 19. For the second year in a row, he was selected to the NL All-Star team, pitching a scoreless eighth in the NL's 6‚Äì0 victory. In August, he had 10 saves, including saves in six straight appearances from August 22 through August 30. After blowing his ninth save of the year on September 1, he converted his remaining seven save opportunities that month as the Dodgers clinched a trip to the playoffs by winning the NL Wild Card. Worrell finished the season with a career-high 44 saves, tied with Jeff Brantley's total for the NL lead and a Dodger single-season record until Eric Gagne had 52 in 2002. In 72 games, he had a 4‚Äì6 record, a 3.03 ERA, 66 strikeouts, 15 walks, and 70 hits allowed in innings pitched. He finished fifth in NL Cy Young Award voting and finished 21st in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting. Worrell threw a scoreless ninth in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Braves, but that was his only appearance of the series as Atlanta swept Los Angeles in three games. In 1997, Worrell was frequently the subject of booing from the Dodger fans. One of his worst games of the year came in the second game of a doubleheader on September 25, when he entered in the ninth with the Dodgers leading the Pirates by a score of 3‚Äì1. After walking Eddie Williams to lead off the ninth inning, Worrell allowed back-to-back home runs to Joe Randa and Mark Smith as the Pirates rallied to win 4‚Äì3. Though he remained in the closer role all year, manager Bill Russell started bypassing him in favor of Darren Dreifort or Scott Radinsky in September. One highlight for Worrell came on September 5, when he got his 126th save for the Dodgers, breaking Jim Brewer's team record. However, he would only have one more save all season. In 65 games, he had a 2‚Äì6 record, a 5.28 ERA, 61 strikeouts, 23 walks, 60 hits allowed, and a career-high 12 home runs allowed in innings pitched. Worrell had 35 saves but blew nine, topped only by the 11 blown by Greg McMichael of the Mets. He retired following the 1997 season, with agent Rich Bry explaining the decision was because of a desire to spend more time with his family. His 127 saves with the Dodgers were the team's record for a few years, until Jeff Shaw recorded his 128th with Los Angeles in 2001. Pitching style Worrell threw a fastball and slider. A 1986 Sports Illustrated article said he consistently threw in the 93-94 mph range, but Hal Bock of the Associated Press wrote in 1987 that Worrell's fastball travelled 90 mph. When he returned from the Tommy John surgery in 1992, the fastball was travelling at 95 mph, and the slider was averaging 90 mph. Bock wrote that Worrell's fastball dared hitters, as if it were saying, \\"Hit me if you can.\\" \\"When I come in and there are runners on base, I don't think that if they score, they're not credited to me,\\" Worrell said. \\"You have to take a little pride, take the responsibility. They're yours.\\" Personal life Worrell and his wife, Jamie, have three sons‚ÄìJosh, Jeremy and Jacob, each of whom played baseball at Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana. Josh was drafted in the 30th round of the 2009 MLB draft by the Royals and played three seasons in the low minors. Todd's younger brother, Tim, played in MLB from 1993 through 2006, serving as a closer himself with the Giants in 2003 and the Phillies in 2004. After retiring, Todd served as the pitching coach at Westminster Christian Academy in St. Louis. One student athlete he coached, Jacob Turner, went on to be a first-round draft pick by the Tigers in 2009. As of 2020, Worrell's son Jacob is Westminster's pitching coach. Todd also used to be the pitching coach for the River City Rascals, a former franchise in the independent Frontier League. For three years, Worrell served as president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes; he has been involved in the organization for more than 14 years. In 1993, he co-founded ProHunt charities, an organization that has donated to groups such as the Make-a-Wish Foundation, the National Children's Cancer Society, and Kids with Cancer. A passionate hunter, he owns and operates the Firesteel Creek Hunting Lodge north of Plankinton, South Dakota.

One of Scotland's five National Performing Arts Companies, the SCO performs throughout Scotland, including annual tours of the Scottish Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. The SCO appears regularly at the Edinburgh, East Neuk, St Magnus and Aldeburgh Festivals and The Proms. The SCO's international touring receives support from the Scottish Government. The SCO rehearses mainly at Edinburgh's Queen's Hall. History The SCO was formed in 1974, with Roderick Brydon as its first Principal Conductor, from 1974 to 1983. The founding leader of the SCO was John Tunnell, and by 1977 he had been joined by Carolyn Sparey as principal viola, and Haflidi Halgrimsson as principal cello. With Michael Storrs managing the orchestra for much of its first decade, the schedule, which for a while included work as the orchestra for Scottish Opera, offered a full diary of concert performances, recordings and touring. In 1978 there was a tour to Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria, as well as the first of two summers as orchestra in residence for the festival in Aix-en-Provence. A year later a tour of the Scottish Highlands and islands was the first of its kind ever to take place on the islands of the West coast of Scotland, and was followed by the official opening by Queen Elizabeth II of the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh on July 6th. A highlight of the year 1980 was a BBC TV recording with Raymond Leppard of all six Brandenburg Concertos and over the next couple of years the relentless schedule continued with concerts in Barcelona, a residency in the Scottish Highlands, performances at the St. Magnus Festival in Orkney, a recording of Vivaldi‚Äôs Four Seasons with violinist Jaimie Laredo, tours of the UK and Europe with mezzo soprano Teresa Berganza, concerts with the Polish conductor, Jerzy Maksymiuk, and an introduction to the up and coming young English conductor, Simon Rattle in a concert involving the American opera singer, Jessye Norman. Other principal conductors have included Jukka-Pekka Saraste (1987‚Äì1991) and Ivor Bolton (1994‚Äì1996). The American violinist and conductor Joseph Swensen served as Principal Conductor from 1996 to 2005, and is now the SCO's Conductor Emeritus. Sir Charles Mackerras held the position of Conductor Laureate until his death in 2010. The Estonian conductor Olari Elts served as the SCO's Principal Guest Conductor from October 2007 to September 2010. Robin Ticciati was principal conductor from 2009 through 2018. with an initial contract of 3 years. Emmanuel Krivine became the SCO's principal guest conductor in September 2015. In March 2018, Maxim Emelyanychev first guest-conducted the SCO, as an emergency substitute for Ticciati. Based on this appearance, in May 2018, the SCO announced the appointment of Emelyanychev as its sixth principal conductor, effective with the 2019-2020 season. In November 2019, the SCO announced the extension of Emelyanychev's contract as principal conductor through 2025.

He was the chairman of Birmingham City Football Club until 2009. Since 2010, he has been the joint chairman of West Ham United. Early life Gold was brought up in East London at 442 Green Street near to West Ham's Boleyn Ground. He played youth team football for West Ham and was offered forms to sign as an apprentice professional for the first team, which his father refused to counter sign. His father, Godfrey,The Independent: \\"Golden balls: West Ham United's co-owner reveals his cunning plan for the Olympic stadium\\" by Robert Chalmers 19 August 2012 was an East End criminal, known locally as 'Goldy', who spent time in prison during Gold's early years.

GGI was jointly owned by Gold and his brother Ralph, until he bought out Ralph's share in 2008. He co-owned (with brother Ralph) adult magazine company Gold Star Publications (GSP), including printing and distribution businesses, and a stable of titles including Rustler and Raider. He and his brother sold their interests in November 2006. In 2007, the brothers also sold their share in Sport Newspapers, following falling sales and profits. He owned corporate air service Gold Air International until he sold it in 2006 for ¬£4.4m. Football clubs Gold is the former chairman of Birmingham City F.C. In 2007 the Gold brothers were believed to be in the process of selling their share in Birmingham City which followed Birmingham's return from relegation and lower than expected profits. After the club was relegated once again to the Championship in May 2008, Gold was quoted as saying he was considering stepping down as joint head of the board of Birmingham City. He sold his Birmingham City shares in 2009. In May 2005, Gold bought the second FA Cup trophy at auction for ¬£488,620, saying he wanted to prevent it being bought by overseas buyers. In January 2010, Gold and David Sullivan acquired a 50 percent share of West Ham United giving them overall operational and commercial control of the club. They were appointed joint chairmen. They increased their share of the club to 30% each in May 2010 at a cost of ¬£8 million. His time as chairman of West Ham has been conspicuous due to several incidents. In August 2010 his Rolls-Royce Phantom car was attacked by Aston Villa fans outside a pub near Villa Park after West Ham's 3‚Äì0 defeat. The car sustained ¬£8,500 worth of damage. He described the incident as \\"the most frightening experience of my football life\\". In November 2010 Gold criticised Birmingham City's new owners for reneging on their promise to keep him on as chairman following the sale of the club. Birmingham City and their acting chairman, Peter Pannu, responded by banning Gold from their ground St Andrew's for Birmingham City's game against West Ham on 6 November. Gold later issued a personal apology to Pannu on West Ham's own website. After the campaign against Malcolm Glazer's increase in the debt of Manchester United and Portsmouth going into administration in 2010, Gold has advocated regulating football clubs' debts. He feels it is \\"cheating\\" for a team to take on debts which they could never pay off without external assistance and that he \\"fears for the league\\". Personal life In 1957, Gold married Beryl Hunt. They divorced in 1972 after Gold found her cheating on him with his best friend in his swimming pool, on the same day he caught his father stealing his shares. Hunt died in 2003. They had two children: *Jacqueline Gold (b. 1960) is CEO of Ann Summers and Knickerbox Ltd *Vanessa Gold (b. 1966) is the Managing Director of Ann Summers and Knickerbox Ltd.

It was known for poor performance and high costs, something Apple did little to address over its short lifetime, before it was sold off in 1994. DAL is used as the native SQL dialect of the PrimeBase SQL server, as well as the now-defunct Butler SQL. History DAL started as a 3rd-party product, CL/1 (Connectivity Language One), from a small vendor, Network Innovations. Apple purchased the company in 1988,\\"Apple Acquires Network Innovations\\", Wheels for the Mind, Boston College, 1988 during a time that client/server databases were becoming a hot issue in the industry. They released their first version of the re-branded software in 1989, for MVS, and followed with other versions over the next year or so. DAL suffered from most Apple problems of the early 1990s, notably an alternating level of support in which Apple would aggressively promote the product and then ignore it. Throughout, the company struggled with promoting the system as a cross-platform standard, or as a Mac-only technology.Jeff Moad, \\"Apple Says Yes to SQL\\", Datamation, 1990 DAL's release was also coincident with Apple's fall from grace in the business world, and not coincidentally with Microsoft's ODBC efforts. DAL appears to have seen little use, and eventually Apple sold it to Independence Technologies in 1994, during a sell-off of a number of \\"high-end\\" packages such as their X.400 server and an SNA client.\\"Apple Divests Data Access Language, SNAps, take Bedrock\\", Computer Business Review, 26 January 1994 Independence Technologies was a middleware vendor, better known as a major reseller of the Tuxedo product for Unix. In 1995 BEA Systems bought the company, and in turn sold it to UniPrise Systems in late 1996. No releases took place during this period. Description Like Oracle's PL/SQL or Microsoft's Transact-SQL, DAL is essentially an extended version of SQL supporting basic query functionality and adding clean syntax for cursor operations, logic, and loops. When sent a command, early versions of Apple's DAL interpreter broke down the statement and re-built it into subqueries for the underlying data sources. This translation took place on the server-side, just like PL/SQL and Transact-SQL, but required a fairly expensive \\"adaptor\\" program of often dubious performance. This adaptor made DAL considerably less appealing than later systems like ODBC, where the translation normally takes place on the client side and is typically included for free with the database engine. The downside to the ODBC approach is that, theoretically at least, more network bandwidth is used up to pull the \\"raw data\\" to the client machine for processing back into a standard format. On the client end, DAL was originally accessed directly through a system extension, but DAL was later rolled into a single ODBC-like driver layer, the Data Access Manager (DAM). DAM was ODBC-like in concept, but did not include the SQL layers, it was strictly a system for sending \\"opaque\\" queries and receiving result sets. DAM also included the concept of a \\"query document\\" that allowed the DAL (or other) queries to be written in an authoring system and then easily used in any client application. Servers and clients One of the more common clients for DAM was HyperCard. The combination of HyperCard and DAL presented a serious challenge to existing vendors who could offer nothing with a GUI. Apple gave a series of demos of HyperCard/DAL, and soon Oracle Corporation purchased a HyperCard-clone, PLUS from Spinnaker Software, to produce Oracle Card. For much of the 1990s a direct-DAL database server was available on the Macintosh, Butler SQL. However, like any server software on the \\"classic\\" Mac OS, Butler was seriously hampered by the Mac's single-user file system and limited multitasking and could never really deliver the sort of performance the same server would have on Windows NT or Unix. The PrimeBase division of German software developer SNAP Innovation GmbH continues to support DAL in their cross platform SQL database server (originally known as P.INK SQL). Their extended version of DAL is called PrimeBaseTalk (PBT) and is fully backward compatible with DAL. Their architecture does not include Data Access Manager and the resulting performance gains are considerable.

The battle was the last Hungarian attempt to subdue the independent Moldavia, as previous attempts had ended in failure. Corvinus invaded Moldavia as a consequence of Stephen's annexation of Chilia‚Äîa fortress and harbour at the coast of the Black Sea, which at the time was controlled by Hungarian and Wallachian forces, though it had belonged to Moldavia centuries earlier. The conflict ended with a draw, with the annual retreat of both sides. This put an end to all Hungarian claims on Moldavia. Background In 1359, Bogdan I of Moldavia rebelled against the King of Hungary and founded an independent Moldavia. However, the Hungarian attempts to seize control over Moldavia did not end there, and in 1429, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, and also King of Hungary, met with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland to try to persuade him to launch a common attack on Moldavia and divide the country in two equal parts--Polish and Hungarian.D≈Çugosz, p. 449 Sigismund argued that the Moldavian nation did not \\"owe allegiance to anyone, is accustomed to live by theft and brigandage and so is everyone's enemy.\\" He also complained about not receiving any help for his struggle against the Turks. In the Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz, the Polish chronicler wrote the following on W≈Çadys≈Çaw‚Äôs reply to Sigismund: After the death of Alexander I, the country was thrown into civil strife, in which the two claimants, Peter Aron III and Bogdan II, in order to gain the throne, pledged loyalty to either the Hungarian or the Polish king. The political turmoil lasted until 1457, when Stephen, son of Bogdan, having fled to Hungary and later Wallachia, with Wallachian help, gained the throne and ousted the boyars loyal to Aron. The latter fled to Poland, but was later forced to seek asylum in Hungary, after Moldavia and Poland concluded a new treaty. Stephen‚Äôs objective was to regain the region of Budjak with the castles of Chilia and Cetatea AlbƒÉ. The region had previously belonged to Wallachia, but had been incorporated into Moldavia in the late 14th century.Spinei, p. 218 Due to the decline of Moldavia during the civil war, the region reverted to Wallachia, with Chilia being co-ruled by Hungary and Wallachia. =Foreign relations= In 1462, Stephen sent a letter to his cousin, Prince Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia, asking him to return Chilia back to Moldavia‚Äîa demand that was most likely refused.C√¢rciumaru, p.221 On 22 June, when Vlad was fighting Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, Stephen launched an attack on Chilia, with some Turkish assistance, with the objective of capturing the fortress.Florescu, p. 149 The Wallachians rushed to the scene with 7,000 men, and together with the Hungarian garrison, battled the Moldavians and the Turks for eight days. The Turks were defeated and Stephen was wounded by a piece of shrapnel ‚Äî an injury which would hasten his death. In 1465, when Vlad was in Hungary, Stephen again advanced towards Chilia with a large force and siege weapons; but instead of besieging the fortress, he showed the garrison, who favoured the Polish King, a letter in which the King requires them to surrender the fortress. The garrison complied with the King's demand and Stephen entered the fortress escorted by Polish troops where he found ‚Äúits two captains, rather tipsy, for they have been to a wedding.‚ÄùD≈Çugosz, p. 552 Mehmed was furious about the news and claimed Chilia as being a part of Wallachia, which now was a vassal to the Porte, and demanded Stephen relinquish ownership. However, Stephen refused and recruited an army, forcing Mehmed, who was not yet ready to wage war, to accept the situation, if only for the time being. D≈Çugosz recalls that in the beginning of his reign, Stephen reformed his army by extending rights for men to bear arms: In 1466, Stephen regained Khotyn from Poland in a diplomatic victory, but in the same year, Corvinus became on bad terms with King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland,Iorga, p. 91 which frustrated the Hungarian king further, knowing that Moldavia was a Polish fief. One year later, in 1467, the locals of Transylvania started an uprising in which Corvinus had a difficult time quelling the riots.Iorga, p. 94 He later found out that Stephen had supported the rioters, -- probably in order to find and kill Aron. D≈Çugosz writes in his ‚Äò‚ÄôAnnals‚Äô‚Äô that in 1467, a certain \\"Berendeja\\" went to the court of Corvinus and promised to make Moldavia his vassal, if the King would in turn make him Prince of Moldavia. This was denounced by Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga, who argued that Corvinus started recruiting troops and took Aron with him to put him on the Moldavian throne. This is disputed by D≈Çugosz though, who in ‚Äò‚ÄôHistoriae Polonicae‚Äô‚Äô, adds that Corvinus brought with him both Aron and Berendeja, making unknown whom the king considered more worthy of the Moldavian throne. =Preparations for war= The Hungarians recruited an army of 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of them being Stefan B√°thory.Iorga, p. 95 With them, they brought 500 cannons and other heavy siege equipment.Sf√¢ntul Voievod »òtefan cel Mare, Letter of Stephen to Casimir, January 1, 1468 The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined to wage war, started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads. Battle Map of the battle, showing the Moldavian attack The Hungarians departed in the middle of October and reached the realm of Moldavia at the beginning of November, using a passage near BacƒÉu.Iorga, p. 95 On 19 November, the Hungarians arrived at the Trotu»ô River where they met some Moldavian resistance, but Corvinus, to ensure the \\"loyalty of his troops, avoids a pitched battle and limits his efforts to surprise attacks and ambushes, yet is himself prevented from foraging or doing further damage.\\" The town was destroyed and the Hungarians headed for BacƒÉu, which they also burned down; then they continued to Roman and stayed there between 29 November and 7 December. According to a chronicle, Stephen sent envoys to negotiate a peace treaty, but the two factions could not agree and the war continued. Roman was put to flames and the Hungarians killed everyone they encountered, ‚Äúwithout considering their sex, age, or looks.‚Äù After three days of marching and more pillaging, they reached Baia where Corvinus met with a Hungarian nobleman by the name of Sythotus, who revealed to him the Moldavian position, their numbers (12,000), and their plan to attack before dusk. The Moldavians were encamped further north, between Moldova River and »òomuz creek. Corvinus ordered the city to be fortified with \\"ramparts, ditches and a ring of wagons\\", as the men were told to be prepared for battle and guards were sent to guard strategic points. A peculiar report mentions that Stephen himself was captured by the Hungarians on 14 December, but that he convinced them to release him.Moldavian-German Chronicle, The On 15 December, when dusk was approaching, Stephen sent smaller detachments that set the town on fire from three different places: thereafter, noise and confusion set in. Stephen ordered his men to dismount and soon after they launched their attack and made battle until dawn. Descriptions of the battle say that the fire made the night equally light as the day and that many Hungarians were consumed by the flames. The two armies started to butcher each other at the gate of the city; then the fighting continued onto the streets \\"with such a wrath, that nothing could be seen as more horrible than this.\\" The Moldavians got the upper hand of the battle and launched another attack against the royal guard, which consisted of 200 heavily armed knights, the aristocrats, and Corvinus. Many Moldavians were killed in the tumult that followed, as B√°thory and the rest of the knights defended the entrance to the market. Corvinus was wounded and, allegedly he had to be ‚Äúcarried from the battlefield on a stretcher, to avoid him falling into the hands of the enemy.‚Äù For Moldavians, it was a victory because they could retreat, leaving only 14 of their battleflags in the hands of the Hungarian army, and Stephen was able to write a letter to the Polish king, stating that he won the battle. The captured battleflags were suspended in the Boldogasszony church of Budapest, as sign of victory over the vassal, the Hungarian bishop and pot dedicating three epigrammas to them.http://mek.oszk.hu/06700/06722/06722.htm#884 Janus Pannonius :DE SIGNIS, QUAE MOLDAVIS EREPTA IN TEMPLO BEATAE MARIAE VIRGINIS BUDAE SUSPENDEBANTUR; GRATULATUR DE DUPLICI VICTORIA MATTHIAE ; DE SIGNO IOANNIS VIT√âZII ARCHIEPISCOPI According to D≈Çugosz, Corvinus escaped the Moldavians due to the assistance of another Vlach (Romanian), whom Stephen found and had executed because of treachery. The Moldavian-German Chronicles say that someone named Isaia failed to launch the cavalry attack which would have blocked the path for the Hungarian retreat; for this, he and others were later executed. 4,000-10,000 Hungarians were said to have been killed; most of the barons survived, following their king. Janus Pannonius mentions totally 11,000 casualties for the Moldavian, with 4,000 \\"cut down while retreating\\". Aftermath Some of the Hungarian standards that were captured came with a \\"huge booty of tents, waggons and guns\\", which were sent to Casimir as proof of Stephen's victory. Upon his return to Brass√≥ on Christmas day, Corvinus took revenge on the people who had rebelled against him; thereafter he collected a war tax of 400,000 florins, which they had to pay immediately, in gold. With this money he raised an army of foreign mercenaries, which would prove more loyal to him. Corvinus rewarded in 1469 some Romanians from Maramure»ô who were on Corvinus's side, for their bravery when saving the life of the king: Coroi from Once»ôti (Maramure»ô), his son Ioan, and their brothers in arms: Mihai de Petrova, Mihai Nan de Slatina, Petru LeucƒÉ from Valea Lupului, Ioan Miclea from »òugatag, Petru de Berbe»ôti, Simion son of Pop de Uglea, Lup»ôa de Berbe»ôti, Ste»õ de Biserica AlbƒÉ and George Avram de Once»ôtiConstantin Ioan Lazu, Maramure»ôul istoric -Editura Vicovia, pag.44, In 1468, Stephen campaigned in Transylvania, found Aron and had him executed.Iorga, p. 99 Stephen and Corvinus would later negotiate a peace treaty, with Stephen accepting Corvinus as his de jure liege lord. In 1475, Corvinus sent 6,800 soldiers that assisted Stephen in his victory at the Battle of Vaslui. Footnotes References *C√¢rciumaru, Radu. Vlad »öepe»ô »ôi »òtefan cel Mare - prieteni sau du≈ümani?

AVO analysis is a technique that geophysicists can execute on seismic data to determine a rock's fluid content, porosity, density or seismic velocity, shear wave information, fluid indicators (hydrocarbon indications).http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=amplitude%20variation%20with%20offset Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary The phenomenon is based on the relationship between the reflection coefficient and the angle of incidence and has been understood since the early 20th century when Karl Zoeppritz wrote down the Zoeppritz equations. Due to its physical origin, AVO can also be known as amplitude versus angle (AVA), but AVO is the more commonly used term because the offset is what a geophysicist can vary in order to change the angle of incidence. (See diagram) 600px Background and theory 500px For a seismic wave reflecting off an interface between two media at normal incidence, the expression for the reflection coefficient is relatively simple: :R=\\\\frac{Z_1 - Z_0}{Z_1 + Z_0}, where Z_0 and Z_1 are the acoustic impedances of the first and second medium, respectively. The situation becomes much more complicated in the case of non-normal incidence, due to mode conversion between P-waves and S-waves, and is described by the Zoeppritz equations. =Zoeppritz equations= In 1919, Karl Bernhard Zoeppritz derived four equations that determine the amplitudes of reflected and refracted waves at a planar interface for an incident P-wave as a function of the angle of incidence and six independent elastic parameters.Sheriff, R. E., Geldart, L. P., (1995), 2nd Edition. Exploration Seismology. Cambridge University Press. These equations have 4 unknowns and can be solved but they do not give an intuitive understanding for how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved.Shuey, R. T. [1985] A simplification of the Zoeppritz equations. Geophysics, 50:609‚Äì614 =Richards and Frasier (1976), Aki and Richards (1980)= P. Richards and C. FrasierRichards, P. G., and Frasier, C. W., 1976, Scattering of elastic wave from depth-dependent inhomogeneities: Geophysics, 41, 441‚Äì458 expanded the terms for the reflection and transmission coefficients for a P-wave incident upon a solid-solid interface and simplified the result by assuming only small changes in elastic properties across the interface. Therefore, the squares and differential products are small enough to tend to zero and be removed. This form of the equations allows one to see the effects of density and P- or S- wave velocity variations on the reflection amplitudes. This approximation was popularized in the 1980 book Quantitative Seismology by K. Aki and P. Richards and has since been commonly referred to as the Aki and Richards approximation.Aki, K. and Richards, P. G., 1980, Quantitative seismology: Theory and methods, v.1 : W.H. Freeman and Co. =Ostrander (1980)= Ostrander was the first to introduce a practical application of the AVO effect, showing that a gas sand underlying a shale exhibited amplitude variation with offset.Ostrander, W.J., 1984, Plane wave reflection coefficients for gas sands at non-normal angles of incidence: Geophysics, 49, 1637‚Äì1648. =Shuey (1985)= Shuey further modified the equations by assuming ‚Äì as Ostrander had ‚Äì that Poisson's ratio was the elastic property most directly related to the angular dependence of the reflection coefficient. This gives the 3-term Shuey Equation:Avseth, P, T Mukerji and G Mavko (2005). Quantitative seismic interpretation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK :R(\\\\theta ) = R(0) + G \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta + F ( \\\\tan^2 \\\\theta - \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta ) where :R(0) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta V_\\\\mathrm{P}}{V_\\\\mathrm{P}} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\rho}{\\\\rho} \\\\right ) and :G = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta V_\\\\mathrm{P}}{V_\\\\mathrm{P}} - 2 \\\\frac{V^2_\\\\mathrm{S}}{V^2_\\\\mathrm{P}} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\rho}{\\\\rho} + 2 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta V_\\\\mathrm{S}}{V_\\\\mathrm{S}} \\\\right ) ; F = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{\\\\Delta V_\\\\mathrm{P}}{V_\\\\mathrm{P}} where {\\\\theta}=angle of incidence; {V_p} = P-wave velocity in medium; {{\\\\Delta}V_p} = P-wave velocity contrast across interface;{V_s} = S-wave velocity in medium; {{\\\\Delta}V_s} = S-wave velocity contrast across interface; = density in medium; {{\\\\Delta}{\\\\rho}} = density contrast across interface; In the Shuey equation, R(0) is the reflection coefficient at normal incidence and is controlled by the contrast in acoustic impedances. G, often referred to as the AVO gradient, describes the variation of reflection amplitudes at intermediate offsets and the third term, F, describes the behaviour at large angles/far offsets that are close to the critical angle. This equation can be further simplified by assuming that the angle of incidence is less than 30 degrees (i.e. the offset is relatively small), so the third term will tend to zero. This is the case in most seismic surveys and gives the \\"Shuey Approximation\\": :R(\\\\theta ) = R(0) + G \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta This was the final development needed before AVO analysis could become a commercial tool for the oil industry. Use crossplot400px Modern seismic reflection surveys are designed and acquired in such a way that the same point on the subsurface is sampled multiple times, with each sample having a different source and receiver location. The seismic data is then carefully processed to preserve seismic amplitudes and accurately determine the spatial coordinates of each sample. This allows a geophysicist to construct a group of traces with a range of offsets that all sample the same subsurface location in order to perform AVO analysis. This is known as a Common Midpoint Gatherhttp://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=CMP Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary (a midpoint being the area of the subsurface that a seismic wave reflects off before returning to the receiver) and in a typical seismic reflection processing workflow, the average amplitude would be calculated along the time sample, in a process known as \\"stacking\\". This process significantly reduces random noise but loses all information that could be used for AVO analysis.Young, R. & LoPiccolo, R. 2005. AVO analysis demystified. E&P.; https://e-seis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AVO-Analysis- Demystified.pdf =AVO crossplots= A CMP gather is constructed, the traces are conditioned so that they reference the same two-way travel time, sorted in order of increasing offset and the amplitude of each trace at a specific time horizon is extracted. Remembering the 2-term Shuey Approximation, the amplitude of each trace is plotted against sin^2 of its offset and the relationship becomes linear, as seen in the diagram. Using linear regression, a line of best fit can now be calculated that describes how the reflection amplitude varies with offset using just 2 parameters: the intersect, P, and the gradient, G. As per the Shuey approximation, the intersect P corresponds to R(0), the reflection amplitude at zero-offset, and the gradient G describes the behaviour at non-normal offset, a value known as the AVO gradient. Plotting P (or R(0)) against G for every time sample in every CMP gather produces an AVO crossplot and can be interpreted in a number of ways. Interpretation An AVO anomaly is most commonly expressed as increasing (rising) AVO in a sedimentary section, often where the hydrocarbon reservoir is \\"softer\\" (lower acoustic impedance) than the surrounding shales. Typically amplitude decreases (falls) with offset due to geometrical spreading, attenuation and other factors. An AVO anomaly can also include examples where amplitude with offset falls at a lower rate than the surrounding reflective events.  Applications in the oil and gas industry  The most important application of AVO is the detection of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Increasing AVO is usually present in oil-bearing sediments with at least 10% gas saturation, but is especially pronounced in porous, low-density gas-bearing sediments with little to no oil. Particularly important examples are those seen in Middle Tertiary gas sands of the coastal counties of Southeast Texas, turbidite sands such as the Late Tertiary deltaic sediments in the Gulf of Mexico (especially during the 1980s‚Äì1990s), West Africa, and other major deltas around the world. Most major companies use AVO routinely as a tool to \\"de-risk\\" exploration targets and to better define the extent and the composition of existing hydrocarbon reservoirs.  AVO is not fail-safe  An important caveat is that the existence of abnormally rising or falling amplitudes can sometimes be caused by other factors, such as alternative lithologies and residual hydrocarbons in a breached gas column. Not all oil and gas fields are associated with an obvious AVO anomaly (e.g. most of the oil found in the Gulf of Mexico in the last decade), and AVO analysis is by no means a panacea for gas and oil exploration.

However he wasn't part of the squad for the final itself. Brazil was a key player by the 1980‚Äì81 season, when they won the UEFA Cup and finished runners-up in the league. Ipswich finished runners-up once more the following season, when Brazil scored 22 goals, making him the second-highest scorer in the First Division after Kevin Keegan, who scored 26 for Southampton. One of his finest games in an Ipswich shirt came on 16 February 1982, when he scored all of their goals in a 5‚Äì2 league win over Southampton. Brazil moved to Tottenham Hotspur in March 1983 for ¬£425,000, scoring six times in 10 appearances. In his only full season at White Hart Lane he scored three goals in 19 games, while his fellow Scot Steve Archibald scored 21 times. Tottenham won the UEFA Cup and Brazil scored four goals during their cup run, however he was not part of the squad for the final. In June 1984 Brazil joined Manchester United for a fee of ¬£625,000. He stayed with United for two seasons, but a recurring back injury restricted him to a total of 41 appearances in the league, the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. Competition for places at Old Trafford was very fierce, with Irish International Frank Stapleton, Mark Hughes and Peter Davenport all in contention. Brazil scored 16 goals during his 18 months with Manchester United, but by the time his second season got underway, he was no longer a regular member of the first team, with most his final appearances for the club coming as a substitute. In January 1986, he was transferred to Coventry City as a 'makeweight' in the deal that took Terry Gibson to Old Trafford. He made 15 league appearances, scoring twice, and was given a free transfer at the end of the season, with his back problems becoming more evident. Joining Queens Park Rangers, he made a total of four appearances, scoring once (the winner against Blackburn in the FA Cup), and went on to play for Bury Town, Chelmsford City and Stambridge United.http://hafc.hawkwellfc.com/index.php/about/our-coaches/andy-s/ http://www.stambridgeunitedfc.com/#/club-history/4544145337 Brazil left British football in 1988 to join Wollongong City (now the South Coast Wolves), a New South Wales-based club in Australia's National Soccer League. He returned to Europe to spend his final season (1988‚Äì89) with FC Baden of the Swiss Challenge League, the country's second division, before his playing career ended due to the serious back injury that had plagued him for seasons. Brazil later played under Garry Hill at Chelmsford Sunday League side Priory Sports, alongside Micky Droy and Paul Parker. =International career= Brazil made 13 appearances for Scotland, the most notable of which saw him playing in the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals in Spain. He was the youngest member of the Scotland squad at the finals. His debut came against Poland in a friendly in Warsaw on 28 May 1980, which Scotland lost 1‚Äì0. His last full international came on 1 June 1983 in a 2‚Äì0 Home Championship defeat to England. He scored once for the Scottish national side, in his penultimate appearance on 28 May 1983 in a 2‚Äì0 Home Championship win over Wales. His international appearances were limited as Scotland had a number of other strikers at this time such as Kenny Dalglish, Charlie Nicholas, Mo Johnston, Steve Archibald, Paul Sturrock, Joe Jordan, Frank McAvennie, Davie Dodds, Frank McGarvey and Andy Gray who were preferred to Brazil. Media career Brazil was a sports analyst for breakfast TV station GMTV in its early days. Soon afterwards, was invited to join Andy Gray in The Boot Room on Sky Sports. When Sky Sports gained rights to the Football League and the Football League Cup, Brazil worked as a studio analyst and may have done some work as a co- commentator. He later worked as a co-commentator on matches covered by Anglia TV in the 200102 season. In the late 1990s, Brazil joined radio station Talk Radio to present evening sports programming, titled \\"It's Just Like Watching Brazil\\". When the station became Talk Sport in early 2000, he became co- presenter on the weekday 610am programme. The show has since been renamed the 'Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast'. He has had various co-presenters over the years, including Mike Parry, Graham Beecroft and Ronnie Irani. Since Irani left the show in 2013, there has been a variety of co-presenters including Matt Holland, Ray Parlour, David Ginola, Dominic Cork, Neil Warnock and Brian Moore. Brazil missed a show in March 2004 and was dismissed by the station, but he was reinstated three weeks later. While reacting to the death of actor Robin Williams in August 2014, Brazil said on his talkSPORT show that he did not have a lot of sympathy for people who commit suicide as it leaves their families in a \\"diabolical\\" situation. Many listeners criticised Brazil for not showing any regard for Williams having suffered from depression. The station apologised for offence caused and said it did not agree with his opinion. Personal life In the early 1970s, Brazil was subject to abuse at Celtic Boys Club, by Jim Torbett. When Torbett was charged and tried in 1996, Brazil was a witness for the prosecution. Torbett was found guilty on child abuse charges and sentenced to two years in prison. Having retired from English league football aged 27 due to injury, for several years in the 1990s Brazil ran the Black Adder pub in Ipswich. This business venture failed and Brazil was declared bankrupt. A fan of horse racing, in 2003 he formed the Alan Brazil Racing Club based at Newmarket near to his home in Suffolk. In 2006 Brazil published a book co-written with Mike Parry called There's an Awful Lot of Bubbly in Brazil.Compton, Berkshire: Highdown Publishing This was followed in 2007 by Both Barrels from Brazil: My War Against the Numpties, again co- written with Parry.Compton, Berkshire: Highdown Publishing In September 2007, Brazil was arrested near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk on suspicion of drink- driving. He was convicted, banned from driving for 20 months, and given a ¬£750 fine, as well as being ordered to pay ¬£450 compensation to the court. In 2011, Brazil brought out a range of bar nuts named 'Alan Brazil's Nuts', a play on Brazil nuts. The packages have barcodes readable by smartphones for accessing Talksport-related media. The nuts are produced at an Intersnack factory in Haverhill, Suffolk, with profits going to the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. Robson, who died from cancer in 2009, was Brazil's manager at Ipswich. The range of salted and dry roasted peanuts were due to be extended to cashews and chilli nuts in 2012.

The defining characteristic of a VSP (of which there are many types) is that either the energy source, or the detectors (or sometimes both) are in a borehole. In the most common type of VSP, Hydrophones, or more often geophones or accelerometers, in the borehole record reflected seismic energy originating from a seismic source at the surface. There are numerous methods for acquiring a vertical seismic profile (VSP). Zero-offset VSPs (A) have sources close to the wellbore directly above receivers. Offset VSPs (B) have sources some distance from the receivers in the wellbore. Walkaway VSPs (C) feature a source that is moved to progressively farther offset and receivers held in a fixed location. Walk-above VSPs (D) accommodate the recording geometry of a deviated well, having each receiver in a different lateral position and the source directly above the receiver. Salt-proximity VSPs (E) are reflection surveys to help define a salt-sediment interface near a wellbore by using a source on top of a salt dome away from the drilling rig. Drill-noise VSPs (F), also known as seismic-while-drilling (SWD) VSPs, use the noise of the drill bit as the source and receivers laid out along the ground. Multi-offset VSPs (G) involve a source some distance from numerous receivers in the wellbore.

The choir was founded in 1967 by the then bishop of Limburg, Wilhelm Kempf. Its conductors were Hans Bernhard, Mathias Breitschaft, Klaus Knubben and, since 2014, Andreas Bollendorf. The choir's main task is singing in services at the Limburg Cathedral. The choir also performs in other services and performs concerts internationally. The repertoire is from all eras of classical music. They took part in recordings of Mahler symphonies, conducted by Eliahu Inbal and Paavo J√§rvi, and in the premiere of Kagel's Sankt-Bach-Passion. In their home Musisches Internat, which served as a boarding school until 2007, the boys receive thorough training, four vocal rehearsals per week, individual voice coaching, and instrumental instructions. They study not only choral but also solo parts of the works they perform. Many tours took them to European and American countries. Choir members became soloists or conductors, and formed chamber choirs.  History  Entrance of the Musisches Internat in Hadamar The Limburger Domsingknaben were founded in 1967 by Wilhelm Kempf, then Bishop of Limburg. Their home is the , a boarding school in Hadamar, close to Limburg. The first conductor was the former Cathedral Kapellmeister Hans Bernhard. He was succeeded in 1973 by Mathias Breitschaft, who led the choir to 1985. From 1987, Domkantor Klaus Knubben was the chorale conductor, succeeded in 2014 by Andreas Bollendorf who had been a choir member as a boy. The voice coach is Wilhelm Gries. The focus of the choir is to sing in services of the Limburg Cathedral, alternating with the M√§dchenkantorei and the Limburger Domchor. The choir also performs in services in and outside of the Diocese of Limburg, and performs concerts internationally. The repertoire of the Limburger Domsingknaben spans eras from Gregorian chant via Baroque music, the Classical period, Romantic music to contemporary music. The choir performs in public yearly about 80 times, including 40 church services, secular concerts and church concerts, appearances on radio and television, and singing for special occasions. The boys rehearse twice a week when they begin, and four times for regular members. They receive individual vocal training that makes them able to also sing solo parts. Beginning in 2007, the Musisches Internat is only used during the day, because full boarding could no longer be offered. It is used for vocal education, instrumental training (because each singer has to learn at least one instrument), and supervised homework, but also for sports and recreation. Concert tours, beginning in 1987, took the choir to U.S. (1989, 1998 and 2007), Canada (1993 and 2001), Mexico (2000), Brazil (2011), Argentina (2011), Paraguay (2011), South Africa (1995) and other, mostly European, countries. As of 2017, the choir traveled on more than 40 tours to 26 countries. The 50th anniversary of the choir was celebrated in 2017. They were acknowledged as ambassadors of the diocese. That year, they participated in Rome and the Vatican in the festival L'arte salva l'arte, presenting Haydn's Die Sch√∂pfung at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, with the Roma Sinfonietta and soloists Mechthild Bach, and , conducted by Bollendorf. Among former Limburger Domsingknaben are tenors , Christoph Pr√©gardien and Gerd T√ºrk, conductors Andreas Bollendorf, Eberhard Metternich and Harald Schmitt, and the musical performer . Around 100 conductors and the members of five chamber choirs are former members of the Limburger Domsingknaben.  Recordings  The Limburger Domsingknaben recorded in 1978, conducted by Mathias Breitschaft, Christmas music including Palestrina's Ad te levavi, Reger's Mariae Wiegenlied, Hammerschmidt's Machet die Tore weit, Hermann Schroeder's \\"Siehe, die Jungfrau wird empfangen\\", Eccard's \\"√úbers Gebirg Maria geht\\", Bruckner's Ave Maria, Kurt Hessenberg's \\"Maria durch ein Dornwald ging\\", Hans Leo Hassler's \\"Verbum caro factum est, Bach's Ich steh an deiner Krippen hier, Carl Loewe's \\"Quem pastores laudavere\\", \\"Es ist ein Ros entsprungen by Michael Praetorius, and \\"Drei K√∂n'ge wandern aus Morgenland\\" by Peter Cornelius, among others. The Limburger Domsingknaben recorded several large-scale works. In 1985, they took part in a live recoding of Mahler's Third Symphony at the Frankfurt Alte Oper, with soloist Doris Soffel, the women's choir of the Frankfurter Kantorei and the hr-Sinfonieorchester, conducted by Eliahu Inbal. In November 1985, they sang in the premiere of Maurizio Kagel's oratorio Sankt-Bach-Passion, conducted by the composer as part of the Berliner Festwochen at the Berlin Philharmonie. It was recorded soon afterwards, with soloists Anne Sofie von Otter, Hans Peter Blochwitz, Roland Hermann, as narrator, organist Gerd Zacher, NDR Chor and S√ºdfunk-Chor Stuttgart, and the Radio Symphony Orchestra Stuttgart. In 2013, they participated in a live recording of Mahler's Eighth Symphony at the Frankfurt Alte Oper conducted by Paavo J√§rvi, with eight soloists, the EuropaChorAkademie, the Czech Philharmonic Choir Brno and the hr- Sinfonieorchester.

It is produced by Granada Australia, who are responsible for other programs such as Dancing with the Stars, Australia's Next Top Model, and Merrick and Rosso Unplanned. It is an Australian version of American Princess. The show is also aired in the United Kingdom on ITV2, in Finland on SubTV, in Canada on W Network, in the United States on WE: Women's Entertainment, in the Middle East on MBC 4, and in Belgium on Vitaya. The contestants have been judged by Paul Burrell, Jane Luedecke (sister of Sarah, Duchess of York) and Jean Broke-Smith since its inception along with various other guest judges. The two series of the show were hosted by Jackie O. Overview Fuelled by the fairy tale story of Mary Donaldson who, in 2004, married Denmark‚Äôs heir to the throne, Crown Prince Frederick, Australian Princess scoured the country to find 12 young Australian women and give them the journey of their lives. Paul Burrell, former butler to Diana, Princess of Wales and footman in the Royal Household of Queen Elizabeth II, led a team of international experts, who attempted to shape these ordinary 'Aussie' girls into worldly sophisticated women ready to handle the challenges of being a young royal. The contestants took classes, met challenges and attempted to convince the judges that they have what it takes to mix in elite social circles both in Australia and the United Kingdom. Cast =Host= * Jackie O =Judges= * Paul Burrell * Jane Luedecke * Jean Broke-Smith Series one The first season of Australian Princess was aired in late 2005 on Network Ten. Despite initial critical cynicism of the program's concept, it quickly gained cult status and was praised for the quality of its production, witty and often cringe-induced humour (one recalls a contestant's sobbing lament of the deaths of two icons she held dear - Diana, Princess of Wales, and Tupac Shakur). Ally Mansell from the University of Wollongong and Danebank was announced the winner during the final show, which was aired in Australia on 23 November 2005.

Medical career left Carl von Rokitansky was born in Hradec Kr√°lov√© (), Bohemia. He studied at the Charles University in Prague (1821‚Äì1824) and attained a doctorate in medicine on 6 March 1828 at the University of Vienna. In 1830, he became assistant to Johann Wagner,A History of Endometriosis by Ronald Elmer Batt the professor of pathological anatomy, and succeeded him in 1834 as prosector, being at the same time made extraordinary professor. He became a full professor ten years later. In 1847, to his duties as a teacher, Rokitansky added the onerous office of medico-legal anatomist to the city of Vienna. In 1863, Rokitansky was appointed by Anton von Schmerling as medical adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, wherein he advised on all routine matters of medical teaching, including patronage. As a young professor, Rokitansky recognized that the still little noted discipline of pathological anatomy could be of great service to clinical work in the hospital, because it could offer new diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities to the bed-side physician. Ludwig Freiherr Baron von T√ºrkheim (1777-1846) established the Second Vienna Medical School in 1836. Around Rokitansky's autopsies the school began \\"one of the most fruitful and brilliant epochs of Viennese medicine\\".Intellectual Development of Carl Von Rokitansky A paradigm shift occurred, led by Rokitansky, Josef ≈†koda, and Ferdinand von Hebra, moving from the notion of medicine as a branch of natural philosophy, to the more modern notion of it as a science. =Contributions= thumb Rokitansky's name is associated with the following diseases/morphologic features of disease: *Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome *M√ºllerian agenesis (aka \\"Mayer- Rokitansky-K√ºster-Hauser syndrome\\") *Rokitansky's diverticulum *Rokitansky's triad (pulmonary stenosis) *Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (in the gallbladder) *Rokitansky-Cushing ulcer *Rokitansky-Maude Abbott syndrome *Von Rokitansky's syndrome *Rokitansky nodule ‚Äì teratomas *Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (levo-Transposition of the great arteries) he first described about endometriosis in 1860 Rokitansky also developed a method of autopsy which consisted mainly of in situ dissection. Rokitansky is said \\"to have supervised 70,000 autopsies, and personally performed over 30,000, averaging two a day, seven days a week, for 45 years\\".St√∂ppler, MD, Melissa Conrad (2015-06-01). \\"Medically Reviewed by [Jay W. Marks, MD].\\" MedicineNet, 1 June 2015. Autopsy (Post Mortem Examination, Necropsy). Retrieved from http://www.medicinenet.com/autopsy/page4.htm. Philosophical career Although Rokitansky defended the \\"materialistic method\\" in scientific research, he rejected materialism as a philosophical world view. In his commemorative speech on the occasion of the opening of the Institute of Pathological Anatomy at the General Hospital of Vienna, he warned against the abuse of \\"natural science liberties\\". Scientists should first regard humans as \\"conscious and free-willing subjects\\" and only then follow their urge toward knowledge. The feeling of humanity would be lost if physicians regarded human beings purely as research objects. Thus Rokitansky brought up for the first time the question of ethics in medicine. In another speech about the \\"solidarity of all animal life\\", delivered at the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Rokitansky showed his proximity to Arthur Schopenhauer's writings on compassion: \\"if we [... ] preserve and practice compassion\\", he explained \\"we are able to alleviate part of the load of suffering\\" of patients. Human generosity will be shown by our capability to accept the greatest sufferings by voluntarily renouncing aggression. Those who succeed in this should be our greatest ethical role models. In 1845, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On 17 July 1848 Rokitansky was elected as an effective member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1866, he became its vice-president and from 1869 until his death in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, on 23 July 1878, its president. Rokitansky felt that this \\"was the largest honour which I could enjoy\\". Political career Rokitansky's arms as baron, granted in 1874 By way of his leading positions in the most diverse academic and political institutions of the Austrian Empire, Rokitansky helped to shape the era of Austrian high liberalism. He represented liberalism among the educated middle class and strove for \\"freedom and progress\\", both to the university reform and to the substantial improvement of health sciences. Rokitansky was several times the dean of the medical school, and, in 1853, the first freely elected rector of the medical congregation of the University of Vienna and president of the Superior Medical Council. From 1850 until his death, he also presided the Physician's Society of Vienna. On 25 November 1867 he was \\"unexpectedly and unprepared\\" nominated by Franz Joseph I to the upper house of the Royal Council () in recognition of his public service. Finally, he was elected in 1870 to the presidency of the Anthropological Society. Family Two of Rokitansky's sons became professors at Vienna, one of astronomy and another of medicine, while a third gained distinction on the lyric stage, and another as a composer: * Hans von Rokitansky (1835‚Äì1909), became an opera singer. * Victor von Rokitansky (1836‚Äì1896), became a composer. * Prokop Rokitansky (1843 ‚Äì 24 August 1928), became a doctor. Bibliography His published works include: * Handbuch der pathologischen Anatomie (\\"Handbook of pathological anatomy\\", 3 vols., Vienna: Braum√ºller und Seidel, 1842‚Äì1846; English translation by the Sydenham Society, 4 vols., London, 1845‚Äì1852) This is his principal work. It was entirely redone and issued under the title of Lehrbuch der pathologischen Anatomie (\\"Textbook of pathological anatomy\\", 3 vols., 1851‚Äì1861) * Die Defecte der Scheidew√§nde des Herzens (\\"Defects in the septa of the heart\\", Vienna: W. Braum√ºller, 1875)  In popular culture  The main character in the film series Mad Max, Max Rockatansky, is named after Carl von Rokitansky. The reason for this bizarre connection is the fact that the director of this film series, George Miller, studied medicine and also made a living as doctor at the time when he was raising funds for his first movie - Mad Max 1.

Early life Linkson was born in New Barnet, Hertfordshire. His father was Robert Linkson, a house painter; his mother, Rebecca Bartram, ran a business selling wardrobes made by her father and brothers. Linkson was the youngest of five boys in a family that also included four sisters. His three eldest brothers, William, Robert and Alfred, and his sister Margaret all died in infancy before he was born. His one remaining brother, Sidney died in 1901 as a result of a disease caught during active service in the Second Boer War. Football career Linkson started his career with Barnet Alston (later Barnet F.C.) in 1907. He was spotted playing for an amateur team, Pirates FC, on a continental tour by scouts from Manchester United, who were also touring in the same area, and he signed for the club in 1908. He made his first team debut on 24 October 1908 in a match against Nottingham Forest. In total, Linkson played in 55 league games and four FA Cup games, and helped the club win the 1909 FA Cup and 1911 league title. In 1913, he transferred to Shelbourne in Dublin. Army career At the outbreak of the First World War, he returned to England, where he enrolled with the 1st Football Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment, who were formed under the Pals battalion scheme and made up entirely of sportsmen; he fought alongside other footballers, such as Walter Tull, Evelyn Lintott and Vivian Woodward. On 8 August 1916, Private Linkson went missing in the battle to seize Guillemont Station during the Somme Offensive.

Founded in 1936, the NJCL comprises more than 1,000 Latin, Greek and Classical chapters in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and with over 45,000 members, is the largest Classical organization in the world today. Its mission: \\"to encourage an interest in and an appreciation of the language, literature and culture of ancient Greece and Rome and to impart an understanding of the debt of our own culture to that of classical antiquity.\\" The current NJCL National Committee Chair is Mr. Kyle McGimsey. NJCL official colors are Roman purple and gold. History The idea of creating a junior organization to the American Classical League was first proposed in 1927 at the organization's annual meeting. A committee was appointed to study the matter, but it decided two years later that it wouldn't be worth pursuing at the time. In 1936, a pin was made and lifetime membership cost thirty cents, as it was decided to pursue the creation of a junior organization. The Junior Classical League was announced in November 1936 in Classical Outlook, with headquarters being established at New York University. Today, chapters exist in the United States, Canada, and Australia and has over 50,000 members. National convention 2011 General Assembly at Eastern Kentucky University, looking at convention participants The NJCL hosts a week- long national convention annually at a college campus in late July or early August, where 1200‚Äì1500 students compete in academic tests, graphic and creative arts competitions, and meet many classics students from around the country. Other components of the convention in which students may participate include Certamen,The Passion of Latin Lovers seminars commonly known as Colloquia, and Ludi (literally \\"games\\"‚Äîvarious athletic and recreational events). Students may also campaign for public offices within the NJCL, including President, Treasurer, and Historian. Starting regularly in 1972, every convention is given a motto/theme from Latin poetry or literature. A theme for the following year's convention is chosen by the incoming president each year. Most state-level NJCL chapters hold their own annual conventions at locations central to their attendees, where schools compete in varied events. These events are divided into academic levels for scoring purposes; participation can be countywide, regional, or even statewide. Awards are given out to schools based on sweepstakes points, earned by placing high in competitive events. The 2018 national convention was held at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio from July 23-28. The 2019 national convention was held at North Dakota State University in Fargo, North Dakota from July 26-31. State chapters As of 2010, forty-seven U.S. states, the District of Columbia, three Canadian provinces, and the United Kingdom each maintain a state (or state-level) chapter of the NJCL; the current total number is 51 as Washington state and British Columbia share a chapter. Many chapters hold their own annual State Convention in addition to the National Convention. Publications Torch: U.S. is the NJCL's official publication, which details the events of the organization, reports scores, and issues stories. Published four times a year, the only issue sent to all convention attendees (including non-subscribers) is the fall issue, shortly after convention. Until October 2007, the NJCL also published JCL Highlights in months when the Torch: U.S. was not published. JCL Highlights publicized administrative details about the League, including details about applying for JCL scholarships, information about the upcoming Convention, and requests for information from NJCL officers and national committee members. According to the Fall 2007 Torch: U.S., the National Committee decided at the October 2007 Fall Planning Meeting to eliminate the JCL Highlights in favor of online distribution of the same information. During national conventions, a student published newspaper, The Convention Ear, is produced. The Ear highlights convention events and gives information about candidates for NJCL office.

The last of these was won with Ipswich Town, while the other titles were won while playing for Ajax. He is also one of the two Dutch players, together with Danny Blind, to have won all UEFA club competitions and the Intercontinental Cup. Career After starting his career at FC Volendam, M√ºhren moved to Ajax Amsterdam in 1971, winning 3 domestic and 3 international titles in his first two seasons there. His third season with Ajax yielded no titles, but he found further success after a transfer to FC Twente, winning the KNVB Cup in 1977 and reaching the 1975 UEFA Cup Final. A year later he moved to Ipswich Town in England for a fee of ¬£150,000; in the same year he made his international debut in a 4‚Äì0 win against Tunisia. He was part of the successful Ipswich team that won the 1981 UEFA Cup, and finished second in the league that year and the year after. In 1982, he transferred to Manchester United. He helped United win the 1983 FA Cup Final by scoring a penalty in the replay against Brighton, and left the club after the 1985 FA Cup Final, in which United defeated Everton. He did not feature in the match squad for the 1985 final, having lost his place in the team that season to new signing Jesper Olsen. He was one of the few players from outside the United Kingdom and Ireland playing in English football during the late 1970s and early 1980s. After seven years in England, M√ºhren returned to Ajax, where he added the European Cup Winners' Cup (1986‚Äì87) to his trophy collection. M√ºhren also reached the final the following year in 1988 but lost to KV Mechelen. At the age of 37, he achieved the highlight of his career, when he was a vital part of the Dutch national team that won the European Championships in 1988. In the final against the Soviet Union he provided the cross from which Marco van Basten scored the second goal (considered one of the greatest volleyed goals of all time). He continued playing for Ajax for one more season after that, finally hanging up his boots in 1989 at the age of 38.

The 6pm bulletin was moved to SVT2 in 1997, followed on 15 January 2001 by the 9pm edition. The year before, editorial responsibility for Aktuellt, Rapport (SVT1's news programme), and SVT's news channel, SVT24, was unified; nevertheless, the name \\"Aktuellt\\" continues to be used to designate SVT2's news programmes. A relaunch of Aktuellt in November 2007 saw Rapport begin a 6pm bulletin on SVT1 while the sole 9pm Aktuellt programme relaunched as an in-depth news and current affairs programme, covering two of three main items in detail. On 5 March 2012, the programme was extended to 60 minutes and now incorporates sports updates, regional news opt-outs & a news summary. The programme is now co-anchored by a rotating team of presenters - Anna Hedenmo, Jon Nilsson, Claes Elfsberg and Cecilia Gralde. Carina Bergfeldt is their foreign reporter.

It won a BAFTA for Best Factual Series in 1993. Curtis deals with, in order: Communism in the Soviet Union, systems analysis and game theory during the Cold War, economy of the United Kingdom during the 1970s, the insecticide DDT, Kwame Nkrumah's leadership in Ghana in the 1950s, and the history of nuclear power. The documentary makes extensive use of clips from the short film Design for Dreaming, especially in the title sequence. Curtis's later series The Century of the Self and The Trap have similar themes to Pandora's Box. Episodes =Part 1. 'The Engineers' Plot'= This episode, originally broadcast on 11 June 1992, details how the Bolshevik revolutionaries who came into power in 1917 attempted to industrialise and control the Soviet Union with rational scientific methods. The Bolsheviks wanted to turn the Soviet people into scientific beings. Aleksei Gastev used social engineering, including a social engineering machine, to make people more rational. But Bolshevik politicians and bourgeois engineers came into conflict. Lenin said, \\"The communists are not directing anything, they are being directed.\\" Stalin arrested 2000 engineers in 1930, eight of whom were convicted in the Industrial Party show trial. Engineering schools gave those loyal to the party only limited training in engineering, to minimise their potential political influence. Industrialised America was used as a template to develop the Soviet Union. Magnitogorsk was built to closely replicate the steel mill city Gary, Indiana. A former worker describes how they went so far as to create metal trees since trees could not grow on the steppe. By the late 1930s, Stalin-faithful engineers like Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and Nikita Khrushchev grew in influence, due to Stalin eliminating many earlier Bolshevik engineers. They aimed to use engineering in line with Stalin's policies to plan the entire country. At Gosplan, the head institution of central planning, engineers predicted future rational needs. Vitalii Semyonovich Lelchuk, from the USSR Academy of Sciences, describes the level of detail as absurd, \\"Even the KGB was told the quota of arrests to be made and the prisons to be used. The demand for coffins, novels and movies was all planned.\\" The seemingly rational benchmarks began to have unexpected results. When the plan measured tonnes carried per kilometer, trains went on long journeys simply to meet the quota. Sofas and chandeliers increased in size to meet requirements of material usage. When Nikita Khrushchev took over after Stalin, he tried to make improvements, including considering prices in the plan. The head of the USSR State Committee for Organization and Methodology of Price Creation is shown with a tall stack of price logbooks declaring, \\"This shows quite clearly that the system is rational.\\" Academician Victor Glushkov proposed the use of cybernetics to control people as a remedy for the problems of planning. In the 1960s, computers began to be used to process economic data. Consumer demand was calculated by computers from data gathered by surveys. But the time delay in the system meant that items were no longer in demand by the time they had been produced. When Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin took over in the mid-1960s, the economy of the Soviet Union was stagnating. By 1978, the country was in full economic crisis. Production had degenerated to a \\"pointless, elaborate ritual\\" and endeavours to improve the plan had been abandoned. The narrator says, \\"What had begun as a grand moral attempt to build a rational society ended by creating a bizarre, bewildering existence for millions of Soviet people.\\" Contributors * Vitali Semyonovich Lelchuk, USSR Academy of Sciences * Alexei A.

'To The Brink of Eternity'= This episode, originally broadcast on 18 June 1992, outlines how the United States government and its departments attempted to use systems analysis and game theory to develop strategies to control the nuclear threat and nuclear arms race during the Cold War, and, more specifically, to manage the \\"loss of control\\" crises encountered during events such as the Space Race, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War. The focus is on the men on whom Dr Strangelove was allegedly based: Herman Kahn, Albert Wohlstetter and John von Neumann. These were mathematical analysts employed by the American RAND Corporation to examine issues of America's national security in the nuclear age. They believed the world could be controlled by the scientific manipulation of fear. One problem, however, was the seemingly unpredictable and irrational nature of politicians, societies, and individuals, which rendered elements of the theory difficult to apply, as well as the challenge of finding accurate, impartial, and unmodified data on which to base concise predictions. In the end, their visions were obscured and became the stuff of science fiction fantasy. Similar material is also covered in the \\"F**k You Buddy\\" part of Curtis's later work, The Trap, but To The Brink of Eternity has the focus entirely on the nuclear and military aspects of Cold War strategy, such as planning for and against pre-emptive war. John Nash is not mentioned, and the psychological and economical aspects of game theory are not included. Contributors * Samuel T.

'The League of Gentlemen'= This part, originally broadcast on 22 June 1992, focuses on how both the Conservative and Labour governments of the 1960s attempted to use economists to engineer economic growth to specific targets, as well as programme post-war economic management in the United Kingdom, and attempts to prevent relative economic decline and the perception of the 1960s Wilson governments that devaluation would jeopardise against national self-esteem. By the mid-1970s, stagflation emerged to confound the Keynesian theories used by policy makers. Meanwhile, a group of economists had managed to convince Margaret Thatcher, Keith Joseph and other British politicians that they had foolproof technical means to make Britain 'great' again. The stagflation of the 1970s catapulted the then obscure economic theory of Monetarism to the forefront of political thought. By the late 1970s Milton Friedman had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics and even some Labour politicians were claiming that government attempts to grow the economy by injecting capital was doing more harm than good by driving up inflation. In 1979, Margaret Thatcher came to power and began to implement these new economic theories to drive down inflation by cutting government spending and raising interest rates, thus tightening the money supply. However, this failed to end inflation straight away, and caused widespread job loss and industrial decline. By the early 1980s, unemployment had risen to 2.5 million, British industrial output had declined by 1/6, and large-scale riots had begun to break out in Britain. The Conservative Government decided to abandon the Monetarist project and lowered interest rates in an attempt to create jobs. In fact, by the mid-1980s Mrs Thatcher claimed in a television interview that she had \\"never subscribed\\" to the theories of Milton Friedman. The episode ends with many of the economists involved in the ill-fated attempts to manage the economy arriving at the same conclusion their predecessors had 30 years before: they could only prevent an economic disaster, not engineer growth. Other economists point out that other countries' successes had more to do with focusing on improving their education systems and industrial bases rather than large-scale attempts to engineer the entire nation's economy. Another economist and adviser to Margaret Thatcher, Alan Budd, worries that the whole Monetarist project might simply have been an attempt to reduce the economic and political power of the working class by raising unemployment and lowering wages, or as he puts it, \\"creating a reserve army of labour.\\" Contributors * Michael Posner, Economic Adviser to the Treasury 1967‚Äì69 * Sir Donald MacDougall, Economic Director, N.E.D.C. 1962‚Äì64; Director-General, Department of Economic Affairs 1964‚Äì68 * Reza Moghadam, London School of Economics * Prof. Charles Goodhart, Economic Adviser to the Department of Economic Affairs 1965‚Äì67; Chief Economic Adviser on Monetary Policy, Bank of England 1980‚Äì85 * Rt Hon.

'Goodbye Mrs Ant'= This part, originally broadcast on 2 July 1992, focuses on attitudes to nature and tells the story of the insecticide DDT, which was first seen as a saviour to humankind in the 1940s, only to be claimed as a part of the destruction of the entire ecosystem in the late 1960s. It also outlines how the sciences of entomology and ecology were transformed by political and economic pressures. The episode appears to be named after the 1959 film Goodbye, Mrs. Ant. Clips from the 1958 horror movie Earth vs. the Spider and the 1941 grasshopper cartoon Hoppity Goes to Town are also used. Insects were a huge problem in the United States, and they often ruined entire crops. Emerging in the 1940s, DDT and other insecticides seemed to offer the solution. As more insecticides were invented, the science of entomology changed focus from insect classification, to primarily testing new insecticides and exterminating insects rather than cataloguing them. But as early as 1946‚Äì48, entomologists began to notice that insecticides were having a negative impact on other animals, particularly birds. Chemical companies portrayed the human battle against insects as a struggle for existence, and their promotional films in the 1950s invoke Charles Darwin. Darwin's biographer James Moore notes how the battlefield and life and death aspects of Darwin's theories were emphasised to suit the Cold War years. Scientists believed they were seizing power from evolution and redirecting it by controlling the environment. In 1962, biologist Rachel Carson released the book Silent Spring, which was the first serious attack on pesticides and outlined their harmful side effects. It caused a public outcry, but had no immediate effect on the use of pesticides. Entomologist Gordon Edwards retells how he made speeches that were critical of Carson's book. He eats some DDT on camera to show how he demonstrated its apparent safety during these talks. The spraying of DDT in the growing suburbs on America brought the side effects to the attention of the wealthy and articulate middle classes. Victor Yannacone, a suburbanite and lawyer, helped found the Environmental Defense Fund with the aim to legally challenge the use of pesticides. They argued that the chemicals were becoming more poisonous as they spread, as evidenced by the disappearance of the peregrine falcon. In 1968, they got a hearing on DDT in Madison, Wisconsin. It became headline news, with both sides claiming that everything America stood for was at stake. Biologist Thomas Jukes is shown singing a pro- DDT parody on \\"America the Beautiful\\" he sent to Time magazine at the time of the trial. Hugh Iltis describes how, in 1969, a scientist testified at the hearing about how DDT appears in breast milk and accumulates in the fat tissue of babies. This got massive media attention. Where once chemicals were seen as good, now they were bad. In the late 1960s, ecology was a marginal science. But Yannacone used ecology as a scientific basis to challenge the DDT defenders' idea of evolution. Similar to how the science of entomology had been changed in the 1950s, ecology was transformed by the social and political pressures of the early 1970s. Ecologists became the guardians of the human relationship to nature. James Moore describes how people try to get Darwin on the side of their view of nature. In The Origin of Species nature is seen as being at war, but also likened to a web of complex relations. Here, Darwin gave people a basis for urging humans not to take control of nature but to cooperate with it. In popular imagination, a scientific theory has a single fixed meaning, but in reality it becomes cultural property, and is usable by different interested parties. Twenty years later, the story of DDT continues with a press conference announcing the halting of construction in a skyscraper due to a nesting peregrine falcon being found there. Ornithologist David Berger criticises the event for helping to foster the myth of the sensitivity of nature. Joan HalifaxNote: she is named as \\"Joan Fairfax\\" in the documentary, subtitled with \\"The Ojai Foundation\\", but her real name appears to be Joan Halifax. talks about ecology as a gift to human beings and all species, a moral lesson that gave rise not to utopia, but ecotopia. Politics professor Langdon Winner theorises that social ideals are being read back to us as if they were lessons derived from science itself. The scientific notions of the 1950s, the ideas of endless possibilities for exploitations of nature, are now seen as ill-conceived. And the ideas of ecology today may in 30 or 40 years seem similarly ill-conceived. The episode ends with a quote from Darwin about seeking divine providence in nature. \\"I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe what he can.\\" Contributors * Prof. Robert Metcalf, entomologist, National Defense Research Committee 1943‚Äì46 * Harry Renken, farmer * Wilbert Joyce, farmer * Shirley Briggs, biologist, US Fish and Wildlife Service 1945‚Äì48 * Lillard Heddon, crop sprayer 1945‚Äì83 * Dr Eugene Kenega, research entomologist, Dow Chemical 1940‚Äì82 * Dr Thomas Jukes, research chemist, American Cyanamid Company 1945‚Äì63 * James Moore, biographer of Charles Darwin * J.

'Black Power'= The penultimate episode, originally broadcast on 9 July 1992, looks at how Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of the Gold Coast (which became Ghana on independence from the United Kingdom in 1957) from 1952 to 1966, set Africa ablaze with his vision of a new industrial and scientific age. At the heart of his dream was to be the huge Volta River dam, generating enough power to transform West Africa into an industrialised utopia and focal point of post-colonial Pan-Africanism. At first, it was hoped the U.K. would help to finance the project, but after the Suez Crisis of 1956, interest was lost. Later, after meeting U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, American backing for the project materialised. A scheme was finally drawn up offering Kaiser Aluminum favourable conditions (including the smelting of aluminium imported from outside Ghana) and the dam was opened to great fanfare in January 1966. Weeks later, in February 1966, while Nkrumah was on a state visit to North Vietnam and China, his government was overthrown in a military coup (possibly CIA backed), and evidence of massive corruption and debt was revealed. As of 1992, for many Ghanaians the promised benefits of the project were still unrealised.

'A Is for Atom'= This final episode, originally broadcast on 16 July 1992, is named after a 1953 General Electric promotional film called A Is for Atom. The episode gives an insight into the history of nuclear power. In the 1950s, scientists and politicians thought they could create a different world with a limitless source of nuclear energy. But things started to go wrong. Scientists in America and the Soviet Union were duped into building dozens of potentially dangerous nuclear power plants. For business reasons, General Electric and Westinghouse decided that the types sold would be versions based on the reactors used in nuclear submarines, but sold with dubious claims made about their cost effectiveness and safety. However, in 1964, at the Atomic Energy Commission it was found that while small reactors were safe, the bigger core sizes as used in power plants were potentially susceptible to nuclear meltdown‚Äîan accident where the reactor core could melt through the bottom of the reactor containment vessel. A study showed this could potentially happen, and if it did, it could damage the reactor. These concerns were largely kept from the public. The episode goes into some detail over attempts to find solutions to the meltdown issue. In the Soviet Union, reactors were considered too expensive, until Brezhnev came to power. Under his leadership, Anatoly Petrovich Alexandrov designed cheap reactors that were produced at high speed, with very few safety features, sometimes not even containment vessels. This was publicly criticized by experts, but the experts were sidelined. In Britain, by 1974, delays to its native advanced gas cooled reactor power plant caused Britain to adopt the American PWR design of reactors. However, in America it was being discovered that safety systems that had to work to avoid meltdown could not be guaranteed to work reliably in the complex circumstances in a nuclear reactor. Tests run on the emergency core-cooling systems to deal with pipe breaks, performed on the Atomic Energy Commission's test models in Idaho in 1971, repeatedly failed; often the water was forced out of the core under pressure. It was discovered that the theoretical calculations had no correspondence with reality. Nevertheless, they had not necessarily proved that they wouldn't work on a real reactor, so they decided to carry on with mandated safety systems, that the best evidence suggested, may well not function in the event of an accident. Engineers and scientists and regulators that tried to publicise the potential issues found that their concerns were not published, and these issues remained largely unknown to the public, and nuclear power had a high degree of confidence with the public. Then came the disasters of Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986, which changed public views on the safety of this new technology. It revealed that the industry had been hiding the problems and unpredictable nature of these types of reactors, and that they had imposed risks on the public, without consultation. It ends with the points that the forms of the reactors were chosen only for business reasons. There are very broad range of scientific and engineering options which were not explored. Therefore, perhaps nuclear power should be led by public decisions and redeveloped, but from a more morality- centred point of view.

It was written in 1969 and originally published in the same year in the literary magazine Neva (1969, No. 3, 4, and 5, publication of the Leningrad Division of the Union of Soviet Writers). It appeared in a book form in 1971, with great number of changes as demanded by the state censor; the English translation was released in 1977. The protagonist is a youngster from Earth, Maxim Kammerer, who gets stranded on an unknown planet named Saraksh.  Plot summary  Maxim Kammerer is a young amateur space explorer from Earth, regarded as a failure by his friends and relatives because this occupation is not considered to be a serious pursuit. The novel starts when he accidentally discovers an unexplored planet Saraksh inhabited by a humanoid race. The atmospheric conditions on Saraksh are such that the inhabitants believe that they live inside a sphere. The level of technological development on the planet is similar to mid-20th century Earth. The planet recently came through big nuclear and conventional war and the predicament of the population is dire. When Maxim lands, the natives mistake his small spaceship for a weapon and destroy it. At first he doesn't take his situation seriously, imagining himself a Robinson Crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but friendly natives. He is looking forward to establishing contact and befriending the population of the planet. However, the reality turns out to be far from glamorous. After being captured by armed natives and initially taken to what appears to be a concentration camp, Kammerer is sent to some governmental research institute which treats him as a mental patient. He escapes and finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The city is grim and polluted, with police and military omnipresent. He makes friends among the ordinary people that lead the life of privation and misery, while twice daily everyone is overcome by sudden an unexplained bouts of ecstatic enthusiasm, proclaiming their total allegiance and undying gratitude to the country's hidden rulers, known as the Unknown Fathers (in the censored versions Fire-bearing Creators), who are said to have the best interests of the people at heart, serving as bulwark against threats foreign and domestic, mainly from the so called degens (degenerates), the uncompromising enemies of the people, the terrorists who sometimes blow up the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) towers strewn around the country. All this makes little sense to Maxim, since his own society is free from war, hostility, crime and material shortages. Still confused about the official ideology, Kammerer gets enlisted in the military, to serve and protect the state and its people. He is ordered to execute some captured degens, one of them a woman. When he refuses, he is shot multiple times, survives, and joins the underground which consists of the degens who suffer great headaches twice daily. Degens believe that the ABM towers are responsible for that. Maxim participates in an attack on one such tower. Captured, tried and sent to a concentration camp in the South, the same one where he has made his landing, he is finally revealed the truth about the towers by a fellow prisoner high ranking member of the underground. They turn out to be broadcasting a mind control signal, employed by the Fathers to control the population. The constant low-intensity broadcast suppresses the ability of most people to evaluate information critically, making the omnipresent regime propaganda much more effective. In addition, twice a day an intense signal relieves mental stresses caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing euphoria in the susceptible majority, and intense headaches in others who are immune to the signal's coercive power. Those are the only sober-thinking people in the country, including both the underground degens and the Fathers themselves. Astonished and appalled by this revelation, Kammerer makes it his mission to rid the planet of the mind control broadcast system. Several of his schemes fail because the cure may be worse than the disease. He escapes to the radioactive South in hopes of organizing an invasion, but the mutants dwelling there are weakly and softhearted, and the tribes further South are ruthless barbarians. He then turns to the state's neighbor ‚Äî the Island Empire ‚Äî but abandons this plan after finding documents on a destroyed Empire submarine that describe mass killings and other atrocities that the Empire military routinely perpetrates. He now focuses on trying to find and destroy the Control Center where the mind control broadcasts originate. Meanwhile, the Fathers decide to start a small victorious war on the country's northern neighbor, Honti. Kammerer surrenders to local gendarmes and is assigned to a penal battalion that is supposed to lead the invasion of the North. In this abortive action, most of his friends perish while Kammerer himself barely escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear blasts. Having served in the war, he earns himself a rehabilitation from the state and is installed in a secret research institution at the behest of a powerful Father known as the Wanderer, who remains out of reach. A Father known as the Smarty realizes that Kammerer is not affected by the broadcasts in any way and plots to use him to stage a coup and take over the state. His plan is for Kammerer to capture the Control Center and use its transmissions to incapacitate his rivals and install him as the new ruler in the minds of the population. The Center is protected by intense depression-inducing local broadcast field that makes it impossible for any native to penetrate it. The Smarty reveals the Center's location to Kammerer, who plays along; however, after penetrating the Center, he destroys it instead, thus disabling the whole system countrywide. It is revealed that the powerful Father, the Wanderer, is in fact a human progressor named Rudolf Sikorski, carefully working in secret to gradually improve the lot of the people of Saraksh. His plans now ruined, the Wanderer finally catches up with Maxim and lambasts him for his interference. He describes the unanticipated consequences of Kammerer's rash actions: up to 20% of the people may die or go insane due to the withdrawal from the mind control signal; Saraksh faces famine, anarchy, widespread radioactive pollution, and looming invasion by the Island Empire which they planned to stop using the depression field. The Wanderer orders Kammerer to leave the planet but Maxim refuses and stays on, to help stabilize the situation. Despite the many upheavals that Saraksh has ahead of her, he is still glad he destroyed the Control Center because now the people can be in charge of their own destiny.  Sequels  According to Boris Strugatsky's later reminiscences,–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –°—Ç—Ä—É–≥–∞—Ü–∫–∏–π. –ö–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∏ –∫ –ø—Ä–æ–π–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º—É (–∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≤–∞—Ä–∏–∞–Ω—Ç) (archived link) the Strugatsky brothers were planning to write a sequel to Inhabited Island. However, following the death of Arkady Strugatsky, the surviving brother felt that he could not bring himself to write the novel. The novel would have been named \\"White Ferz\\" (\\"–ë–µ–ª—ã–π –§–µ—Ä–∑—å\\"). Ferz - the Russian term for Queen in chess, which has male gender in Russian. The novel would have followed the story of the infiltration of Maxim Kammerer, now a progressor, into the heart of the Island Empire. The Island Empire would have been shown as consisting of several social \\"circles\\". While the outer circle represents a fascist militaristic society, the middle circle is a peaceful liberal society, and the inner core is a highly developed harmonic society of intellectuals, similar to the Noon Universe Earth. A special social apparatus directs each citizen of the Empire according to his personality to the circle where he belongs. The book would have shown that this cruel social selection of the Island Empire is the more (or even the only) realistic way for a social utopia to exist, and by contrast would doubt if the Noon Universe's Earth is realistically possible, so much so that it is actually suggested to Maxim by one of the leaders of the Inner Circle (when he finally makes contact with them) that his \\"Earth\\" is really an imaginary world, some literary invention that is impossible to have existed in the real world (serving as the authors' final judgement upon their own creation). Two other sequels exist, Beetle in the Anthill and The Time Wanderers, but their plots are almost independent from the first book: while they have the common characters, Maxim Kammerer and Rudolf Sikorski, the events of Inhabited Island are only briefly mentioned. The events that authors planned to describe in White Ferz took place at some time between the events of Beetle in the Anthill and The Time Wanderers.  Adaptations  There have been three PC games based on the novel released in 2007: adventure game Inhabited Island: Earthling developed by Step Creative Group, strategy Galactic Assault developed by Wargaming and first-person shooter Inhabited Island: Prisoner of Power by Orion Games. A two-part Russian movie adaptation was released in December 2008 and April 2009.  English editions  The first English translation, by H.S. Jacobson, is based on the censored version of the novel, as the original version was unavailable to the translator. The second English translation, by Andrew Bromfield, reflects the original version.https://www.chicagoreviewpress.com/inhabited-island--the- products-9781613735978.php References External links * Read Prisoners of Power by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky on the Perm mirror of Maxim Moshkow Library.

Vegetation The Davis Mountains are a sky island, an isolated mountain range surrounded by desert. The town of Fort Davis at the foot of the Davis Mountains has an elevation of . From that elevation, the sky island rises to . As the elevation increases, average temperatures decline and precipitation increases, permitting an \\"island\\" of forest and other mesic habitat at higher elevations. The McDonald Observatory is situated at an elevation of The most common vegetation of the Davis Mountains is montane grassland, often mixed with scattered bushes and trees. As is common in most Northern Hemisphere semiarid climates the vegetation on the southern slopes of the mountains is noticeably sparser than on the northern slopes. This is due to the greater exposure to the sun on southern slopes, thus warmer temperatures and drier soils. Mixed in with the grassland, and usually at higher elevations, are four woodland and forest zones. First, at elevations below and at higher, drier elevations, the dominate tree species is the alligator juniper mixed with oak species and pinyon pine. Secondly, woodlands with pinyon pine as the most common species are found on steep slopes at elevations of . Third, woodlands in which the gray oak is the most common tree and mixed with other oak species are also found on steep slopes at elevations of . The gray oak woodlands are found in slightly moister soils than the pinyon woodlands. The richest and most diverse of the woodlands and forests in the Davis Mountains are the mesic forests found from . These forests are found in stream valleys and other well-watered areas. Indicator species are ponderosa pine and southwestern white pine, plus two small groves of quaking aspen at elevations of at the base of the cliffs surrounding the summit of Mount Livermore.

Rolling hills in the Davis Mountains Texas separatist standoff The Texas separatist organization known as the Republic of Texas has its origins in the Davis Mountains. On April 27, 1997, the leader of the group, Rick McLaren, staged an attack on his neighbor's house and demanded that he cede his property to the Republic of Texas. This led to 300 state troopers surrounding his house with his five followers, his wife, the victims of the attack, and him inside for close to a week. Ultimately, one follower was shot in the standoff and McLaren was arrested and imprisoned for the equivalent of a life sentence.

Olsen was a regular left winger for the Danish national team, scoring five goals in 43 matches. He represented Denmark at the Euro 1984 and 1986 World Cup tournaments. Career He started his senior career for N√¶stved IF, and made his debut for the Danish national team in a July 1980 friendly match against the Soviet Union. He had a trial with Arsenal FC in 1978‚Äì79, scoring a goal in a reserve team game. Ajax initially tried to sign Olsen in May 1980, but it was only in July 1981 that he moved to play professionally for Ajax in the Netherlands. =Ajax= Wim Jansen, trainer Kurt Linder and Jesper Olsen, in July 1981. While playing for Ajax, Olsen became well known for his part in the infamous \\"passed penalty\\" routine he performed with Johan Cruyff. When Cruyff was awarded a penalty kick in a Dutch Eredivisie league match against Helmond Sport on 5 December 1982, with Ajax leading 1‚Äì0, Cruyff passed the ball sideways to Olsen, who returned it to Cruyff, with the Dutchman then slotting the ball past the bemused goalkeeper to make the score 2‚Äì0. It was allowed by the referee because the penalty is a direct free kick, so it can also be taken indirectly. During his stay with Ajax, Olsen earned the nickname De Vlo (The Flea) due to his posture and his ability to twist, turn and jump to avoid tackles. He was also called \\"The Untouchable\\". The Ajax coach in the 1981‚Äì82 season, Kurt Linder, regarded him the most surprisingly talented player in the young Ajax squad, both technically and tactically phenomenal. Frank Rijkaard, Gerald Vanenburg, Wim Kieft and captain Soren Lerby also played for Ajax then. Olsen won the 1981‚Äì82 Eredivisie championship in his first season at the club (117 goals for and 42 goals against). The next season, 1982‚Äì83, Ajax successfully defended the Eredivisie title, and also won the Dutch Cup to complete The Double, with also young players Jan Molby and Marco van Basten in the squad. In the 1983-84 season, Olsen was the best player in the match Ajax-Feyenoord (8-2!). Olsen scored twice in the qualification tournament for Euro 1984, including a last-minute equaliser in the 2‚Äì2 draw against England. He was selected to represent Denmark at the finals tournament, and played two games, including Denmark's semi-final against Spain. The game ended a draw, but even though Olsen scored in the penalty shootout, Denmark were eliminated when Preben Elkj√¶r missed his shot. =Manchester United= Olsen moved from Ajax to England in July 1984, joining Manchester United for a fee of ¬£350,000, signed by manager Ron Atkinson. He scored a total of 24 goals for the Reds in more than four years at Old Trafford, including a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 3‚Äì0 Football League First Division home win on 22 February 1986. He succeeded Dutchman Arnold Muhren as United's regular left winger, at a time when foreign players still relatively rare in the English game. He collected an FA Cup winner's medal in 1985, when United beat Everton 1‚Äì0 in the final at Wembley, having ousted veteran Dutch midfielder Arnold M√ºhren on the left wing that season. He also helped them establish a runaway lead at the top of the First Division in the first half of the 1985‚Äì86 season, where they won their first 10 league games and remained top of the table until well into the new year before floundering and finishing fourth in the table. Atkinson signed winger Peter Barnes for United at the start of the 1985‚Äì86 season, who provided cover on the left wing when Olsen was out of action with injury, but after Olsen regained his fitness and form, Barnes was sold to Manchester City in January 1987. Already an established member of the Danish national team, he was called up to the Danish squad for the 1986 World Cup, and scored two goals in the three preliminary group stage matches, but he will always be remembered for making a grave mistake in the round of 16 match against Spain. He gave Denmark the lead on a penalty kick, but just before half-time he collected a ball from goalkeeper Lars H√∏gh. When he tried to return the ball to H√∏gh, his pass ended up straight in front of Emilio Butrague√±o instead. The Spanish striker levelled the game, and eventually went on to score four goals in the game that Denmark lost 5‚Äì1. Consequently, the term en rigtig Jesper Olsen (a right Jesper Olsen) entered the Danish lexicon. During October 1986, Olsen had a training ground bust-up with midfield colleague Remi Moses and by the end of the month he was put on the transfer list by manager Ron Atkinson. However, Atkinson was sacked as manager a week later due to United's dismal start to the season, and his successor Alex Ferguson took Olsen off the transfer list and he would stay at Old Trafford for two more years, even passing up the chance to sign John Barnes from Watford in the summer of 1987 due to his faith in Olsen. Through his later years at Old Trafford, Olsen had a hard time adapting to the changing English game, and saw his footballing development stagnate.Kim Simmelsgaard, \\"S√• bli'r Olsen engl√¶nder\\", B.T., 20 October 1991 He was selected for the Denmark team at the Euro 1988, but did not play any games at the tournament. =Bordeaux and Caen= Olsen's Manchester United career ended in the 1988‚Äì89 season, and he transferred to Bordeaux of France for ¬£400,000 in November 1988. In his final full season at Old Trafford, United had finished runners-up to Liverpool in the league. His final United goal had come on 12 December 1987 in a 3‚Äì1 home win over Oxford United. In 1990, he left Bordeaux to play as a wingback for Caen. After suffering a serious injury, he left Caen and retired in 1992, despite being offered the chance to return to English football with Blackburn Rovers and Nottingham Forest.\\"S√• er det slut med Jesper Olsen\\", Politiken, 4 July 1992 Retirement Olsen has maintained a low profile since his retirement as a player, and now lives in Brighton, Victoria, Australia. In 2003, he founded and commenced operating the Fun Football Group in Australia. He was admitted to hospital on 4 May 2006 after suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage.Olsen suffers brain haemorrhage, BBC Sport, 9 May 2006 He had just returned from jogging, when he first felt the effects of the haemorrhage, and said, \\"It was frightening to feel the loss of control\\". After recovering from the haemorrhage, Olsen visited Australia coach Guus Hiddink at the Australian World Cup preparation camp in Melbourne. Olsen was acquainted with Hiddink through his friends S√∏ren Lerby and Frank Arnesen. \\"I'm doing well, but it was a quite scary experience\\", Olsen told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. The newspaper described Jesper Olsen as looking somewhat fatigued, but otherwise appearing as his usual self. In 2011 the Fun Football Group became a part of the Football Star Academy, of which Olsen was appointed as Director of coaching. He oversees the Elite training program, and passes on his worldly knowledge and experiences to new budding football stars. Football Star Academy was instrumental in George Lambadaridis being given a chance to participate in European Football in a move to Club Belgian Club Brugge K.V., and works with Clubs all over Europe such as Panathinaikos F.C. in Greece, and Ipswich Town F.C. in England to link Australian talent to international opportunities. Managerial career From Jan 2010 to May 2011, Olsen was one of the Assistant Managers of A-League club, Melbourne Heart, assisting head coach John Van't Schip in all football matters.

The company bears the title of a Purveyor to the Imperial and Royal Court (k.u.k. Hofzuckerb√§cker) up to today. The pastry shop and chocolaterie is closed until further notice (per their website as of 24th of May 2020).  Location  Interior The building is located in the central Innere Stadt district on Kohlmarkt 14 near Hofburg Palace. The interior was designed by Portois and Fix decorators in a Neo- baroque style. The white-aproned waitresses ‚Äî the Demelinerinnen ‚Äî usually address the customers in a traditional honorific third person style, \\"Haben schon gew√§hlt?\\" or \\"Wollen etwas zu sich nehmen, wenn belieben?\\". The cabaret artist Helmut Qualtinger extolled their timeless quality in his song Die Demelinerinnen. Demel temporarily had one additional location in Salzburg, which was closed in March 2012. The company formerly had a small cafe at The Plaza's Retail Collection in New York City, but this location has since closed (as of March 2010). The corporate website indicates they are continuing to look for a new location to operate in New York. History The k.k. Hofzuckerb√§ckerei pastry shop was founded on Michaelerplatz by Ludwig Dehne, a confectioner from W√ºrttemberg. Upon his early death in 1799, the business was continued by his widow for their minor son August Dehne. In 1813 she purchased the house on Michaelerplatz 14. August Dehne inherited the company in 1832 and successfully managed the business, however, as his son pursued an academic career, he sold the company to his journeyman Christoph Demel in 1857. Renamed Ch. Demel's S√∂hne in 1867, Christoph Demel's sons Joseph and Karl continued the business and were granted the title of a purveyor to the Habsburg court by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1874. When in 1888 the old Burgtheater on Michaelerplatz was demolished combined with a general refurbishment of the whole square, they moved the confectionery around the corner to Kohlmarkt, where the company is still located today in its original building. In the heyday of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, notable customers included Empress Elisabeth (Sisi), Princess Pauline von Metternich, and actress Katharina Schratt. During the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany 1938‚Äì45, the Vienna Gauleiter Baldur von Schirach and his wife Henriette were regulars here. The company was headed by Demel's heirs until 1972, when the entrepreneur Udo Proksch bought it and established the Club 45 on the first floor, a popular venue of the Vienna high society. After Proksch was arrested for his involvement in the Lucona affair in 1989, the Raiffeisen Bank became the owner of the famous company. In 2002 the Do & Co restaurants and catering company took over Demel. Demel exterior sign Legal issues In the early decades of the twentieth century, a legal battle over the use of the label \\"The Original Sacher Torte\\" developed between the Hotel Sacher and the Demel bakery. Eduard Sacher, son of Franz Sacher, the inventor of Sachertorte, had completed his own recipe of his father's cake during his time at Demel, which was the first establishment to offer the \\"Original\\" cake. Following the death of Eduard's widow Anna in 1930 and the bankruptcy of the Hotel Sacher in 1934, Eduard Sacher's son (also named Eduard Sacher) found employment at Demel and brought to the bakery the sole distribution right for an Eduard-Sacher-Torte. The first differences of opinion arose in 1938, when the new owners of the Hotel Sacher began to sell Sacher Tortes from vendor carts under the trademarked name \\"The Original Sacher Torte\\". After interruptions brought about by the Second World War and the ensuing Allied occupation, the hotel owners sued Demel in 1954, with the hotel asserting its trademark rights and the bakery claiming it developed and bought the title \\"Original Sacher Torte\\". Over the next seven years, both parties waged an intense legal war over several of the dessert's specific characteristics, including the change of the name, the second layer of jam in the middle of the cake, and the substitution of margarine for butter in the baking of the cake. The author Friedrich Torberg, who was a frequent guest at both establishments, served as a witness during this process and testified that, during the lifetime of Anna Sacher, the cake was never covered with marmalade or cut through the middle. In 1963 both parties agreed on an out of court settlement that gave the Hotel Sacher the rights to the phrase \\"The Original Sachertorte\\" and gave the Demel the rights to decorate its tortes with a triangular seal that reads Eduard-Sacher-Torte.

An accordionist plays the tune of a song, the text of which is shown. A love song is a song about romantic love, falling in love, heartbreak after a breakup, and the feelings that these experiences bring. A comprehensive list of even the best known performers and composers of love songs would be a large order. Love songs can be found in a variety of different music genres. History Love songs have been around for centuries and can be found in the histories and cultures of most societies, though their ubiquity is a modern phenomenon. A highly controversial and startling explanation of the genesis of love songs can be found in Denis de Rougemont's \\"Love in the Western World\\". De Rougemont's thesis is that the love song grew out of the courtly love songs of the troubadours, and that those songs represented a rejection of the historical Christian notion of love. Identities of love songs change from time to time, from the decade of love in the 1970s, through night partying in the 1980s, and into the dark romance of the 1990s.

With a height of , it is the seventh highest summit in the Alps, overall. Based on prominence, it can be regarded as the third most prominent mountain in the Alps,based on a height difference of at least 300 metres above other points. and the second highest in Switzerland, after Monte Rosa.Without counting subsidiary summits of Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa. The Dom is the main summit of the Mischabel group (German: Mischabelh√∂rner), which is the highest massif lying entirely in Switzerland. The Dom is noteworthy for its 'normal route' of ascent having the greatest vertical height gain of all the alpine 4000 metre peaks, and none of that route's 3,100 metres of height can be achieved using mechanical means. Although Dom is a German cognate for 'dome', it can also mean 'cathedral' and the mountain is named after Canon Berchtold of Sitten cathedral, the first person to survey the vicinity. The former name Mischabel comes from an ancient German dialect term for pitchfork, as the highest peaks of the massif stand close to each other.  Geographical setting  The Dom is the culminating point of a chain running from the Schwarzberghorn on the south, at the intersection with the main chain of the Alps (Alpine watershed), to the Distelhorn on the north and ending above the town of Stalden. The chain lies entirely in the district of Visp. The Dom from the Nadelgrat The two valleys separated by the range are the Mattertal on the west and the Saastal on the east. The towns of Randa and Saas-Fee lie both six kilometres from the summit (to the west and the east, respectively). The elevation difference between the summit and the valley floor is 3,150 metres on the west side (Randa) and 3,000 metres on the east side (Saas-Grund). On the Mattertal side, the Dom faces the almost equally high Weisshorn and, on the Saastal side, it faces the Weissmies. The Dom is the highest point of the Saastal and the second highest mountain of the Mattertal after Monte Rosa. Since the Dom is not on the main Alpine chain, the rivers flowing on both the west and east side of the massif end up in the same major river, the Rhone, through the Mattervispa and the Saaservispa. The Dom is the highest mountain in the Alps with this peculiarity. The Mischabel group includes many subsidiary summits above 4,000 metres. To the north lies the Nadelgrat, composed of the Lenzspitze, the Nadelhorn, the Stecknadelhorn, the Hohberghorn and the D√ºrrenhorn. The Nadelgrat is easily visible from the north and gives the massif its characteristic pitchfork appearance. The second highest peak of the massif, the T√§schhorn to the south, culminates at 4,491 metres, and south of it, is the characteristically flat summit of the Alphubel. In total, eight summits above 4,000 metres make up the Mischabel massif.Without counting the Allalinhorn, Rimpfischhorn and Strahlhorn to the south Other important peaks of the massif are the Ulrichshorn and the Balfrin. The Dom has a western shoulder (4,479 m) and an eastern shoulder (4,468 m). Generally, areas above 3,000 metres are covered by glaciers, the two largest being the Ried Glacier situated at the foot of the Nadelgrat and the Fee Glacier, at the foot of the Dom itself, below the east face.  Geology  The massif is almost entirely composed of gneiss from the Siviez-Mischabel nappe. The latter is part of the Brian√ßonnais microcontinent and is located in the Penninic nappes.  Climbing history  East face above the Fee Glacier The first ascent of the Dom was made on 11 September 1858. It was reached via the Festigrat (north-west ridge) by John Llewelyn Davies with guides Johann Zumtaugwald, Johann Kr√∂nig and Hieronymous Brantschen.Dom erstersteiger.de Davies published an account of his ascent in Peaks, Passes and Glaciers. The first ascent of the western ridge (above the Festikinl√ºcke) was made in 1879 by two parties. One comprised Mrs E. P. Jackson with her guides Aloys Pollinger, Peter Josef Truffer and Josef Biner. The second consisted of Percy Thomas with Josef Imboden and Josef Lengen. They bypassed the upper section and traversed the west face to join the upper part of the Festigrat before arriving to the summit. The first complete ascent on the entire western ridge was made later in 1882 by Paul G√ºssfeldt and guides Alexander Burgener and Benedict Venetz. The direct route on the west face (50¬∞ ice slope, TD-) was first ascended in 1962. The 1000-metre-high east face above Saas-Fee was climbed in 1875 by Johann Petrus, along with his clients Alfred and Walter Puckle, and a local hunter, Lorenz Noti. A route on the south face was first made in August 1906 by Geoffrey Winthrop Young and R. G. Major, with the guides Josef Knubel and Gabriel Lochmatter of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais. According to Young it was more dangerous than the south-west face of the nearby T√§schhorn, which they had climbed two weeks earlier. On 18 June 1917, Arnold Lunn, a pioneer ski mountaineer, and Josef Knubel of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais made the first ski ascent of the Dom, by the Hohberg Glacier (north flank).Helmut Dumler, Willi P. Burkhardt, Les 4000 des Alpes,  Climbing routes and huts  The west side of the Dom Climbing the Dom by its normal route is a relatively straightforward, but nevertheless long and somewhat arduous 3,100-metre ascent on foot from the valley, and taking 6 hours to the summit from the Dom Hut. The route is graded as PD- on the French adjectival climbing scale. This route has been described in the mountaineering literature as \\"something of a snow trudge\\". The only mechanical means of access is located in the Saas-Fee area, on the east side of the mountain, from which all the routes to the Dom are much harder. The easiest way to the summit starts from Randa, where there is a railway station (1,407 m) served by the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn. From Randa a trail leads to the Dom Hut (2,940 m), which also crosses the Europaweg near the Europa Hut. Climbing the mountain requires an overnight stay at the Dom Hut. The normal route starts from the hut and goes on the Festigletscher glacier towards the Festijoch (3,720 m). It then follows the Hohberggletscher glacier to the summit above the north face. An alternative route is provided by the Festigrat, which is the Dom's north- western ridge. It goes directly from the Festijoch to the summit, and is preferred by climbers who wish to avoid the long slopes of the north flank. In good conditions it is graded at PD/PD+. However, its upper section can be treacherous in icy conditions, in which case the north flank approach is better. =Domgrat= The summit of the Dom can also be reached from the south by the classic and exposed 'T√§sch-Dom traverse'. This is a very long, committing and challenging mountaineering route which has been described as \\"one of the most demanding ridge grandes courses in the Alps\\".. This route (via the south ridge or Domgrat), first requires an ascent of the adjacent T√§schhorn - most easily attained from the Mischabel Bivouac Hut perched on Mishabeljoch. From there, an ascent of the T√§schhorn's south-southeast ridge (Mischabelgrat, grade AD, III) is made in 4 to 5 hours. The descent from the T√§schhorn to the Domjoch (4,282m) is on steep, slabby and sometimes icy rock, taking 2-3 hours, followed by a further 2-3 hours ascent of the rocky crest of the Domgrat ((Grade D, III+) before the Dom's summit cross is finally reached after some 8 to 11 hours of sustained climbing in total, followed by a long but simple descent of the 'normal route' to reach the Dom Hut.

He spent nine years at United, where he was captain, helping the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup. He won three caps for England in 1905. Playing career Born in Darlington, Roberts started his football career with Bishop Auckland, but soon moved to Grimsby Town. In 1904, he was transferred to Manchester United for ¬£600. The United manager at the time was Ernest Mangnall who had embarked on a spending spree which would later see Manchester City players Billy Meredith and Sandy Turnbull arrive at Bank Street, United's ground at the time. Roberts arrival at United was extremely important to the development of the club; a strong, skilful, fast centre half and a rebel to boot. He flouted FA rules by wearing his shorts above the knee and was politically minded in favour of the unionisation of professional footballers. Playing as centre-half he helped Manchester United win the 1908 and 1911 league titles as well as the 1909 FA Cup. He left the club in August 1913 for a then record fee of ¬£1,500 to Oldham Athletic, who he also went on to manage, after appearing in 299 matches and scoring 23 goals for United. Roberts was capped three times for England in 1905, Manchester United's first England international. Not until 1983, when a United side captained by Bryan Robson lifted the FA Cup for the fifth time, did another Englishman captain the club to FA Cup glory, as United's captains of their second and third triumphs were both Irish and their fourth FA Cup winning side was captained by a Scotsman.Johnny Carey and Noel Cantwell captained the 1948 and 1963 teams and Martin Buchan captained the side in 1977 Players' Union On 2 December 1907, Roberts and Meredith were instrumental in setting up the Players' Union. The organisation was not recognised by the FA but it did attract considerable support from fellow League clubs. In August 1909, the FA threatened to suspend any player who admitted to being a member of the Union, following which Roberts and his Manchester United's teammates were summoned to a meeting with the club's management. The players refused to relinquish their Union membership, forcing the club to contact their first opponents of the new season, Bradford City to cancel the fixture, as it could not field a team. The FA's threat had seen the membership of the Union fall so that the only members were the Manchester United players, who called themselves \\"The Outcasts\\". It was only after Tim Coleman of Everton renewed his support by siding with The Outcasts that the FA relented and Roberts' Union was saved. Coaching career In 1928, together with former colleague Billy Meredith, he became a coach for the ambitious Manchester Central. Roberts' son, Charlie Jr., was a player for Central's first season. He died, aged 56, at Manchester Royal Infirmary in August 1939 following a cranial operation after suffering extended \\"dizzy spells\\". Personal life Roberts' cousin, Harry Hooper, played at full-back for Southampton, Leicester City and Queens Park Rangers. His nephews, Danny, Bill, Mark and Carl Hooper, were all professional footballers, and his nieces, Sarah and Bessie Hooper, played for Darlington Quaker Ladies. His great-great-granddaughter, Lucy Roberts, played for Manchester United W.F.C. in their inaugural season.

It took place on 23 August (13 August on old style calendar) 1595 between the Wallachian army led by Michael the Brave and the Ottoman army led by Koca Sinan Pasha. It was part of the Long War, fought between Christian and Ottoman forces at the end of the 16th ‚Äì beginning of the 17th centuries. The whole Ottoman force was estimated at about 100,000 men, but not all of their troops were on the battlefield at CƒÉlugƒÉreni. It seems that only about 30,000-40,000 Ottoman soldiers were involved in the battle. Michael the Brave had in total about 15,000 menA. D. Xenopol, Istoria Romanilor Vol. 5 and about 12 large field cannons, with Transylvanian (Sz√©kely) detachments.Singur √Æmpotriva Europei, Author: Mircea Dogaru, Publisher: Phobos, Bucharest 2005 Michael the Brave strategically positioned his forces near a swampy field (near Neajlov river) that would negate the Ottoman's military superiority. South of the village of CƒÉlugƒÉreni, where the C√¢lni≈ütea river flows into the Neajlov river, the terrain is a muddy marsh, surrounded by forests. A narrow bridge over the Neajlov river was a mandatory pass point. The battle had three different phases. First phase of the battle The day of 23 August started with probing cavalry attacks. The Wallachian cavalry surprised the Ottoman cavalry in front of the village and pushed it over the Neajlov river. Michael the Brave positioned himself with 10,000 troops and 10 cannons north of the Neajlov river and south of the village. The Sz√©kely mercenary Captain Albert Kir√°ly was in charge of the reserve of 6,000 Sz√©kely troops. The reserve was positioned rather far, north- west of the village, to stop any possible attack from the direction of the village of Singureni. After the cavalry skirmish, Koca Sinan Pasha sent forward a force 12,000 strong. Michael the Brave waited for the Ottoman forces to cross the river and, after a heavy artillery bombardment, attacked fiercely pushing the Turks back over the river. The first phase of the battle ended favorably for the Wallachians. Second phase of the battle The second phase started at noon, when Sinan Pasha launched a decisive attack with all the forces he had at that moment. Janissaries made a frontal attack over the bridge while other forces made a double flanking maneuver (Mehmet Satirghi Pashha in the east and Hasan Pasha (beylerbey of Rumelia) in the west, passing over Neajlov by the bridge of Singureni). Janissaries attacked not only on the bridge, but also used logs and planks to help them cross the marsh. Initially their attack was stopped, but Ottoman cavalry managed to cross the river via a ford in the east and threatened the Wallachian left wing. Michael retreated, abandoning all his cannons. He rallied his troops north of the village where he stopped the Ottoman advance. The second phase of the battle ended favorably for the Ottomans. Third phase of the battle The third and last phase of the battle took place in the afternoon and started with a strong frontal Wallachian attack, led by Michael the Brave. Captain Cocea had just returned from a scouting mission with 400 cavalry and his fresh forces were used in this attack in a flanking maneuver. Mehmet Sat√Ærgi Pasha's troops were pushed into the Janissaries and the Ottoman forces were crowded in a narrow space north of the Neajlov river. The Wallachian counterattack reached the bridge and the cannons were retaken and used to inflict many casualties on the Ottomans. Sinan Pasha tried to restore the situation by advancing with his personal guard, but the Ottoman forces dispersed in disarray when Captain Cocea's cavalry attacked them in the rear. The Wallachians attacked the Ottoman camp simultaneously, which was near Hulube≈üti village. In the disorganized retreat, legend has it that Michael the Brave, true to his name, took a battle axe and (as Robert the Bruce had done to Sir Henry de Bouhen at the battle of Bannockburn) threw Sinan Pasha from his horse and into the marsh, but he was saved by one of his slaves. The Wallachians were unable to pursue the fleeing Ottomans because Hasan Pasha appeared on their right flank. Michael the Brave turned with all his men against Hasan Pasha and routed his forces. Aftermath of the battle The casualties are estimated at least 1,000 men for Wallachians, while the Ottoman casualties are thought to be in the range of 10,000 to 15,000. Michael the Brave knew that he still was greatly outnumbered, and during the night he retreated northward. He abandoned both Bucharest and T√¢rgovi≈üte, stopping at the winter camp in Stoiene≈üti, near the RucƒÉr-Bran Pass. Sinan Pasha captured the capital, Bucharest, and left there Mehmed Pasha with 10,000 troops, then captured T√¢rgovi≈üte where he left another 1,500 troops and 30 cannons. The bulk of the Ottoman army advanced to Stoiene≈üti, where it took positions in front of the Wallachian army, but did not attack. On 6 September, the Transylvanian prince Sigismund B√°thory arrived with around 7,500 cavalry to support Michael the Brave. Early October another 1,500 troops from the Habsburg Empire and 300 cavalry from Tuscany arrived. These combined forces attacked the Ottomans and eventually defeated them at T√¢rgovi≈üte (18 October), Bucharest (22 October), and Giurgiu (26 October).

Charger for a plus-minus net fence An electric fence is a barrier that uses electric shocks to deter animals and people from crossing a boundary. The voltage of the shock may have effects ranging from discomfort to death. Most electric fences are used today for agricultural fencing and other forms of animal control, although they are also used to protect high-security areas such as military installations or prisons, where potentially lethal voltages may be used. Design and function Detail of an electric fence material made of synthetic cord with metal interwoven through it, attached to a steel fence post with a plastic insulator. This material is more visible than wire, but most often used for temporary fencing. Electric fences are designed to create an electrical circuit when touched by a person or animal. A component called a power energizer converts power into a brief high voltage pulse. One terminal of the power energizer releases an electrical pulse along a connected bare wire about once per second. Another terminal is connected to a metal rod implanted in the earth, called a ground or earth rod. A person or animal touching both the wire and the earth during a pulse will complete an electrical circuit and will conduct the pulse, causing an electric shock. The effects of the shock depend upon the voltage, the energy of the pulse, the degree of contact between the recipient and the fence and ground and the route of the current through the body; it can range from barely noticeable to uncomfortable, painful or even lethal. =Fence energizers= Early alternating current (AC) fence chargers used a transformer and a mechanically driven switch to generate the electrical pulses. The pulses were wide and the voltage unpredictable, with no-load peaks in excess of 10,000 volts and a rapid drop in voltage as the fence leakage increased. The switch mechanism was prone to failure. Later systems replaced the switch with a solid-state circuit, with an improvement in longevity but no change in pulse width or voltage control. \\"Weed burner\\" fence chargers were popular for a time and featured a longer-duration output pulse that would destroy weeds touching the fence. These were responsible for many grass fires when used during dry weather. Although still available, they have declined in popularity. Most modern fences emit pulses of high voltage at a given interval of time, and don't take into account whether there is an animal or person touching the conductive wires, except for the voltage multiplier based electric fence charger that stores high voltage potential and dumps its charges as soon as a conductive load (grounded animal/person) touches the wires. Depending on the area to be fenced and remoteness of its location, fence energizers may be hooked into a permanent electrical circuit, they may be run by lead-acid or dry cell batteries, or a smaller battery kept charged by a solar panel. The power consumption of a fence in good condition is low, and so a lead-acid battery powering several hundred metres of fence may last for several weeks on a single charge. For shorter periods dry cell batteries may be used. Some energizers can be powered by more than one source. =Fencing materials= Smooth steel wire is the material most often used for electric fences, ranging from a fine thin wire used as a single line to thicker, high-tensile (HT) wire. Less often, woven wire or barbed wire fences can be electrified, though such practices create a more hazardous fence, particularly if a person or animal becomes caught by the fencing material (electrified barbed wire is unlawful in some areas). Synthetic webbing and rope-like fencing materials woven with fine conducting wires (usually of stainless steel) have become available over the last 15 to 20 years, and are particularly useful for areas requiring additional visibility or as temporary fencing. The electrified fence itself must be kept insulated from the earth and from any materials that will conduct electricity and ignite or short out the fence. Fencing must therefore avoid vegetation, and cannot be attached directly to wood or metal posts. Typically, wooden or metal posts are driven into the ground and plastic or porcelain insulators are attached to them, or plastic posts are used. The conducting material is then attached to the posts. =Palisade fences= Residential Electric Palisade Fence in Johannesburg, South Africa. The top spikes are electrified while the bottom slats of the palisade are grounded. Electrified palisade fences are usually made from painted mild steel, galvanized steel, stainless steel or aluminium. Typically the fences are and typically send high voltage electric pulses through the palisade at a frequency of 1 Hz (one pulse per second). Palisade electric fences are used in most countries, particularly where there is little vegetation to short circuit the fence or where the costs of security personnel is high in relation to automated security equipment. The electric pulse is a strong deterrent for criminals, while the palisade fence is mechanically stronger than a typical steel cable electric fence, being able to withstand impact from wildlife, small falling trees and wildfires. Due to the high levels of crime in South Africa, it is common for residential houses to have perimeter defences. The City of Johannesburg promotes the use of palisade fencing over opaque, usually brick, walls as criminals cannot hide as easily behind the fence. In the City of Johannesburg manual on safety one can read about best practices and maintenance of palisade fencing, such as not growing vegetation in front of palisades as this allows criminals to make an unseen breach. History Electric fence in urban environment First published in 1832, Chapter 7 of Domestic Manners of the Americans by Fanny Trollope describes an arrangement of wires connected with an electrical machine used to protect a display called \\"Dorfeuille's Hell\\" in the Western Museum of natural history in Cincinnati, which she herself invented. Published in 1870, Chapter 22 of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, describes, \\"The Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo\\" the use of electrification of a structure as a defensive weapon. Published in 1889, Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, uses an electric fence for defensive purposes. David H. Wilson obtained United States Patent 343,939 in 1886, combining protection, an alarm bell, and telephone communications. He constructed an experimental 30-mile electric fence energized by a water wheel in Texas in 1888, but it was not successful.\\"ELECTRIC FENCE,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/aoe01), accessed August 4, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. In 1905, the Russian army improvised electric fences during the Russo-Japanese War at Port Arthur. In 1915, during World War I, the German army installed the \\"Wire of Death\\", an electrified fences along the border between Belgium and the Netherlands Maartje M. Abbenhuis The art of staying neutral: the Netherlands in the First World War, 1914-1918, Amsterdam University Press, 2006 pages 164-168 to prevent unauthorized movement of people across the border. The fences covered 300 kilometres and consisted of several strands of copper wire, backed with barbed wire, and energized to several thousand volts. An estimated 3,000 human fatalities were caused by the fence, as well as the destruction of livestock. Electric fences were used to control livestock in the United States in the early 1930s, and electric fencing technology developed in both the United States and New Zealand. An early application of the electric fence for livestock control was developed in 1936-1937 by New Zealand inventor Bill Gallagher. Built from a car ignition trembler coil set, Gallagher used the device to keep his horse from scratching itself against his car. Gallagher later started the Gallagher Group to improve and market the design. In 1962, another New Zealand inventor, Doug Phillips, invented the non-shortable electric fence based on capacitor discharge.\\"...while working as a scientist at Ruakura Agricultural Research Centre in the 1950s...\\" Ag Heritage This significantly increased the range an electric fence could be used from a few hundred metres to 35 km (~20 miles), and reduced the cost of fencing by more than 80%.\\"50 YEARS OF POWER FENCING\\", V. Jones, Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association 49: 145-149 (1988) The non-shortable electric fence was patented by Phillips and by 1964 was manufactured by Plastic Products, a New Zealand firm, under the name \\"Waikato Electric Fence.\\" This idea was to replace ceramic with plastic insulators. A variety of plastic insulators are now used on farms throughout the world today. By 1939, public safety concerns in the United States prompted Underwriters' Laboratories to publish a bulletin on electric shock from electric fences, leading to the ANSI/UL standard No. 69 for electric fence controllers.Mark W. Kroll, Taser conducted electrical weapons: physiology, pathology, and law, Springer, 2009 pp. 18-19 In 1969 Robert B. Cox, a farmer in Adams County, Iowa, invented an improved electric fence bracket and was issued United States Patent No. 3,516,643 on June 23, 1970. This bracket improved electric fences by keeping the wire high enough above the ground and far enough away from the fence to permit grass and weeds growing beneath the wire to be mowed. The brackets attached to the posts by what may be called a \\"pivot bind\\" or \\"torsion-lock.\\" The weight of the bracket, the attached insulator and the electric wire attached to the insulator bind the bracket to the post. Electric fences have improved significantly over the years. Improvements include: * Polyethylene insulators replacing porcelain insulators, beginning in the 1960s. Polyethylene is much cheaper than porcelain and is less breakable. * Improvements in electrical design of the fence energizer, often called a \\"charger\\" (USA) or \\"fencer\\" (UK). * Changes in laws. In some jurisdictions, certain types of electrical outputs for fences were unlawful until the 1950s or 1960s. In other areas, signage requirements and other restrictions limited usability. Many US cities continue to have outdated laws prohibiting electric fences to prevent agricultural fences from entering the city. Houston in Texas for example, changed their ordinance that prohibited electric fencing in 2008. * Introduction of high tensile (HT) steel fence wire in the 1970s in New Zealand and in the 1980s in the United States. * Introduction of synthetic webbing and rope-like fencing materials woven with fine conducting wires. * Design of moveable fence components, such as Tumblewheel, a moveable fence post used to create mobile one-wire fences for the purpose of rotational grazing. The insulated central hub enables the line to maintain power while the fence is being moved. Uses =Agriculture= Permanent electric fencing is used in many agricultural areas, as construction of electric fences can be much cheaper and faster than conventional fences (it uses plain wire and much lighter construction, as the fence does not need to physically restrain animals). The risk of injury to livestock (particularly horses) is lower compared to fences made of barbed wire or certain types of woven wire with large openings that can entangle the feet. Its disadvantages include the potential for the entire fence to be disabled due to a break in the conducting wire, shorting out if the conducting wire contacts any non-electrified component that may make up the rest of the fence, power failure, or forced disconnection due to the risk of fires starting by dry vegetation touching an electrified wire. Other disadvantages can be lack of visibility and the potential to shock an unsuspecting human passer-by who might accidentally touch or brush the fence. Many fences are made entirely of standard smooth or high-tensile wire, although high quality synthetic fencing materials are also beginning to be used as part of permanent fences, particularly when visibility of the fence is a concern. Conventional agricultural fencing of any type may be strengthened by the addition of a single electric line mounted on insulators attached to the top or front of the fence. A similar wire mounted close to the ground may be used to prevent pigs from excavating beneath other fencing. Substandard conventional fencing can also be made temporarily usable until proper repairs are made by the addition of a single electric line set on a \\"stand-off\\" insulator. A temporary electric fence of synthetic materials and plastic step-in posts set about 12 feet apart Electric materials are also used for the construction of temporary fencing, particularly to support the practice of managed intensive grazing (also known as rotational or \\"strip\\" grazing). It is also popular in some places for confining horses and pack animals overnight when trail riding, hunting, or at competitions such as endurance riding and competitive trail riding. Typically, one or more strands of wire, synthetic tape or cord are mounted on metal or plastic posts with stakes at the bottom, designed to be driven into the ground with the foot. For a hand-tightened temporary fence of electrified rope or web in a small area, these are usually spaced at no more than 12 to 15 feet (about four metres) to prevent the fencing material from sagging and touching the ground. Larger areas where tools are used to stretch wire may be able to set step-in posts at larger distances without risk that the fencing material will sag. With temporary electric fencing, a large area can be fenced off in a short period. Temporary fencing that is intended to be left in place for several weeks or months may be given additional support by the use of steel T posts (which are quickly driven in with hand tools and unearthed with relative ease, using a leverage device), to help keep the fence upright, particularly at corners. Livestock owners using rotational grazing in set patterns that are similar from one year to the next, may permanently drive a few permanent wooden fence posts in strategic locations. Portable fence energizers are made for temporary fencing, powered solely by batteries, or by a battery kept charged by a small solar panel. Rapid laying-out and removal of multiple-strand temporary electric fencing over a large area may be done using a set of reels mounted on a tractor or all-terrain vehicle. For sheep, poultry, and other smaller animals, plastic electric netting may be mounted on insulating stakes - this is also effective at keeping out some predators such as foxes. In practice, once most animals have learned of the unpleasant consequences of touching the fence they tend to avoid it for considerable periods even when it is inactive. However, some animals learn to avoid the shock, either by running under the fence quickly between pulses, or by pushing other individuals through the fence. Animals with thick woolly coats (such as sheep or highland cattle) may learn to push through the fence themselves, using their coats as electrical insulation. Some animals also learn to recognize the slight clicking sound made by some electric fences and thus can sense when the fence is off. =Wild animals= Electric fencing to protect a walkway against wildlife. Pilanesberg Game Reserve, South Africa A wolf jumping over an electric fence only touching the plus pole not getting an electric shock. Electric fences are useful for controlling the movements of wild animals. Examples include deterring deer from entering private property, keeping animals off airport runways, keeping wild boar from raiding crops, and preventing geese from soiling areas used by people. Electric fencing has been extensively used in environmental situations reducing the conflict between elephants or other animals and humans in Africa and Asia.\\"Jumbo dilemma\\", Bangkok Post However, electric fences are increasingly used in small livestock farming as a management tool to exclude animals, such as potential predators, that will tunnel under these fences to gain entrance to livestock camps. Electrified fences are also increasingly used on both domestic livestock and wildlife (game) farms in Africa as a management tool to exclude predators from entering or exiting a camp. A number of animal species, other than predators, may dig under these fences in order to cross that barrier Beck, A. 2008. Electric fence induced mortality in South Africa. M.Sc. thesis, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.. The value of electrified fences is offset by lethal electrocution threats to a number of species including vulnerable and endangered species such as African Ground Pangolin (Smutsia temminckii), Southern African Python (Python natalensis), and a number of tortoise species Heard, H.W. and Stephenson, A. 1987. Electrification of a fence to control the movements of black-backed jackals. South African Journal of Wildlife Research 17: 20‚Äì24.Jacobsen, N.H.G., Newbery, R.E., De Wet, M.J., Viljoen, P.C. and Pietersen, E. 1991. A contribution of the ecology of the Steppe Pangolin Manis temminckii in the Transvaal. Zeitschrift f√ºr S√§ugetierkunde 56: 94‚Äì100.Burger, M. and Branch, W.R. 1994. Tortoise mortality caused by electric fences in the Thomas Baines Nature Reserve. South African Journal of Wildlife Research 24: 32‚Äì37. . In South Africa it is estimated that more than 31 500 reptiles (predominantly tortoises) are killed on electrified fences annually. The estimate for African Ground Pangolins killed by electrocution is 377‚Äì1 028 annually . The impacts of electrified fences on other species, such as Monitor Lizard (Varanus spp), have not been quantified. Pangolins are bipedal, walking on their hind legs with their front legs and tail held off the ground, leaving their ventral surface unprotected . This makes them particularly prone to accidental electrocution on electrified fences . Depending on the electrified fence‚Äôs design and height of the lower lines, the pangolin's head or exposed belly come into contact with the electrified wire(s). The initial shock will causes the pangolin to adopt its defense of rolling into a ball, often resulting in it inadvertently wrapping itself around the electriÔ¨Åed wire . An animal wrapped around the electric wire receives successive shocks, which in the case of pangolins results in them curling into an ever tighter ball around the live wire . The repeated electrical pulses ultimately kill the pangolin. Those not killed outright usually succumb to exposure, dehydration or starvation. Pangolins found dead on electric fences often have epidermal burns, these sometimes burning through the scales. Internal injuries may also be significant. Pangolins found alive while wrapped around an electrified wire may suffer debilitating neurological damage if they have experienced prolonged exposure to the electric current. These ultimately succumb even when released. =Security= Non-lethal fence Security electric fences are electric fences constructed using specialised equipment and built for perimeter security as opposed to animal management. Security electric fences consist of wires that carry pulses of electric current to provide a non-lethal shock to deter potential intruders. Tampering with the fence also results in an alarm that is logged by the security electric fence energiser, and can also trigger a siren, strobe, or notifications to a control room or directly to the owner via email or phone. In practical terms, security electric fences are a type of perimeter intrusion detection sensor array that acts as a (or part of a) physical barrier, a psychological deterrent to potential intruders, and as part of a security alarm system. Multi-zone security electric fence used alongside a physical barrier. Non-lethal electric fences are used by both private and government-sector bodies to prevent trespass. These include freight carriers, auto auctions, equipment rental companies, auto dealers, housing communities, commercial factories or warehouses, prisons, military bases, and government buildings. Many of these electric fences act as monitored security alarm systems in addition to causing an uncomfortable shock. Electrified palisade fences are used to protect isolated property and high security facilities, but also around some residential homes. They can also be used inside a building, for example as a grid behind windows or skylights to prevent people from climbing through. They have even been used on yachts and on large ships to deter pirates. Electric fences are occasionally employed to discourage suicide attempts on tall structures, and to reduce the incidence of graffiti and other petty crime. Due to the high levels of crime in South Africa, it is common for residential houses to have perimeter defences. The City of Johannesburg promotes the use of palisade fencing rather than opaque, usually brick, walls as criminals cannot hide as easily behind the fence. In the City of Johannesburg manual on safety, one can read about best practices and maintenance of palisade fencing, such as not growing vegetation in front of palisades as this allows criminals to make an unseen breach. Types of security electric fences include: ; Piggyback: A Piggyback electric fence is mounted off the back of an existing wire or mesh fence, adding another level of security to the existing perimeter barrier. The piggyback profile is fastened to existing fence posts (e.g. pillars of a palisade fence) using rivets or screws. These are the most commonly used security electric fences. ; Wall top:Wall-top electric fences attach to the top of an existing perimeter barrier such as a masonry wall. These are the second most common type of security electric fences. ; Stand alone:Stand-alone electric fences act as the sole perimeter barrier. This type is normally found as one of many layers of perimeter security around high security establishments, meaning that in order touch it, an intruder would have had to previously bypass at least one physical barrier. Nazi concentration camps were surrounded by electric fences, like this one shown above at Auschwitz, which contained lethal voltages, continuously rather than in pulses Stun-lethal fence A \\"stun-lethal\\" electric fence can be set to deliver a shock if touched once, and a fatal jolt if touched a second time. 12-foot-high \\"stun- lethal\\" fences have been in use for some time in many US state prisons, like those in Arizona. The Federal Department of Corrections added them in 2005 to two prisons in Coleman, Florida, and prisons in Tucson; Terre Haute, Indiana; Hazelton, West Virginia; Pine Knot, Kentucky; and Pollock, Louisiana. A \\"stun- lethal\\" fence may also consist of two fences; one set of wires forming a conventional pulsed DC non-lethal fence, the second set (interleaved with the first) forming a 6.6kV AC lethal fence, energized when the DC fence detects an intruder. Alternatively it may consist of a single, AC or pulsed DC fence capable of running in \\"safe\\", \\"unsafe\\" or \\"lethal\\" modes by varying the DC pulse energy, AC/DC fence voltage and/or fence on-off duty cycle. Lethal fence Electric fences designed to carry potentially lethal currents can be used for anti-personnel purposes. In 1915, during World War I, the German occupiers of Belgium closed off the border with neutral Netherlands, using a 300 km electric fence running from Vaals to Scheldt. Germany also erected a similar fence to isolate thirteen Alsatian villages from Switzerland. DMZ, which separates North Korea from South Korea Electric fences were used to guard the concentration camps of Nazi Germany during World War II, where potentially lethal voltages and currents were employed, continuously rather than in pulses. Some prisoners used the electric barbed wire fence to commit suicide. During the Algerian War the French erected the electrified Morice Line. Sections of the inner German border were lined with a 3 m (10 ft) high electric fence to deter potential defectors from East Germany.\\"E. Germany Builds Electric Fence\\", The Times, 28 March 1984 Similarly, the Czechoslovak border was lined with high electric fence during Cold War to prevent emigration from Czechoslovakia. Electric fences continue to be used in similar fashion at some high-security prisons and certain other installations to this day. Typically a nonelectric fence is constructed on either side of such an installation, or the deadly current is carried out of casual reach atop a wall. North Korea uses electric fences to seal off parts of its border with South Korea. =Other uses= Recent innovations include electrical fence monitoring for intruder detection as opposed to providing an electric shock to discourage entry. It can be used in addition to or as substitute for a host of other fence monitoring systems. Buried electric fences (also called \\"invisible fences\\" or \\"electronic fences\\") are sometimes used to contain dogs or livestock. The buried wire radiates a weak radio signal, which is detected by a collar worn by the animal. The collar emits a warning noise near the wire, but if this is ignored, produces a mild shock. Humans and other animals are unaware of the buried line. In a similar system, the collar uses GPS signals to determine proximity to a predetermined \\"virtual fence\\" without a physical installation. Interference and unwanted effects Poorly designed or badly maintained electric fences can create sufficient electromagnetic interference to cause problems for nearby telephone, radio, and television reception - and has been a particular problem for dial-up Internet users in some rural areas.\\"Electric fence interference with Internet\\", NZ Government website\\"Five- Step Electric Fence Check\\".

Australia's batsmen took advantage of several dropped catches and other mistakes in the field to amass 364 for 2, with Ricky Ponting contributing 123 before being bowled by Ashley Giles, and Matthew Hayden finishing the day on 186 not out. England's woeful day in the field was capped by a severe injury to young bowler Simon Jones, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament while sliding to field a ball and was forced to withdraw from the tour. England fought back on the second day of the Test. Hayden advanced to 197 before gloving a catch to Wicket-keeper Alec Stewart, and the Australians' last eight wickets fell for just 128 runs despite 57 from Shane Warne. Giles added three more wickets to his total and Andy Caddick took three in the day, including the captain Steve Waugh for just 7. The England batsmen then began, Marcus Trescothick and Mark Butcher sharing an unbroken century partnership to take England to 158 for 1 at stumps. However, the Australians fought back on the third day. Butcher and Trescothick were both out early in the same over to Glenn McGrath. Hussain and John Crawley managed to stabilise the England innings and advanced to 268 for 3. However, England lost their last six wickets for 57 runs as the tail collapsed around Crawley, leaving him on 69 not out at the end of the innings. Australia started their second innings positively but lost both Justin Langer and Ponting to Caddick by the end of the day. A partnership between Hayden and Damien Martyn saw each advance to 40 not out by the close. Australia advanced to a commanding lead on the fourth and final day, Hayden becoming only the fourth Australian to score a century in both innings of a Test match with his 103. Adam Gilchrist weighed in with 60 not out from 59 balls to take the Aussies to 296 for 5. Giles and Caddick were the only England bowlers to have any success: Giles taking the wickets of both Hayden and Ponting to finish with figures of 2 for 90 and Caddick taking 3 for 95. Waugh's declaration left England with a target of 464 runs for victory. However, England eventually finished with figures of 79 all out in 28 overs, with Mark Butcher the highest scorer at 40. Michael Vaughan departed LBW to McGrath on the third ball of the innings and Trescothick soon followed, caught at slip off Jason Gillespie. Brief partnerships between Hussain and Butcher, and then Butcher and Craig White were soon ended by McGrath (4 for 36) and Warne (3 for 29). =2nd Test= The second Test at Adelaide started much more positively for England, who had made several changes to their side, bringing in spinner Richard Dawson, Steve Harmison and Robert Key for the injured Ashley Giles, Simon Jones and John Crawley. Nasser Hussain won the toss and this time decided to bat, a decision that looked good as England advanced to 295 for 4 by the end of the day. However, this confident score was largely built around a massive 177 from Michael Vaughan, who was finally out to the last ball of the day, edging Andy Bichel to slip. No other England batsmen passed fifty, and Vaughan himself was lucky to escape dismissal on just 19 when he seemed to have been caught off Bichel by Justin Langer ‚Äì TV replays proved inconclusive. Australia took firm control of the match on the second day after a strong performance with both ball and bat. England crumbled from their strong overnight position to 342 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 47 runs. Mark Butcher was caught behind off Jason Gillespie having added nothing to the overnight total, and England's tail was quickly dismissed by Gillespie (who finished with 4 for 78) and Warne (4 for 93). The English bowlers were next to suffer as the Australians advanced to 247 for 2 at stumps with Ricky Ponting undefeated overnight on 83. Matthew Hoggard and Andy Caddick were both smashed around the field and it was left to Craig White and Dawson to make the only breakthroughs in the afternoon, White having Matthew Hayden caught on 46 and Dawson striking to have Justin Langer caught behind on 48. The situation worsened for England on the third day. Ponting and Damien Martyn batted through the morning session to take their overnight partnership for the third wicket to 242 before Martyn was caught off Harmison for 95 shortly after lunch, and Ponting went on to convert his overnight 83 into 154 before holing out to White. Darren Lehmann, Steve Waugh and Shane Warne fell quickly but expensively, Waugh making 34 runs from just 40 deliveries. A 77 run eighth-wicket partnership between Bichel and Adam Gilchrist off just 14 overs advanced the Aussies to a commanding 552 before Gilchrist was out miscuing a hook off Harmison and Waugh declared the innings. Needing 211 to avoid an innings defeat, England got off to a nightmare start as they collapsed to 36 for 3 by the close of play, losing Marcus Trescothick LBW to Gillespie for a duck, Butcher LBW to Glenn McGrath shortly afterwards and finally Hussain clean bowled by Bichel. England began the fourth day hoping for rain, but despite several short delays for weather the Aussies completed the innings victory with a day to spare. Key completed a disappointing Ashes debut as he was caught at mid-wicket off Bichel for 1 in the third over of the morning, and though Vaughan and Alec Stewart looked to stabilise the innings their partnership was broken when McGrath took an impressive catch to dismiss Vaughan off the bowling of Warne. Stewart, supported by a defensive Craig White, continued to make his 41st Test half century but the two fell in successive balls to leave England in hopeless circumstances. The tail fell to leave 159 all out, McGrath taking 4 for 41 and Warne 3 for 36, giving the Aussies a crushing victory by an innings and 51 runs. =3rd Test= =4th Test= =5th Test= VB Series (ODIs) =1st match: Australia v England= =2nd match: Australia v England= =3rd match: England v Sri Lanka= =4th match: England v Sri Lanka= = 5th match: Australia v Sri Lanka = = 7th match: Australia v England = =8th match: England v Sri Lanka= =10th Match: England v Sri Lanka= =11th Match: Australia v England= =1st final: Australia v England= =2nd final: Australia v England= References Sources * Playfair Cricket Annual * Wisden Cricketers Almanack 2002-03 Category:2002 in English cricket Category:2003 in English cricket Category:2002‚Äì03 Australian cricket season 2002-03 Category:2002 in Australian cricket Category:2003 in Australian cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2002‚Äì03 ","title":"English cricket team in Australia in 2002‚Äì03"},{"id":"1920230","text":"Patrick Joseph Christopher \\"Paddy\\" Roche (born 4 January 1951) is an Irish former football goalkeeper.

It is an archaeological site situated southwest of the city of Raqqa and the Euphrates. Procopius describes at length the ramparts and buildings erected there by Justinian.\\"De edificiis\\", II, ix The walls of Resafa, which are still well preserved, are over 1600 feet in length and about 1000 feet in width; round or square towers were erected about every hundred feet; there are also ruins of a church with three apses.  Names  Resafa corresponds to the Akkadian Ra·π£appa and the Biblical Rezeph (Septuagint; ), where it is mentioned in ; cuneiform sources give Rasaappa, Rasappa, and Rasapi . Ptolemy calls it Rhesapha ().V, xiv, 19, cited in In the late Roman Tabula Peutingeriana, it is called Risapa.Catholic Encyclopedia (1907), loc.cit. In the Notitia dignitatum, it is Rosafa.  History  The site dates to the 9th century BC, when a military camp was built by the Assyrians. During Roman times, it was a desert outpost fortified to defend against the Sasanian Empire and a station on the Strata Diocletiana. It flourished as its location on the caravan routes linking Aleppo, Dura- Europos, and Palmyra was ideal. Resafa had no spring or running water, so it depended on large cisterns to capture the winter and spring rains. North gate of the city of Resafa, site of Hisham's palace and court. Resafa was located in the area of the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars, and was therefore a well-defended city that had massive walls that surrounded it without a break. It also had a fortress. In the 4th century, it became a pilgrimage town for Christians coming to venerate Saint Sergius, a Christian Roman soldier said to have been martyred in Resafa during the Diocletianic Persecution. A church was built to mark his grave, and the city was renamed Sergiopolis. Indeed, it became, after Jerusalem, \\"most important pilgrimage center in Byzantine Oriens in [the] proto-Byzantine period\\", with a special appeal to the local Arabs, especially the Ghassanids. By the late 6th century, the Ghassanids‚Äô tribal Arab ally the Bahra‚Äô were tasked with guarding Resafa and it‚Äôs shrine from nomadic marauders and the Lakhmids of Mesopotamia. The city was lost by the Romans in the 7th century when the Arabs won the final victory at the Battle of Yarmouk in the year 636. In the eighth century, the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724‚Äì743) made the city his favoured residence, and built several palaces around it. The city was finally abandoned in the 13th century when the Mongols and Turks invaded the area. = Recent history = In the Syrian Civil War, the town was occupied by ISIS, before being liberated by Government forces on 19 June 2017 during the Southern Raqqa Offensive.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-government-forces- liberate-rusafa-town-southwest-raqqa/  Ecclesiastical history  Ruins of Sergiopolis.

Later, Marianus attended a Council of Antioch. The metropolis of Sergiopolis with five suffragan sees figures in the Notitia episcopatuum of Antioch in the sixth century. It had obtained this title from Emperor Anastasius I; at the fifth general council (Second Council of Constantinople) in 553, Abraham signed as Metropolitan. The favors of Anastasius obtained for the city the name of Anastasiopolis, which it still retained at the beginning of the seventh century.

The line connects Freiburg im Breisgau with Donaueschingen, a distance of . Over its entire course the line rises from an altitude of in Freiburg to in Hinterzarten. Part of the route has a 5.5% gradient, making the line one of the steepest in Germany. The section Freiburg-Neustadt is electrified since 18 June 1936. Because of this and the steady decrease of traffic between Neustadt and Donaueschingen the route did not represent an operational unit anymore. The last direct connection between Freiburg and Donaueschingen ended in 2003 with the Kleber-Express being discontinued. Missing sections are supposed to be electrified until the end of 2019 in the course of the project ‚ÄúBreisgau-S- Bahn 2020‚Äù (Breisgau-tramway 2020), in order to enable direct trains from Breisach via Freiburg, Neustand and Donaueschingen to Villingen. History The line, which opened as far as Neustadt in 1887, was constructed for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways and was the last project of railway architect Robert Gerwig. The section of the line between Hirschsprung and Hinterzarten has a maximum gradient of 5.5%, and was initially operated as a rack railway on the Riggenbach system. The line was extended from Neustadt to Donaueschingen in 1901. In 1932/33, ten powerful Class 85 steam locomotives were built, which enabled traffic to operate over the Hirschsprung and Hinterzarten section without rack assistance, and rack operation ceased in 1933. In 1934, a new and partially tunnelled route within the city of Freiburg was opened. This enabled the original route, which passed closer to the city centre and over congested level crossings, to be closed. In 1936, the Deutsche Reichsbahn electrified the line between Freiburg and Neustadt, installing a 20 kV, 50 Hz AC. This led to the subsequent adoption of the 25 kV AC 50 Hz system in France and elsewhere. Since the electrification of Mannheim‚ÄìKarlsruhe‚ÄìBasle railway had been completed in 1958, the H√∂llentalbahn was linked to the nationwide electric railway system. Therefore, in 1960, the electrified section of the H√∂llentalbahn was converted to the standard 15 kV, 16‚Öî Hz system used throughout the German railway network. The H√∂llentalbahn was used successfully to test designs for the DB Class 144\\\\. Later, electric motive power was supplied by the Series 145, which was itself replaced by the DB Class 139\\\\. Today, the electric line uses modern double-decker rolling stock pulled by DB Class 143 locomotives. The stretch of line between Neustadt and Donaueschingen remains unelectrified. Development during the era of the German National Railway (1919‚Äì1945) On 14 December 1927 the old Ravenna bridge that crossed the Ravennaschlucht (Ravenna ravine), close to Hinterzarten, was replaced with a new viaduct, because it could not cope with the demand anymore. With the construction of the new viaduct, the railway section of the H√∂llentalbahn was straightened in that area. The costs were about 1,7 million Reichsmark, and only the abutments are still leftovers of the old bridge. The Ravenna tunnel which follows immediately after the bridge was originally 85 metres long. It was partially split open so that nowadays it only has a length of 47 metres. At the beginning of the 1930s, the H√∂llentalbahn between Freiburg main station and Freiburg- Littenweiler was relocated, so that the station of Freiburg-Wiehre had to be moved as well. The relocation was made in order to avoid the intersection with the Rheintalbahn, to create a bridge instead and especially to get rid of the railroad crossings in the city area.[15] Furthermore, the intersection with the already existing line to G√ºnterstal of the Freiburg im Breisgau tramway, which existed since 1901, could be discontinued. There was a severe accident on 12 October 1916 because a tram, which was heading into town, disregarded the closed barrier in the darkness and collided with a railroad train going uphill. The tram and the line-keepers lodge got shattered while the tram driver, the conductor and the only passenger got slightly injured.Freiburger Zeitung, Morgenausgabe, Freitag, 13. Oktober 1916Freiburger Zeitung, Abendausgabe, Freitag, 13. Oktober 1916 Two new tunnels had to be built for the new line: the one going through the Lorettoberg and the one beneath the Sternwald. The eastern border fault of the Upper Rhine Plain goes through the Lorettoberg. It can be seen through a ‚Äòwindow‚Äô, which has been left open whilst bricking the tunnel so the further subsidence can be measured. In the course of the construction works, the line from the central station to Wiehre was increased to two tracks. The former trainstation Alter Wiehre Bahnhof (Old Wiehre Station) is now used for cultural activities, for example as a building for film and literature with the ‚ÄòKommunales Kino Freiburg‚Äô (municipal cinema Freiburg), the 'Literaturb√ºro Freiburg' (lit.: literature office Freiburg) and it also houses a caf√©. Route After leaving Freiburg Hauptbahnhof, the main station for the city of Freiburg, the H√∂llentalbahn diverges from the mainline Mannheim‚ÄìKarlsruhe‚ÄìBasel railway to the east. It the crosses over the mainline on a flyover and serves two further stops within the city, before starting its ascent of the H√∂llental. High points on the stretch of the line through the H√∂llental include the Hirschsprungfelsen (a rock formation) and a crossing of the Ravenna Gorge on the high Ravenna Bridge. The section of the line between Hirschsprung and Hinterzarten has a steep maximum gradient of 5.5%, betraying its origin as a rack railway. After leaving the H√∂llental, the Dreiseenbahn railway to Seebrugg diverges at the spa town of Titisee, close to the Titisee lake. The town of Neustadt follows, where electrification ends and through passengers normally need to change trains. Further on, between Neustadt and Donaueschingen, the viaduct at the former crosses the Wutach at the beginning of its long gorge. While in a tunnel near D√∂ggingen station, the line crosses a main European watershed, between the Rhine drainage basin (flowing into the North Sea) and the Danube drainage basin (flowing into the Black Sea).  Construction engineering  The H√∂llentalbahn has 15 tunnels on its railway section. Nine of them are on the section between Freiburg and Neustadt (front section) and six of them are on the section between Neustadt and Donaueschingen (back section). The longest tunnel is the D√∂gginger Tunnel with a length of 535 metres. It passes beneath the European watershed between the Black Sea and the North Sea. All the tunnels on the back section between Neustadt and Donaueschingen were built with the building of the railway section; in contrast to the front section between Freiburg and Neustadt, where the Sternwald-Tunnel with a length of 514 metres and the Loretto-Tunnel with a length of 302 metres were built with the relocation of the railway section between Freiburg main station and Freiburg-Littenweiler in 1934. The lower Hirschsprung tunnel was originally 121 metres long but was then shortened to 114 metres after World War II.

Maxtla sent Chimalpopoca a present of women's clothing. Tayatzin was killed, and Chimalpopoca decided to offer himself as a sacrifice at the altar of his father Huitzil√≠huitl. When Maxtla laid siege to Tenochtitlan in 1428, Chimalpopoca's successor and uncle, Itzcoatl, repelled his forces with the aid of an alliance of city states, including Texcoco under Nezahualcoyotl and many former Tepanec allies, notably Tlacopan. These allied forces sacked Azcapotzalco and Maxtla was personally sacrificed by Nezahualcoyotl. The victorious powers formalized their relationship in the Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan, which would become the basis of the Aztec Empire.

Its name (Upper Sorbian: Sosny) may derive from Sosna meaning pine, a tree quite common in the region. In 1875, Zossen railway station opened on the railway line from Berlin to Dresden and the Prussian military railway to the artillery range at Kummersdorf-Gut in present-day Am Mellensee. Between 1901 and 1904, Zossen adopted the use of different high-speed vehicles, such as electric locomotives and trams, for transportation to and from Berlin-Marienfelde. These vehicles were powered by an alternating current of 15 kV and used a variable frequency. The power was transmitted by three vertical overhead lines. In 1910, a proving ground and a garrison of the Imperial German Army was established at the Waldstadt section of the W√ºnsdorf community ‚Äì surviving to the present day. In World War I it was the site of several prisoner-of-war camps, including the \\"crescent camp\\" (Halbmondlager for Muslims who had fought for the Triple Entente), where the first wooden mosque in Germany was erected. From 1939 to 1945, W√ºnsdorf hosted the underground headquarters of the German Wehrmacht (OKW) and Army's High Command (OKH).

The former village, incorporated according to the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, today is a mixed industrial and residential area. Geography The Marienfelde quarter borders the Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg localities of Mariendorf in the northeast and Lichtenrade in the southeast. In the west, it borders on Lankwitz, part of the Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough. In the south, it is bounded by the Berlin city limits and the border with the state of Brandenburg. History Marienfelde manor The medieval Angerdorf arose together with neighbouring Mariendorf during the German Ostkolonisation migration about 1220 AD, then affiliated with the Teltow estates held by the Knights Templar commandry at Tempelhof. A fieldstone church was erected around 1240 which, still preserved, is one of the oldest in the Berlin area. The settlement of Merghenvelde itself was first mentioned in a 1344 deed, after the Brandenburg lands of the Knights Templar had passed to the Order of Saint John. From 1435 onwards, the estates were held by the City of Berlin. Located in the southwestern suburbs of the Prussian capital, population increased from the mid-19th century on. The historic village centre was largely destroyed during the bombing of Berlin in World War II. Transportation and industry Transportation and industry have played an important role in the development of Marienfelde: Since 1875 the Dresden Railway, a main North-South line entering Berlin, passes through Marienfelde. It is currently served by the Berlin S-Bahn commuter rail network at the Marienfelde, Buckower Chaussee and Schichauweg railway stations. The re-development as a long-distance track is planned. Tanker train at Marienfelde station The parallel Royal Prussian Military Railway (K√∂niglich Preu√üische Milit√§reisenbahn) passed through the Marienfelde area on its way from Berlin to the town of Zossen. Between 1901 and 1904, the track was electrified and used as test track for high-speed locomotive testing. Ten kilovolt, three-phase alternating current with a frequency of 50 hertz was transmitted over three overhead wires, strung one above the other. Experimental electrical locomotives reached speeds of up to on the track. Near the end of World War II, as part of the Elbe-Project, the world's first high-voltage direct current transmission lines were built from a power plant in Dessau, on the Elbe river, to Marienfelde. A substation was located in Marienfelde converted the direct current into alternating current. However, developments in the war prevented the project from ever becoming operational. Today, Marienfelde comprises several industrial parks such as the former Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft assembly plant opened in 1902, today operated by Daimler AG. Other main employers include IBM and Stollwerck; as well as branches of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. Refugee processing center Refugee center memorial site Marienfelde is also known for a large refugee-processing center which operated during the Cold War. The center, which opened in 1953, was the first stop for more than 1.5 million refugees fleeing communism in East Germany via West Berlin. Refugees arriving in West Berlin were sent to the center where they received medical treatment, food, identification papers, and housing until they could be permanently re-settled in the West. Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the center continued processing East German refugees until unification a year later. Today the center remains in use, processing ethnic Germans who are immigrating to Germany from the former Soviet Union.

After a two-goal performance for Turton Rovers against Bury Reserves, the Gigg Lane club signed Sagar in 1898. In a seven- year spell with Bury, Sagar scored 71 goals in 186 appearances, and finished as the club's top scorer from 1903 to 1905. He was also part of the Bury team that won the FA Cup in 1900 and 1903, scoring the second of six goals in the latter game ‚Äì Bury's 6‚Äì0 win is still a record margin of victory in the FA Cup Final. During his time at Bury, Sagar played for The Football League XI four times. Bury finished in 17th in the First Division in 1904‚Äì05, which would have seen them relegated had the league not chosen to expand the division from 18 teams to 20. Nevertheless, Sagar joined Manchester United in May 1905, and made his debut on the opening day of the 1905‚Äì06 season at home to Bristol City; Manchester United won 5‚Äì1, with Sagar scoring a hat-trick ‚Äì only Wayne Rooney has since scored a hat-trick on his Manchester United debut. He scored another hat-trick in another 5‚Äì1 win against Barnsley later in the season on the way to a total of 20 goals in 23 appearances; only a knee injury prevented him from contributing further to the club's second-place finish in the Second Division and subsequent promotion. The injury worsened over the course of the following season, limiting Sagar to sporadic appearances and his eventual release at the end of the season; he managed only four goals in 10 appearances in 1906‚Äì07. After leaving Manchester United, Sagar joined Atherton of the Lancashire Combination First Division, but left for Second Division Haslingden after Atherton finished bottom of the league in 1909. The year after Sagar joined Haslingden, they scored 113 league goals, but it is unknown how many of these he contributed. They scored 98 goals the following year on the way to securing the Division Two title and promotion to Division One. Sagar earned two caps for England.

He is one of twenty-seven saints, most of them martyrs, who bear this name,Antonio Borrelli, \\"San Ciriaco di Roma\\" of whom only seven are honoured by a specific mention of their names in the Roman Martyrology.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969 )  Life  Of the Saint Cyriacus who, together with Saints Largus and Smaragdus and others (of whom Crescentianus, Memmia and Juliana are mentioned in the Roman Martyrology), is venerated on 8 August, all that is known with certainty, apart from their names and the fact of their martyrdom, is that they were buried at the seventh milestone of the Via Ostiensis on that date.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 133 However, legend has it that Cyriacus was a Roman nobleman who converted to Christianity as an adult and, renouncing his material wealth, gave it away to the poor. He spent the rest of his life ministering to the slaves who worked in the Baths of Diocletian. Under the reign of Western Roman Emperor Maximian, co-emperor with Diocletian, Cyriacus was tortured and put to death, beheaded in 303 on the Via Salaria, where he was subsequently buried. With him were martyred his companions Largus and Smaragdus, and twenty others, including Crescentianus, Sergius, Secundus, Alban, Victorianus, Faustinus, Felix, Sylvanus, and four women: Memmia, Juliana, Cyriacides, and Donata.Alban Butler, \\"The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints\\" (J. Duffy, 1866), p. 123 Saint Cyriacus is credited with exorcizing demons from two girls. The first was Artemisia (or Artemia), the daughter of Emperor Diocletian, which resulted in both Artemisia and her mother Saint Serena converting to Christianity. The second was Jobias, the daughter of Shapur I of Persia (reigned 241-272), which led to the conversion of the King's entire household. But this is not possible because Shapur died thirty years before exorcism and because he had only one daughter named Adur-Anahid.http:/Florindo Cirignano:San-Ciriaco-un-santo-tra-storia- leggenda-e-arte/ It is credible that it is, perhaps, either of the daughter of Narseh (293-302), or of the daughter of Hormizd II (302-309)d. It is more likely that many Bishops throughout the world (to this day) have been named in honor of Saint Cyriacus at the Baths (of Diocletian), including maybe the first so honored, Judas the Jew from Jerusalem, who converted and upon being named Bishop of Ancona took the name Cyriacus as his own in the latter part of the 4th century.  Veneration  The Tridentine Calendar included the feast day of Cyriacus, Largus and Smaragdus on 8 August as a Semidouble. In 1955 this rank was lowered to that of Simple.General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII The 1962 Calendar, issued together with Pope John XXIII's Roman Missal, the licit private and, under certain conditions, public use of which was authorized by the 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, reduced their celebration to a Commemoration. They are not included in the 1970 reformed Calendar of the Roman Rite liturgy, which was issued under the authority of Pope Paul VI, but, being included, all three, together with Memmia, Juliana and Smaragdus, in the Roman Martyrology,Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ) they are recognized saints of the Roman Catholic Church. St Pantaleon is on the left. Weitnau Saint Cyriacus is venerated as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. It is claimed his relics were moved to Santa Maria in Via Lata in Rome, and the abbey of St Cyriaque in Altorf in Alsace. The Church of \\"Saint Cyriacus in the Baths of Diocletian\\" (), was dedicated to this martyr, a former titulus church. The \\"tituli\\" were commonly named after their patron, often a lay patron in the early centuries: \\"Cyriac\\" in Greek signifies simply \\"patron.\\" This \\"titulus,\\" to which a cardinal was assigned, whatever its claimed second- or third-century origins, existed certainly in the fifth century, when Marcianus was cardinal priest of the title of S. Ciriaco alle Terme di Diocleziano in 494, at the time of Pope Gelasius I. The titulus was suppressed in 1477 by Pope Sixtus IV in favor of Saints Ciro and Giulitta. In 1493, Pope Alexander VI restored the name of S. Ciriaco. The title was definitively suppressed in 1587 by Pope Sixtus V, who assigned a titulus of Sts Quirico e Giulitta to Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici.This history of the \\"titulus\\" follows Salvador Miranda, \\"The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church,\\" s.v. \\"St. Gelasius I (492-496)\\"; \\"Annuaire Pontifical Catholique,\\" 1926 St Cyriacus is the patron saint of the Italian city of Ciri√©.

The residents of both these villages venerated him during the Byzantine era. On St Cyriacus' feast day, 8 August 1899, a category four hurricane made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico and was named after him. It was known as the Hurricane San Ciriaco.

It is a medium-sized tree that produces quality timber and is the main source of timber amongst the indigenous tree species of desert regions of Shekhawati and Marwar in Rajasthan. The trade name of the tree species is desert teak or Marwar teak. Leaves of Tecomella undulata tree at the village of Gharsana, India Tecomella undulata tree at the village of Harsawa Tecomella undulata is a deciduous or nearly evergreen tree of arid and semi arid regions.It is the state flower of rajasthan. It occurs on flat and undulating areas including gentle hill slopes and sometimes also in ravines. It is well adapted to drained loamy to sandy loam soil having pH 6.5-8.0. The species thrives very well on stabilized sand dunes, which experience extreme low and high temperatures. It grows in areas of scanty rainfall (annual 150-500mm) and high temperature (35 ¬∞C to 48 ¬∞C). It can withstand extreme low temperature (0 ¬∞C to ‚àí2 ¬∞C) during winter and high temperature (48 ¬∞C to 50 ¬∞C) in summers. The tree is a strong light demander. It is drought, frost, fire and wind hardy. At the time of flowering (December‚ÄìFebruary) it produces beautiful showy flowers in yellow, orange and red colours. Three types of flower bearing trees can be observed near to each other in the same vicinity. Distribution Distribution of Tecomella undulata is restricted to the drier parts of the Arabia, southern Pakistan and northwest India up to an elevation of 1200 metres. In Pakistan, in the Kala Chitta Range of the Attock District of Punjab, its local name is Haroora. It is found in Baluchistan and Sindh. In India, it occurs naturally in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. The species is mainly found to occur in the western parts of Rajasthan. In other states its population is scanty and very rare. In Rajasthan, Tecomella undulata is found in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Pali, Ajmer, Nagaur, Bikaner, Churu and Sikar, Jalore districts. Tecomella undulata is an accepted tree species in agroforestry and large population is found in agricultural lands. It can be observed growing in inhabited areas, forested areas and scrubland habitats in association with Prosopis cineraria, Capparis decidua, Maytenus emarginata, Zizyphus spp and Salvadora spp. In agricultural areas, it generally grows in association with Prosopis cineraria. Its flower is the state flower of Rajasthan. Tecomella Undulata Uses Stem of Tecomella undulata tree at the village of Gharsana, IndiaTecomella undulata is mainly used as a source of timber. Its wood is strong, tough and durable. It takes a fine finish. Heartwood contains quinoid. The wood is excellent for firewood and charcoal. Cattle and goats eat leaves of the tree. Camels, goats and sheep consume flowers and pods. Tecomella undulata plays an important role in ecology. It acts as a soil-binding tree by spreading a network of lateral roots on the top surface of the soil. It acts as a windbreak and helps in stabilizing shifting sand dunes. It is considered as the home of birds and provides shelter for other desert wildlife. Shade of tree crown is shelter for the cattle, goats and sheep during summer days. Tecomella undulata has got medicinal properties as well. The bark obtained from the stem is used as a remedy for syphilis. It is also used in curing urinary disorders, enlargement of spleen, gonorrhoea, leucoderma and liver diseases. Seeds are used against abscess.

It is the selection against the heterozygote, causing disruptive selection and divergent genotypes. Underdominance exists in situations where the heterozygotic genotype is inferior in fitness to either the dominant or recessive homozygotic genotype. Compared to examples of overdominance in actual populations, underdominance is considered more unstable and may lead to the fixation of either allele. An example of stable underdominance may occur in individuals who are heterozygotic for polymorphisms that would make them better suited for one of two niches. Consider a situation in which a population is completely homozygotic for an \\"A\\" allele, allowing exploitation of a particular resource. Eventually, a polymorphic \\"a\\" allele may be introduced into the population, resulting in an individual who is capable of exploiting a different resource. This would result in an \\"aa\\" homozygotic invasion of the population due to nonexistent competition of the unexploited resource. The frequency of \\"aa\\" individuals would increase until the abundance of the \\"a\\" resource begins to decline. Eventually, the \\"AA\\" and \\"aa\\" genotypes would reach equilibrium with each other, with \\"Aa\\" heterozygotic individuals potentially experiencing a reduced fitness compared to those individuals who are homozygotic for utilization of either resource. This example of underdominance is stable because any shift in equilibrium would result in selection for the rare allele due to increased resource abundance. This compensatory selection would ultimately return the dimorphic system to underdominant equilibrium.  Incidence in butterfly populations  An example of stable underdominance can be found in the African butterfly species Pseudacraea eurytus, which utilizes Batesian mimicry to escape predation. This species possesses two alleles which each confer an appearance similar to that of another local butterfly species that is toxic to its predator. Individuals who are heterozygous for this trait appear to be intermediate in appearance and thus experience increased predation and lowered overall fitness.  Uses in pest control  Models of stable underdominance have shown potential in driving the introduction of refractory genes into pest populations that are responsible for the spread of infective diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. A refractory gene alone would not have higher fitness than the native genes, but engineered underdominance may prove effective as a mechanism to spread such a gene. In this model, two genetics constructs are introduced into two non-homologous chromosomes. Each construct is lethal when expressed individually but can be suppressed by the other construct. In this way, individuals with only one of the two constructed genes (heterozygotes) are selected against, but homozygotes with both or neither construct are genetically healthy. Analysis of this model using simple population genetics shows that successful spread of refractory genes using this engineered underdominance is possible with relatively small release of the constructed genotype into the population. A similar system of manipulation of pest populations was achieved in a population of Drosophila melanogaster by using a knock-down/rescue system. The genetic construct in this system employs a dsRNAi knockdown of a C-reactive protein, RpL14, as well as a rescue element (a complete copy of the wild type RpL14 gene). Individuals that are heterozygous for this construct experience lowered fitness due to limited restoration of the RpL14 gene, which results in reduced female fertility and delayed development, along with various other mutations that ultimately lower fitness by 70-80%. This system of underdominance allowed manipulation of the population and ultimate fixation of the constructed genotype and has potential applications in a number of settings, including agriculture and the reduction of various pest-carried diseases.

Rod puppets require one of the puppeteer's hands inside the puppet glove holding a rod which controls the head, and the puppet's body then hangs over most or all of the forearm of the puppeteer, and possibly extends further. Other parts of the puppet may be controlled by different means, e.g., by rods operated by the puppeteer's free hand, or strings or levers pulled the head or body. A smaller variety, simple hand puppets often have no significant manipulable parts at all. Finger puppets are not hand puppets as they are used only on a finger. Types of hand puppets =Simple hand puppets= A simple toy dog hand puppet. The simplest hand puppets are those with few or no moving parts. They can be stiff, made from e.g. a hard plastic, but are more often flexible, made from fabric, possibly with some stuffing and attached decorations for eyes, nose, and so on. The mouth may be a mere decoration that does not open and close, or the thumb may enter a separate pocket from the rest of the fabric and so simulate a mandible, allowing the puppet to talk. Simple hand puppets are usually not much larger than the hand itself. A sock puppet is a particularly simple type of hand puppet made from a sock. A glove puppet is slightly more complex, with an internal division for fingers allowing independent manipulation of a character's arms. The unconsumed hand of the puppeteer is usually concealed from the audience to maintain the illusion of the puppet. Simple hand puppets, especially popular licensed characters, are sometimes distributed as children toys or party favors. Children usually like to experiment in play with a puppet creating voices and movements and in many cases staging a strictly private performance. =Rod puppets= A rod puppet with typical rods to control the arms. A rod puppet is made out of wood wire and string and is manipulated with wooden or wire rods.Sinclair, A, The Puppetry Handbook, p.15 Rod puppets can sometimes have a complete working hinged mouth but many do not. A rod puppet can have a fixed facial expression. Arms are usually a requirement as rods are attached to them. A fish rod puppet could have a rod attached to the tail to manipulate this section of the puppet. Sometimes special variants exist with additional manipulable parts: (e.g., eyelids that open and close). Many rod puppets depict only the upper half of the character, from the waist up, with the stage covering the missing remainder, but variations sometimes have legs. The legs usually just dangle, but in special cases the legs may be controlled either from behind the stage using rods from below. These are mostly used at carnivals or fairs. A very common example of rod puppets are those of The Muppets and Sesame Street. =Human-arm puppet= Also called a \\"two-man puppet\\" or a \\"live-hand puppet\\", the human-arm puppet is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers. One puppeteer places their dominant hand inside the puppet's head and operates the puppet's head and mouth, while putting their non- dominant arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet. The second puppeteer puts their arm into a glove and special sleeve attached to the puppet in order to operate the other arm. This way, the puppet can perform hand gestures. This is a form of glove or hand puppetry and rod puppetry. Some puppets from The Muppets and Sesame Street fit this category. Technique =Basic positioning= Chroma for television. (J√∫lia i Gilbert) As with any stage performer, the puppet should generally face the audience; but may turn to one side or the other. There are times when a puppet does turn its back to an audience just like an actor. Puppets generally should look out towards an audience and not up at the ceiling unless they wish an audience to follow their line of vision. Generally a hand or glove puppet should talk a lot. =Body movement= Bleeckie, a rod puppet from a series of web videos, ready to slide One of the most important techniques in puppetry is continuous motion. A puppet that remains still has a dull, lifeless appearance and is said to be dead. Motion should shift from one portion of the puppet to another, so that one moment the puppet is moving its head and the next moment shifting its torso or repositioning an arm. The puppet may shift from side to side, look around, lean or straighten, fidget (with part of the stage, its own clothing or hair, or any available object), cross or uncross its arms, sigh, tilt its head, or make any number of other small motions, in order to continue to appear lifelike. Depending on the type of puppet, more or less complex motion may be possible. Unrealistic motion patterns can sometimes be useful for special effect purposes. As put into words by Oscar Wilde, puppets \\"are admirably docile\\" and \\"recognize the presiding intellect of the dramatist\\".Scott Cutler Shershow \\"Puppets and popular culture\\" A puppet should not move when another puppet is speaking. To do so confuses an audience as to which particular puppet is speaking at any given time. Maintaining clear focus for an audience in a puppet performance is extremely important.

Born in Chipman, New Brunswick, James King was the son of George Gerald King, a businessman and Canadian politician in his own right. The elder King was a Liberal Member of Parliament in the nineteenth century, and a Senator from 1896 until his death in 1928. The younger King earned his MD from McGill University in 1895. After practicing medicine for a short period in New Brunswick, he moved to the Kootenay region of British Columbia in 1898 serving a large rural territory. In 1910, he attended an international medical conference in Budapest, and played a leading role in establishing the American College of Surgeons in Chicago, serving as a governor of the college. In 1932, he was created a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem for his services to medicine. In 1903, King was elected as a British Columbia Liberal Party member of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly for the riding of Cranbrook and was re-elected in 1907 before leaving provincial politics in 1909 to return to medicine. A supporter of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, King was a Liberal candidate in the riding of Kootenay in the 1911 federal election but was defeated. He returned to the provincial legislature in 1916, joining the provincial cabinet as Minister of Public Works. He served in that portfolio until 1922 when he was offered a federal Cabinet position by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. J.H. King became Minister of Public Works shortly before winning a by-election to enter the House of Commons of Canada as MP for Kootenay East. In 1926, King became Minister of Soldiers‚Äô Civil Reestablishment and minister responsible for the Department of Health. In 1928, he became the country's first Minister of Pensions and National Health. He was appointed to the Senate on Prime Minister Mackenzie King's recommendation on June 7, 1930, shortly before the defeat of Mackenzie King's government. In 1942, King returned to Cabinet as Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate. In this capacity, he attended the June 1945 San Francisco Conference that established the United Nations. In August 1945, he was appointed Speaker of the Senate of Canada chairing sessions of the upper house until 1949. He then served as co-chairman of the joint Senate‚ÄìHouse of Commons Committee on Old Age Security which reported in 1950. King remained a Senator until his death in 1955.

Published in 1881, the novel has a unique style of short, erratic chapters shifting in tone and style. Instead of the clear and logical construction of a normal nineteenth-century realist novel, the novel makes use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction. It is considered the first romance of the realist movement in Brazil.  Plot introduction  The novel is narrated by the dead protagonist Br√°s Cubas, who tells his own life story from beyond the grave, noting his mistakes and failed romances. The fact of being already deceased allows Br√°s Cubas to sharply criticize the Brazilian society and reflect on his own disillusionment, with no sign of remorse or fear of retaliation. Br√°s Cubas dedicates his book: \\"To the worm who first gnawed on the cold flesh of my corpse, I dedicate with fond remembrance these Posthumous Memoirs\\" (), which indicates that not a single person he met through his life deserved the book. Cubas decides to tell his story starting from the end (the passage of his death, caused by pneumonia), then taking \\"the greatest leap in this story\\", proceeding to tell the story of his life since his childhood. The novel is also connected to another Machado de Assis work, Quincas Borba, which features a character from the Memoirs (as a secondary character, despite the novel's name), but other works of the author are hinted in chapter titles. It is a novel recalled as a major influence by many post-modern writers, such as John Barth or Donald Barthelme, as well as Brazilian writers in the 20th century.  Philosophy of Br√°s Cubas  Br√°s Cubas' pessimism is shown most obviously in the sub-title of the novel, Epitaph of a Small Winner. Cubas considers his life in the manner of an accounting, finding neither any positives or negatives; but he then realises that since he has not fathered any children he has not passed on the \\"misery\\" of life any further. For this reason he considers his life a success. Assis published his work in 1881 and it is influenced by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher whose philosophical magnum opus, The World as Will and Representation was first published in 1818. Schopenhauer's influence on the novel's philosophy is without doubt when one compares Cubas' description of insects and his attitude towards animals, which is a feature of Schopenhauer's philosophical outlook; and in Schopenhauer's writing he similarly uses examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate a philosophical truth (most famously that of the Australian bull-ant). Assis' allusion to Schopenhauer's philosophy is also 'formal': the chapter structure of The Posthumous Memoirs mimics that of Schopenhauer's World as Will and Representation; Bras Cubas' \\"method\\" in the novel, specifically the practice of referring to incidents in previous chapters by the chapter number, is imitative. Schopenhauer is often referred to as the 'King' of pessimists, or the 'Philosopher of despair'; his outlook is heavily linked to that of Buddhism. It is important to note that Assis created a philosophical theory to criticize Positivism, which was common in Brazil's literature back then. The theory in question was Humanitism, created in the books by Quincas Borba, a friend of Br√°s Cubas who had gone mad before dying. By doing this, Assis sharply criticizes the current philosophical theories, implying that only someone crazy would believe in them. Humanitism is to believe in Humanitas, which, according to Borba, is \\"the principle of the things, the same man equally distributed in all men\\". Therefore, if all men are equally Humanitas, an executioner killing a convict of murder is just \\"Humanitas correcting Humanitas because of an infraction of the laws of Humanitas\\". Envy is just \\"an admiration that fights for Humanitas against Humanitas\\", and thus, \\"being the war the grand function of the human genus, all the pugnacious feeling are the most adequate to happiness. From this, I came to the conclusion: envy is a virtue\\". If envy is a virtue, then cynicism, vanity and egoism are legitimated. Assis, through an ingenious fallacy, implied that envy is positive, in the same way many theories could \\"prove\\" true something clearly absurd looking through today's eyes.  Reception  In an article in The Guardian, Woody Allen listed the work as one of his favorites. He said in an interview with the newspaper:  Translations  There have been multiple translations. It was first translated in 1952 as Epitaph of a Small Winner by William L. Grossman. In 1997, it was translated as The Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas by Gregory Rabassa. In 2020, there were two new translations, by Flora Thomson-DeVeaux (Penguin Classics) and Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson (Liveright). The New York Times named Jull Costa and Patterson's translation \\"the superior translation\\" (Parul Sehgal, The New York Times).

It was founded in 1942, and was purchased by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever in 1996. Besides its own traditional brands, it now produces many of the same products as other Unilever Heartbrand subsidiaries, such as Langnese in Germany. Nogger Black controversy In 2005, the Swedish company was criticized by the Centre against Racism and Related Intolerance after launching an advertising campaign introducing their new line of ice cream bars, the Nogger Black, which is an addition to their existing \\"Nogger\\" ice cream product. The original Nogger is a vanilla ice cream bar with a nougat filling and chocolate shell, whereas the Nogger Black substitutes toffee in lieu of the nougat center and encases the bar in a salty, black liquorice outer shell rather than chocolate; hence the name Nogger Black. Nogger Black has a logotype that looks like graffiti. Petronella Warg, GB Glace's information officer, reported that the first Nogger ice cream bar had been marketed since 1979, its name derived from the nougat filling. The criticism was mainly aimed at an advert where the slogan \\"Nogger + liquorice = true\\" (a Swedish equivalent to \\"Nogger ‚ô• liquorice\\") was written in white chalk on asphalt. Stig Wallin - chairman of the centre - misread the slogan as \\"Nigger + liquorice\\" and said \\"It's impossible not to see this as an allusion to racism\\". The centre urged for a boycott of the company if they did not withdraw the campaign. Slate writer Timothy Noah also criticized the product.

Despite the similarity in name, this game is different than the solitaire game of Labyrinth, and is more similar to the solitaire game of Gaps. Rules First, all 52 cards are laid out into a 6 x 9 grid, where the first two rows have 8 cards instead of 9. Then, the Kings are moved and discarded from play. This leaves six gaps, four left behind by the Kings and the two spaces formed on the first two rows. The rule of the game are as follows: *A gap is filled by a card that is the same suit and a rank higher than the card on the gap's left or one that is the same suit and a rank lower than the card on the gap's right, whichever is more advantageous. *A gap to the right of a Queen can be filled with any ace or a card that is the same suit and a rank lower than the card on the gap's right, again, whichever is more advantageous. However, a gap to the left of an Ace is not filled. *The rows run from left to right, top to bottom. *The rows are continuous. The last card of one row is connected to the first card of the next. So goes with the last card of the sixth row to the first card of the first row. Thus, a gap on the extreme left of a row can be filled with a card with the same suit and a rank lower than the card on the gap's right or a card with the same suit and a rank higher than the last card of the row above, and vice versa. The game is won when all 48 cards are arranged in four suit sequences from Ace to Queen with an Ace as the first card on the first row and a Queen as the last card of the sixth row; it does not matter where the gaps end up when this is achieved.

Jeffrey Whitefoot (born 31 December 1933) is an English former footballer who played as a wing half in the Football League for Manchester United, Grimsby Town and Nottingham Forest. He was capped by England at under-23 level in 1954. Whitefoot started his career as a trainee with Manchester United in 1949. When he made his debut against Portsmouth in April 1950 he was at the time the youngest player to start in a League match for United at 16 years and 105 days. In eight seasons at United, he made 95 appearances in all competitions and was a member of the 1952 and 1956 title- winning sides, although he never scored a goal for them. He left the club for Grimsby Town in 1957, but returned to the First Division to sign for Nottingham Forest a year later, and helped them win the FA Cup in 1959. He stayed at the City Ground until his retirement as a player at the end of the 1966-67 season, when Forest finished second behind Manchester United in the league - at the time, this was the closest Forest had come to winning the league title. After Billy Gray's death on 11 April 2011, Whitefoot is now the only surviving member of the 1959 FA Cup winning team. The death of Bill Foulkes on 25 November 2013 also means that Whitefoot is the last player still living to have collected a league title winner's medal with Manchester United in the 1955-56 season, having played 15 times in the league that season.

His work as both a researcher and teacher had a major influence on the understanding, methods and apparatus used in almost all branches of physiology. In 1842 Ludwig became a professor of physiology and in 1846 of comparative anatomy. From professorships in Zurich and Vienna he went in 1865 to the University of Leipzig and developed there the Physiological Institute, designated today after him: Carl Ludwig Institute of Physiology.Current website of the Carl-Ludwig-Institute of Physiology http://cliphys.uniklinikum-leipzig.de/ Ludwig researched several topics such as the physiology of blood pressure, urinary excretion, and anesthesia. He received the Copley Medal in 1884 for his research. In 1869, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He is credited for inventing the stromuhr. Since 1932 the Carl Ludwig Honorary Medal is awarded by the German Society for Cardiology to outstanding investigators in the area of cardiovascular research.  Life  Ludwig was born at Witzenhausen, near Kassel, and studied medicine at Erlangen and Marburg, taking his doctor's degree at Marburg in 1839. He made Marburg his home for the next ten years, studying and teaching anatomy and physiology, first as prosector to FL Fick (1841), then as privat-docent (1842), and finally as extraordinary professor (1846). In 1849 he was chosen professor of anatomy and physiology at Zurich, and 6 years afterwards he went to Vienna as professor in the Josephinum school for military surgeons. In 1865 Ludwig was appointed to the newly created chair of physiology at Leipzig, and continued there until his death on 23 April 1895. Appraisal Carl Ludwig in 1856 Ludwig's name is prominent in the history of physiology, and he had a large share in bringing about the change in the method of that science that took place in the middle of the 19th century. With his friends Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz, Ernst Wilhelm von Br√ºcke, and Emil du Bois-Reymond, whom he met for the first time in Berlin in 1847, he rejected the assumption that the phenomena of living animals depend on special biological laws and vital forces different from those that operate in the domain of inorganic nature; and he sought to explain them by reference to the same laws as are applicable in the case of physical and chemical phenomena. This point of view was expressed in Ludwig's celebrated Text-book of Human Physiology (1852‚Äì1856), but it is as evident in his earliest paper (1842) on the process of urinary secretion as in all his subsequent work. Ludwig exercised enormous influence on the progress of physiology, not only by the discoveries he made, but also by the new methods and apparatus he introduced to its service. Thus in regard to secretion, he showed that secretory glands, such as the submaxillary, are more than mere filters, and that their secretory action is attended by chemical and thermal changes both in themselves and in the blood passing through them. Ludwig demonstrated the existence of a new class of secretory nerves that control this action, and by showing that if the nerves are appropriately stimulated the salivary glands continue to secrete, even though the animal be decapitated, he initiated the method of experimenting with excised organs. He devised the kymograph as a means of obtaining a written record of the variations in the pressure of the blood in the blood vessels; and this apparatus not only conducted him to many important conclusions respecting the mechanics of the circulation, but afforded the first instance of the use of the graphic method in physiological inquiries. For researches on blood gases, he designed the mercurial blood-pump that, with various modifications, has come into extensive use. He used it for many investigations into gases of the lymph, the gaseous interchanges in living muscle, the significance of oxidized material in the blood, etc. There is indeed scarcely any branch of physiology, except the physiology of the senses, to which Ludwig did not make important contributions. He was also a great power as a teacher and the founder of a school. Under him the Physiological Institute at Leipzig became an organized center of physiological research, whence issued a steady stream of original work; and though the papers containing the results usually bore the name of his pupils only, every investigation was inspired by him and carried out under his personal direction. Thus his pupils gained a practical acquaintance with his methods and ways of thought, and, coming from all parts of Europe, they returned to their own countries to spread and extend his doctrines. Possessed himself of extraordinary manipulative skill, he abhorred rough and clumsy work, and he insisted that experiments on animals should be planned and prepared with the utmost care, not only to avoid the infliction of pain (which was also guarded against by the use of an anesthetic), but to ensure that the deductions drawn from them should have their full scientific value.

It is the second book in the series Dalemark Quartet.  Plot  The book begins with the birth of Alhammit Alhammitson, or Mitt, in South Dalemark, near a seaport called Holand. When Mitt is a young child, his family are evicted from their farm when the rent is doubled by Earl Hadd, the cruel and tyrannical ruler of South Dalemark. The entire family is forced to move to an unpleasant tenement in the city of Holand, where Mitt's father joins the Free Holanders, a resistance against Earl Hadd. However, after a raid on a warehouse which goes fatally wrong, Mitt's father disappears, most likely killed by the soldiers. Mitt and his mother Milda are convinced that three of the elder Free Holanders, Siriol, Dideo and Ham, betrayed the younger members to the Earls soldiers because they were scared of the consequences of raiding the warehouse. Mitt is determined to take revenge on them for causing his father's death, and to do this, he joins the Free Holanders, hoping to bring them down from within. He ends up working on a fishing boat with Siriol out of Holand harbor. Milda, meanwhile, marries Hobin, a well-off gunsmith. Mitt plans to take revenge on the Free Holanders by assassinating Earl Hadd with a homemade bomb during the annual Sea Festival, then letting himself be caught and, in turn, betraying the Free Holanders. Mitt's attempt fails miserably, when the Earl's youngest son, Navis, kicks away the bomb that Mitt planted at the Earl's feet, but the Earl is killed anyway by a sniper with a long-range gun, shooting from one of the many boats in the harbor. Watching the festival are Navis's children, Ynen and Hildrida (Hildy). Hildy is furious with her father, since he had allowed her to be betrothed to Lithar, Lord of the Holy Islands, whom she has never met. After the assassination, she asks the new Earl, Harl, to break off her engagement, but he refuses. To get back at them, she and Ynen decide to make it look as if they'd run away and gone for a sail on her new boat, the Wind's Road. Having been seen and recognized during the Earl's assassination, Mitt is forced to flee for his life. He hides on a magnificent boat‚Äîthe very same one that Ynen and Hildy are running away on. They take the ship out of Holand harbor, with Mitt stowing away beneath deck, and when they are sufficiently far out to sea, Mitt shows himself, and demands that they take him to the North, where he can hide from the Earl's soldiers. Although the two are initially uncooperative, Mitt does his best to convince them that he is a rough, tough freedom fighter who will shoot them if he gets the chance; he partially succeeds, and Hildy and Ynen agree to take him North, if only because he has a gun, given to him by Hobin. On the way North the three find, floating in the sea, the wheat figure of Poor Old Ammet, which was thrown in the sea during the Festival. This is considered good luck, and so they take him on board, lashing him to the prow as a figurehead. As well as this, Mitt has a small wax figure of Poor Old Ammet's consort, Libby Beer, which they attach to the stern. That night they weather a dreadful autumn storm with the help the two demigods, Poor Old Ammet and Libby Beer. After the storm has passed, they come across a lifeboat, with one sailor aboard. After a few hours in the man's company, Mitt realizes that not only is the sailor the man who shot Earl Hadd from the harbor, he is also Mitt's own long-lost father, Al. Mitt's father, who turns out to be the actual betrayer of the Freedom Fighters and a truly bad person, forces them to take him to the Holy Islands. He plans to deliver Hildy to her would-be fianc√©, the Lord of the Holy Islands, the man she ran away from home to avoid marrying. Hildy is determined to stop this, but before they can do anything, they arrive in the Holy Islands. Upon being told the name of the Wind's Road, the Holy Islanders say that a great one \\"will come on the wind's road with a great one before him and behind.\\" Hildy and Ynen are taken prisoner, but Al forces Lithar, who is a childish imbecile, to have Mitt killed. The Holy Islanders refuse to harm him, so they maroon him on the uninhabited Holy Island. Hildy, meanwhile, meets with Libby Beer herself. Libby tells her that, if she wishes to return to the Holy Islands, she must trust Mitt. Hildy reluctantly agrees. On Holy Island, Mitt encounters the two demigods in person and learns their secret names. When invoked in dire danger, the secret names produce cataclysmic effects that explain the folk names by which the two demigods are called on Holy Islands: the Earth Shaker for Poor Old Ammet and She Who Raised the Islands for Libby Beer. Meanwhile, Hildy and Ynen are re-united with Navis, who tells them that they were lucky to escape Holand alive, as Harl had been planning to kill them. Al is taking Ynen and Navis back to Holand to be killed by Harl when Mitt arrives. He invokes the greater name of Libby Beer, causing an island to rise up, destroying the ship. Al is killed. The Holy Islanders send them off again on Wind's Road to go North. Before leaving, Mitt promises Poor Old Ammet that he will return to Holy Islands as a friend, not as a conqueror.  Characters  *Mitt Alhamittsson: A young boy who styles himself a Freedom Fighter, a murderer, and ultimately a fugitive from the law. *Hildrida Navissdaughter: Granddaughter of Earl Hadd, betrothed at the age of nine to the Lord of Holy Islands as a political alliance. Her temper tantrums are a force of nature. *Ynen Navisson: Grandson of Earl Hadd, an ardent boat lover and sailor. Ynen is the only one of Hadd's grandchildren who is genuinely nice. *Navis Haddsson: The third and youngest son of Earl Hadd and the father of Ynen and Hildrida. Unlike his brothers, he isn't cruel, but he hasn't done much of anything since his wife died. *Earl Hadd: The cruel and tyrannical earl of Holand, Hadd is wealthy and grows wealthier still from his high taxes. He has three sons, Harl, Harchad, and Navis, and prefers his granddaughters to his grandsons because they can be married off to make alliances. *Old Ammet: One of the Undying, also known as the Earth Shaker. Ynynen is the lesser of his hidden names, which shakes the earth when invoked. He is a particular friend of Mitt's. His original name is Alhammitt (like Mitt's), and he is often described as a man with long grey or pale yellow hair and a young-old face. There is a custom in Holand in which, every year, a straw figure of Ammet is thrown into the sea during the Autumn Festival to bring luck and prosperity. The ship lucky enough to find Old Ammet's figure lashes it to its prow as a figurehead and is said to meet with great fortune. *Libby Beer: Another one of the Undying and the wife of Poor Old Ammet. Her epithet is She Who Raised the Islands, and she is described as a woman in a green dress. Her lesser name causes plants to grow on any surface; her greater name raises land out of the sea. Her figure made of fruits and berries is also thrown into the sea during the Autumn Festival. Explanation of the novel's title \\"Drowned Ammet\\" refers to the custom in Holand of throwing a straw figure of Poor Old Ammet (see above) into the ocean.

The battle was part of the Creek War. Background In July 1813, Peter McQueen, a Creek Native American chief, and a large party of Red Stick warriors proceeded to Pensacola, Florida to buy munitions, with $400 and a letter from a British officer at Fort Malden. In McQueen's words, the Spanish governor gave them \\"a small bag of powder for each ten towns, and five bullets to each man.\\" The governor presented this as a \\"friendly present, for hunting purposes\\". But Samuel Moniac, a Creek warrior, testified August 2, 1813 after the events, \\"High Head told me that, when they went back with their supply, another body of men would go down for another supply of ammunition; and that ten men were to go out of town, and they calculated on 'five horse-loads for every town'.\\" Battle United States soldiers at Fort Mims, having heard of Peter McQueen's mission, sent a quickly organized force, led by Colonel James Caller and Captain Dixon Bailey, to intercept McQueen's party. The Americans ambushed the Red Sticks as they bedded down on the evening of July 27, 1813, on the banks of Burnt Corn Creek, in present-day southern Alabama (in what is now northern Escambia County, Alabama). It would become known as \\"The Battle of Burnt Corn\\" or the \\"Battle of Burnt Corn Creek,\\" and would be seen as a part of the broader Creek War. The Americans scattered the Red Sticks, who fled to the nearby swamps. Flush with victory, the Americans began looting the Red Sticks' pack-horses. From the swamp, the Creeks noticed that the Americans had dropped their guard. The Creek re-grouped and launched a surprise attack of their own, which scattered the Americans.

Its ISO 4217 code was PEI and its abbreviation in local use was \\"I/.\\" The inti was divided into 100 c√©ntimos. The inti replaced the inflation-stricken sol. The new currency was named after Inti, the Inca sun god. History The inti was introduced on 1 February 1985, replacing the sol which had suffered from high inflation. One inti was equivalent to 1,000 soles. Coins denominated in the new unit were put into circulation from May 1985 and banknotes followed in June of that year. By 1990, the inti had itself suffered from high inflation. As an interim measure, from January to July 1991, the \\"inti mill√≥n\\" (I/m.) was used as a unit of account. One inti mill√≥n was equal to 1,000,000 intis and hence to one new sol. The nuevo sol (\\"new sol\\") was adopted on 1 July 1991, replacing the inti at an exchange rate of a million to one. Thus: 1 new sol = 1,000,000 inti = 1,000,000,000 old soles. Inti notes and coins are no longer legal tender in Peru, nor can they be exchanged for notes and coins denominated in the current nuevo sol. Coins Coins were introduced in 1985 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centimos (designs were taken from the previous 10, 50, 100 and 500 soles de oro coins), plus 1 and 5 intis. The 1 c√©ntimo coin was issued only in 1985. The 5-c√©ntimo coins were issued until 1986. All the other denominations were issued until 1988. All coins featured Navy Admiral Miguel Grau: cent coins on the reverse, Inti coins on the obverse. Banknotes In June 1985, notes were introduced in denominations of 10, 50 (taken from previous 10,000 and 50,000 soles de oro notes) and 100 intis, followed by 500 intis in December of the same year.

It is a common misconceptionL. G. Wade, Jr., Organic Chemistry, 6th ed., p. 477, Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, USA, 2005. that PI3 is too unstable to be stored; it is, in fact, commercially available. It is widely used in organic chemistry for converting alcohols to alkyl iodides. It is also a powerful reducing agent. Note that phosphorus also forms a lower iodide, P2I4, but the existence of PI5 is doubtful at room temperature. Properties PI3 has essentially zero dipole moment in carbon disulfide solution, because the P-I bond has almost no dipole. The P-I bond is also weak; PI3 is much less stable than PBr3 and PCl3, with a standard enthalpy of formation for PI3 of only ‚àí46 kJ/ mol (solid). The phosphorus atom has an NMR chemical shift of 178 ppm (downfield of H3PO4). Reactions Phosphorus triiodide reacts vigorously with water, producing phosphorous acid (H3PO3) and hydroiodic acid (HI), along with smaller amounts of phosphine and P-P compounds. Alcohols likewise form alkyl iodides, this providing the main use for PI3. PI3 is also a powerful reducing agent and deoxygenating agent. It reduces sulfoxides to sulfides, even at ‚àí78 ¬∞C. Meanwhile, heating a 1-iodobutane solution of PI3 with red phosphorus causes reduction to P2I4. Preparation The usual method or preparation is by the union of the elements, often by addition of iodine to a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide: : P4 \\\\+ 6 I2 ‚Üí 4 PI3 Alternatively, PCl3 may be converted to PI3 by the action of hydrogen iodide or certain metal iodides. Uses Phosphorus triiodide is commonly used in the laboratory for the conversion of primary or secondary alcohols to alkyl iodides.B. S. Furnell et al., Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, 5th edition, Longman/Wiley, New York, 1989. The alcohol is frequently used as the solvent, on top of being the reactant. Often the PI3 is made in situ by the reaction of red phosphorus with iodine in the presence of the alcohol; for example, the conversion of methanol to give iodomethane: :PI3 \\\\+ 3 ‚Üí 3 + These alkyl iodides are useful compounds for nucleophilic substitution reactions, and for the preparation of Grignard reagents.

The Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) was not an acceptable long-standing agreement for the Ottoman Empire. Twelve years after Karlowitz, the Turks began the long prospect of taking revenge for their defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. First, the Turkish Grand Vizier Baltacƒ± Mehmet's army defeated Peter the Great's Russian Army in the Russo-Turkish War (1710‚Äì1711). Thereafter, in the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1714‚Äì1718), the new Grand Vizier Damat Ali re-conquered the Morea from the Venetians in 1715. As a reaction, Austria, as the guarantor of the Treaty of Karlowitz, threatened the Ottoman Empire, but in response, the Ottoman Empire declared war against Austria. In 1716, Prince Eugene of Savoy defeated the Turks at Petrovaradin. The Banat and its capital Timi≈üoara was conquered in October 1716. The following year, after the Austrians captured Belgrade, the Turks wanted peace and in 1718 the Treaty of Passarowitz was signed. The Austrians maintained control over Belgrade and the Treaty of Passarowitz confirmed their gains in 1699, leaving the Turks with control over the south bank of the Danube river. The war led to the loss of Austrian holdings in Italy because of their support in the Balkans. It caused them to send more supplies to the Balkan front, ultimately reducing focus to their Italian territories which were facing aggression from Spain. Even though Eugene of Savoy asked for the troops to be diverted, the focus was given to the Ottomans. This ultimately caused the War of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain.

The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. The band is something of a Supergroup: Eric Wilson from Sublime and Long Beach Dub Allstars, RAS-1 also from Long Beach Dub Allstars, Trey Pangborn from the Falling Idols and Bargain Music and Damion Ramirez from Capitol Eye. The latter two bands, albeit not as well known, were quintessential Long Beach bands that helped influence the sound of Long Beach Shortbus today. Their first CD was a self-titled EP and featured their hit \\"California Grace.\\" Their second CD was entitled Flying Ship of Fantasy, featuring tracks from their first album. \\"California Grace\\" is also available on the soundtrack to the MTV reality series Laguna Beach. On October 7, 2007, it was announced that the band would be parting ways. Their final show took place at the Haunted Ball And Chain festival in San Diego, California, on November 2 and 3. Eric Wilson is now in Sublime with Rome, a new incarnation of Sublime which chiefly performs songs by that band, and also features Rome Ramirez filling in for their late singer/guitarist Bradley Nowell.

Operated by the Alabama State Department of Postsecondary Education, Shelton is one of the largest two-year colleges in the state. Approximately 4,500 students are enrolled in some form of coursework, including around 3,000 full-time students. The college is currently in good standing with its regional accrediting body SACSCOC. Shelton State is also designated as the Alabama Junior College of the Fine Arts by the state legislature. The Alabama Stage and Screen Hall of Fame is located there and Theatre Tuscaloosa is based in the Bean Browne Theatre at Shelton. The Alabama Fire College and Personnel Standards Commission is also located on the Martin campus of Shelton State. The Fire College is responsible for training paid and volunteer fire fighters and EMTs throughout the state. History The Tuscaloosa Trade School was created by the Alabama State Board of Education in 1950 and opened for classes in 1952. Its campus was located southeast of downtown, near what is now the intersection of 15th Street/Veterans Memorial Drive and McFarland Boulevard. In 1954, the school was renamed J. P. Shelton Trade School in honor of one of the state legislature who lobbied for the opening of the trade school in Tuscaloosa. In 1976, the school's name was changed to Shelton State Technical College. In 1975, Brewer State Junior College (now Bevill State Community College) opened a branch campus in Tuscaloosa in an old elementary school building near the intersection of 28th Street and Greensboro Avenue. At the time of its opening, it had three full-time faculty and 800 students. In 1977, Brewer State moved to a renovated strip mall on Skyland Boulevard. Shelton State Community College was established on January 1, 1979, by the state Board of Education by combining Shelton State and the Tuscaloosa branch of Brewer State. The two campuses remained separate, with the 15th Street campus acting as the vocational and technical campus and the Skyland Boulevard campus serving as the junior college campus. Tuscaloosa State Trade School was created by the state legislature in 1963. In 1974, the institution became Tuscaloosa State Technical College and was authorized by the Alabama State Board of Education to grant associate degrees. In 1976, the college name was changed to C. A. Fredd State Technical College to honor the first president of the institution. In 1994, Fredd State merged with Shelton State. The new institution retained the name of Shelton State Community College, and the president of Shelton State was named president of the consolidated institution. Around this time, Shelton broke ground on a new campus on Alabama Highway 69 in the growing suburb of Taylorville. The new campus - named Martin campus - opened in 1997-98 and consolidated the 15th Street and Skyland Boulevard campuses into one. The Fredd campus remained on MLK Boulevard but was renovated extensively to match the architecture of the Martin campus.  Campus  Shelton State has two campuses: Martin Campus, off Alabama Highway 69, south of Tuscaloosa, in the unincorporated suburb of Taylorville, and C.A. Fredd Campus on Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard in west Tuscaloosa. Student life  =Athletics= Shelton State fields six varsity sports teams in the Alabama Community College Conference (ACCC) in Division I of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). Two of the sports are women's (softball and basketball), two are men's (baseball and basketball), and one is co-ed (cheerleading). Shelton State's sports teams are called the Buccaneers and their colors are gold and emerald.

Robertson's paternal grandfather, Robert Robertson, was a member of Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1854 until 1878. His father, Thomas Robertson was also a member of the provincial legislature, as well as serving as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) from 1882 to 1887. His mother was Josephine Allan. Born in Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia, Wishart Robertson was educated in a Nova Scotia high school. He moved to Brooklyn, United States, to enter business, but returned to Canada in 1916 to join the 219th Battalion and then the 85th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a lieutenant. In 1918, he returned to Canada following World War I, and entered the automobile industry. In 1919, Robertson married Ethel Walker. He eventually became president and manager of Argyle Motor Services Ltd. and of Robertson Motors Ltd. of Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1928, he was elected to the provincial legislature, representing the riding previously held by his father and grandfather before him had represented. He did not run for re-election in 1933. In 1943, he was elected President of the National Liberal Federation of Canada, and was appointed to the Senate of Canada on February 19 of that year. Senator Robertson was appointed to the cabinet as Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate and minister without portfolio in 1945. He served as a delegate to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946. He was active in the civil section of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and helped establish international parliamentary groups to help set out the political, economic and social goals of NATO. Robertson was appointed Speaker of the Senate of Canada in 1953. He continued his efforts with NATO, and formed the Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association in 1954 with himself as president. He encouraged the formation of similar associations in other countries. He won the 1954 Atlantic Award for outstanding service to the NATO community for his efforts that ultimately led to the formation of the NATO International Parliamentary Association in July 1955. Senator Robertson was Chairman of the founding conference, and was elected Honorary Life President of the international association. Robertson's term as the Senate's speaker ended with the defeat of the Liberal government in the 1957 election. Robertson remained a Senator until his resignation in 1965 due to ill health. He died in Ottawa at the age of 76.  Archives  There is a Wishart Robertson fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

It is named after the Salic Law which prohibits women from ascending to the throne or obtaining inheritance. Rules First, the Queens are taken out of the stock. Then a King is placed on the tableau. The rest on the cards are shuffled and dealt on the King to form a column. The player deals as many cards over the King until another King appears, starting a new column. This is done until all eight Kings are laid out and all cards have been dealt, resulting in eight columns of various lengths. During dealing, whenever an Ace appears, it is put onto the foundations. In fact, once aces are in the foundations over the kings, they can be built up to Jacks regardless of suit, even while dealing is in progress as long as the top cards of the columns already dealt are available for play, as well as any applicable card that appears during dealing. Once all cards have been dealt, building to the foundations continue. Cards on the tableau cannot be built on each other. However, a column containing just a King is considered vacant and any card can be placed there. One card can be moved at a time and as mentioned earlier, the top card of each column is available for play. The game is won when all cards available are placed on the foundations with the Jacks on the top of the foundations and the Kings exposed. Sometimes, players still give the Queens a decorative role by putting them between the foundations and the King columns or shuffling them with the rest of the deck and putting them between the foundations and the columns later. Variants In the rules described by David Parlett, when a King becomes exposed in the tableau it is permissible to transfer the end-card of a column to it as a temporary reserve. Under this rule the game can often be completed successfully. Some implementations of Salic Law in software programs disallow this, making the game much harder to win. Intrigue is similar to Salic Law, but also involves the queens and building in the foundations goes both ways, downwards from the 5s and upwards from the 6s. Also closely related to Salic Law is Faerie Queen.

Life Little is known of Ayrer's living circumstances. He lived as an ironmonger in Nuremberg, probably studying theology and law in Bamberg before returning in 1593 to Nuremberg, where he was Imperial notary and legal prosecutor. Ayrer was the last significant composer of Fastnachtsspiele and a very prolific author: of his 106 plays, sixty-nine survive. He took his material from Greek mythology, Roman fables and German chapbooks and stories; he also translated plays of Shakespeare. Ayrer died in 1605 in his birth city of Nuremberg. Opus Theatricum, a six-volume selection of his plays, Fastnachtsspiele and farces, appeared in 1618. As a dramatist, Ayrer is virtually the successor of Hans Sachs, but he came under the influence of the so-called Englische Komodianten, that is, troupes of English actors, who, at the close of the 16th century and during the 17th, repeatedly visited the Continent, bringing with them the repertory of the Elizabethan theatre. From those actors Ayrer learned how to enliven his dramas with sensational incidents and spectacular effects, and from them he borrowed the character of the clown. Influence may have operated in the other direction as well; Comedia von der sch√∂nen Sidea (ca. 1600; ‚ÄúComedy of the Beautiful Sidea‚Äù) is often cited as the plot model used by William Shakespeare in The Tempest. Ayrer's plays, however, are in spite of his foreign models, hardly more dramatic, in the true sense of the word, than those of Sachs, and they are inferior to the latter in poetic qualities.

The song closes side one on their 1969 album Abbey Road. The song is an unusual Beatles composition for a variety of reasons, namely its length (nearly eight minutes), minimal lyrics, a three-minute descent through repeated guitar chords over a rising background of synthesized white noise, and an abrupt ending. It was the first song recorded for the Abbey Road album but one of the last songs to be finished, on 20 August 1969, the last time all four Beatles were together in the studio.The Beatles. J Lennon, P McCartney, G Harrison‚Ä¶ ‚Äì John Lennon ‚Äì Google Books Composition Lennon wrote the song about his love for Yoko Ono. It begins in time, with an arpeggio guitar theme in D minor, progressing through E7(9) and B7 before cadencing on an A augmented chord. In this chord sequence, the F note is a drone. The bass and lead guitar ascend and descend with a riff derived from the D minor scale. As the last chord fades, a verse begins in time, based on the A and D blues scales, with Lennon singing \\"I want you / I want you so bad ...\\" The two blues verses alternate, before the reappearance of the E7(9) chord, and McCartney playing a notably aggressive bass riff. This would function, throughout the song, as a transition to the main theme. The main theme repeats with Lennon singing \\"She's so heavy\\", with a long sustain on the last word. The second set of verses are rendered instrumentally with lead guitar. Another repeat of the \\"She's So Heavy\\" theme (this time featuring harmonies) is followed by Lennon singing a livelier repeat of the \\"I Want You\\" verse. During the next E7(9) transition, Lennon lets loose a primal scream of \\"Yeah\\", until his voice breaks. The song's coda consists of a three-minute repetition of the \\"She's So Heavy\\" theme, with the arpeggios double tracked, intensifying with \\"white noise\\" fading in as the theme continues; this consists of multi-tracked guitars from Lennon and Harrison, Moog white-noise from Lennon, and drums and bass from Starr and McCartney respectively. In the middle of the 15th repetition of the theme, the song abruptly ends. Recording The song was rehearsed several times during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions; the basic track and Lennon's guide vocal (which is used in the master) were recorded at Trident Studios on 22 February 1969, shortly after shooting for the Let It Be film ended. Lennon played the lead guitar, as George Harrison stated: Lennon and Harrison overdubbed multi- tracked heavy guitars on 18 April 1969. Billy Preston's Hammond organ and Ringo Starr's congas were added on 20 April 1969. \\"I Want You\\" received the \\"She's So Heavy\\" vocals on 11 August, and thus the title became \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\".Voice Leading and Harmony as Expressive Devices in the Early Music of the Beatles:'She Loves You'W Everett ‚Äì College Music Symposium, 1992 ‚Äì JSTOR \\"'She's So Heavy' was about Yoko,\\" Lennon told Rolling Stone. \\"When you're drowning, you don't say, 'I would be incredibly pleased if someone would have the foresight to notice me drowning and come and help me.' You just scream.\\" Three takes from 22 February were edited into a master (second generation), which was overdubbed, mixed down on 18 April (third generation), and overdubbed on 18 April, 20 April, 8 August and 11 August. Different overdubs were made to the second generation tape on 8 August. The mix is the third generation for 4:37 and then the second generation tape, which has white noise produced by the Moog synthesizer played by Lennon and additional drums added on 8 August. The final overdub session for \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", which included the final mixing and editing, was the last time all four Beatles worked in the studio together. The final master lasted 8:04, but Lennon decided on a surprise ending. During the final edit with the guitars, drums and white noise climaxing endlessly, he told recording engineer Geoff Emerick to \\"cut it right there\\" at the 7:44 mark, bringing the song (and side one of Abbey Road) to an abrupt end. On the Beatles' remix album Love, the three-minute guitar coda from \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is attached to \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\", and snippets of that song and \\"Helter Skelter\\" are mixed in with the repeated guitar riff. The abrupt ending of the original is retained, but it cuts to wind-like white noise, not to silence as on the original. The mix also included the organ solo and the guitar solo from the trident studio outtake. Influence and legacy Pitchforks Jillian Mapps describes \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" as a song in which Lennon \\"predates heavy-metal transcendence\\". In 2015, Josh Hart and Damian Fanelli, writing for Guitar World, placed it 34th in their list of the \\"50 Heaviest Songs Before Black Sabbath\\", and called the track a \\"bluesy rocker\\" that \\"might have inadvertently started doom metal\\". Jo Kendall of Classic Rock magazine similarly states that \\"I Want You\\" predated \\"Black Sabbath's creation of doom rock by several months\\" and comments on its \\"Santana-like Latin blues section\\".Classic Rock Magazine, September 2014 James Manning of Time Out London recognises the song as the foundation for stoner rock.

It is owned by the Chinese company Midea Group. The KUKA Robotics Corporation has 25 subsidiaries worldwide, mostly sales and service subsidiaries, including in the United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Russia and most European countries. The company name, KUKA, is an acronym for Keller und Knappich Augsburg. KUKA Systems GmbH, a division of KUKA, is an international supplier of engineering services and flexible automated manufacturing solutions with around 3,900 employees in twelve countries globally. KUKA Systems‚Äô plants/equipments are being used by various automotive manufacturers such as BMW, GM, Chrysler, Ford, Volvo, Volkswagen, Daimler AG, Valmet Automotive as well as manufacturers from other industrial sectors such as Airbus, Astrium, Siemens and others. The range includes products and services for task automation in the industrial processing of metallic and non-metallic materials for various industries including automotive, energy, aerospace, rail vehicles, and agricultural machinery.  History  The company was founded in 1898 by Johann Josef Keller and Jacob Knappich The company was founded in 1898 in Augsburg, Germany, by Johann Josef Keller and Jacob Knappich. The acetylene factory Augsburg was founded in 1898 by Johann Josef Keller and Jakob Knappich for the production of low-cost domestic and municipal lighting, household appliances and automobile headlights. In 1905, the production was extended to the innovative autonomous welding equipment. After the First World War, Keller and Knappich resumed production of safety-, manual- and power-winches and began the manufacturing of large containers. As a result, the Bayerische Kesselwagen GmbH was formed in 1922. The new company was responsible for the development and production of superstructures for municipal vehicles (street cleaning machines, sewage trucks, garbage trucks). In 1927, this business division presented the first large garbage truck. The name KUKA came into being in the same year through the company‚Äôs name at that time ‚ÄúKeller und Knappich Augsburg‚Äù. Keller & Knappich GmbH merged with part of Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe AG to become Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe Augsburg Aktiengesellschaft, eventually KUKA (Keller und Knappich Augsburg) for short. The development and manufacture of spot welding equipment began in 1936. Three years later, KUKA already had more than 1,000 employees. After the major destruction of the company during the Second World War in 1945, KUKA started manufacturing welding machines and other small appliances again. With new products such as the double-cylinder circular knitting machine and the portable typewriter \\"Princess\\", KUKA introduced new industrial fields and gained independence from the supply sector. In 1956, KUKA manufactured the first automatic welding system for refrigerators and washing machines and supplied the first multi- spot welding line to Volkswagen AG. Ten years later, the first friction welding machine went into production. In 1967, the arc welding method was applied for the first time at KUKA. In 1971, the delivery of the first robotic welding system for the S-Class took place. A year later, the magnetic arc- welding machine came to the market. In 1973, KUKA created its own industrial robot FAMULUS.Company history located on the KUKA Robotics Homepage At that time, the company belonged to the Quandt group. In 1978, beginning with the IR 601/60, robot production went into mass-production. In 1980, the Quandt family withdrew and a publicly owned firm was established. In 1981, KUKA‚Äôs main activities were grouped into three independent companies: the KUKA Schweissanlagen und Roboter GmbH, the KUKA Umwelttechnik GmbH and the KUKA Wehrtechnik GmbH, which was re-sold to Rheinmetall in 1999. Towards the end of 1982, the LSW Maschinenfabrik GmbH, Bremen became a subsidiary of KUKA. In 1993, the first laser-roof-seam welding systems were manufactured. These welding systems were then further expanded to adhesive bonding and sealing technologies in the following year. Around the same time, KUKA took over the tools & equipment manufacturers Schwarzenberg GmbH and expanded its business to China and the USA in the following years. In 1995, the company was split into KUKA Robotics Corporation and KUKA Schwei√üanlagen (now KUKA Systems), now both subsidiaries of KUKA AG. The company is a member of the Robotics Industries Association (RIA), of the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) and the German engineering association VDMA. Today, KUKA concentrates on solutions for the automation of industrial manufacturing processes. In 1996, KUKA Schweissanlagen GmbH became an independent company and, two years later, the market leader among European welding equipment manufacturers. The supply of the first pressing tools for automobile side-walls made of high-strength steel began in 2002. The company launched the KUKA RoboScan with remote laser welding head in 2003. Since 2006, KUKA Systems is operating its own bodyshell factory in Toledo, America and produces the bodywork for the Jeep Wrangler by Chrysler. In the course of internationalization and expansion of business units and technologies such as reshaping, tooling, bonding, sealing, etc., KUKA Schweissanlagen GmbH became KUKA Systems GmbH in 2007. In 2010, KUKA presented a newly developed standardized cell concept for welding solutions, KUKA flexibleCUBE. In the automation sector, KUKA Systems offers standard and customized solutions for industrial production automation; joining technologies and component handling are amongst their activity. The technologies are tested and the production processes are fully optimized prior to the development. In addition, KUKA Systems offers engineering and individual counseling, so that customized/special production solutions can be planned and optimized in co-operation with the customer. In June 2016, Midea Group offered to buy Kuka for about ‚Ç¨4.5 billion ($5 billion). Midea completed the takeover bid in January 2017 by taking 74.55% voting stake in the company. In late 2017 Kuka announced that 250 employees of KUKA Systems will be terminated. The management named trouble with projects as a reason. . Most robots are finished in \\"KUKA Orange\\" (the official corporate color) or black.  Corporate structure  The company is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany. As of December 2014, KUKA employed more than 13,000 workers. While previously emphasizing customers in the automotive industry, the company has since expanded to other industries. It has 5 divisions: *Systems *Robotics *Swisslog Logistics Automation *Swisslog Healthcare *China  Notable milestones  1971 ‚Äì Europe's first welding transfer line built for Daimler-Benz. 1973 ‚Äì The world's first industrial robot with six electromechanically driven axes, known as FAMULUS. 1976 ‚Äì IR 6/60 ‚Äì An utterly new robot type with six electromechanically driven axes and an offset wrist. 1989 ‚Äì A new generation of industrial robots is developed ‚Äì brushless drive motors for a low maintenance and a higher technical availability. 2004 - The first Cobot KUKA LBR 3 is released.

The video has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube and has won numerous awards.Press Release from 12 May 2015, Retrieved August 6th, 2015 2017 - KUKA robots are heavily featured in a music videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAdqazixuRY by artist Nigel Stanford  System information and application areas  alt= alt= alt= alt= = System information = The KUKA system software is the operating software and the heart of the entire control. In it, all basic functions are stored which are needed for the deployment of the robot system. Robots come with a control panel(the KCP, or KUKAControlPanel), also known as a teach pendant, that has a display and axis control buttons for A1-A6, as well an integrated 6D mouse, with which the robot can be moved in manual(teaching) mode. The pendant also allows the user to view and modify existing programs, as well as create new ones. To manually control the axes, an enabling switch (also called a dead man's switch) on the back of the pendant must be pressed halfway in for motion to be possible. The connection to the controller is a proprietary video interface and CAN bus for the safety interlock system and button operation. A rugged computer located in the control cabinet communicates with the robot system via the MFC,Multi Function Card which controls the real-time servo drive electronics. Servo position feedback is transmitted to the controller through the so-called DSE- RDW/RDCResolver Digital Converter connection. The DSEDigital Servo Electronics board is in the control cabinet, usually located on or integrated into the MFC, the RDW/RDC board in located in the base of the robot. The software comprises two elements running simultaneously - the user interface and program storage, which is run on Windows 95 for KRC1 and early KRC2 controllers, Windows XP Embedded for KRC2 controllers, and Windows 7 Embedded for KRC4 controllers, as well as VxWin, a KUKA-modified version of the VxWorks real- time OS for program control and motion planning, which communicates to the MFC. The systems also contain standard PC peripherals, such as a CD-ROM drive(or 3.5\\" floppy on older controllers), USB ports, as well as a standard interface, either ISA or PCI/PCIe, for adding software and hardware options for industrial automation, such as Profibus, Interbus, DeviceNet and Profinet, and others.  Fields of application  = Aerospace = Aerospace KUKA Systems supplied the TIG welding cell for the upper stage of the Ariane 5 launcher-rocket. TIG welding stands for tungsten inert gas welding and is a special form of arc welding and is one of the core activities of KUKA Systems. The company also provides apparatuses appliances for the construction of aircraft structural elements. Boeing, SpaceX, Bell and Airbus are among KUKA Systems' respective customers. = Automotive = Automotive The KUKA Systems portfolio includes the spectrum of production automation of joining and assembling of vehicle body structures: from low-scale automated production facilities to highly flexible manufacturing systems; from production of individual equipments or subassemblies to the assembly of complete body structures and mechanical parts.

They are used in some large companies, predominantly in the automotive industry, but also in other industries such as the aerospace industry. Specific applications include: * Transport industry: for the transport of heavy loads, where their load capacity and free positioning are used. * Food and beverage industry: for tasks such as loading and unloading of packaging machines, cutting meat, stacking and palletizing, and quality control. * Construction industry: e.g., for ensuring an even flow of material. * Glass industry: used, for instance in the thermal treatment of glass and quartz glass in laboratory glass production, bending and forming operations. * Foundry and forging industry: the robots' heat and dirt resistance enable them to be used directly before, in and on the casting machines. They can also be used for operations such as deburring, grinding, or drilling, and for quality control. * Wood industry: for grinding, milling, drilling, sawing, palletizing or sorting applications. * Metal processing: for operations such as drilling, milling, sawing or bending and punching. Industrial robots are used in welding, assembly, loading and unloading processes. * Stone processing: the ceramic and stone industries use the industrial robots for bridge sawing  KUKA Entertainment  In 2001, KUKA formed a partnership with RoboCoaster Ltd to develop the world's first passenger-carrying industrial robot. The ride uses roller coaster-style seats attached to robotic arms and provides a roller coaster-like motion sequence through a series of programmable maneuvers. Riders themselves can also program the motions of their ride. A second generation system, the RoboCoaster G2, was deployed at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida in 2010, in conjunction with Dynamic Structures. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey's seats are mounted on robotic arms, which are in turn mounted on a track allowing the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). KUKA's partnership with RoboCoaster has also seen KUKA robots appear in some Hollywood films. In the James Bond film Die Another Day, in a scene depicting an ice palace in Iceland, NSA agent Jinx, played by Halle Berry, is threatened by laser-wielding robots. In the Ron Howard film The Da Vinci Code, a KUKA robot hands Tom Hanks‚Äô character Robert Langdon a container containing a cryptex. In 2007, KUKA introduced a simulator, based on the Robocoaster.\\"KUKA Entertainment 4D Simulator\\". Retrieved 2008-01-11. RoboCoaster Ltd does not market this product.

On 24 April 1871, he founded the Civilista Party, the most important political party of the Aristocratic Republic. He was elected president by the Peruvian Congress after a failed coup launched by colonel Tom√°s Gutierrez. One of the most controversial acts committed during his presidency was the signing of a Treaty of Defensive Alliance with Bolivia. The objective of this pact was to protect themselves from what they perceived as \\"Chilean Imperialism\\" and a growing desire of Chile for the allied provinces of Tarapac√° and Litoral.

Thus a volume element is an expression of the form :dV = \\\\rho(u_1,u_2,u_3)\\\\,du_1\\\\,du_2\\\\,du_3 where the u_i are the coordinates, so that the volume of any set B can be computed by :\\\\operatorname{Volume}(B) = \\\\int_B \\\\rho(u_1,u_2,u_3)\\\\,du_1\\\\,du_2\\\\,du_3. For example, in spherical coordinates dV = u_1^2\\\\sin u_2\\\\,du_1\\\\,du_2\\\\,du_3, and so \\\\rho = u_1^2\\\\sin u_2. The notion of a volume element is not limited to three dimensions: in two dimensions it is often known as the area element, and in this setting it is useful for doing surface integrals. Under changes of coordinates, the volume element changes by the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of the coordinate transformation (by the change of variables formula). This fact allows volume elements to be defined as a kind of measure on a manifold. On an orientable differentiable manifold, a volume element typically arises from a volume form: a top degree differential form. On a non- orientable manifold, the volume element is typically the absolute value of a (locally defined) volume form: it defines a 1-density. Volume element in Euclidean space In Euclidean space, the volume element is given by the product of the differentials of the Cartesian coordinates :dV = dx\\\\,dy\\\\,dz. In different coordinate systems of the form x=x(u_1,u_2,u_3), y=y(u_1,u_2,u_3), z=z(u_1,u_2,u_3), the volume element changes by the Jacobian of the coordinate change: :dV = \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial (x,y,z)}{\\\\partial (u_1,u_2,u_3)}\\\\right\\\\,du_1\\\\,du_2\\\\,du_3. For example, in spherical coordinates (mathematical convention) :\\\\begin{align} x&=\\\\rho\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\\\\\\\\\ y&=\\\\rho\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\\\\\\\\\ z&=\\\\rho\\\\cos\\\\phi \\\\end{align} the Jacobian is :\\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial(x,y,z)}{\\\\partial (\\\\rho,\\\\theta,\\\\phi)}\\\\right = \\\\rho^2\\\\sin\\\\phi so that :dV = \\\\rho^2\\\\sin\\\\phi\\\\,d\\\\rho\\\\,d\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\phi. This can be seen as a special case of the fact that differential forms transform through a pullback F^* as : F^*(u \\\\; dy^1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dy^n) = (u \\\\circ F) \\\\det \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F^j}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\right) dx^1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dx^n  Volume element of a linear subspace  Consider the linear subspace of the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn that is spanned by a collection of linearly independent vectors :X_1,\\\\dots,X_k. To find the volume element of the subspace, it is useful to know the fact from linear algebra that the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the X_i is the square root of the determinant of the Gramian matrix of the X_i: :\\\\sqrt{\\\\det(X_i\\\\cdot X_j)_{i,j=1\\\\dots k}}. Any point p in the subspace can be given coordinates (u_1,u_2,\\\\dots,u_k) such that :p = u_1X_1 + \\\\cdots + u_kX_k. At a point p, if we form a small parallelepiped with sides du_i, then the volume of that parallelepiped is the square root of the determinant of the Grammian matrix :\\\\sqrt{\\\\det\\\\left((du_i X_i)\\\\cdot (du_j X_j)\\\\right)_{i,j=1\\\\dots k}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\det(X_i\\\\cdot X_j)_{i,j=1\\\\dots k}}\\\\; du_1\\\\,du_2\\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\,du_k. This therefore defines the volume form in the linear subspace. Volume element of manifolds On an oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension n, the volume element is a volume form equal to the Hodge dual of the unit constant function, f(x) = 1: :\\\\omega = \\\\star 1 . Equivalently, the volume element is precisely the Levi-Civita tensor \\\\epsilon.Carroll, Sean. Spacetime and Geometry. Addison Wesley, 2004, p. 90 In coordinates, :\\\\omega = \\\\epsilon =\\\\sqrt{\\\\det g}\\\\, dx^1 \\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge dx^n where \\\\det g is the determinant of the metric tensor g written in the coordinate system. = Area element of a surface = A simple example of a volume element can be explored by considering a two-dimensional surface embedded in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Such a volume element is sometimes called an area element. Consider a subset U \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{R}^2 and a mapping function :\\\\varphi:U\\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}^n thus defining a surface embedded in \\\\mathbf{R}^n. In two dimensions, volume is just area, and a volume element gives a way to determine the area of parts of the surface. Thus a volume element is an expression of the form :f(u_1,u_2)\\\\,du_1\\\\,du_2 that allows one to compute the area of a set B lying on the surface by computing the integral :\\\\operatorname{Area}(B) = \\\\int_B f(u_1,u_2)\\\\,du_1\\\\,du_2. Here we will find the volume element on the surface that defines area in the usual sense. The Jacobian matrix of the mapping is :\\\\lambda_{ij}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_i} {\\\\partial u_j} with index i running from 1 to n, and j running from 1 to 2. The Euclidean metric in the n-dimensional space induces a metric g=\\\\lambda^T\\\\lambda on the set U, with matrix elements :g_{ij}=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\lambda_{ki} \\\\lambda_{kj} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_k} {\\\\partial u_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_k} {\\\\partial u_j}. The determinant of the metric is given by :\\\\det g = \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi} {\\\\partial u_1} \\\\wedge \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi} {\\\\partial u_2} \\\\right^2 = \\\\det (\\\\lambda^T \\\\lambda) For a regular surface, this determinant is non-vanishing; equivalently, the Jacobian matrix has rank 2. Now consider a change of coordinates on U, given by a diffeomorphism :f \\\\colon U\\\\to U , \\\\,\\\\\\\\! so that the coordinates (u_1,u_2) are given in terms of (v_1,v_2) by (u_1,u_2)= f(v_1,v_2). The Jacobian matrix of this transformation is given by :F_{ij}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_i} {\\\\partial v_j}. In the new coordinates, we have :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_i} {\\\\partial v_j} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi_i} {\\\\partial u_k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_k} {\\\\partial v_j} and so the metric transforms as :\\\\tilde{g} = F^T g F where \\\\tilde{g} is the pullback metric in the v coordinate system. The determinant is :\\\\det \\\\tilde{g} = \\\\det g (\\\\det F)^2. Given the above construction, it should now be straightforward to understand how the volume element is invariant under an orientation-preserving change of coordinates. In two dimensions, the volume is just the area. The area of a subset B\\\\subset U is given by the integral :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mbox{Area}(B) &= \\\\iint_B \\\\sqrt{\\\\det g}\\\\; du_1\\\\; du_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\iint_B \\\\sqrt{\\\\det g} \\\\;\\\\det F \\\\;dv_1 \\\\;dv_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\iint_B \\\\sqrt{\\\\det \\\\tilde{g}} \\\\;dv_1 \\\\;dv_2. \\\\end{align} Thus, in either coordinate system, the volume element takes the same expression: the expression of the volume element is invariant under a change of coordinates. Note that there was nothing particular to two dimensions in the above presentation; the above trivially generalizes to arbitrary dimensions. =Example: Sphere= For example, consider the sphere with radius r centered at the origin in R3. This can be parametrized using spherical coordinates with the map :\\\\phi(u_1,u_2) = (r\\\\cos u_1\\\\sin u_2,r\\\\sin u_1\\\\sin u_2,r\\\\cos u_2). Then :g = \\\\begin{pmatrix}r^2\\\\sin^2u_2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & r^2\\\\end{pmatrix}, and the area element is : \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\det g}\\\\; du_1 du_2 = r^2\\\\sin u_2\\\\, du_1 du_2.

Its remains are known mostly from Triassic \\"fissure fillings\\" in South England. Thecodontosaurus was a small bipedal animal, about 2 m (6.5 ft) long. It is one of the first dinosaurs to be discovered and is one of the oldest that existed. Many species have been named in the genus, but only the type species Thecodontosaurus antiquus is seen as valid today. Discovery and naming =Thecodontosaurus antiquus= Size comparison In the autumn of 1834, surgeon Henry Riley (1797‚Äì1848) and the curator of the Bristol Institution, Samuel Stutchbury, began to excavate \\"saurian remains\\" at the quarry of Durdham Down, at Clifton, presently a part of Bristol, which is part of the Magnesian Conglomerate. In 1834 and 1835, they briefly reported on the finds.Williams, 1835, \\"Discovery of Saurian Bones in the Magnesian Conglomerate near Bristol\\", American Journal of Science and Arts 28: 389 They provided their initial description in 1836, naming a new genus: Thecodontosaurus. The name is derived from Greek Œ∏ŒÆŒ∫ŒÆ, ', \\"socket\\", and ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÖœÇ, ', \\"tooth\\", a reference to the fact that the roots of the teeth were not fused with the jaw bone, as in present lizards, but positioned in separate tooth sockets.Riley, H., and S. Stutchbury, 1836, \\"A description of various fossil remains of three distinct saurian animals discovered in the autumn of 1834, in the Magnesian Conglomerate on Durdham Down, near Bristol\\", Proceedings of the Geological Society of London 2:397‚Äì399 Thecodontosaurus was the fifth dinosaur named, after Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, Streptospondylus and Hylaeosaurus, though Riley and Stutchbury were not aware of this, the very concept of Dinosauria only being created in 1842. In 1843, in his catalogue of British fossils, John Morris provided a complete species name: Thecodontosaurus antiquus.Morris, J., 1843, A Catalogue of British Fossils. British Museum, London, 222 pp The specific epithet, \\"antiquus\\", means \\"ancient\\" in Latin. The original type specimen or holotype of Thecodontosaurus, BCM 1, a lower jaw, fell victim to heavy World War II bombings by the Germans. Many remains of this dinosaur and other material related to it were destroyed in November 1940 during the Bristol Blitz. However, most bones were salvaged: today 184 fossil bones are part of the collection of the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. Later, more remains were found near Bristol at Tytherington. Currently about 245 fragmentary specimens are known, representing numerous individuals. In 1985, Peter Galton designated another lower jaw, a right dentary, as the neotype, BCM 2. The remains had been found in chalkstone infillings, breccia deposited in fissures in older rocks. The age of these deposits was once estimated as old as the late Carnian, but recent studies indicate that they date from the Rhaetian. =Other species= Apart from the original type species, Thecodontosaurus antiquus, Riley and Stutchbury also found some teeth of carnivorous phytosaurians that they named Palaeosaurus cylindrodon and P. platyodon. In the late nineteenth century, the theory became popular that such remains belonged to carnivorous prosauropods: animals with the body of Thecodontosaurus, but with slicing teeth. In 1890, Arthur Smith Woodward accordingly named a Thecodontosaurus platyodon,A.S. Woodward and C.D. Sherborn, 1890, A Catalogue of British Fossil Vertebrat Dulao & Company, London pp. 396 and in 1908 Friedrich von Huene named a Thecodontosaurus cylindrodon.F. v. Huene, 1908, \\"On phytosaurian remains from the Magnesian Conglomerate of Bristol (Rileya platyodon)\\", Annals and Magazine of Natural History, series 8 1: 228-230 Though still defended by Michael Cooper in 1981, the hypothesis that such creatures existed has now been totally discredited. On one occasion, material of Thecodontosaurus was, by mistake, described as a separate genus. In 1891, Harry Govier Seeley named Agrosaurus macgillivrayi, assuming the remains had been collected in 1844 by the crew of HMS Fly on the northeast coast of Australia.Seeley, H.G., 1891, \\"On Agrosaurus macgillivrayi, a saurischian reptile from the northeast coast of Australia\\", Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 47: 164‚Äì165 It was long considered the first dinosaur found in Australia, but in 1999 it was discovered that the bones probably belonged to a lot sent by Riley and Stutchbury to the British Museum of Natural History and then mislabelled. In 1906, von Huene had already noted the close resemblance and renamed the species Thecodontosaurus macgillivrayi. It is thus a junior synonym of Thecodontosaurus antiquus.Vickers-Rich, P., Rich, T.H., McNamara, G.C. & Milner, A. (1999). \\"Agrosaurus: Australia's oldest dinosaur?\\". Records of the Western Australian Museum Supplement 57: 191-200 Presently, the only valid species is thus T. antiquus. =Misassigned species= *Thecodontosaurus latespinatus von Huene, 1907-08 = Tanystropheus *Thecodontosaurus primus von Huene, 1907-1908 = indeterminate archosauromorph, previously questionably referred to Protanystropheus *Thecodontosaurus elizae Sauvage, 1907 *Thecodontosaurus gibbidens Cope, 1878 = Galtonia *Thecodontosaurus skirtopodus (Seeley, 1894) = Hortalotarsus *Thecodontosaurus polyzelus (Hitchcock, 1865) von Huene, 1906 *Thecodontosaurus hermannianus von Huene, 1908 *Thecodontosaurus diagnosticus Fraas, 1912 = Efraasia *Thecodontosaurus minor Haughton, 1918 *Thecodontosaurus dubius Haughton, 1924Haughton, S.H., 1924, \\"The fauna and stratigraphy of the Stormberg Series\\", Annals of the South African Museum 12: 323‚Äì497 *Thecodontosaurus browni (Seeley, 1895) von Huene, 1932 *Thecodontosaurus alophos Haughton, 1932 = NyasasaurusS.H.

Description Life restoration compared to a human From the fragmentary remains of Thecodontosaurus, most of the skeleton can be reconstructed, except for the front of the skull. Thecodontosaurus had a rather short neck supporting a fairly large skull with large eyes. Its jaws contained many small- to medium- sized, serrated, leaf-shaped teeth. This dinosaur's hands and feet each had five digits, and the hands were long and rather narrow, with an extended claw on each. This dinosaur's front limbs were much shorter than the legs, and its tail was much longer than the head, neck and body put together. On average, it was long, or 1 ft. tall, and weighed . The largest individuals had an estimated length of . In 2000, Michael Benton noted the existence of a robust morph in the population, seen by him as a possible second species or, more likely, an instance of sexual dimorphism. Benton also indicated some unique derived traits, or autapomorphies, for the species: a long basipterygoid process on the braincase; a dentary that is short in relation to the total length of the lower jaw; an ilium that has a back end that is subquadrate instead of rounded.M.J. Benton, L. Juul, G.W. Storrs and P.M. Galton, 2000, \\"Anatomy and systematics of the prosauropod dinosaur Thecodontosaurus antiquus from the upper Triassic of southwest England\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 20(1): 77-108 The small size has been explained as an instance of insular dwarfism.Whiteside, D.I. and Marshall, J.E.A. (2008) \\"The age, fauna and palaeoenvironment of the Late Triassic fissure deposits of Tytherington, South Gloucestershire, UK\\". Geological Magazine, 14(1): 105-147 Phylogeny Riley and Stutchbury originally saw Thecodontosaurus as a member of the Squamata, the group containing lizards and snakes. This did not change when Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria in 1842, because Owen did not recognise Thecodontosaurus as a dinosaur; in 1865, he assigned it to the Thecodontia. It was not until 1870 that Thomas Huxley became the first person to understand that it was a dinosaur, though referring it incorrectly to the Scelidosauridae.Huxley, T. H. 1870. \\"On the classification of the Dinosauria, with observations on the Dinosauria of the Trias\\". Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 26: 32‚Äì50 Later, it was be placed in either the Anchisauridae or its own Thecodontosauridae. Modern exact cladistic analyses have not been conclusive. Although not actually the earliest member of the group, Thecodontosaurus is sometimes placed in a very basal position among the sauropodomorph dinosaurs. It was earlier included under the Prosauropoda,Upchurch, P. (1998). \\"The phylogenetic relationships of sauropod dinosaurs\\". Zool. J. Linnean Soc. 124: 43-103 but more recently it has been suggested that Thecodontosaurus and its relatives preceded the prosauropod- sauropod split.Yates, A.M. & Kitching, J. W. (2003). \\"The earliest known sauropod dinosaur and the first steps towards sauropod locomotion\\". Proc. R. Soc. Lond.: B Biol Sci. 2003 Aug 22; 270(1525): 1753-8 New reconstructions show that its neck is proportionally shorter than those in more advanced early sauropodomorphs. The Bristol Dinosaur Project Bob Nicholls sculpting a model in Bristol Museum Thecodontosaurus has formed the basis of a massive public engagement exercise, the Bristol Dinosaur Project, that has run since 2000. In 2009, HLF core funded the Bristol Dinosaur Project, which allowed for the hiring of an Educational Officer and a Fossil Preparator to further develop the project. This funding resulted in three and a half years of extensive laboratory, research, and outreach work that presented the project to thousands of people all around the world.

She was often called \\"the richest girl in the world\\". Her great wealth, luxurious lifestyle, and love life attracted significant press coverage, both while she was alive and after her death. Duke's passions varied wildly. Briefly a news correspondent in the 1940s, she also played jazz piano and learned to surf competitively. At her father's estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, she created one of America's largest indoor botanical displays. She was also active in preserving more than 80 historic buildings in Newport, Rhode Island. Duke was close friends with former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and in 1968, when Duke created the Newport Restoration Foundation, Kennedy Onassis was appointed the vice president and championed the foundation. Her philanthropic work in AIDS research, medicine, and child welfare continued into her old age. She also donated funds to support and educate black students in the South who were disadvantaged because of their race. Her estimated $1.3 billion fortune was largely left to charity. Duke's legacy is now administered by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, dedicated to medical research, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, the performing arts, wildlife and ecology. Early life Duke was born in New York City, the only child of tobacco and hydroelectric power tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of William Patterson Inman. At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter, along with $17 million in two separate clauses of the will, to The Duke Endowment he had created in 1924. The total value of the estate was estimated variously at $60 million to $100 million (equivalent to $ million to $ billion in ), the majority derived from J.B. Duke's holdings in the American Tobacco Company and the precursor of the Duke Power Company. Duke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, her father's estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Due to ambiguity in James Duke's will, a lawsuit was filed in 1927 to prevent auctions and outright sales of real estate he had owned; in effect, Doris Duke successfully sued her mother and other executors to prevent the sales. One of the pieces of real estate in question was a Manhattan mansion at 1 East 78th Street which later became the home of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.  Adult life  When she turned 18, in 1930, the tall Duke was presented to society as a debutante, at a ball at Rough Point, the family residence in Newport, Rhode Island. She received large bequests from her father's will when she turned 21, 25, and 30; she was sometimes referred to as the \\"world's richest girl.\\" Her mother died in 1962, leaving her jewelry and a coat. When Duke came of age, she used her wealth to pursue a variety of interests, including extensive world travel and the arts. During World War II, she worked in a canteen for sailors in Egypt, taking a salary of one dollar a year. She spoke French fluently. In 1945, Duke began a short- lived career as a foreign correspondent for the International News Service, reporting from different cities across the war-ravaged Europe. After the war, she moved to Paris and wrote for the magazine Harper's Bazaar. While living in Hawaii, Duke became the first non-Hawaiian woman to take up competitive surfing under the tutelage of surfing champion and Olympic swimmer Duke Kahanamoku and his brothers. A lover of animals, in particular her dogs and pet camels, in her later years Duke became a wildlife refuge supporter. Duke's interest in horticulture led to a friendship with Pulitzer Prize-winning author and scientific farmer Louis Bromfield, who operated Malabar Farm, his country home in Lucas, Ohio in Richland County. Today, his farm is part of Malabar Farm State Park, made possible by a donation from Duke that helped purchase the property after Bromfield's death. A section of woods there is dedicated to her and bears her name. At age 46, Duke started to create Duke Gardens, an exotic public-display garden, to honor her father James Buchanan Duke. She extended new greenhouses from the Horace Trumbauer conservatory at her home in Duke Farms, New Jersey. Each of the eleven interconnected gardens was a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period, inspired by DuPont's Longwood Gardens. She designed the architectural, artistic and botanical elements of the displays based on observations from her extensive international travels. She also labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days. Display construction began in 1958. Duke had learned to play the piano at an early age and developed a lifelong appreciation of jazz and befriended jazz musicians. She also liked gospel music and sang in a gospel choir. Duke cultivated an extensive art collection, principally of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. In 2014, sixty objects from her collection (including ceramics, textiles, paintings, tile panels, and full-scale architectural elements) were displayed temporarily at the University of Michigan Museum of Art in the exhibition \\"Doris Duke's Shangri La: Architecture, Landscape, and Islamic Art,\\" organized by the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art. The collection is on public display at her former home in Honolulu, Hawaii, now the Museum of Islamic Art, Culture, & Design. =Homes= Duke created the Italian Garden to showcase sculptures that her father had collected, such as this replica of Canova's Three Graces Duke acquired a number of homes. Her principal residence and official domicile was Duke Farms, her father's 2,700 acre (11 km2) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Here she created Duke Gardens, a public indoor botanical display that was among the largest in America. Duke's other residences were private during her lifetime: she spent summer weekends working on her Newport Restoration Foundation projects while staying at Rough Point, the 49-room English manor-style mansion that she inherited in Newport, Rhode Island. Winters were spent at an estate she built in the 1930s and named \\"Shangri La\\" in Honolulu, Hawaii; and at \\"Falcon Lair\\" in Beverly Hills, California, once the home of Rudolph Valentino. She also maintained two apartments in Manhattan: a nine-room penthouse with a veranda at 475 Park Avenue that was later owned by journalist Cindy Adams; and another apartment near Times Square that she used exclusively as an office for the management of her financial affairs. She purchased her own Boeing 737 jet and redecorated the interior to travel between homes and on her trips to collect art and plants. The plane included a bedroom decorated to resemble a bedroom in a real house. Doris Duke had difficulty remaining in one place, and whenever she arrived somewhere, she had the desire to go somewhere else. Duke was a hands-on homeowner, climbing a ladder to a three-story scaffolding to clean tile murals in the courtyard of Shangri La, and working side by side with her gardeners at Duke Farms. Three of Duke's residences are currently managed by subsidiaries of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and allow limited public access. Duke Farms in New Jersey is managed by the Duke Farms Foundation; a video tour of the former Duke Gardens is available. Rough Point was deeded to the Newport Restoration Foundation in 1999 and opened to the public in 2000. Tours are limited to 12 people. Shangri-La is operated by the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art; small personal tours and an online virtual tour are available. Death of Eduardo Tirella In 1966, Eduardo Tirella, curator of Duke's art holdings for the previous decade, decided to leave for a career in Hollywood as a production designer. He flew to Newport, where she was staying at Rough Point, on October 6, to collect his belongings and let Duke know that he was leaving her employ. His friends who also knew her had warned him she would not take it well, and the following afternoon the estate's staff overheard the two having a loud and lengthy argument before they got into a rented Dodge Polara to leave. Tirella, who had been driving, got out at the gate to open it, leaving the engine running but with the parking brake engaged and the transmission in park. Duke moved from the passenger seat to the driver's seat in order, she said later, to drive the car forward and pick up Tirella once the gate was open. In order to do so she released the parking brake and shifted into drive, but instead of putting her foot on the brake pedal she hit the gas. The vehicle, she told police later, pinned Tirella against the still-opening gates, knocked them over and then struck a tree across Bellevue Avenue. Tirella was found trapped under the car and was pronounced dead of serious injuries soon after. After a brief investigation, the Newport police ruled the death was accidental. Tirella's family sued and won $75,000 ($ in today's dollars), divided among his eight siblings, when Duke was found negligent after a trial five years later. Later biographies and her obituaries repeated the official finding. In 2020, Peter Lance, a Newport native who had begun his journalism career at Newport Daily News shortly after the incident, reinvestigated the case in a Vanity Fair article. He found initially that the police file on the case and the transcripts of the wrongful death suit brought by Tirella's family were missing from archives where they would normally be kept, but was able to find some of those documents later. They showed that the investigation into Duke had been cursory and compromised by conflicts of interest (shortly before the medical examiner arrived at the hospital, for instance, Duke had hired him as her personal physician, meaning anything she told him was protected by doctor-patient privilege). What Lance was able to find showed that Duke's account of the incident had changed and was inconsistent with the evidence. The parking brake could not have been released the way she said she had, and all Tirella's injuries were above his waist, which suggests he was not trapped between the car and the gates when it broke through. The deep grooves left by the Polara's rear tires in the gravel suggested considerably more acceleration than what might have resulted from an accidental depression of the gas pedal. Lance, and several other experts who reviewed the evidence, concluded that it was far more likely that Duke had deliberately run Tirella over out of rage at his decision to leave her for Hollywood. Shortly after the case was closed, Duke began making considerable philanthropic contributions to the city, including the repair of Cliff Walk around her estate, previously a source of friction between her and the city when her dogs had attacked tourists, and $10,000 to the hospital she had been taken to the night of the accident. Within months she established the Newport Restoration Foundation, which has since renovated 84 of the city's colonial era buildings. The police chief retired to Florida within a year and bought two condominiums for himself; he was succeeded as chief by the detective who had investigated the incident, instead of his boss who was seen as next in line. Belief persists today in Newport that there was a coverup facilitated by Duke \\"blood money\\". Personal life Duke married twice, the first time in 1935 to James H. R. Cromwell, the son of Eva Stotesbury and stepson of wealthy financier Edward T. Stotesbury. Cromwell, a New Deal advocate like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who was born prematurely on July 13, 1940, in Hawaii and died on the following day. They divorced in 1943. On September 1, 1947, while in Paris, Duke became the third wife of Porfirio Rubirosa, a diplomat from the Dominican Republic. She reportedly paid his second wife, actress Danielle Darrieux, $1 million to agree to an uncontested divorce. Because of her great wealth, Duke's marriage to Rubirosa attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department, which cautioned her against using her money to promote a political agenda. Further, there was concern that in the event of her death, a foreign government could gain too much leverage. Therefore, Rubirosa had to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. During the marriage though, she gave Rubirosa several million dollars in gifts, including a stable of polo ponies, sports cars, a converted B-25 bomber, and, in the divorce settlement, a 17th-century house in Paris. She reportedly had numerous affairs, with, among others, Duke Kahanamoku, Errol Flynn, Alec Cunningham- Reid, General George S. Patton, Joe Castro and Louis Bromfield. Duke posted a bail of $5,000,000 for her friend, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos after the latter was arrested for racketeering. Death In 1992, at the age of 79, Duke had a facelift. She began trying to walk while she was still heavily medicated and fell, breaking her hip. In January 1993, she underwent surgery for a knee replacement. She was hospitalized from February 2 to April 15. She underwent a second knee surgery in July of that year. A day after returning home from this second surgery, she suffered a severe stroke. Doris Duke died at her Falcon's Lair home on October 28, 1993, at the age of 80. The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, according to a spokesman. Duke was cremated 24 hours after her death and her executor, Bernard Lafferty, scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean as her last will specified. Net worth When Doris' father died, he left a fortune valued at $100 million, with the largest share going to Duke and her mother. Nanaline was a shrewd businesswoman, often compared to Hetty Green, and when she died in 1962, she left her daughter an estate then estimated to be worth $250 million. Duke also owned numerous shares in big-name companies, such as General Motors, and had a large financial team of bankers and accountants to manage her holdings (since, despite rumors, Duke had little to no interest in money matters). In addition, Duke had a collection of artwork, which was said to include works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Monet, as well as her valuable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asia art and furniture. Also in Duke's collection were over 2,000 bottles of rare wine (worth over $5 million) and the extraordinary Duke collection of fine jewels. Her total net worth, including all property, was valued at $5.3 billion. =Philanthropy= Duke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her. In 1958, she established the Duke Gardens Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens \\"reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.\\". Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy over the decision by the trustees of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to close them on May 25, 2008. In 1968, Duke created the Newport Restoration Foundation with the goal of preserving more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, with whom Duke was friends with, was the vice president and publicly supported the foundation. Duke was also friends with artist Andy Warhol. Historic properties include Rough Point, Samuel Whitehorne House, Prescott Farm, the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, visited by the Beatles in 1968. Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the Walters Art Museum of Baltimore. Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated $2 million to Duke University to be used for AIDS research. Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity. After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, Shangri La, Rough Point, and Duke Farms. =Trusts and wills= Duke was the life beneficiary of two trusts created by her father, James Buchanan Duke, in 1917 and 1924. The income from the trusts was payable to any children after her death. In 1988, at the age of 75, Duke legally adopted a woman named Chandi Heffner, then a 35-year-old Hare Krishna devotee and sister of the third wife of billionaire Nelson Peltz. Duke initially maintained that Heffner was the reincarnation of her only biological child Arden, who died soon after birth in 1940. The two women had a falling out, and the final version of Duke's will specified that she did not wish Heffner to benefit from her father's trusts; she also negated the adoption. Despite the negation, after Duke's death, the estate's trustees settled a lawsuit brought by Heffner for $65 million. In her final will, Duke left virtually all of her fortune to several existing and new charitable foundations. She appointed her butler, Bernard Lafferty, as executor of her estate. Lafferty appointed the U. S. Trust company as corporate co-executor. Lafferty and Duke's friend Marion Oates Charles were named as her trustees. However a number of lawsuits were filed against the will. At death, Duke's fortune was estimated at upwards of $1.2 billion. The best-known lawsuit was initiated by Harry Demopoulos. In an earlier will, Demopoulos had been named executor and challenged Lafferty's appointment. Demopolous argued that Lafferty and his lawyers had cajoled a sick, sedated old woman into giving him control of her estate. Even more sensational accusations were made by a nurse, Tammy Payette, who contended that Lafferty and a prominent Beverly Hills physician, Dr. Charles Kivowitz, had conspired to hasten Duke's death with morphine and Demerol. In 1996, the year Lafferty died, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office ruled there was no firm evidence of foul play. Duke University also filed suit, claiming entitlement to a larger share of the Duke assets than the $10 million provided in the will (although Duke's will also stated that any beneficiary who disputed its provisions should receive nothing). Litigation involving 40 lawyers at 10 different law firms tied up the Duke estate for nearly three years. New York courts ultimately removed Lafferty for using estate funds for his own support and US Trust for failing \\"to do anything to stop him.\\" The Surrogate Court of Manhattan overrode Duke's will and appointed new trustees from among those who had challenged it: Harry Demopoulos; J. Carter Brown (later also involved in overturning the will of Albert C. Barnes); Marion Oates Charles, the sole trustee from Duke's last will; James Gill, a lawyer; Nannerl O. Keohane, president of Duke University; and John J. Mack, president of Morgan Stanley. The fees for their lawsuits exceeded $10 million, and were paid by the Duke estate. These trustees now control all assets of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which Doris Duke directed should support medical research, anti-vivisectionism, prevention of cruelty to children and animals, performance arts, wildlife, and ecology. The DDCF also controls funding for the three separate foundations created to operate Duke's former homes: the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art, Duke Farms and Newport Restoration Foundation. The trustees have progressively reduced funding for these foundations, stating that Doris Duke's own works are \\"perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption.\\" Recently, these foundations have sold some assets and have closed Duke Gardens. Christie's, New York, published a heavily illustrated catalog of over 600 pages for its auction of \\"The Doris Duke Collection, sold to benefit the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation\\" which was held in New York City over three days in 2004. The last living heirs to Duke's vast Industrial Age fortune are twins Georgia Inman and Walker ‚ÄúPatterson‚Äù Inman III, the children of Walker Inman Jr., Duke's nephew. Their childhood has been documented as a tragedy of grotesque neglect, abuse, parental violence and addiction.

It is green, with bright splashes of various colours. Its name is due to the area of red plumage commonly found at its throat. The hypothetical Martinique amazon (\\"A. martinicana\\"), known only from old descriptions, was said to look quite similar and may have been a related or even the same species. It was said to occur one major island to the south of Dominica. Description The red-necked amazon gets its name because of its orange and reddish feathers found on its lower throat. The bird also sometimes has blue feathers on its forehead, around the eyes and its head. Although, the blue feathers verge to wither away to gray feathers at its upper breast. The rest of its body is covered in deep bottle green feathers and a wide band of yellow color runs down to the tip of its tail. The beak and feet are both grey. These birds average about 40 cm in length and can weigh between 550 and 650 g. Range, habitat The red-necked amazon is only found in the Caribbean island of Dominica. It lives throughout Montane and sub-montane forests of Morne Diablotion and Northern and Central Forest Reserves and sequestered State Lands that are above 1500 ft elevation. This species also lives at subordinate altitudes in agricultural regions and peripheral forests all the way to the northwest and northeast coasts. The Jacos primarily eat flowers, sprouts, seeds and fruits of the rainforest trees and plants, citrus and pastoral crops. With a population of less than 400 birds, this beautiful parrot is very endangered due to its habitat destruction and hunting. Social organisation The species is highly social and flies in groups of 30 or more during the non-breeding season. Exceedingly territorial during nesting, breeding inaugurates from January to March, with fledging from May to July. Red-necked amazon pairs are loyal to each other and tend to stay at the same nesting site for many years. Other than early morning and afternoon calls, these birds are fairly quiet and difficult to detect in the wild because they are well cloaked by their fluff. They are dexterous climbing birds and are prone to migrate seasonally, provisional on food supplies. Call Red-necked amazons are most vigorous and animated in the early mornings from dawn to around 10 am, and again in the late afternoon after about 4 pm. During those periods they are most communicative. The cry of the red-necked amazon is rough with a high-pitched squawk and usually uses two-syllable notes. Threats Red-necked amazon numbers have been diminishing through the 20th Century, primarily as a consequence of hunting for food and, to a lesser degree, the pet trade, and, more recently, by the clearing of forests for agriculture. Luckily, hunting and illegal trade no longer pose a serious threat, and this buoyant bird has made a notable recovery, both in range extension and overall population size, after its population size decreased to an all-time low of as few as 150 individuals in 1980. Through substantial conservation action, this species has recovered to a far healthier 750 to 800 birds (2003 population estimates). Due to this, the species seems to have successfully survived Hurricane Maria in 2017, which devastated the entirety of Dominica; all of the captive birds were safe after the hurricane, and several wild birds were also sighted flying around the island.

The heating of an allyl vinyl ether will initiate a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to give a Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated carbonyl. The Claisen rearrangement Discovered in 1912, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. Many reviews have been written.Hiersemann, M.; Nubbemeyer, U. (2007) The Claisen Rearrangement. Wiley-VCH. Mechanism The Claisen rearrangement is an exothermic, concerted (bond cleavage and recombination) pericyclic reaction. Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules show a suprafacial, stereospecific reaction pathway. The kinetics are of the first order and the whole transformation proceeds through a highly ordered cyclic transition state and is intramolecular. Crossover experiments eliminate the possibility of the rearrangement occurring via an intermolecular reaction mechanism and are consistent with an intramolecular process. There are substantial solvent effects observed in the Claisen rearrangement, where polar solvents tend to accelerate the reaction to a greater extent. Hydrogen-bonding solvents gave the highest rate constants. For example, ethanol/water solvent mixtures give rate constants 10-fold higher than sulfolane. Trivalent organoaluminium reagents, such as trimethylaluminium, have been shown to accelerate this reaction. Variations =Aromatic Claisen rearrangement= The first reported Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl phenyl ether to intermediate 1, which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho- substituted phenol. The Claisen rearrangement Meta-substitution affects the regioselectivity of this rearrangement. For example, electron withdrawing groups (such as bromide) at the meta-position direct the rearrangement to the ortho-position (71% ortho product), while electron donating groups (such as methoxy), direct rearrangement to the para-position (69% para product). Additionally, presence of ortho substituents exclusively leads to para- substituted rearrangement products (tandem Claisen and Cope rearrangement). Aromatic Claisen with ortho-position substituted If an aldehyde or carboxylic acid occupies the ortho or para positions, the allyl side-chain displaces the group, releasing it as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively. =Bellus‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement= The Bellus‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement is the reaction of allylic ethers, amines, and thioethers with ketenes to give Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated esters, amides, and thioesters. This transformation was serendipitously observed by Bellus in 1979 through their synthesis of a key intermediate of an insecticide, pyrethroid. Halogen substituted ketenes (R1, R2) are often used in this reaction for their high electrophilicity. Numerous reductive methods for the removal of the resulting Œ±-haloesters, amides and thioesters have been developed. The Bellus-Claisen offers synthetic chemists a unique opportunity for ring expansion strategies. The Bellus‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement =Eschenmoser‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement= The Eschenmoser‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement proceeds by heating allylic alcohols in the presence of N,N-dimethylacetamide dimethyl acetal to form a Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated amide. This was developed by Albert Eschenmoser in 1964. Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement was used as a key step in the total synthesis of morphine. The Eschenmoser- Claisen rearrangement Mechanism: Eschenmoser‚ÄìClaisen mechanism =Ireland‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement= The Ireland‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic carboxylate with a strong base (such as lithium diisopropylamide) to give a Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The rearrangement proceeds via silylketene acetal, which is formed by trapping the lithium enolate with chlorotrimethylsilane. Like the Bellus-Claisen (above), Ireland- Claisen rearrangement can take place at room temperature and above. The E- and Z-configured silylketene acetals lead to anti and syn rearranged products, respectively. There are numerous examples of enantioselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangements found in literature to include chiral boron reagents and the use of chiral auxiliaries. The Ireland‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement = Johnson‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement= The Johnson‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic alcohol with an orthoester to yield a ester. Weak acids, such as propionic acid, have been used to catalyze this reaction. This rearrangement often requires high temperatures (100‚Äì200 ¬∞C) and can take anywhere from 10 to 120 hours to complete. However, microwave assisted heating in the presence of KSF-clay or propionic acid have demonstrated dramatic increases in reaction rate and yields. The Johnson‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement Mechanism: Johnson‚ÄìClaisen mechanism =Photo-Claisen rearrangement= The Claisen rearrangement of aryl ethers can also be performed as a photochemical reaction. In addition to the traditional ortho product obtained under thermal conditions (the [3,3] rearrangement product), the photochemical variation also gives the para product ([3,5] product), alternate isomers of the allyl group (for example, [1,3] and [1,5] products), and simple loss of the ether group, and even can rearrange alkyl ethers in addition to allyl ethers. The photochemical reaction occurs via a stepwise process of radical-cleavage followed by bond-formation rather than as a concerted pericyclic reaction, which therefore allows the opportunity for the greater variety of possible substrates and product isomers. The [1,3] and [1,5] results of the photo- Claisen rearrangement are analogous to the photo-Fries rearrangement of aryl esters and related acyl compounds. Hetero-Claisens =Aza‚ÄìClaisen= An iminium can serve as one of the pi-bonded moieties in the rearrangement. An example of the Aza‚ÄìClaisen rearrangement =Chromium oxidation= Chromium can oxidize allylic alcohols to Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones on the opposite side of the unsaturated bond from the alcohol. This is via a concerted hetero-Claisen reaction, although there are mechanistic differences since the chromium atom has access to d-orbitals which allow the reaction under a less constrained set of geometries. center = Chen‚ÄìMapp reaction = The Chen‚ÄìMapp reaction, also known as the [3,3]-phosphorimidate rearrangement or Staudinger‚ÄìClaisen reaction, installs a phosphite in the place of an alcohol and takes advantage of the Staudinger reduction to convert this to an imine. The subsequent Claisen is driven by the fact that a P=O double bond is more energetically favorable than a P=N double bond. The Mapp reaction =Overman rearrangement= The Overman rearrangement (named after Larry Overman) is a Claisen rearrangement of allylic trichloroacetimidates to allylic trichloroacetamides. The Overman rearrangement The Overman rearrangement is applicable to the synthesis of vicinol diamino compounds from 1,2-vicinal allylic diols. =Zwitterionic Claisen rearrangement= Unlike typical Claisen rearrangements which require heating, zwitterionic Claisen rearrangements take place at or below room temperature. The acyl ammonium ions are highly selective for Z-enolates under mild conditions. The zwitterionic Claisen rearrangement In nature The enzyme chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) catalyzes the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, a key intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway towards the synthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine.

He discovered molecular mechanisms of infectious diseases, like antibiotic resistance and sounded the alarm for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. He championed the benefits of microorganisms. He formulated molecular Koch's postulates, which have guided the study of the microbial determinants of infectious diseases since the late 1980s.Falkow S (1988). \\"Molecular Koch's postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity.\\" Rev Infect Dis 10(Suppl 2):S274-S276. Early life and education Falkow was born into a Yiddish- speaking household in Albany, New York. His father was a shoe salesman and had immigrated from Soviet Kiev, Ukraine.Sandeep Ravindran. Curious About Everything Stanford Alumni Magazine, September/October 2011, retrieved June 22 2018 His mother came from a family of Jewish immigrants from Poland. She \\"rented several of their bedrooms and later opened a corset shop\\". Falkow attributed his early interest in microbiology to reading Microbe Hunters in 1943, when he was 11 years old, which he found at the public library after the family had moved to Newport, Rhode Island. The book is a dramatization of microbiological research written by American microbiologist Paul de Kruif. Because of poor grades until his senior year of high school, an adviser suggested military rather than college. Career Falkow enrolled in biology at the University of Maine, because of their microbiology department. During the summers he worked in pathology at the hospital in Newport, staining slides and assisting in autopsies. He graduated in 1955. Before he even started graduate school at University of Michigan, he developed acute anxiety. He avoided movie theaters between 1956 and 1961 and dropped out of University, because of recurring panic attacks. He switched to Brown University and graduated with a PhD in 1961. He became a staff member at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the Department of Bacterial Immunology, where he was eventually named the assistant chief of the department.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Stanley Falkow, Ph.D. Retrieved on July 4, 2007 His early work in the 1960s focused on the genetic mechanisms, which enable bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. He showed that organisms, such as shigella, can possess gene fragments called plasmids which exist apart from the bacterial chromosome, and that they carry specialized information for survival. Under selective pressure from antibiotics, one species of bacteria can pass its plasmids to another directly without mating, thereby preserving its own specialized survival genes. In 1966, he joined Georgetown University School of Medicine as a professor of microbiology. He later moved to Seattle to join the faculty of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Here he described how meningitis and gonorrhea organisms acquire plasmids to become resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics. In the 1970s, Falkow shifted his focus to the infection process. During this period, he showed that a life- threatening diarrhea prevalent in many developing countries is caused by a sub-type of E. coli. He also co-authored (with Royston C. Clowes, Stanley N. Cohen, Roy Curtiss III, Naomi Datta and Richard Novick) a proposal for uniform nomenclature for bacterial plasmids.Richard P. Novick et al., \\"Uniform Nomenclature for Bacterial Plasmids: A Proposal\\", Bacteriol. Rev., March 1976, pp. 168-189.

His brother, Ben Weese, is also a renowned architect. Early life and education Harry Weese grew up in this house in Kenilworth, Illinois. Harry Mohr Weese was born on June 30, 1915 in Evanston, Illinois as the first son of Harry E. and Marjorie Weese. His father was an Episcopalian, and his mother was a Presbyterian. In 1919, the family moved to a house in Kenilworth, Illinois, where Harry would be raised. Weese was enrolled in the progressive Joseph Sears School in 1919. By 1925, Weese decided that he wanted to be either an artist or an architect. After graduating from New Trier High School, Weese enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1933 to earn a Bachelor in Architecture degree. Weese also took architecture classes at Yale University starting in 1936. Weese studied under Alvar Aalto at MIT, and fraternized with classmates I.M. Pei and Eero Saarinen. As his schooling was at the height of the Great Depression, Weese avoided studying expensive historical revival styles in favor of more-affordable modern styles. In the summer of 1937, Weese toured northern Europe on a bicycle, fostering his appreciation for the modernist movement. Upon his return to the United States, Weese was offered a fellowship at the Cranbrook Academy of Art (sometimes called the \\"Scandinavian Bauhaus\\") through Eero Saarinen, whose father Eliel oversaw the school. There, he studied city planning, potter, and textiles while learning more about Modernist principles. He worked alongside other emerging Modernist designers such as Ralph Rapson, Florence Knoll, and Charles Eames. Career Pentagon City Station, a typical stop on the Washington Metro, considered one of the best examples of brutalist style architecture. Weese formed an architectural partnership in Chicago with classmate Benjamin Baldwin upon their graduation in 1940. He would later marry Baldwin's sister, Kitty. Following the brief partnership, Weese joined the firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM). Soon after joining, however, Weese enlisted as an engineering officer in the United States Navy for World War II. Weese moved back to Chicago after the war in 1945 and rejoined SOM. In 1947, Weese started his independent design firm, Harry Weese Associates. His first commissions, such as the Robert and Suzanne Drucker House in Wilmette, Illinois, were houses for family members and close associates. By the late 1950s, Weese began to receive major commissions. Although he continued to plan houses, Weese also built civic projects such as the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago. The Washington Metro in the District of Columbia helped Weese become the foremost designer of rail systems during the peak of his career. He subsequently was commissioned to oversee rail projects in Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Buffalo. He was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1961 and received the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1964. Weese was also well known for his firm advocacy of historic preservation, and was remembered as the architect who \\"shaped Chicago‚Äôs skyline and the way the city thought about everything from the lakefront to its treasure-trove of historical buildings\\". He led the restoration of Adler & Sullivan's Auditorium Building, and Daniel Burnham's Field Museum of Natural History and Orchestra Hall. Harry Weese & Associates received the Architecture Firm Award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1978. Weese also served as a judge for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial design competition, and helped defend fledgling architect Maya Lin's unconventional design against her critics. In the late 1970s, Weese was involved in the inception of the effort to host a 1992 World's Fair in Chicago. From the mid-1980s, Weese drank heavily and his reputation faded; he died after years of going in and out of alcohol rehabilitation and a series of disabling strokes.  Personal life  Weese's parents were Protestant Christians, but he himself was nonreligious. While being interviewed by the building committee of the Seventeenth Church of Christ, Scientist in Chicago, when asked of his religious views, he said, \\"My father was Episcopalian, my mother Presbyterian, and I‚Äôm an architect\\". Legacy In a 1998 obituary, architectural critic Herbert Muschamp wrote that \\"Mr. Weese designed a systemwide network of stations that rank among the greatest public works of this century\\", referring to his design of the Washington Metro system. Muschamp noted that the vaulted ceilings at the crossings of subway lines \\"induce an almost religious sense of awe\\". In 2007, the design of the Washington Metro's vaulted-ceiling stations was voted number 106 on the \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" list compiled by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and was the only brutalist design to win a place among the 150 selected by this public survey. In January 2014, the AIA announced that it would present its Twenty-five Year Award to the Washington Metro system for \\"an architectural design of enduring significance\\" that \\"has stood the test of time by embodying architectural excellence for 25 to 35 years\\". The announcement cited the key role of Harry Weese, who conceived and implemented a \\"common design kit-of-parts\\" which continues to guide the construction of new Metro stations over a quarter-century later.

He held the positions of Starosta of Owrucz, Crown Grand Standard- bearer, and Crown Great Guard (praefectus excubiarum seu vigiliarum). He served as a military commander and was given the nom de guerre \\"zago≈Ñczyk\\" (brave raider), but later became infamous as an outlaw. He was known for his smile and quick wit, and allegedly introduced a traditional Polish haircut which bears his name.  Military career ≈Åaszcz is alleged to have started his military career at the age of 17, serving under the famous commander Stefan Chmielecki, with whom he practiced his military skills in the Dzikie Pola. He took part in the Khotyn campaign (1621) and fought later in 1633 against Mehmed Abazi Pasha during the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1633‚Äì34), during which fame of his bravery grew. He fought during the Swedish invasion of 1626-29, and in numerous other battles against the Crimean Tatars (e.g. 1624, 1629), the rebellious Commonwealth Zaporozhian Cossacks, (e.g. at the Battle of Kumeyki in 1637), and during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. He was known as stretch tatarski (Tatar terror) and considered a successful commander. Before the Battle of Kumeyki, he brought 500 horsemen and 300 infantry to the army lines. During the campaign, field hetman Miko≈Çaj Potocki ordered ≈Åaszcz's command to provoke the Cossacks to abandon their positions and pursue him. ≈Åaszcz successfully carried out his orders, helping to bring about victory over the more numerous rebels. In 1638, he led his own command against the Cossacks and gained even greater military fame. Life as an outlaw ≈Åaszcz and his company pillaged, robbed and raped victims across various noble estates, including peasants, merchants and many others, in the Commonwealth provinces of Ukraine, Red Ruthenia, Volhynia, and Podolia. He received 236 sentences of exile (banicja) and 37 sentences of infamy (infamia). He is rumoured to have sewn them into his coat (delia). He fought with Prince Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki. He was protected from the law by the patronage of hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, because Koniecpolski admired the fact that ≈Åaszcz, an able soldier and commander, could always be counted on to fight for the Commonwealth in times of war. From a legal point of view, as a professional soldier, ≈Åaszcz was subject to military, not civil, jurisdiction. He was therefore able to enjoy the protection that Koniecpolski's status as a hetman offered him. However, when Koniecpolski died, ≈Åaszcz was attacked at his estates by Prince Wi≈õniowiecki, being forced to escape and became a true outlaw, without a home or money. He was stripped of his offices and titles, finally relying on Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dominik Zas≈Çawski to offer him refuge. Prior to his expulsion by Prince Wi≈õniowiecki, his headquarters were in Makar√≥w (Makarov) in Ukraine; after the lawful ousting by his enemies, he and his family were banished from their estates for the rest of their lives. Return and death When the Khmelnytsky Uprising began in 1648, ≈Åaszcz fought against the rebels as part of the Zas≈Çawski party. However, his enemy, Prince Wi≈õniowiecki, demanded that he leave the army camp, due to an event that took place before the Battle of Pyliavtsi. ≈Åaszcz, having 1000 men at his command, had attacked the Cossacks' camp, causing alarm and fear. He left but later fought in the defence of Lw√≥w, scoring some successes against the besieging Cossack army. The Polish lower parliamentary house (sejm) granted him a salvus conductus (safe conduct) in return for his military services; however, he only participated in the campaigns of 1648, before falling ill and dying on 15 February 1649. He was buried at the Saint Stephen Church in Krak√≥w. The church was demolished in 1802; thus, ≈Åaszcz's tomb has been lost. Family The historian Szymon Okolski wrote in his Dyaryusz that ≈Åaszcz's mother was from the house of Koraczewska. ≈Åaszcz married twice and had a daughter and two sons.

Knowing the place of the contraflexure is especially useful when designing reinforced concrete or structural steel beams and also for designing bridges. Flexural reinforcement may be reduced at this point. However, to omit reinforcement at the point of contraflexure entirely is inadvisable as the actual location is unlikely to realistically be defined with confidence. Additionally, an adequate quantity of reinforcement should extend beyond the point of contraflexure to develop bond strength and to facilitate shear force transfer.

She was one of the last two Town class cruisers, which formed the Edinburgh sub-class. Edinburgh saw a great deal of combat service during the Second World War, especially in the North Sea and the Arctic Sea, where she was sunk by torpedoes in 1942.  Construction and specifications  Edinburgh was built in Newcastle-upon-Tyne by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson, her keel laid down on 30 December 1936. She was a fast cruiser, displacing 10,635 tonnes, and with an intended sea speed of , reaching a maximum speed of thirty-three knots. The ship was heavily armed for a light cruiser, with twelve 6 inch guns, twelve (later eight) 4 inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns (along with her sister ship, the heaviest 4-in battery among all the British cruisers), sixteen 2-pounder pom pom guns, in addition to sixteen Vickers .50 machine guns. Also, she carried six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedoes in a pair of triple racks, giving the ship extra firepower. Edinburgh was designed as a very modern vessel, equipped with an impressive radar array and fire-control systems, and the ability to carry up to three Supermarine Walrus seaplanes for reconnaissance, though she usually carried only two. Her armour thickness statistics were on the main belt, and at its thinnest, the heaviest of all the British light cruisers. As with battlecruisers, light cruisers were intended to be fast enough to avoid engagements with more heavily armed opponents, negating the need for immensely thick armour like that found on the battleships of the day.  War service  convoy duty during Operation Halberd in September 1941. Edinburgh was launched on 31 March 1938, and after commissioning in July 1939 was immediately attached to the 18th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, as part of the British Home Fleet. For a time, she was assigned to patrol between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but in 1939, she was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, serving with the Humber Force. However, Edinburgh was still in the Firth of Forth when the Luftwaffe made their first raid on the naval bases at Rosyth on 16 October 1939. She sustained minor damage from the attack, but no direct hits. Between the three ships damaged in the raid including Edinburgh, the cruiser , and destroyer ; sixteen Royal Navy crew died and a further 44 were wounded, although this information was not made public at the time. She left Rosyth on 23 October, on escort duties with the convoys heading to and from Narvik, in Norway. When the armed merchant cruiser was attacked and sunk defending her convoy on 23 November, Edinburgh was among the flotilla detached to search for the German commerce raider, the battleship , responsible. However, the search was unsuccessful, and Edinburgh returned to escort duties. On 18 March 1940, she arrived in the Tyne for a lengthy refit which lasted until 28 October. After these repairs, she was re-attached to the 18th Cruiser Squadron, and on 18 November left Faslane Naval Base, on the Clyde, escorting the troop convoy WS4B as far as Freetown (now Sierra Leone) before returning to Scapa Flow on 12 November. Shortly before Christmas, Edinburgh participated in a hunt for a German surface raider that had been reported as breaking out into the North Atlantic. The force consisted of the battlecruiser , Edinburgh, and the destroyers , , , and . After spending a week at sea, including Christmas Day, after the report turned out to be false, she returned to port on New Year's Eve. During the winter of 1940, Edinburgh took part in several minor operations with the Home Fleet. She escorted convoy WS7 to the Middle East, returning to Scapa Flow on 15 April. She supported several mine-laying operations off the Danish coast, and supported Operation Claymore, the successful Allied raid on the German-occupied Lofoten Islands, on 4 May 1941. Edinburgh also played a minor role in the hunt for the in May 1941. She was on patrol in the Bay of Biscay, where she intercepted the German vessel on 22 May 1941. Edinburgh was sent to intercept Bismarck on her projected course for Brest, and then shadow her, but Bismarck never reached that area. On 1 June, she was sent to relieve the light cruiser on the Denmark Strait patrol route. After an uneventful assignment, she was ordered to cover another Middle East- bound convoy, WS 9B, and docked in Gibraltar again in early July. Later that month, Edinburgh took part in Operation Substance, arriving in Malta on 24 July. The next day, she had a close call when a German torpedo bomber attacked her. However, the ship sustained no damage, and continued on her course back to the Clyde. In August 1941, Edinburgh escorted convoy WS10 to Simonstown, South Africa, and later sailed to Malta once more, this time as part of Operation Halberd, arriving at Malta on 28 September. She returned to Gibraltar shortly afterwards, departing from there on 1 October 1941, with supplies and prisoners of war aboard, and bound once more for the Clyde. After repairs at Faslane, she rejoined the Home Fleet on Iceland Forces Patrol during November. In December 1941, she provided cover to Arctic convoys bringing aid to the Soviet Union. From January 1942, she refitted in the Tyne, until 4 March, when she was once again placed on the Iceland-Faroes patrol. She escorted two convoys to the Soviet Union (QP4 and PQ13), returning to Scapa Flow on 28 March. On 6 April, she left Scapa Flow to escort convoy PQ 14 to Murmansk. Of the 24 ships in PQ14, 16 were forced by unseasonal ice and bad weather to return to Iceland, and another was sunk by a U-boat. Edinburgh and the remaining seven vessels arrived in Murmansk on 19 April. = Sinking = Edinburghs wrecked stern after being struck by a torpedo on 30 April 1942. Edinburgh was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Stuart Bonham Carter, commanding the escort of returning Convoy QP 11: 17 ships which left Murmansk on 28 April 1942. On 30 April, the (under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Max-Martin Teichert) fired a torpedo into her starboard side, hitting her just forward of the space in which the gold was stored. The U-boat, on her fifth patrol, had been alerted to the convoy by German aerial reconnaissance.UBoat.net on Max- Martin Teichert The ship began to list heavily, but the crew reacted quickly and competently by closing watertight bulkheads, which prevented the ship from sinking immediately. Soon after, U-456 put a second torpedo into Edinburghs stern, wrecking her steering equipment and crippling her. In anticipation of Edinburghs sinking, Stoker Francis James Dawson recovered her flag, later returning it to the Leith Museum in Edinburgh. Edinburgh was taken in tow, and tried to return to Murmansk with destroyers and , and four s; , , Niger, and . Along the way she was hounded constantly by German torpedo bombers. On 2 May, as she progressed at a snail's pace under tow and her own power, she was attacked off Bear Island by three large German destroyers, , and . Edinburgh cast off the tow, so that she started to sail in circles. Although her guns were in disarray, she fired on the attacking German ships. Her second salvo straddled Hermann Schoemann, damaging her severely enough that her crew scuttled her.David Irving: Destruction of Convoy PQ-17 (1968), reprint (1989), St. Martins Mass Market Paper, Edinburghs escorts drove off Z24 and Z25, but she was struck by a torpedo that had missed another ship.Quotes Halcyon Minesweepers The torpedo struck Edinburgh amidships, exactly opposite the first torpedo hit from U-456. She was now held together only by the deck plating and keel, which was likely to fail at any time, so the crew abandoned ship. Gossamer took off 440 men and Harrier about 400. Two officers and 56 other ranks were killed in the attacks. The vigorous action of the minesweepers led the Germans to mistake the power of the force they were facing. Harrier tried to scuttle Edinburgh with 4 inch gunfire, but 20 shots did not sink her. Depth charges dropped alongside also failed. Finally, Foresight sank Edinburgh with her last torpedo (the others having been expended against the German destroyers), the torpedo being fired by David Loram (later to become Vice-Admiral Sir David Loram). Gold salvage On the return journey, Edinburgh was carrying of gold bullion back to the UK. The consignment, which had a value of about ¬£1.5 million sterling in 1942 (adjusted for inflation to 20 pounds, ¬£), was a partial payment by the USSR for the supplies of war material and military equipment from the Western Allies. In total the ship had 465 gold ingots in 93 wooden boxes stored in the bomb-room just aft of where the first torpedo - fired from U-456 - struck. Nine years after the Second World War, the British government offered the salvage rights on Edinburgh to the British salvage company, Risdon Beazley Ltd., in 1954. However the project was put on hold due to strained political relations with the Soviet Union. In 1957, the wreck was designated as a war grave, which further complicated any recovery attempts because of the limitations in salvage techniques of the era. In the late 1970s, the British government became increasingly anxious to recover the gold; not only because of its value but also because there was a growing concern that the wreck might be looted by unscrupulous salvagers or by the Soviet Union. In the early 1980s, seasoned diver Keith Jessop's company Jessop Marine, with the full guidance and support of Wharton Williams Ltd ~ a leading global diving company, and OSA ~ a specialist shipping company, won a contract to attempt a recovery. Cutting into the wreck by divers was deemed more appropriate for a war grave than the traditional 'smash and grab' explosives-oriented methods. The consortium of specialist companies for the project was then formed: Wharton Williams as managers, OSA and Decca. This group was contracted to Jessop Marine to attempt a recovery of the gold from the bomb room of the Edinburgh. In April 1981, the OSA survey ship Dammtor, with Decca surveyors embarked under the direction of former Royal Naval Survey officer John Clarke, began searching for the wreck in the Barents Sea. The area was approximately north of the coast of the USSR and Norway. After less than 48 hours, Decca discovered the wreck at , about NNE of the Soviet coast at the Kola Inlet. The depth was . Deploying a Scorpio ROV, Dammtor took detailed film of the wreck, which allowed Wharton Williams and OSA to evaluate a recovery project. The survival of her twin sister ship lying in the Thames, permitted management and later the diving team to inspect and absorb the layout of the compartments surrounding the bomb room and, not least, the scale of the challenge in cutting into the ship 800 feet down in a hostile and remote location. Later that year, on 30 August, the OSA dive-support vessel Stephaniturm steamed to the site from Peterhead, and the diving operation began in earnest under the leadership of former RN Clearance Diving Officer, Mike Stewart. On 15 September 1981, diver John Rossier found the first bar of gold. By 7 October, when bad weather finally forced the cessation of the diving operation, 431 of 465 ingots had been recovered.

Mosaic by C√©sar Manrique Early life Wind Toy by C√©sar Manrique Manrique was born in Arrecife, Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands. He fought in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer in the artillery unit on Franco's side. He attended the University of La Laguna to study architecture, but after two years he quit his studies.  Career  He moved to Madrid in 1945 and received a scholarship for the Art School of San Fernando, where he graduated as a teacher of art and painting. Between 1964 and 1966 he lived in New York City, where a grant from Nelson Rockefeller allowed him to rent his own studio. He painted many works in New York, which were exhibited in the prestigious \\"Catherine Viviano\\" gallery.Biography C√©sar Manrique Manrique returned to Lanzarote in 1966. His legacy on the island includes the art, culture and tourism centre at Jameos del Agua (1963-87); his Volcano House, Taro de Tahiche (1968); the restaurant at the restored Castillo de San Jos√© at Arrecife (1976); the visitors center at the Timanfaya National Park (1971); his Palm Grove House at Haria (1986); the Mirador del Rio (1973), and the Jardin de Cactus at Guatiza. He had a major influence on the planning regulations on Lanzarote following his recognition of its potential for tourism and lobbied successfully to encourage the sustainable development of the industry. One aspect of this is the lack of high rise hotels on the island. Those that are there are in generally keeping with the use of traditional colours in their exterior decoration.  Death  Manrique died in a car accident at Tah√≠che, Teguise, very near the Fundaci√≥n, his Lanzarote home, in 1992. He was aged 72. C√©sar Manrique Foundation One of the living spaces created within the volcanic bubble The large mural outside the house, in the fountain area The C√©sar Manrique foundation was set up in 1982 by C√©sar Manrique and a group of friends but wasn't officially opened until 1992 after Manrique died. The foundation, based at Manrique's home, following his move to a townhouse in the North of the Island, is a private, non-profit organisation set-up to allow tourists access to Manrique's home. The foundation is also an art-gallery featuring art created by Manrique himself as well as Art that he acquired during his life. The gallery includes original sketches by Pablo Picasso and Joan Mir√≥. The money the foundation takes from ticket sales goes toward raising awareness about the art of Lanzarote, as well as being used to fund the foundation's \\"artistic, cultural and environmental activities\\". Manrique's home itself is built within a 3,000 m2 lot, on the site of the Lanzarote eruptions in the 18th century, and was created upon Manrique's return from New York City in 1966. The rooms on the first floor, including the artist studios, were created with the intention of keeping with Lanzarote traditions, yet making them more modern with open spaces and large windows. The \\"ground floor\\", more appropriately titled the \\"basement\\", contains five areas situated within volcanic bubbles, the rooms bored into volcanic basalt. There is a central cave which houses a recreational area, including a swimming pool, a barbecue and a small dance floor. Once outside the main house, the visitor comes to the outside area, where there is a small square with a fountain in the middle before approaching a small caf√© area and the visitor shop. This area was once C√©sar Manrique's garage. One of the foundation's fundamental missions is to oppose the spread of high-rise concrete across the Spanish coastline and her island. The foundation recently brought attention to 24 illegally erected hotels in Lanzarote. Building craze threatens to end Lanzarote's biosphere status The Independent. 7 July 2010 .

Sometimes called the black-billed parrot, this amazon parrot is mostly green with small patches of red on the wing and sometimes flecked on the head. Its bill makes it easy to separate from most other amazons, including the yellow- billed amazon, which also lives in Jamaica. It is the smallest Amazona parrot at . Description At Vienna Zoo, Austria This parrot is smaller than the yellow-billed amazon and measures between . In males, the bill is very dark grey, almost black, becoming paler towards the base. The cere is very dark grey, as is the skin around the eyes, and the iris is dark brown. This bird's plumage is predominantly green, paler and more yellowish on the underparts. The feathers of the neck are edged with dusky black. Ear-coverts are blackish and primary coverts are red. Primaries are violet-blue and black, secondaries are blue at the tips, becoming green towards the base. The tail is mostly green and lateral feathers are marked with red, while outer feathers are margined with blue. The feet are greyish-green. Females are similar to males but with some primary coverts green instead of red. Habitat The Black- billed Amazons live in mountainous rainforest, usually limestone rainforest, feeding on fruit, seeds, and nuts, and will take cultivated fruit like mangos, papayas and cucumbers as well as wild fruits. Population The black-billed amazon was once as common as the yellow-billed amazon, but has become much rarer due to deforestation and hurricane damage fragmenting its forest, poaching for food and the pet trade in wild parrots. Call The black-billed amazon's call is bugling while in flight however, while perched it growls and rumbles. Often its calls tend to be sharp and screechy.

It is about north of Peterborough. Young's Point gets its name from the founders of the village. The Young family settled the area and build the dam and a grist mill here. References are recorded in Susanna Moodie's Book \\"Roughing it in the Bush.\\" Later generations ran a store and built and operated the steamboat service for both cargo and passenger service to nearby Stoney Lake. The Stoney Lake Navigation Company office was near the original Young family homestead where a cairn now stands at lock 27. The Lockside Trading Company is home to one of the later generation buildings. Young's Point is the home of Lock 27 of the Trent-Severn Waterway network. The lock has a lift of seven feet and was built in the early 1870s. To the south you can travel through Katchewanooka Lake towards Lakefield and on to Peterborough, to the north travel through Clear Lake and on to Stoney, Buckhorn and Pigeon Lakes and beyond. In 1887 the Old Bridge Inn was built; originally run as a general store (the Kearney Store), it's now a bed and breakfast. In addition, Young's Point is host to several recreational facilities, including, but not limited to; a golf course, several bed & breakfast hotels, marinas and restaurants. With a low population density and significant amounts of privately owned wooded land, Young's Point is also a favorite spot for residents of nearby Peterborough and Lakefield to hunt, fish, partake in off-road activities (both motorized and not) and play paintball. Young's Point is also home to Mink Island and the \\"Legend of the Wailing Woman,\\" a local legend about a previous resident (named Abbirah) of the island. A documented fact of the Ojibwe in the area, is the story of Polly Lee, a young woman who was to marry a resident of the Algoinkin neighbouring clan. As the daughter of the chieftain known as \\"Handsome Jack\\", this was a marriage of prestige and the Youngs' were invited to as the local white head of the clan. Unfortunately, she died from influenza. She is buried on a tiny island south of the hamlet, a silver cup denoted her grave. Although long gone, the cup was placed there by Jack to ensure she could get to Katchewanooka for water. Handsome Jack was commemorated by Jack's Lake north of Burleigh Falls, Ontario. Lovesick Lake in Burleigh Falls named after her love affair and Lee island south of the point where she is buried.http://lakefieldliteraryfestival.com/authors/aileen-young/ Another persistent rumour is that somewhere in Clear Lake a steamboat filled with weapons and gold sunk somewhere in the lake during a storm. To give credit to this story, some of the weapons have floated to shore over the years. Scuba divers and sailors hunt the lake. Just northwest at the bottom of Clear Lake was the South Beach Hotel, a well known local that existed for 100 years was destroyed by fire twice. Indigenous and white immigrants \\"mostly\\" congregated well here and was the home for Ice race drivers, and Sailing. The Yacht Club (SBYC) was a group of old salty-sailors that sailed Sunday races. It was also the home of the Canadian Windsurfing Championships in 1977 and 1987. Two kilometres north of the hamlet, The Canadian Shield begins.

The area also encompasses the Frankel and Opera Estates and their names have sometimes been used interchangeably to refer to the approximate same area. The planning subzone area of Siglap as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is confusingly and inaccurately referred to as the small strip of land between Victoria Junior College and Bedok South Avenue 1. It is a residential area where a majority live in landed homes such as freehold semi-detached houses and bungalows. Some of the land parcels near Siglap Centre have been redeveloped into serviced apartments and condominiums. The few Housing and Development Board flats in Siglap have been demolished in 2015 under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme. The East Coast Park is also located nearby, across the East Coast Parkway. Etymology The present area of Siglap was founded by Tok Lasam, the Chieftain (Penghulu) of Siglap. It is believed that he sailed to Singapore to escape the Dutch's attack on his Sultanate of Gowa in the 1660s. According to legend, it was said that dark thunder clouds had appeared when he first landed in the area which led to the name \\"Si-Gelap\\", derived from the Malay word ‚Äògelap‚Äô, meaning \\"darkness that conceals\\". Other versions of his arrival include him as a Minangkabau prince arriving from Sumatra to visit the Bugis settlements in the Tanjong Rhu area and ultimately establishing Siglap in 1809. According to historians, his arrival might have coincided with a rare full solar eclipse on 4 March 1821 and hence the darkness might have referred to the eclipse, rather than the dark clouds. Today the graves of Tok Lasam, his wife and his panglima (Commander) can be found near Jalan Sempadan off Upper East Coast Road. History Siglap in its early days had four kampongs, side by side each other along the coastline, they were from east to west starting from Jalan Hajijah, Kampong Hajijah, Kampong Goh Choo, Kampong Siglap and Kampong Lim Choo which ended near Siglap Road. There were also a small community of Japanese fishermen living in the area, although by the end of World War II (WWII) they had mostly vanished. The inland areas of Siglap consisted mostly of coconut and nutmeg plantations and in 1912 the Frankels bought over these plantations. The Frankels were wealthy Jewish business people originating from Lithuania and had decided to settle in Singapore after accumulating considerable wealth from their sale of rubber, bread and even furniture in Singapore and around the region. They settled in the estate and developed the area by building roads named after famous Operas of their time including Carmen and Aida, which gave rise to the name of Opera Estate as it is known today. They were influential people that welcomed distinguished guests like Albert Einstein to visit and tour the area. At the onset of WWII the Frankels left for the United States. The area as well as along the wider East Coast Stretch saw machine gun pillbox being installed by the British in anticipation of a sea-bound attack by the Japanese that never materialise. During the Japanese Occupation, the coasts of Siglap and several of the nearby hills were used as execution sites in the Sook Ching operation carried out by the Japanese to clear out anti-Japanese personnel, the operation mostly targeted the Chinese population. At the end of the war many mass graves had been found in the area, one of such place was near the junction of Bedok South Avenue 1 and Upper East Coast Road. In 1953 during the heydays of Singapore film making, Cathay-Keris Studio, one of two major film companies in Singapore, set up its studio along Jalan Keris and the surrounding area was commonly used for shooting scenes in the films. In 1962 a huge fire broke out at Kampong Siglap when firecrackers were burnt out of control and set the village ablaze. The few HDB flats built in the area were built in the aftermath of the fire to house the homeless victims. Starting from the mid-1960s, the Government embarked on an ambitious land reclamation project that saw the coastline of the entire East Coast Region shift outwards. As a result, many villagers in the area could not depend on fishing as a form of livelihood and many eventually settled away or were relocated to the neighbouring estates. The reclaimed land was then redeveloped with numerous high rise flats built and the East Coast Parkway was also constructed. The area has throughout history been home to several of Singapore's Presidents, including the first President of Singapore, Yusof Bin Ishak. Geography The terrain of Siglap can be divided into two, the inland and the outer coastal areas, with the former considerably hilly while the latter because it had mostly been reclaimed generally flat. The uneven terrain inland can be seen with the steep descent of Fidelio Street into the lower lying areas of Opera Estate at the Fidelio Circus. This has caused frequent flooding in Opera Estate in the past whenever it rained. The Government has since, starting from 1996, improved drainage and installed Singapore's first underground water detention tank to store excess rain water from the estate that would be discharged after the rain has stopped. Amenities Siglap is served by amenities like the Siglap Centre, Siglap New Market, Siglap Shopping Centre and Siglap V which are mainly found at the junction of Siglap Road and East Coast Road. East Coast Road and Upper East Coast Road are also lined with several restaurants, food courts and shops. Additionally the entire estate is dotted with shophouses for the convenience of residents. The Siglap Park Connector that leads to either the Bedok Reservoir Park or the East Coast Park runs west of the estate along the Siglap Canal. The Siglap Linear Park which is similar to a park connector cuts through the area too, running from Opera Estate to East Coast Park. Siglap is part of the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency and has one community centre, the Siglap South Community Centre, it is not to be confused with the Siglap Community Centre that serves the Bedok South Estate which is part of the East Coast Group Representation Constituency. The Wisma Mendaki Headquarters is another social facility located in the estate and serves the Malay community of the greater Geylang area too. There are various places of worship like the Bethany Evangelical Free Church, Bethesda Frankel Estate Church, Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, Ean Keng Si Buddhist Temple (Âª∂Â∫ÜÂØ∫), Kim San Temple (ÈáëÂ±±ÂØ∫ÊñóÂ±±ÂÆ´), Masjid Kampong Siglap and The Emmanuel Assembly of God Church. The area falls under the jurisdiction of the Siglap Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP), which is part of the Bedok Police Division, and the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ. =Education= There are currently several schools in the area namely (5 of which are public government schools): * Global Indian International School (GIIS) * Opera Estate Primary School (OEPS) * Rosemount International School/ Kindergarten * Sekolah Indonesia Singapura * St. Andrew's Autism School * St. Stephen's School * Tanjong Katong Girls' School (Temporary holding site) * Victoria Junior College * Victoria School Despite the lower population density of the estate because it contains mostly landed houses, as opposed to HDB flats, the area still has a rich history of having numerous schools. Excluding the schools that have operated from the holding site campus due to PRIME initiatives by the Ministry of Education at the junction of New Upper Changi Road and Bedok South Road, these are the schools which no longer operate in the estate and all but one of which are defunct: * APSN Katong School, occupied the former Siglap Primary School premises from 1992 to 2006, it is now located at New Upper Changi Road * Cheong Nam School, from 1931 to 1982, first set up at 79/ 123 Joo Chiat Place before moving in 1945 to 397A Jalan Tua Kong * CHIJ Opera Estate, from 1959 to 1989, the Red Cross Campsite now occupies the site * Opera Estate Boys' School, from 1959 to 1985, merged to form OEPS * Opera Estate Girls' School, from 1959 to 1985, merged to form OEPS * Siglap Malay School/ Siglap Indah Primary School, from 1903 to 1983, the Wisma Mendaki now occupies the site * Siglap Primary School, from 1956 to 1990, located formerly opposite St. Stephen's School * Siglap Secondary School, from 1955 to 1997, GIIS now occupies the site, it was subsequently merged with Coral Secondary School in Pasir Ris in 2017 These are the schools that have operated from the PRIME holding site campus chronologically: * Temasek Primary School, original occupants of the holding site from 1980 to 2000, stands today along Upper East Coast Road * Temasek Secondary School, original occupants of the holding site from 1980 to 1999, stands today along Upper East Coast Road * Bedok North Secondary School, original occupants of the holding site to 1981 to 1982, it has now merged with Damai Secondary School * Opera Estate Primary School, from 2001 to 2003 * Ping Yi Secondary School, from 2004 to 2005 * Pasir Ris Secondary School, from 2006 to 2007 * Tampines Secondary School, from 2008 to 2009 * St. Anthony's Canossian Secondary School, from 2011 to 2012 * Tao Nan School, from 2014 to 2015 * Tanjong Katong Girls' School, from 2017 to 2018 =Transportation= Bus Marine Parade Bus Terminal was operational from 5 July 1981 till 16 September 2001 when it was closed to make way for the construction of Victoria School. Most of the bus services that originated from the terminal were subsequently extended to Bedok Bus Interchange or the newly opened Upper East Coast Bus Terminal further east, while others were made to loop around the site or had their routes cut short. Today, there are still many bus services that ply along Upper East Coast Road and Marine Parade Road that run through the south of Siglap, in contrast, however the services cutting through the Frankel and Opera Estate areas are limited and these services are 32, 40, 42 and 401. MRT Siglap is served by the Kembangan and Bedok MRT Stations, on the East West MRT line. However, in 2023 a closer station, Siglap MRT station, on the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line, will open on Marine Parade Road near Victoria School and bring greater and faster connectivity to the city or Changi Airport. Road The East Coast Parkway (ECP) is an expressway that lies south of Siglap. Exit 7 and 8 of the expressway lead directly into the estate. The streets in Siglap (First to Fourth Street) off Siglap Road, were numerically named in 1958. Places of Historic Significance The historic site of Kubur Kassim (also known to contain Keramat Sheikh Ali), an old Malay Cemetery that is nestled in the heart of Siglap is the final resting place of many Muslims in the area in the past. Several prominent people buried there include Dr Hafeezudin Sirajuddin Moonshi founder of the first Muslim Clinic in Singapore. There are even graves allocated for the mythological Orang Bunian inside. This site coupled with Masjid Kassim located in Telok Kurau originally belonged to Ahna Mohamed Kassim bin Ally Mohamed who was endowed with it in 1921. Today the 2.02 hectares cemetery contains a distinctive yellow gate and is at least 90 over years old. Despite it being a cemetery it is entirely surrounded by landed houses and condominiums. Incidents * On 6 October 2009, Masjid Kampong Siglap was set on fire by a 14 year old boy, he was charged in the Juvenile Court with mischief by fire and two other charges of criminal trespass and fraudulent possession of another student's EZ-Link card were later added. About 150 people including the mosque preschoolers were evacuated from the mosque. The mosque sustained more than $4.5 million worth of damages as the roof and prayer room were completely gutted and the mosque had to be closed for renovations. * On 2 December 2016, two houses at Siglap Plain were damaged when a construction crane toppled on them. It was said to be lifting concrete when it toppled. No injuries were reported but a full stop work order has been issued by the Ministry of Manpower for investigations to be carried out.

During her lifetime she was known more for her beauty than her writing, and it wasn't until her son, Richard Chenevix Trench, published her diaries posthumously in 1861 that her work received notice.Chawton House Library Biography of Melesina Chenevix St. George Trench by Katharine Kittredge Biography Melesina Chenevix was born in Dublin to Philip Chenevix and Mary Elizabeth Gervais. She was orphaned before her fourth birthday and brought up by her paternal grandfather, Richard Chenevix (1698‚Äì1779), the Anglican Bishop of Waterford. The family were of Huguenot extraction. After the death of Richard Chenevix she went to live with her other grandfather, the Archdeacon Gervais. On 31 October 1786 she married Colonel Richard St George (d. 1790pers. comm. \\"5 October 1757\\", d. 1790. at ). Her husband died only four years later in Portugal, leaving one son, Charles Manners St George, who became a diplomat. Between 1799 and 1800, Melesina travelled around Europe, especially Germany. It was during these travels that she met Lord Nelson, Lady Hamilton and the cream of European society, including Rivarol, Lucien Bonaparte, and John Quincy Adams while living in Germany. She later recounted anecdotes of these meetings in her memoirs. On 3 March 1803 in Paris she married again. Her second husband was Richard Trench (1774‚Äì1860), sixth son of Frederick Trench (1724‚Äì97) and brother of Lord Ashtown. After the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens, Richard Trench was detained in France by Napoleon's armies, and in August 1805 Melesina took it upon herself to petition Napoleon in person and plead for her husband's release. Her husband was released in 1807, and the couple settled at Elm Lodge in Bursledon, Hampshire, England. Their son Francis Chenevix Trench was born in 1805. In 1807, when they were on holiday in Dublin, their son Richard Chenevix Trench was born. He went on to be the Archbishop of Dublin, renowned poet and contemporary of Tennyson. Her only daughter died a few years later, aged four.The Leadbetter Papers, a selection from the mss. and correspondence of Mary Leadbeater (1862) Diaries and correspondence She corresponded with (amongst others) Mary Leadbeater, with whom she worked to improve the lot of the peasantry at her estate at Ballybarney.The Leadbetter Papers (1862), p. 8 Melesina Trench's diaries and letters were compiled posthumously by Richard Chenevix Trench as The remains of the late Mrs. Richard Trench in 1861 with an engraving of her taken from a painting by George Romney. Another oil painting, The Evening Star by Sir Thomas Lawrence, had her as a subject, and she was reproduced in portrait miniatures; one in Paris by Jean-Baptiste Isabey and another by Hamilton that was copied by the engraver Francis Engleheart.

Instead of modulating the amplitude of two carrier waves, CAP generates a QAM signal by combining two PAM signals filtered through two filters designed so that their impulse responses form a Hilbert pair. If the impulse responses of the two filters are chosen as sine and a cosine, the only mathematical difference between QAM and CAP waveforms is that the phase of the carrier is reset at the beginning of each symbol. If the carrier frequency and symbol rates are similar, the main advantage of CAP over QAM is simpler implementation. The modulation of the baseband signal with the quadrature carriers is not necessary with CAP, because it is part of the transmit pulse. Applications CAP finds application in HDSL and in early proprietary ADSL variants. For HDSL, the American ANSI standard specifies 2B1Q rather than CAP, while the European ETSI ETR 152 and the international ITU-T G.991.2 standards specify both CAP and 2B1Q. For ADSL deployments CAP was the de facto standard up until 1996, deployed in 90 percent of ADSL installs. The standardized variants of ADSL, ANSI T1.413 Issue 2 and G.dmt, as well as the successors ADSL2, ADSL2+, VDSL2, and G.fast, do not specify CAP, but rather discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation. CAP used for ADSL divides the available frequency spectrum into three bands. The range from 0 to 4 kHz is allocated for POTS transmissions. The range of 25 kHz to 160 kHz is allocated for upstream data traffic and the range of 240 kHz to 1.5 MHz is allocated for downstream data traffic, in a frequency-division duplexing (FDD) scheme.

The river rises in the fertile Beqaa Valley, west of Baalbek, and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre. Exceeding 140 km in length, the Litani River is the longest river in Lebanon and provides an average annual flow estimated at 920 million cubic meters. The waters of the Litani both originate and flow entirely within the borders of Lebanon. It provides a major source for water supply, irrigation and hydroelectricity both within Southern Lebanon, and the country as a whole. Etymology The Litani River is named after the Canaanite deity Lotan, a seven-headed sea serpent and servant of the sea god Yam.Price, Robert. Bart Ehrman Interpreted. Pitchstone Publishing, Durham, NC. 2018, p. 153. The river that winds and coils like a serpent through the Beqaa Valley was believed to be the personification of the deity. History Historians in the past have claimed that the location of Biblical Misrephoth Maim, the place to which Joshua chased the various tribes after their defeat at the waters of Merom, was the river-mouth of the Litani River, but it is unlikely as the name Litani predates that of the Biblical story.Bekkum, Koert va. From Conquest to Coexistence: Ideology and Antiquarian Intent in the Historiography of Israel's Settlement in Canaan Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherland, 2011, p. 178. The Litani was a natural frontier that prevented the Seleucids from encroaching on the Ptolemaic dominion in the Levant.Bickerman, Elias Joseph. The Jews in the Greek Age, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998, pp. 69-70. Southern flow The southern part of the Litani River. After heading south parallel to the Syrian border, the course of the river bends dramatically westward. Near this bend, the Litani comes within five km of the Hasbani River. Qasimiyeh The portion of the river flowing west is called the Qasimiyeh. The Qasmieh-Ras-el-A√Øn region, irrigated from the river's lower reaches from main irrigation canals, to south and north, is one of the largest irrigated areas in the nation, consisting of 32.64 km¬≤, shared among 1257 irrigating farmers, who concentrate on citrus crops and bananas (Raad 2004). For the entire stretch of the Qasimiyeh as it flows into the Mediterranean Sea, the Litani River remains nearly parallel to (and about north of) the Israeli-Lebanese border. 10 km north of Tyre, the river is crossed by the ancient Leontes Bridge. In June 1941, the mouth of the river was the site of an attack by British commandos and Australian troops on Vichy French forces that became known as the Battle of the Litani River. The Litani River Dam, as seen from the highway to the west. Litani River Dam Qaraoun, an artificial lake of 12 square km, was created by the Litani River Dam, 60 meters high and 1,350 meters in length, which was completed in 1959. A spillway of 6503 meters carries the water to the underground station where generators produce a maximum of 185 megawatts of electricity, the largest hydroelectric project in Lebanon. The dam was intended eventually to provide irrigation for 310 km¬≤ of farmland in South Lebanon and 80 km¬≤ in the Beqaa Valley. The office is at the southern (dam) end of the lake on the left side. The lakeside has a hotel and a number of restaurants specializing in fresh trout.  The Litani River Authority  The Upper Litani Basin (ULB) The Litani River Authority was formed in 1954 to facilitate the integrated development of the Litani River Basin. Shortly after its formation, the authority engaged in a massive hydroelectric development project that tapped the 850 meter head potential between Lake Qaraoun and the Mediterranean. This development has brought about major hydrological changes to the Litani River Basin, where the flows from its upper reaches above Lake Qaraoun, referred to as the Upper Litani Basin, are diverted through a system of tunnels, ponds and plants, to meet the Mediterranean several kilometers north of its original natural tailwater. These changes have resulted in the effective hydrological separation between the Upper Litani Basin and the lower reaches. The advent of a protracted civil strife in the 1970s followed by a prolonged occupation in the 1980s that lasted into the 1990s, have plunged the country into disarray, freezing development and investment in infrastructure. The subsequent return to normal conditions has encouraged the river authority to initiate several major water diversion projects from the Upper Litani Basin worth hundreds of millions of US dollars.

With a radical tailless, forward-swept wing design, the aircraft appeared futuristic; however, the project was canceled before either of the two prototypes were completed. Design and development The project was originally designated XA-44 in 1945 under the old \\"attack\\" category. An unusual forward-swept wing- design powered by three J35-GE turbojets, the project was developed in parallel with Convair's XB-46. The original design had a wing with a 12¬∞ forward-sweep and a solid nose section, but when the Army Air Force revamped the advanced attack aircraft requirement into a light bomber requirement in 1946, the aircraft was redesignated XB-53 and the wing redesigned with a 30¬∞ forward-sweep and 8¬∞ dihedral that was borrowed from German wartime research, but also a glazed nose section. The swept-forward configuration would give the aircraft a greater climb rate and maneuverability.Buttler, Tony (2010).

Retrieved: 9 July 2017. Classified as a medium bomber, the XB-53 would have carried up to 12,000 pounds of bombs as well as 40 High Velocity Aerial Rockets (HVAR) mounted on underwing pylons. Convair argued for completion of the XB-46 prototype as a flying testbed, without armament and other equipment, and with the substitution of two XA-44s for the other two B-46 airframes on contract. The Air Force ratified this in June 1946 but the project did not progress, nor were additional B-46s built. The XB-53 program was reinstated in February 1949 but only for a short while.

In physics, he is known for his work on the large N expansion, a method of approximating the spectrum of atoms based on the consideration of an infinite-dimensional version of the problem, and for his work on the quantum theory of light inside dielectrics. He is known to a wider audience through his books for the general public, five of which have been New York Times best-sellers, including The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives, which was chosen as a New York Times notable book, and short-listed for the Royal Society Science Book Prize; The Grand Design, co-authored with Stephen Hawking, which argues that invoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the universe; War of the Worldviews, co-authored with Deepak Chopra; and Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior, which won the 2013 PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award. He is also known through his public lectures and media appearances on programs ranging from Morning Joe to Through the Wormhole, and for debating Deepak Chopra on ABC's Nightline. Biography Mlodinow was born in Chicago, Illinois, of parents who were both Holocaust survivors. His father, who spent more than a year in the Buchenwald concentration camp, had been a leader in the Jewish resistance in his hometown of Czƒôstochowa, in Nazi Germany-occupied Poland. As a child, Mlodinow was interested in both mathematics and chemistry, and while in high school was tutored in organic chemistry by a professor from the University of Illinois. As recounted in his book Feynman's Rainbow, his interest turned to physics during a semester he took off from college to spend on a kibbutz in Israel, during which he had little to do at night besides reading The Feynman Lectures on Physics, which was one of the few English books he found in the kibbutz library. Mlodinow completed his doctorate at the University of California, Berkeley. It was in that PhD dissertation that he developed a new type of perturbation theory for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, based upon solving the problem in infinite dimensions, and then correcting for the fact that we live in three. The method has become the basis of the 1/d expansion used by theoretical chemists. He has also done pioneering and innovative work in the quantum theory of nonlinear optics. The central problem of quantum nonlinear optics is how to quantize a dielectric that, as well as the usual homogeneities and anisotropy, can also have nonlinearities and dispersion, and earlier attempts in this direction, while incorporating the known linear theory, had not fully reproduced the nonlinear equations. In 1981, Mlodinow joined the faculty at Caltech. Later, he was named an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow and worked at the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich, Germany. In 1986, Mlodinow left full-time academia to begin a writing career. In addition to his books, he wrote many episodes for a number of television series including Star Trek: The Next Generation and MacGyver, created computer games with director Steven Spielberg and actor Robin Williams, and wrote the screenplay for the 2009 film Beyond the Horizon. He also continued to conduct research in theoretical physics, and again joined the faculty of Caltech in 2005, leaving in 2013. His latest work in physics concerns the arrow of time, quantum decoherence, and the relation between discrete quantum random walks and the relativistic equations of quantum theory.Point of Inquiry host Josh Zepps interviews Mlodinow - CFI Summit - 2013 Works *Elastic: Flexible Thinking in a Time of Change (2018) () A new look at the neuroscience of change‚Äîand how elastic thinking can help us thrive in a world changing faster than ever before. * The Upright Thinkers: The Human Journey from Living in Trees to Understanding the Cosmos (2015) () A history of human progress, from our time on the African savannah through the invention of modern quantum physics.. *Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior (2012) () Describes how things that we think are conscious, freely made choices, are in fact governed by our subconscious. *The War of the Worldviews (2011) () with Deepak Chopra.

A member of the FOX protein family, FOXP3 appears to function as a master regulator of the regulatory pathway in the development and function of regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells generally turn the immune response down. In cancer, an excess of regulatory T cell activity can prevent the immune system from destroying cancer cells. In autoimmune disease, a deficiency of regulatory T cell activity can allow other autoimmune cells to attack the body's own tissues. While the precise control mechanism has not yet been established, FOX proteins belong to the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators and are presumed to exert control via similar DNA binding interactions during transcription. In regulatory T cell model systems, the FOXP3 transcription factor occupies the promoters for genes involved in regulatory T-cell function, and may inhibit transcription of key genes following stimulation of T cell receptors.  Structure  The human FOXP3 genes contain 11 coding exons. Exon-intron boundaries are identical across the coding regions of the mouse and human genes. By genomic sequence analysis, the FOXP3 gene maps to the p arm of the X chromosome (specifically, Xp11.23).  Physiology  Foxp3 is a specific marker of natural T regulatory cells (nTregs, a lineage of T cells) and adaptive/induced T regulatory cells (a/iTregs), also identified by other less specific markers such as CD25 or CD45RB. In animal studies, Tregs that express Foxp3 are critical in the transfer of immune tolerance, especially self-tolerance. The induction or administration of Foxp3 positive T cells has, in animal studies, led to marked reductions in (autoimmune) disease severity in models of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroiditis and renal disease. Human trials using regulatory T cells to treat graft-versus-host disease have shown efficacy. Further work has shown that T cells are more plastic in nature than originally thought. This means that the use of regulatory T cells in therapy may be risky, as the T regulatory cell transferred to the patient may change into T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are pro-inflammatory rather than regulatory cells. Th17 cells are proinflammatory and are produced under similar environments as a/iTregs. Th17 cells are produced under the influence of TGF-Œ≤ and IL-6 (or IL-21), whereas a/iTregs are produced under the influence of solely TGF-Œ≤, so the difference between a proinflammatory and a pro-regulatory scenario is the presence of a single interleukin. IL-6 or IL-21 is being debated by immunology laboratories as the definitive signaling molecule. Murine studies point to IL-6 whereas human studies have shown IL-21. Foxp3 is the major transcription factor controlling T-regulatory cells (Treg or CD4+ cells). CD4+ cells are leukocytes responsible for protecting animals from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Defects in this gene's ability to function can cause IPEX syndrome (IPEX), also known as X-linked autoimmunity-immunodeficiency syndrome as well as numerous cancers. While CD4+ cells are heavily regulated and require multiple transcription factors such as STAT-5 and AhR in order to become active and function properly, Foxp3 has been identified as the master regulator for Treg lineage. Foxp3 can either act as a transcriptional activator or suppressor depending on what specific transcriptional factors such as deacetylases and histone acetylases are acting on it. The Foxp3 gene is also known to convert na√Øve T-cells to Treg cells, which are capable of an in vivo and in vitro suppressive capabilities suggesting that Foxp3 is capable of regulating the expression of suppression- mediating molecules. Clarifying the gene targets of Foxp3 could be crucial to the comprehension of the suppressive abilities of Treg cells.  Pathophysiology  In human disease, alterations in numbers of regulatory T cells ‚Äì and in particular those that express Foxp3 ‚Äì are found in a number of disease states. For example, patients with tumors have a local relative excess of Foxp3 positive T cells which inhibits the body's ability to suppress the formation of cancerous cells. Conversely, patients with an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have a relative dysfunction of Foxp3 positive cells. The Foxp3 gene is also mutated in IPEX syndrome (Immunodysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, and Enteropathy, X-linked). Many patients with IPEX have mutations in the DNA-binding forkhead domain of FOXP3. In mice, a Foxp3 mutation (a frameshift mutation that result in protein lacking the forkhead domain) is responsible for 'Scurfy', an X-linked recessive mouse mutant that results in lethality in hemizygous males 16 to 25 days after birth. These mice have overproliferation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, extensive multiorgan infiltration, and elevation of numerous cytokines. This phenotype is similar to those that lack expression of CTLA-4, TGF-Œ≤, human disease IPEX, or deletion of the Foxp3 gene in mice (\\"scurfy mice\\"). The pathology observed in scurfy mice seems to result from an inability to properly regulate CD4+ T-cell activity. In mice overexpressing the Foxp3 gene, fewer T cells are observed. The remaining T cells have poor proliferative and cytolytic responses and poor interleukin-2 production, although thymic development appears normal. Histologic analysis indicates that peripheral lymphoid organs, particularly lymph nodes, lack the proper number of cells.  Role in cancer  In addition to FoxP3's role in regulatory T cell differentiation, multiple lines of evidence have indicated that FoxP3 play important roles in cancer development. Down-regulation of FoxP3 expression has been reported in tumour specimens derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer patients, indicating that FoxP3 is a potential tumour suppressor gene. Expression of FoxP3 was also detected in tumour specimens derived from additional cancer types, including pancreatic, melanoma, liver, bladder, thyroid, cervical cancers. However, in these reports, no corresponding normal tissues was analyzed, therefore it remained unclear whether FoxP3 is a pro- or anti-tumourigeneic molecule in these tumours. Two lines of functional evidence strongly supported that FoxP3 serves as tumour suppressive transcription factor in cancer development. First, FoxP3 represses expression of HER2, Skp2, SATB1 and MYC oncogenes and induces expression of tumour suppressor genes P21 and LATS2 in breast and prostate cancer cells. Second, over-expression of FoxP3 in melanoma, glioma, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines induces profound growth inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo. However, this hypothesis need to be further investigated in future studies. Foxp3 is a recruiter of other anti-tumor enzymes such as CD39 and CD8. The overexpression of CD39 is found in patients with multiple cancer types such as melanoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. This overexpression may be protecting tumorous cells, allowing them to create their ‚Äúescape phase‚Äù. A cancerous tumor's ‚Äúescape phase‚Äù is where the tumor grows quickly and it becomes clinically invisible by becoming independent of the extracellular matrix and creating its own immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The consequences of a cancer cell reaching the ‚Äúescape phase‚Äù is that it allows it to completely evade the immune system, which reduces the immunogenicity and ability to become clinically detected, allowing it to progress and spread throughout the body. Some cancer patients have also been known to display higher numbers of mutated CD4+ cells. These mutated cells will then produce large quantities of TGF-Œ≤ and IL-10, (a Transforming Growth Factor Œ≤ and an inhibitory cytokine respectively,) which will suppress signals to the immune system and allow for tumor escape. In one experiment a 15-mer synthetic peptide, P60, was able to inhibit Foxp3's ability to function. P60 did this by entering the cells and then binding to Foxp3, where it hinders Foxp3's ability to translocate to the nucleus. Due to this, Foxp3 could no longer properly suppress the transcription factors NF-kB and NFAT; both of which are protein complexes that regulate transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival. This would inhibit a cell's ability to perform apoptosis and stop its own cell cycle, which could potentially allow an affected cancerous cell to survive and reproduce.  Autoimmune  Mutations or disruptions of the Foxp3 regulatory pathway can lead to organ- specific autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. These mutations affect thymocytes developing within the thymus. Regulated by Foxp3, it's these thymocytes that during thymopoiesis, are transformed into mature Treg cells by the thymus. It was found that patients who have the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) possess Foxp3 mutations that affect the thymopoiesis process, preventing the proper development of Treg cells within the thymus. These malfunctioning Treg cells aren‚Äôt efficiently being regulated by its transcription factors, which cause them to attack cells that are healthy, leading to these organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Another way that Foxp3 helps keep the autoimmune system at homeostasis is through its regulation of the expression of suppression- mediating molecules. For instance, Foxp3 is able to facilitate the translocation of extracellular adenosine into the cytoplasm. It does this by recruiting CD39, a rate-limiting enzyme that's vital in tumor suppression to hydrolyze ATP to ADP in order to regulate immunosuppression on different cell populations.

Lindeman was the leisure editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, and Stutz, a disc jockey from Richmond, Virginia. Stutz and Lindeman are also known for writing Perry Como's 1959 hit, \\"I Know\\" (which reached No.47 on the U.S. Billboard chart and No.13 on the UK Singles Chart). The best known recording of \\"Little Things Mean a Lot,\\" by Kitty Kallen (Decca 9-29037), reached No.1 on the U.S. Billboard chart in 1954, and also reached No.1 on the Cash Box chart the same year. Billboard ranked it as the No. 1 song of 1954. In addition, the track climbed to the top spot in the UK Singles Chart in September of that same year. A cover of the song was done by Alma Cogan with orchestra conducted by Frank Cordell in London on May 22, 1954. Cogan's recording was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10717 and reached No. 11 in the UK.

The day-use area of the park is open daily from dawn to dusk. The park also has a camping area as well that accommodates tent camping only. Its sheer cliffs of tuff and basalt are ideal for rock climbing of all difficulty levels. Smith Rock is generally considered the birthplace of modern American sport climbing, and is host to cutting-edge climbing routes. It is popular for sport climbing, traditional climbing, multi-pitch climbing, and bouldering.  Geology  The geology of Smith Rocks is volcanic. It is made up of layers of recent basalt flows overlaying older Clarno ash and tuff formations. Approximately 30 million years ago, a large caldera was formed when overlying rock collapsed into an underground lava chamber. This created a huge amount of rock and ash debris that filled the caldera. That material solidified into rock, becoming Smith Rock tuff. Rhyolite flows intruded along faults in the Smith Rock Tuff.Paul Thornton Robinson and DH Stensland. Geologic map of the Smith Rock area, Jefferson, Deschutes, and Crook counties, Oregon. US Geological Survey, 1979 A half million years ago, basalt lava flows from nearby volcanoes covered the older tuff.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

More recently, the Crooked River cut its way through the layers of rock to create today's geographic features. Smith Rock itself is a -high ridge (above sea level) with a sheer cliff-face overlooking a bend in the Crooked River (elev. 2600 ft), making the cliffs about 600 feet high.  History  The origin of the Smith Rock name is uncertain. One story, published the Albany States Rights Democrat in 1867, states that Smith Rock was named after John Smith, who was Linn County Sheriff and an Oregon state legislator in the 1850s and 1860s. The newspaper article credits Smith with \\"discovering\\" the rock. Another story claims the rock was named after a soldier named Smith who fell to his death from the rock in 1863 while his unit was camped nearby.\\"History\\", Smith Rock State Park, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Salem, Oregon, accessed 27 May 2015. The State of Oregon obtained the park property between 1960 and 1975 from the City of Redmond and Harry and Diane Kem.  Hiking  The Crooked River running through Smith Rock The park has many miles of developed trails for hiking. The trails have viewpoints along the routes that overlook the Crooked River and nearby rock formations. The two main trails are the Summit Trail and Misery Ridge. The park's trail network links to neighboring Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management trails on adjacent public lands. The soil and native vegetation on the steep hillsides in the park are very sensitive to damage, so visitors are required to stay on established trails.\\"Park Info\\", Smith Rock State Park, Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Salem, Oregon, accessed 27 May 2015.  Climbing  The park contains the first U.S. climb rated . The area is well known for its challenging climbing routes and attracts high level climbers. In 1983, Alan Watts began to use sport climbing ethics which pushed American climbing to new levels. Shortly after, between 1992 and 2009, about 500 new climbing routes were added. This brought climbers from all over the world as Smith Rock became the world capital for sport climbing. To this day, the park still attracts climbers from around the globe. The winter weather is typically cold (below freezing), but climbers still make the journey due to the reduced traffic on routes. Summer months regularly reach the 100s ¬∞F (40s ¬∞C). Some climbing routes are closed periodically for the protection of nesting birds of prey. Smith Rock State Park has more than 1,800 rock climbing routes as of 2010. The park is broken up into walls and have names commonly used by the climbing community. = Christian Brothers = The Christian Brothers area is a large group of rock spires in between Asterisk Pass and The Dihedrals. The walls that make up the Christian Brothers area are the Prophet Wall, The Beard, Testament Slab and the Combination Blocks. There are several routes in this area that are noteworthy such as Wartley's Revenge (5.11b Trad), Revelations (5.9 Sport) with its high first bolt off the ground, Double Trouble (5.10b Sport), BBQ the Pope (5.10b Sport), Heresy (5.11c Sport), Rude Boys (5.13c Sport), and Scarface and Chemical Ali (both 5.14a Sport). = The Dihedrals = The Dihedrals are located between the Four Horseman and Asterisk Pass just pass the Morning Glory Wall. It is one of the more popular areas to climb in the park with easy classics like Cinnamon Slab (5.6 Trad, 2 Pitch), Bunny Face (5.7 Sport). It has some more moderate climbs of high quality such as Moonshine Dihedral (5.9 Trad, 2 Pitch) and Karate Crack (5.10a Trad) as well some of the more difficult and famous climbs such as Heinous Cling (5.12c Sport), Chain Reaction (5.12c Sport) and To Bolt or Not to Be (5.14a Sport). = The Upper and Lower Gorge = The Gorge contains more climbs that are Traditional Routes rather than Sport Routes. Climbers also need to be fairly stout climbers as most routes start in the low 5.12's. The rock is mainly basalt, fairly different from the welded tuff you find in most of the other climbing areas in Smith Rock State Park. The lower gorge is a location to get away from the heat of the late spring, summer and early fall. = The Marsupials = The Marsupials are the farthest climbing area from the main entrance of the park. To get there, go across the bridge and turn right on Wolf Tree Trail. Follow this around the canyon following the Crooked River and turn up Burma Road. The beginning of the Marsupials starts just off Burma Road. The three main areas in the Marsupials are Koala Rock, The Wombat and Brogan Spire. Famed climber Beth Rodden made the first female ascent of The Optimist (5.14b Sport) located on the \\"Koala Rock\\" side of the Marsupials. = Monkey Face Area = The Monkey Face area has many routes, but is known for the iconic rock spire known as \\"Monkey Face,\\" a distinctly primate looking face when viewed from certain angles. This iconic tower is 350 feet tall and boasts many routes. One of the more famous routes, Just Do It (5.14c), is still a testpiece for climbers to prove their prowess. Directly across from the \\"mouth\\" of Monkey Face is a prominent rock outcropping (The Diving Board) that comes fairly close to the tower. There is tyrollean traverse gear nailed down on the outcropping and within the \\"mouth\\" of Monkey Face. Adventurous climbers can connect these with 1\\" nylon webbing and create a \\"slackline\\" between the two locations. The idea is to tether yourself with a safety line to the slackline and then walk out over the expanse of open air keeping your balance. = Morning Glory Wall = The Morning Glory Wall sits in just past the Shiprock and is one of the busier walls in the park. It boasts routes of all levels. Because of its location, it is very hot in the late morning and afternoons during the warmer seasons. The Morning Glory Wall a wide range of climbs but some of the more notable routes are 5 Gallon Buckets (5.8), Light on the Path (5.10a), Cool Ranch Flavor (5.11b), Magic Light (5.11b), Zebra Seam (5.11d), Churning in the Wake (5.13a) and Vicious Fish (5.13c). = Picnic Lunch Wall = The Picnic Lunch Wall is generally the first image of Smith Rock State Park that most visitors get. It is 700 feet tall and has climbing routes, many multi-pitch routes that have loose rock. It is also the beginning of the Misery Ridge, Wolf Tree, and River Trails and generally gets heavy hiking traffic. = Red Wall = The Red Wall is located off the Misery Ridge Trail just pass the Picnic Lunch Wall. The rock has a red to purple color to it from the iron in the rock making it distinct from most of the rest of the welded tuft in the park. It has some classic, easy multi-pitch trad climbs with Superslab (5.6 trad, 3 pitches), Moscow (5.6 trad, 3 pitches with one 4th class scramble at the top), and Peking (5.8 trad, 3 pitches). Because it is an east-facing wall, the early morning gets the sun directly on it for colder days and shade in the afternoon/evening for the warmer days. = Rope- de-Dope = The Rope-De-Dope block sits across the Crooked River across from the main climbing areas such as The Morning Glory Wall. The trail to Rope-De- Dope is the gravel Canyon Trail and goes north before you walk across the main bridge into the park. If you are starting from The Bivy, take the Rope-de-Dope Trail that comes around the back of the block. The Rope-De-Dope Block is a common place for beginners to be able to top-rope or learn how to lead climb on easier routes. The routes on Rope-De-Dope are shorter than almost all of the other routes in the park due to the block only being 40 feet high. Top ropes can be set up from a small scramble up the back of the block to get to the top anchors. = Ships and Gullies = The Ships and Gullies area is a collection of smaller, in-the-shade areas that have a range of climbing difficulties. This area contains Aggro Gully, Cocaine Gully, Honeycomb Wall, Shipwreck Wall, Table Scraps Wall, and West Ship River Face. The Ships and Gullies area starts less than a quarter of a mile past the Picnic Lunch Wall after Shiprock where you can see the first set of stairs up the trail to the gullies. = Smith Rock Groups = The Smith Rock Groups cover a large swath of the climbing park stretching from Asterisk Pass to the southern border of the park. Generally, these can be areas to get away from the crowds and the sun. The Smith Rock Group has a lot of varied climbing but mostly sport with a couple of options for multi-pitch. Some of the more popular routes are Sky Ridge (5.8 trad, 3 pitches), Sunset Slab (5.9 sport), White Satin (5.9 trad, 3 pitches), Wherever I May Roam (5.9 sport, 5 pitches), Phoenix (5.10a sport), Kunza Korner (5.10c sport), American Nirvana (5.11c sport), and Blackened (5.11c/d). = West Side Crags = The West Side Crags offer a much cooler side of the park in the summer and a break from the normally fairly crowded sections of the park. There are three ways to get to the West Side Crags depending upon how much hiking/scrambling you are willing to do. The most direct route is to hike to Asterisk Pass from the main trail into the park just west of The Christian Brothers area. It is a scramble to get into the slot and then it is a 5.7R down-climb from the other side of the path to the west side of the park. This can be dangerous if done without climbing equipment and experience. The West Side Crags can also be accessed from either hiking up Misery Ridge and access the crags after coming down the switchbacks at Monkey Face or take the longer River Trail around the southern tip and then walk up to the crags. The West Side Crags are composed of Snake Rock, Angel Flight Crags, Spiderman Buttress, Mesa Verda Wall and the Pleasure Palace.  Camping  Smith Rock silhouetted at sunset The park's day-use area has a visitor center, picnic facilities, and restrooms. The day-use area is open from dawn to dusk year-round. There is also a tent-only campground for overnight visitors. The campsites are located approximately from a parking area along the park's main access road. Restrooms, showers, and a cooking area are located near the parking area. Open fires are not permitted. Many of the state park campers will stay at Skull Hollow, a nearby BLM camp ground.  Wildlife  There is abundant wildlife in and around the park. Mule deer and many small mammals are common in the park. river otter and beaver are found along the park's Crooked River frontage. The Smith Rock area hosts many types of birds like the canyon wren and the white-throated swift, including birds of prey such as prairie falcons and golden eagles. Geese and ducks nest along the river in the spring time. There are rattlesnakes in some areas of the park.  Running  Smith Rock State Park is home to some extreme running races.GoBeyond Racing The races include distances ranging from 4 miles to 50 miles, all on the challenging and hilly terrain of Smith Rock.

It was written by James Keyes, Claude Feaster, Carl Feaster, Floyd F. McRae, and William Edwards, members of the R&B; vocal group the Chords, and published in 1954. It was a U.S. top-10 hit that year for both the Chords (who first recorded the song) and the Crew-Cuts. History The song was first recorded on Atlantic Records' subsidiary label Cat Records by the Chords on March 15, 1954,Cat catalogue #104, \\"B\\" Side: Cross Over The Bridge on the first issue, on the later issues the \\"B\\" Side is Little Maiden. and would be their only hit song. \\"Sh-Boom\\" reached No. 2 on the Billboard R&B; charts and peaked at No. 9 on the pop charts. It is sometimes considered to be the first doo-wop or rock 'n' roll record to reach the top ten on the pop charts (as opposed to the R&B; charts). This version was ranked No. 215 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is the group's only song on the list. A more traditional version was made by a Canadian group, the Crew-Cuts (with the David Carroll Orchestra), for Mercury RecordsMercury catalogue # 70404; \\"B\\" side: I Spoke Too Soon and was No. 1 on the Billboard charts for nine weeks during August and September 1954. The single first entered the charts on July 30, 1954, and stayed for 20 weeks. The Crew-Cuts performed the song on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town on December 12, 1954. On the Cash Box magazine best-selling record charts, where both versions were combined, the song reached No. 1. Other recordings Stan Freberg recorded a combined spoof of \\"Sh-boom\\" and Marlon Brando because he felt that they both mumbled, in 1954. It reached No. 14 in the US and 15 in the UK. The Billy Williams Quartet released a version in 1954 on Coral Records that reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100, with orchestra directed by Jack Pleis. A recording by Ken Mackintosh and His Orchestra (vocalists: the Mackpies) was made in London on April 7, 1954. It was released by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10698\\\\. The record for most recordings of \\"Sh-Boom\\" by a single group probably belongs to the Harvard Din & Tonics, an a cappella men's singing group that has featured the song on 12 of their 13 albums. Their 1979 Crew-Cuts-style arrangement was so popular that the group began performing \\"Sh-Boom\\" as their signature song at all their concerts, bringing all their alumni onstage to perform it across the United States and through 10 world tours. The British Doo-Wop revivalists, Darts, recorded \\"Sh-Boom\\" in the late 1970s, this time at a slower tempo. It was released as the B-side of the band's last charting single, reaching No. 48 in the UK charts in 1980.British Hit Singles & Albums 18th edition, Guinness World Records, 2005, p. 135. The reggae crooner Alton Ellis recorded a cover entitled \\"She Boom\\" for Studio One some time in the 1970s; the EP has been pressed at various times by various distributors. In the 1980s a parody of the song entitled \\"Dubuque\\" was featured in the Dubuque ham TV commercial, a midwestern-based meat packing company. German rock-and-roll band Spider Murphy Gang adapted the song into a Bavarian version, \\"Leben is wiar a Traum\\", which they released as a single in 1985. The Fleetwoods released a cover version of the song. Canadian children's entertainers Sharon, Lois & Bram covered the song on their 1995 album release titled Let's Dance!. Watkin Tudor Jones covered the song on his 2001 album, Memoirs Of A Clone. British doo-wop act the Overtones covered the song on their 2010 album Good Ol' Fashioned Love. The song was covered in 1955 by Enoch Light And His Light Brigade Orchestra, released in the UK on His Master's Voice, and appears on their album Little Things Mean A Lot from Jasmine Records. In popular culture Alternate recordings based on the Crew Cuts' recording were heard in the TV series Happy Days (1974‚Äì84) and in the film Clue (1985). The original Chords' recording was featured in The Super (1991), Liberty Heights (1999), The Sum of Us (1994), Cry-Baby featuring Johnny Depp (1990), Two of Us (2000), Road House (1989), and the mini-series Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). It was briefly featured in the HBO mini-series From the Earth To The Moon (1998) and the movie Hearts in Atlantis (2001). The Trevor Horn Orchestra covered the song for the Mona Lisa Smile (2003) soundtrack. Pixar's Cars used a long recording of the song (2006), and Disney California Adventure prominently incorporated it into the nightly neon lighting ceremony in the new Cars Land. It is heard in the 2011 film Dolphin Tale.\\"Dolphin Tale (2011)  Soundtracks\\", IMDb. Retrieved 2020-02-20. The song is briefly featured in a Nexgard Chewables for Dogs commercial.

It is considered one of the most elite schools in Europe. It offers the German Abitur, as well as the International Baccalaureate (IB). With a scholarship program and its \\"Dienste\\" (Services) such as the Firebrigade, the \\"Technisches Hilfswerk\\" short: THW (Technical Support Organisation), the First Aid or the Nautical Service. The Schule Schloss Salem, also commonly referred to as Salem College, hence offers an education for its students at the academic as well as social levels. The school was established by the educator Kurt Hahn with support of Prince Maximilian of Baden in 1920 and from the beginning accepted girls and boys. Under the Nazi regime Hahn (who was Jewish) was forced to emigrate to Scotland where he founded the British Salem School of Gordonstoun as well as later Outward Bound and the United World Colleges. The school today The school‚Äôs mission continues to reflect its Hahnian roots. Specifically, Salem aims to present young people with high academic and extracurricular expectations and opportunities; and to introduce them to a lifelong sense of respect for the individual, responsibility to the community and an awareness of the importance of the democratic process in sustaining both. The academic program in Years 5-7 is in German. Intensive instruction in German as a foreign language is available for international pupils. Even pupils arriving at the School with no German are fluent within one school year. From Year 8 onward, Salem is fully bilingual and offers a dual curriculum. Students may either continue in the German system (Abitur) or enter the international classes & the IB Diploma Programme, in which the language is English. However, students may switch systems until they enter the upper school. Approximately a third of the students in the upper years are in the IB system. Most students are of German background, but there is significant population of international students, with students attending from a variety of countries such as Switzerland, Spain, USA, China, Russia, Korea, India, Canada, Australia or Italy. At Salem, involvement in extracurricular activities and the life in the boarding community and academic achievement are equally emphasized. All students in the upper years must engage in community service such as Nautical Service, THW (Technical Support Organisation) extended First Aid, Community Service (Kindergarten, Disabled people's home, etc.) or Fire brigade at least one afternoon per week. During the terrible aeroplane accident of 2002 in √úberlingen, Salem Students were some of the first at the scene. All students must also participate in a regular program of sports and/or outdoor pursuits such as Outward Bound, Football, Rugby or Gymnastics. Participation in theatre, music and visual-arts extracurricular programs, while not mandatory, is strongly encouraged. The student orchestra in Salem is regarded to be one of the foremost youth-orchestra's in Germany and travels around the world to perform its music, such as a recent trip to Beijing, China. Far more than in boarding schools from the Anglo-American tradition, responsibility for the everyday running of the School in the upper years is, in keeping with Salem‚Äôs democratic ethos based on the principles of Kurt Hahn, placed in the hands of students under the guidance of staff. All activities and dormitories (Fl√ºgel) are led by students elected by their peers. School regulations are outlined with the consent of the student parliament and breaches of these are jointly dealt with by the School administration and the elected leaders of the student body in what is called the Leitungsrat or the 'Leadership Council', which comprises the Headmaster of the College, the two Head Boys/Girls, the students housemaster/mistress and other senior staff members. In 2013 the one-year interdisciplinary Salem Kolleg was opened in √úberlingen. The autonomously operated Studium generale programme prepares high school graduates for their academic and professional future through an orientation year of three trimesters during which trained advisors provide intensive career counseling, personal assessment with the help of assessment tests such as the Holland Codes, and outdoor leadership courses. The programme shares many of the facilities of Salem International College on the H√§rlen campus in √úberlingen. The founding director was Gerhard Teufel, former director of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes). Beginning with school year 2018/2019 Salem introduced a programme titled 10 Plus, which allows students from other academic tracks to achieve a full- accredited Abitur after one supplemental year of high school before entering the so-called Kollegstufe (Years 11 and 12), the equivalent of the British Sixth form.

University admissions are excellent, with almost all graduates eventually attending the most selective universities in Germany, Great Britain and the leading Commonwealth countries, as well as the United States. Spetzgart and H√§rlen  Campuses  Salem is spread among three separate campuses: the Lower School (grades 5 to 7) and the Middle School in Salem Castle (grades 8 to 11, and Pre-IB), and the 'Upper' (secondary) School in Spetzgart Castle and the new campus of H√§rlen (Grades 11 and 12, IB years 1 and 2). The Lower School was located in ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤Schloss Hohenfels‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, an isolated castle above the town of Kalkofen 20 kilometers to the west of Salem, until the end of school year 2016/17. Salem Castle is located in a former Cistercian monastery, which prior to secularisation in 1802-1803 was known as Salem Abbey, in the town of Salem. The Upper School is located along the shores of Lake Constance on the outskirts of √úberlingen in Spetzgart Castle (since 1928) and on the modern H√§rlen campus, which was opened in September 2000.

The plot centres on Danny, a young English boy with a big wagon, and his father, William, who live in a Gypsy caravan fixing cars for a living and partake in poaching pheasants. It was first published in 1975 in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape. It was adapted into a made-for-TV movie in 1989 by Thames Television which starred Jeremy Irons. It is based on Dahl's adult short story \\"Champion of the World\\" which first appeared in print in The New Yorker magazine,All works by Roald Dahl. The New Yorker.

Retrieved 20 November 2015 Time included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.  Summary  Danny was only four months old when his mother died. At the beginning of the book, he lives with his widowed father, William, in an old caravan behind the service station and garage owned and operated by his father. At the age of nine, Danny learns that his father is an avid poacher, as was his father's father. Shortly thereafter, Danny wakes at 2:10 am to find his father hasn't returned from his latest poaching venture on the property of the local beer magnate, Mr Hazell. Danny drives to the property and finds his father in a trap, incapacitated by a broken ankle. Danny rescues his father and helps him home. While his father recovers from his injury, he and Danny realize Mr. Hazell's annual pheasant shoot is approaching - an event to which he invites wealthy, powerful and influential people. Danny and his father decide to humiliate Mr Hazell by capturing all the pheasants in the forest. To accomplish this, they place the contents of the sleeping pills prescribed to Danny's father by the village doctor, Doc Spencer, into raisins that the pheasants will eat; Danny's father calls this new method \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". After having successfully captured 120 pheasants from Hazell's Wood, Danny and his father take a taxi (driven by a fellow poacher) to the local vicarage, where they hide the pheasants. Afterwards, they walk home. The next day, the vicar's wife (Mrs Clipstone) delivers the sleeping pheasants to Danny's father's garage in a specially built baby carriage; however, the pheasants start flying out of the baby carriage as the narcotic wears off. The birds do not travel far, as they're still sleepy. During the commotion, Mr. Hazell arrives and confronts Danny, his father and Doc Spencer. With the help of Sergeant Enoch Samways, the village policeman, Danny and his father shoo the stunned pheasants over (and in some cases inside) Mr. Hazell's Rolls Royce, damaging the car's paintwork in the process. As Mr. Hazell leaves disgraced, the pheasants wake up completely and fly away in the opposite direction from Hazell's property. The book ends when Danny is hailed as \\"the champion of the world\\" by his father, Doc Spencer and Sgt. Samways. Six pheasants died of a sleeping pill overdose, so Doc Spencer gives two each to Sgt Samways, Mrs Clipstone and Danny and his father. Danny and his father then walk into town, intending to buy a new oven to cook their pheasants. They also discuss possibly attempting to poach trout from a local stream.  TV movie  The book was adapted into a made-for-TV movie in 1989 by Thames Television. It was directed by Gavin Millar and starred Jeremy Irons as William and his son, Samuel, as Danny, with Robbie Coltrane as Mr. Hazell. It was released to Region 2 DVD in 2006. Relations to other Roald Dahl books Danny, The Champion of the World is based on a previous short story by Dahl, entitled The Champion of the World, which was first published in The New Yorker Magazine in 1959 and later re-published in the compilation Kiss Kiss. The original story has a similar premise, but with adults as the main characters. William tells Danny a bedtime story sequence of a \\"Big Friendly Giant\\" who captures good dreams and blows them into children's bedrooms at night. Dahl would later use the same concept in the full-length novel entitled The BFG. Danny describes being caned by his teacher, Captain Lancaster, for cheating in an exam. This is similar to an experience that Dahl recounted of his own teacher, Captain Hardcastle, in Boy: Tales of Childhood.

In effect, the application of this rule is a refusal to recognize the right of representation, a component of primogeniture. Proximity of blood diagram In some feudal entities, proximity of blood was a generally accepted principle. For example, according to the \\"ancient custom\\" () in the Duchy of Burgundy, a grandson could not take precedence over a son, and it was not even clear whether the ruler's grandson could claim precedence over the ruler's brother.  Examples  Proximity of blood and primogeniture were at loggerheads in numerous medieval succession disputes. =Successful applications= *When Richard the Lionheart died in 1199, the succession to the English throne, as well as to Normandy and Anjou, was disputed between his fourth but sole surviving brother, John, and his nephew Arthur (the son of his second brother, Geoffrey). The Angevin law favored primogeniture and thus Arthur, while the Norman law recognized the proximity of blood and gave precedence to John. Arthur's claim had been recognized by Richard in 1191, but just before his death Richard expressed support for John, who in the end prevailed. *Alfonso X of Castile wished to enforce primogeniture by the Siete Partidas in the late 1270s and bequeath his crown to Alfonso, the son of his deceased eldest son, Ferdinand. His second but eldest surviving son, Sancho, rebelled with the support of the nobility and successfully claimed the crown by degree of kinship. *In 1307 a dispute erupted over the County of Artois between Mahaut, who had succeeded her father, Robert II, in 1302, and Mahaut's nephew, Robert. Robert II had outlived his son, Philip, and Mahaut put herself forward as \\"the closest relative to our said father at the time of his death, the reason of propinquity or proximity being notorious in custom\\". Her nephew, Philip's son, insisted on \\"representation of our aforesaid father who was the first born of our same grandfather\\". His appeal was rejected in 1309 on the basis that the established custom of Artois favored Mahaut, but he never relinquished his claim. *Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy, having outlived his son Philip, decreed in his will in 1348 that he should be succeeded by his grandson, also named Philip, unless Odo fathered another son. Odo's grandson, however, should have precedence over any daughters Odo might have and over Odo's sisters. In case of Philip's death without issue, the duchy was to pass to Odo's youngest but sole surviving sister, Joan, rather than to the descendants of his deceased older sisters. Odo IV had no further sons and was succeeded by his grandson, Philip I. Philip died childless in 1361, having outlived his grandfather's last sibling, Joan. The duchy would have gone to Charles II of Navarre, grandson of Odo's older sister Margaret, according to primogeniture, but was successfully claimed by John II of France, son of the younger sister Joan, according to proximity of blood. Since Charles was the grandson of a sister of Odo and John was the son of another, the latter was one degree closer to the dukes of Burgundy than Charles. *During the reign of Charles XII of Sweden it was never resolved whether his heir should be his younger sister, Ulrika Eleonora, or his nephew, Charles Frederick (the son of his deceased elder sister, Hedwig Sophia). The sister was more closely related to the reigning king, but the nephew had precedence according to primogeniture. Upon Charles XII's death in 1718 it was Ulrika Eleonora who successfully claimed the crown. = Unsuccessful applications = *In 1269, upon the death of Conrad III of Jerusalem, Mary of Antioch and Hugh III of Cyprus both claimed the crown. She was the daughter of Melisende, fifth daughter of Isabella I of Jerusalem, while he was the grandson of Alice, second daughter of Isabella I. Mary was the only living grandchild of Isabella I and closer in kinship to Conrad III (first cousin twice removed) and the kings of Jerusalem, while Hugh had precedence by primogeniture but was more distantly related to Conrad III (second cousin) and Isabella I (great-grandchild). The Haute Cour decided in favour of Hugh but Mary did not relinquish her claim. *Alexander III of Scotland drafted a treaty in 1281 in which he set out the rules of succession among his descendants. The provisions appeared to favor primogeniture for male heirs but proximity of blood for female heirs; the son of a deceased older son would take precedence over a surviving younger son but a younger daughter over a deceased older daughter's children. Upon the death of his granddaughter and successor, Margaret, in 1290, the succession was unclear. Robert de Brus claimed the crown by proximity in degree of kinship to the kings of Scotland, while John Balliol made a claim based on primogeniture. Robert and John were both descended from David of Huntingdon (grandson of David I of Scotland); Robert was a grandson (son of Isobel, second daughter of David of Huntingdon) while John was a great-grandson (grandson of Margaret, first daughter of David of Huntingdon). Arbitration by Edward I of England awarded the throne to John, but Robert's grandson later successfully claimed the crown as Robert I of Scotland.

An eagle overhead bears the state motto. Definition The Seal of Iowa is described carefully under Iowa Code 1A.1 in the following: \\"The secretary of state be, and is, hereby authorized to procure a seal which shall be the great seal of the state of Iowa, two inches in diameter, upon which shall be engraved the following device, surrounded by the words, 'The Great Seal of the State of Iowa' - a sheaf and field of standing wheat, with a sickle and other farming utensils, on the left side near the bottom; a lead furnace and pile of pig lead on the right side; the citizen soldier, with a plow in his rear, supporting the American flag and liberty cap with his right hand, and his gun with his left, in the center and near the bottom; the Mississippi River in the rear of the whole, with the steamer Iowa under way; an eagle near the upper edge, holding in his beak a scroll, with the following inscription upon it: Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.\\" Historically there were numerous variations of the Seal of Iowa. The Reports of the Iowa Geological Survey, for example, used three different seals 1893-1918. It was approved by the First Iowa General Assembly on February 25, 1847. Since that date, there have been no revisions to the code governing this Seal. The Seal of Iowa is kept and used by the Governor for official purposes. Because the seal was not illustrated in the Iowa code, over the years there have been several variations with differences in color and arrangement of objects. The seal was not universally beloved when introduced, it was considered cluttered and ungainly, and the older Territorial Seal was utilized in several instances on official publications into the 1860s, including official currency. \\"Gov.

The symbols presented on the seal reflect things important to early Iowa settlers. *Citizen soldier. The seal was approved during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848, and the citizen soldier depicted with a \\"liberty cap\\" represents volunteer soldiers from Iowa. Battles of the Mexican-American war are memorialized in several Iowa place names, including the counties of Buena Vista, Palo Alto and Cerro Gordo. As is traditional in official symbols, weapons are held in the soldier's left hand, and items of peace and freedom in the right. * Liberty Cap. A \\"liberty cap\\", also called a Phrygian cap, is a brimless hat resembling a tall beret that is an ancient Greek symbol of freedom. However, the soldier on the seal typically wears a wide-brimmed hat that resembles a Civil War-era Cavalry hat. Most versions of the seal put the liberty cap on top of the flag staff, presumably because the artists felt the cap did not match the soldier's uniform, which is most often depicted as that of a Civil War Union soldier. *Wheat. Early settlers in the 1840s primarily planted wheat, and it was not until the introduction of the railroad in the 1850s and 1860s that corn became the primary crop grown in Iowa.William Cronon.

Around the border of the seal are the words, SEAL OF THE TERRITORY OF IOWA.\\" The territorial seal was the basis for other state seals, including the first seal of the University of Iowa and the State Historical Society of Iowa, as well as the Civil War Arms of Iowa; these later seals had the bow held in the left talon, rather than the right. The Territorial seal was well liked as a simple image of the state and was used on state documents well into the 1860s, even after it had been officially replaced. \\"It is regarded as perfectly expressive of a distinct idea, intimately associated with the history of the delightful country which we have the happiness to inhabit... The slightest examination of the seal will disclose to the Honorable Council the eagle, the proud and appropriate emblem of our national power, bearing in its beak an Indian arrow, and clutching in its talons an unstrung bow; and while the idea thus delicately evolved is so well calculated to make the eye glisten with patriotic pride, and cause the heart to beat high with the pulsations of conscious superiority, it nevertheless presents a touching appeal to our manly sensibilities.\\" Image: Iowa territorial seal.jpgIowa Territorial Seal, 1838.

In the 1930s, Bergeron and W. Findeisen developed the concept that clouds contain both supercooled water and ice crystals. According to Bergeron, most precipitation is formed as a consequence of water evaporating from small supercooled droplets and accreting onto ice crystals, which then fall as snow, or melt and fall as cold rain depending on the ambient air temperature. This process is known as the Bergeron Process, and is believed to be the primary process by which precipitation is formed. Bergeron was one of the principal scientists in the Bergen School of Meteorology, which transformed this science by introducing a new conceptual foundation for understanding and predicting weather. While developing innovative methods of forecasting, the Bergen scientists established the notion of weather fronts and elaborated a new model of extratropical cyclones that accounted for their birth, growth, and decay. Bergeron is credited with discovering the occlusion process, which marks the final stage in the life cycle of an extratropical cyclone. In 1949 he was awarded the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society. In 1966 he was awarded the prestigious International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization.

A former student of Sailendra Sirkar Vidyalaya. Bhattacharjee had his ancestral house in Bangladesh. He studied Bengali literature at the Presidency College, Kolkata, and secured his B.A. degree in Bengali (Honours), later he joined the CPI(M) as a primary member.Shri Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee Besides taking active part in the food movement, he also supported Vietnam's cause in 1968. He was appointed state secretary of the Democratic Youth Federation, the youth wing of the CPI(M) that was later merged into the Democratic Youth Federation of India.  Political career and controversies  However, he took the biggest risk of his political career by embarking upon the industrialization drive to change the face of West Bengal, which had agriculture as primary source of income. He deviated from the standard Marxist doctrine to invite foreign and national capital to set up factories in West Bengal. Notable among them was the world's cheapest car, Tata Nano, from a small hamlet near Kolkata called Singur. There were other proposals too, such as country's largest integrated steel plant in Salboni, West Midanpore district by Jindal group, and a chemical hub at Nayachar after it faced agrarian resistance in Nandigram. However, his plans backfired, and his party, along with its front partners, suffered heavy losses in the 2009 Lok Sabha election. In the 2011 state assembly election he was defeated by the Trinamool congress candidate Manish Gupta by 16,684 votes, and the CPI(M) lost power in the state. He was relieved from his posts on the Politburo and Central Committee at the 21st party congress, organised at Vishakhapatnam in 2015.

Actually Budhhadeb Bhattacharjee declared that land in Nandigram won't be acquired by ordering the Nandigram notification to be torn apart. Still police were not allowed to enter Nandigram. Roads were dug up, preventing administration from entering the area. The CPI(M) declared that they were totally behind Bhattacharjee and had drawn up \\"plans\\" to placate his critics in the Left Front.Subrata Nagchoudhury, \\"Party stands by Buddha, gets restive allies to fall in line\\", indianexpress.com, March 18, 2007. His government was also criticized by Left supporters for failing to protect the Left party workers (including his own party CPI(M)) who came under assault from political opponents - both right wing and ultra-left wing Maoists during the post-Nandigram turmoil until the end of 7th Left Front Government.

The pyramid building is more formally designated by archaeologists as Chichen Itza Structure 5B18. Built by the pre-Columbian Maya civilization sometime between the 8th and 12th centuries AD, the pyramid served as a temple to the deity Kukulc√°n, the Yucatec Maya Feathered Serpent deity closely related to Quetzalcoatl, a deity known to the Aztecs and other central Mexican cultures of the Postclassic period. It has a substructure that likely was constructed several centuries earlier for the same purpose. The pyramid consists of a series of square terraces with stairways up each of the four sides to the temple on top. Sculptures of plumed serpents run down the sides of the northern balustrade. Around the spring and autumn equinoxes, the late afternoon sun strikes off the northwest corner of the pyramid and casts a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of the feathered serpent \\"crawling\\" down the pyramid. To contemporary visitors, the event has been very popular and is witnessed by thousands at the spring equinox, but it is not known whether the phenomenon is a result of a purposeful design since the light-and-shadow effect can be observed without major changes during several weeks near the equinoxes. All four sides of the pyramid have approximately 91 steps which, when added together and including the temple platform on top as the final \\"step\\", may produce a total of 365 steps (the steps on the south side of the pyramid are eroded). That number is equal to the number of days of the Haab' year and likely is significantly related to rituals.Milbrath 1989: 66 The structure is high, plus an additional for the temple at the top. The square base measures across. Construction The construction of Kukulc√°n (\\"El Castillo\\"), like other Mesoamerican pyramids, likely reflected the common practice by the Maya of executing several phases of construction for their temples. The last construction probably took place between 900-1000 AD, while the substructure may have been constructed earlier, between 600-800 AD. Based on archaeological research, construction of Kukulc√°n was based on the concept of axis mundi.Tejero- Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez-Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A. (2018). ‚ÄòIlluminating‚Äô the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11. Anthropologists think that the site remained sacred regardless of how the structure was positioned on the location. When a temple or pyramid structure was renewed, the former construction was destroyed using a ritual that involved resolving the space of spiritual forces to preserve its sacredness.Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez-Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A. (2018). ‚ÄòIlluminating‚Äô the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11. It is estimated that this last construction dates to the eleventh century AD. The older, inner pyramid is referred to as the \\"substructure\\". After all of the restoration work was completed, an entryway was cut into the balustrade of the northeastern exterior staircase to provide access to tourists. Inside the pyramid In 1566, the pyramid was described by Friar Diego de Landa in the manuscript known as Yucat√°n at the Time of the Spanish Encounter (Relaci√≥n de las cosas de Yucat√°n). Almost three centuries later, John Lloyd Stephens described the architecture of the pyramid with even more detail in his book Incidents of Travel in Yucat√°n (Incidentes del viaje Yucat√°n), published in 1843. At that time, the archaeological site of Chich√©n Itz√° was located on an estate, also called Chich√©n Itz√°, owned by Juan Sosa. Frederick Catherwood illustrated the book with lithographs depicting the pyramid covered in abundant vegetation on all sides. There are some photographs taken in the beginning of the twentieth century that also show the pyramid partially covered by said vegetation. In 1924, the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. requested permission from the Mexican government to carry out explorations and restoration efforts in and around the area of Chichen Itza. In 1927, with the assistance of Mexican archaeologists, they started the task. In April 1931, looking to confirm the hypothesis that the structure of the pyramid of Kukulc√°n was built on top of a much older pyramid, the work of excavation and exploration began in spite of generalized beliefs contrary to that hypothesis. On June 7, 1932, a box with coral, obsidian, and turquoise encrusted objects was found alongside human remains, which are exhibited in the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City. The Temple of Kukulc√°n (El Castillo) is located above a cavity filled with water, labeled a sinkhole or cenote. Recent archaeological investigations suggest that an earlier construction phase is located closer to the southeastern cenote, rather than being centered.Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote- Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez-Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A. (2018). ‚ÄòIlluminating‚Äô the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11. This specific proximity to the cenote suggests that the Maya may have been aware of the cenote‚Äôs existence and purposefully constructed it there to facilitate their religious beliefs.Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez- Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A. (2018). ‚ÄòIlluminating‚Äô the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico, by means of a non- conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11. After extensive excavation work, in April 1935, a Chac Mool statue, with its nails, teeth, and eyes inlaid with mother of pearl was found inside the pyramid. The room where the discovery was made was nicknamed the \\"Hall of offerings\\" or \\"North Chamber\\". After more than a year of excavation, in August 1936, a second room was found, only meters away from the first. Inside this room, dubbed the \\"Chamber of Sacrifices\\", archaeologists found two parallel rows of human bone set into the back wall, as well as a red jaguar statue. Both deposits of human remains were found oriented north-northeast. Researchers concluded that there must be an inner pyramid approximately wide, shaped similarly to the outer pyramid, with nine steps and a height of up to the base of the temple where the Chac Mool and the jaguar were found. The \\"Red Jaguar\\" statue found in what is described as the throne room of the Temple of Kukulc√°n at the Chichen Itza archaeological site What appears to be a throne (referred to as the \\"Red Jaguar\\") was discovered in the room described as the throne room. The jaguar throne was previously presumed to have been decorated with flint and green stone discs, but recent research has determined the jaguar to be composed of highly symbolic and valued materials for ritualistic significance. The use of x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) was used to determine that the sculpture is painted red with a pigment that includes cinnabar, or mercury sulfide (HgS). Cinnabar was not in accessible proximity to Chich√©n Itz√°, so the transportation of this pigment through long-distance trade would have placed a high value on this product.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez-Garc√≠a, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International. Additionally, the color red appears to have been significant to Maya cultural symbolism. It is associated with creating life as well as death and sacrifice.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez-Garc√≠a, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International. Studies suggest that objects in Maya culture were imbued with vital essence, so the choice of painting the jaguar red may be a reflection of these beliefs, deeming the jaguar as an offering.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote- Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez-Garc√≠a, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International. The high status associated with the cinnabar pigment and its red tone suggest that the jaguar was linked to the ritual importance of closing a temple for renewal.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez- Garc√≠a, P.

The four fangs of the Red Jaguar have been identified as gastropod mollusk shells (Lobatus costatus) using a digital microscope and comparative analysis from malacology experts from the National Institute of Anthropology and History. The shells also are thought to be another valued resource material that may have been traded into Chich√©n Itz√°.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez- Garc√≠a, P.

The green stones were analyzed and determined to be a form of jadeite.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez-Garc√≠a, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International. Jadeite was valuable economically and socially, and the acquisition and application of the material is indicative of the access Chich√©n Itz√° had along its trade routes.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez- Garc√≠a, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International. Archaeological studies indicate that the Red Jaguar is similar to other depictions of thrones found in Mayan murals (Temple of Chacmool), thus whomever was seated on this throne could have been accessing the point of axis mundi, which is essential to the elements and relationship to the cosmological system.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez-Garc√≠a, P. (2017). Portable XRF analysis for the identification of raw materials of the Red Jaguar sculpture in Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico. Quaternary International, Quaternary International. The symbolic use of materials related to the underworld and death also suggest that it acted as an offering for ritually closing the temple.Ju√°rez-Rodr√≠guez, O., Argote-Espino D., Santos-Ram√≠rez, M., & L√≥pez-Garc√≠a, P.

Alignment The location of the pyramid within the site is aligned at the intersection between four cenotes: the Sacred Cenote, Xtoloc, Kanjuyum, and Holt√∫n. This alignment supports the position of the Temple of Kukulc√°n as an axis mundi.Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez-Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A. (2018). ‚ÄòIlluminating‚Äô the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11. The western and eastern sides of the temple are angled to the zenith sunset and nadir sunrise, which may correspond with other calendar events such as the start of the traditional planting and harvesting seasons.Wren, L., Kristan-Graham, C., Nygard, T., & Spencer, K. R. (2018). Landscapes of the Itza : Archaeology and art history at Chichen Itza and neighboring sites. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. An approximate correspondence with the Sun's positions on its zenith and nadir passages is likely coincidental, however, because very few Mesoamerican orientations match these events and even for such cases, different explanations are much more likely. Since the sunrise and sunset dates recorded by solar orientations that prevail in Mesoamerican architecture, tend to be separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days (i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system), and given their clustering in certain seasons of the year, it has been argued that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars intended to facilitate a proper scheduling of agricultural and related ritual activities. In agreement with this pattern, detected both in the Maya Lowlands and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, the north (and main) face of the temple of Kukulc√°n at Chich√©n Itz√° has an azimuth of 111.72¬∞, corresponding to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, separated by 65 and 300 days (multiples of 13 and 20). Significantly, the same dates are recorded by a similar temple at Tulum. Recent developments In recent years, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), which manages the archaeological site of Chichen Itza, has been closing monuments to the public. While visitors may walk around them, they no longer are allowed to climb them or to go inside their chambers. Climbing Kukulc√°n was stopped in 2006, after a woman fell to her death. At the same time, INAH closed public access to the interior throne room.Diario de Yucatan, \\"Fin a una exenci√≥n para los mexicanos: Pagar√°n el d√≠a del equinoccio en la zona arqueol√≥gica,\\" March 3, 2006. Today the Temple of Kukulc√°n is one of the most recognized and widely visited pre-Columbian structures in present-day Mexico.Coe 1999: 176 Additionally, researchers have discovered an enormous cenote (also known as a sinkhole) beneath the 1,000-year-old temple of Kukulc√°n. The forming sinkhole beneath the temple is approximately and as many as deep. The water filling the cavern is thought to run from north to south. Researchers also found a layer of limestone approximately thick at the top of the cenote, upon which the pyramid sits. Recent archaeological investigations have used Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to examine the construction sequence of Kukulc√°n.Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez-Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A. (2018). ‚ÄòIlluminating‚Äô the interior of Kukulkan's Pyramid, Chich√©n Itz√°, Mexico, by means of a non-conventional ERT geophysical survey. Journal of Archaeological Science, 90, 1-11. To preserve the site from potential damage, electrodes were placed non-traditionally as flat-based detectors around the quadrangle of the pyramid bodies of the pyramid. After each pyramidal body was tested, the data revealed two previous construction phases within Kukulc√°n with a possible temple at the top of the second substructure. Determining the dates of when these constructions happened will provide time periods of when Chichen Itza may have been significantly occupied.Tejero-Andrade, A., Argote-Espino, D., Cifuentes-Nava, G., Hern√°ndez-Quintero, E., Ch√°vez, R.E., & Garc√≠a-Serrano, A.

History =Home of Wedgwood= Etruria Hall, the Wedgwood family home. Canal scene at Etruria Etruria was the fourth and penultimate site for the Wedgwood pottery business. Josiah Wedgwood, who was previously based in Burslem, opened his new works in 1769. It was named after the Italian district of Etruria, home of the Etruscan people who were renowned for their artistic products. The site covered and was next to the Trent and Mersey Canal. As well as Wedgwood's home, Etruria Hall, it included the Etruria Works which remained in use by the Wedgwood enterprise until 1950. The Wedgwood factory is now in Barlaston, a village about six miles to the south of the Etruria site. Etruria Hall was the site of the substantial invention of photography by Thomas Wedgwood in the 1790s. =After Wedgwood= Much of Etruria became derelict with the move of Wedgwood after the Second World War and the subsequent closure of the nearby Shelton Bar steelworks. Large-scale regeneration began in the 1980s with the Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival. Since the Festival closed at the end of 1986, the site has been given over to the Festival Park commercial and retail development. Etruria was also formerly home to The Sentinel, the local evening newspaper for the Stoke-on-Trent area. The press hall there was responsible for printing several newspaper titles, including The Sentinel, and many northern editions of The Daily Mail. The Sentinel had previously been based in Hanley, and upon the site's closure it moved back. The site was bought by Bet365 and demolished to make way for new offices. Etruria was served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 9 October 1848, but it was closed on 30 September 2005. Etruria is home to the Etruria Industrial Museum, a scheduled ancient monument, which includes a working steam engine called Princess. The museum buildings were originally a bone and flint mill built in 1857 to grind materials for the pottery industry. Inside visitors can see displays on the history of the site and original machinery. On the first weekend of each month the museum's 1903 coal-fired boiler provides steam to operate Princess which then turns the grinding machinery. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Etruria Railway Station was used as a base for Buffalo Bill and his Wild West Show. His reason was, that as it was in the Midlands, it was central to the whole country (and possibly a cheaper rent or lease for the sidings) and it was thus easier to get around the whole country than travelling completely from the south to the north and vice versa. Many of the performers in his show were often seen around the locality of May Bank and Wolstanton in their Native Indian attire, as it was the only clothes that they owned. There is local folklore which states that an elephant used in the show, died and is buried in the vicinity of the railway station. Current status Etruria Canals Festival takes place annually at Etruria Industrial Museum on the first weekend in June.

After his playing days, Matthews was a color commentator for Phillies broadcasts. He batted and threw right-handed. He is the father of former big league outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. The Matthews are one of seven father/son combinations in Cubs history; another son, Delvon, was a member of Milwaukee's Minor League Baseball (MiLB) system in ‚Äì. Playing career Matthews was selected in the first round of the June 1968 draft by the San Francisco Giants. He began his professional career in 1969 playing for the Giants' Decatur Commodores (A) affiliate in Decatur, Illinois. In 1973, his first complete season, he won the National League Rookie of the Year award. Matthews batted .281 during his 16-season major league career with San Francisco (1972‚Äì76), Atlanta (1977‚Äì80), Philadelphia (1981‚Äì83), the Chicago Cubs (1984‚Äì87) and Seattle (1987). He appeared in 2,033 games and recorded 2,011 hits, 234 homers and 978 RBI while scoring 1,083 runs. Matthews was the National League Rookie of the Year in 1973 after batting .300 with 12 homers and 58 RBI for the Giants. He had his best overall season with the Braves in 1979, going to the All-Star Game during a season in which he batted .304 with 27 homers and 90 RBI. Matthews saw postseason action with the Phillies in 1981 and 1983. He homered 7 times in 19 playoff games and was voted the MVP of the 1983 NLCS after leading the Phillies past Los Angeles into the World Series. In the 5-game series, he went 6-for-14 with three homers and eight RBIs. He was also a key contributor to the Cubs' NL Eastern Division title in 1984, batting .291 with 101 runs scored. He had been acquired with outfielder Bob Dernier and pitcher Porfi Altamirano in a spring training deal with Philadelphia for pitcher Bill Campbell and catcher Mike Diaz. In the first game of the 1984 NL Championship Series against San Diego, he homered twice. He spent three seasons as a starter in left field for the Cubs. Matthews was limited by injuries in 1987 before being traded in mid-season to Seattle for minor league pitcher Dave Hartnett. In his 16-season career, Matthews batted .281 with 234 home runs and 978 RBIs in 2033 games. He finished with 183 career stolen bases, 1083 runs scored and 319 doubles. He had 2011 hits in 7147 at bats. He also showed decent plate discipline, with a lifetime .364 OBP, and a career high of .410. In 19 postseason games, he batted .323 with 7 home runs and 15 RBI. He posted a .968 fielding percentage as an outfielder. In his last MLB plate appearance, Matthews faced Texas Rangers pitcher Mitch Williams and singled, but was picked off in the next at-bat ending the ballgame. Coaching career After retiring as a player following the 1987 season, Matthews worked in private industry and broadcasting before joining the Cubs' organization in 1995 as minor league hitting coordinator, a position he held for three years. He left the Cubs in 1998 to become Toronto's hitting coach; he was a member of the Blue Jays' coaching staff for two years, then joined their broadcast team for two seasons. Matthews returned to the field in 2002 as Milwaukee's hitting coach and served as a coach for the Cubs in 2003‚Äì06. Broadcast career Matthews began his broadcast career as a radio commentator for the Toronto Blue Jays (2000‚Äì01) and as a studio analyst on Headline Sports Television, a Canadian cable network based in Toronto.

Fon was founded in Madrid, Spain, in 2006, by Mart√≠n Varsavsky where it headquarters most of its operations. Fon started out by building its Wi-Fi network through devices called \\"foneras\\". Members, whom the company called \\"Foneros\\", agreed to share a part of their bandwidth as a Wi-Fi signal, so that they could connect to other members' hotspots. As the company evolved, it shifted its focus to working with mobile operators and telecommunication providers, and expanded from deploying residential Wi-Fi to providing access and technology to carriers and services providers. Fon claims to operate a network of over 20,000,000 WiFi hotspots.  Company  Fon Wireless Ltd. is a for-profit company incorporated and registered in the United Kingdom. It was created in Madrid, Spain, by Mart√≠n Varsavsky where it headquarters most of its operations. Fon also has subsidiaries and branch offices in the United States, UK, Brazil, France, Germany and Japan. Its investors include Atomico Ventures, Google, Index Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Skype. = Early years = The original idea of Fon was to create a network for Wi-Fi access wherever customers went. To become a Fon member, users had to buy a special router called a ‚ÄúFonera‚Äù. With this router, they agreed to share a part of their bandwidth as a second Wi-Fi signal, in exchange for the right to use other members' Fon hotspots. To achieve this, Fon operated a system of dual access wireless networks. In 2007, Fon‚Äôs development model shifted to encompass ISPs and it began to work on creating Wifi community networks with British Telecom (BT) and SFR. In November 2007, Fon deployed its first wifi rollout, and continued using this foundation with more telco partners in the years to come. = Middle years = Since its initial involvement with ISPs, Fon continued to expand its network through partnerships with local Internet service providers in countries such as Germany, Greece, Japan, and Brazil among others. At the same time the company has continued to expand its product portfolio as technology developed. = 2016= In 2016 the company evolved to include premium networks such as airports, hotels, convention centers, public spaces, etc. in addition to residential networks. Fon also has a technology portfolio called to allow service providers to deliver services to their own customers.  Hardware and firmware  Originally Fon began with a software download for compatible routers, in particular, Linksys routers. This is custom firmware based on OpenWrt. Fon started using the OpenWrt base as firmware base for Fon branded routers. The firmware has been customised specifically for use in the Fon Community, allowing consumers to share their broadband connection and to connect to other Fon Spots around the world. Fon firmware creates two different Wi-Fi signals: one private and one public. * Private ('MYPLACE') : encrypted and intended for the owner's private use. Only the Fon Spot owner can access the internal network, computers and files. * Public ('FON_FREE_INTERNET'): un-encrypted or open, but username and password protected so allowing only registered Fon users to access the Fon Wi-Fi community network, but they cannot access the consumer's private network. The new 2014 Fonera SIMPL, introduced in February 2014, includes Facebook integration. The owner of the Fonera SIMPL may register their own Facebook account with the device. Once this is done, any user that is a 'Facebook Friend' of the owner is granted access to that Fonera (only). The 'Fonera Business' takes Facebook integration further by offering free WiFi to customers of a business who are asked to 'Like' the Facebook page for the business in order to gain free WiFi access.https://shop.fon.com/en/products/business-wifi In early 2018, the Online-Shop closed: \\"manufacture and sale of Foneras has been discontinued\\".

They jointly created the BT-Fon Community by flashing Fon's software on all BT Total Broadband WiFi routers in the UK. This allowed BT Total Broadband customers to participate in the Fon community without buying a Fonera router and in some cases without sharing their own WiFi. In June 2020 Fon's access to the BT WiFi network ended. No notification was given by either Fon nor BT (other than BT mentioning beforehand, the SSID \\"BT WiFi with Fon\\" would be changing to \\"BTwifi\\", but without informing the date of the change not that it would end access). On the day of the change all access points from BT disappeared from the map on the Fon app. The timing was questionable, given the UK was under covid-19 lockdown at the time, leaving Fon users in quarantine or self isolating, stuck at home with no internet provision. = SFR (France) = In 2007 Fon and SFR launched Fon on WiFi routers throughout France. SFR subscribers can opt into Fon to share and receive WiFi services. = NOS (Portugal) = In 2008, ZON (now NOS) announced a partnership with Fon to create the largest WiFi network in Portugal. Fon technology is built into NOS WiFi routers so its subscribers become part of the Fon community automatically. = SoftBank (Japan) = SoftBank is Fon's first collaboration with a mobile line operator wanting to offload data traffic to WiFi. Since 2010, SoftBank bundles a Fonera with every iPhone they sell. = Oi (Brazil) = On 31 October 2011 Oi announced its partnership with Fon, granting global WiFi access to its broadband customers. = Proximus (Belgium) = Discontinued; From November 2011 through 2018, Belgacom (now Proximus) was part the Fon network. Proximus added Fon's WiFi-sharing technology to its BBox2 modem earlier in 2011, making it possible to broadcast two WiFi signals from a broadband internet source. Fon Membership was automatically activated (opt-out). = Netia (Poland) = Discontinued; From 28 February 2012 through 2018 Fon was added Poland to its network, deploying over 100,000 hotspots in the first few months. = KPN (the Netherlands) = KPN, a large telecommunications company in the Netherlands, and Fon formed a partnership to publicly launch the Fon network on KPN modems. = Deutsche Telekom (Germany) = In March 2013, a new partnership with Deutsche Telekom in Germany was announced.

Education and career Born on October 30, 1912, in Greenville, South Carolina, Haynsworth received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1933 from Furman University and a Bachelor of Laws in 1936 from Harvard Law School. He entered private practice in Greenville from 1936 to 1942. He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945. He returned to private practice in Greenville from 1945 to 1957. Federal judicial service Haynsworth was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 19, 1957, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated by Judge Armistead Mason Dobie. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4, 1957, and received commission the same day. He served as Chief Judge and a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1964 to 1981. He assumed senior status on April 6, 1981 until his death on November 22, 1989 in Greenville, South Carolina. Unsuccessful Supreme Court nomination On August 21, 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Haynsworth to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He was proposed to succeed liberal justice Abe Fortas, who had resigned over conflict of interest charges. Haynsworth was opposed by a coalition of Democrats (possibly in retaliation for the Republicans' rejection of Fortas as Chief Justice), Rockefeller Republicans, and the NAACP. He was alleged to have made court decisions favoring segregation and of being reflexively anti-labor. Democratic United States Senator Philip Hart of Michigan said that Haynsworth's decisions on civil rights and labor/management were \\"unacceptable,\\" while Republican Senator Marlow Cook of Kentucky argued that Haynsworth was being \\"subjected to a character assassination that is unjustified.\\" Cook argued that Haynsworth was \\"a man of honesty and a man of integrity\\".http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/War- Protests/12303189849225-3/#title \\"Supreme Court: 1969 Year in Review,\\" UPI.com Controversy erupted over his rulings affirming the decision by local authorities to close the Prince Edward County schools to avoid integration, upholding the constitutionality of school voucher programs used to fund segregated private schools and supporting the management of the Darlington Manufacturing Company in South Carolina over its closing of the factory allegedly over unionisation. Haynsworth was also accused of ruling in cases in which he had a financial interest, although this claim was never proved. Haynsworth was later termed a \\"moderate\\" who was \\"close in outlook\\" to John Paul Stevens, a 1975 nominee of President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Haynsworth's nomination was defeated by a vote of 55 to 45 on November 21, 1969. Nineteen Democrats ‚Äì of whom only Mike Gravel of Alaska represented a state outside the South ‚Äì and 26 Republicans voted for Haynsworth while 38 Democrats and seventeen Republicans voted against the nomination. Haynsworth was the first Supreme Court nominee to be defeated by the Senate since the rejection of Judge John J. Parker (also of the Fourth Circuit) in 1930. Nixon then nominated G. Harrold Carswell, who was also rejected by the Senate. Nixon eventually nominated Harry Blackmun, who was confirmed by the Senate. Honor The Clement F.

It links the process of decompressing frames from a video source to the rest of the Quartz technologies for image rendering and composition. Both QuickTime X and QuickTime 7 depend on Core Video.  Overview  Core Video provides both a buffering model and a playback synchronization solution within its processing pipeline. A video source provides a decompressed data stream to be rendered as images within a visual context in Quartz 2D. Core Video can be thought of as the link between this video source and its display context. Rendered images can be further processed by Core Image before being composed into a final scene with Quartz Compositor. As part of the composition process, Core Video maintains a frame buffer, keeping a pool of rendered, composed frames ready for playback. To ensure smooth playback, Core Video uses a high-priority thread to maintain its frame buffer. This display link runs independently from the application which invokes video playback, and it compensates for different display refresh rates and latency. Because QuickTime 7 employed Core Video, it was the first version of QuickTime to implement the rendering capability of Quartz. Previous versions of QuickTime used QuickDraw for rendering. Although Core Video typically interacts with QuickTime, it can interact with any video source. Core Video benefits from graphics processor (GPU) rendering and composition provided by Quartz GL, Core Image, and Quartz Extreme, since final playback is composed on an OpenGL surface.  History  Although Core Video was introduced with the release of Mac OS X v10.4, it is included in the installation of QuickTime 7 on Mac OS X; thus, Core Video is available for Mac OS X 10.3.9 with QuickTime 7 installed as well. In Mac OS X 10.4, Core Video is implemented as part of the QuartzCore framework; in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, it resides in its own framework.

Pole's career was nearly ended by an injury during a game against the Orioles on June 30, 1975, when a line drive by Tony Muser struck him in the face. The ball had been hit so hard that it bounced into foul territory near third base, scoring two runs on the play. Pole sustained a broken jaw and damage to the retina of his right eye. The damaged eye never fully recovered, and he ultimately lost ninety percent of the vision in that eye.Boston Red Sox - Sox get a scare as line drive hits Clement - The Boston Globe Pole recovered from his injuries in time to pitch in the 1975 World Series, walking the only two batters he faced in a 6-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds in Game 5. The Red Sox ultimately lost the series in seven games. At the end of the 1976 season, Pole became one of the inaugural members of the Seattle Mariners franchise, as they selected him from the Red Sox with the seventh pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft. Pole spent 1977 and 1978 with the Mariners, but his performance was not up to the standard he had set in Boston, possibly due to effects from the injury.

After the end of his Major League career, he continued to play professionally in Mexico. Coaching career Pole began his coaching career in the Chicago Cubs' minor league system in 1983, and joined their Major League coaching staff in 1988, working as pitching coach for Don Zimmer. Pole remained in that capacity through 1991, during which time he oversaw the development of Greg Maddux. Maddux credits Pole as a major influence, and a significant contributor to his success. In a 2005 interview, he said, \\"I remember when Dick Pole told me one day, 'Why don't you stop trying to strike guys out? Just try to get them out, and you'll probably strike out just as many guys, if not more. He was right. I've always tried with two strikes just to make a pitch and get the guy out.

''''' () is a Latin adage translated as \\"If you want peace, prepare for war\\". Background The phrase ' is adapted from a statement found in Latin author Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus's tract De Re Militari (4th or 5th century AD), in which the actual phrasing is Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum (\\"Therefore let him who desires peace get ready for war.\\"). The idea which it conveys also appears in earlier works such as Plato's Nomoi (Laws) and the Chinese Shi Ji.Plato, Laws, 1.628c9‚Äìe1.Martin Ostwald, Language and History in Ancient Greek Culture (2009), p. 87. The phrase presents the counter-intuitive insight that the conditions of peace are often preserved by a readiness to make war when necessitated. Notable uses Apotheosis of Napoleon, Andrea Appiani, 1807. Whatever the source, the adage has become a living vocabulary item itself, used in the production of different ideas in a number of languages. =Si vis bellum para pacem= For example, historian Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne made reference to the foreign policy of Napoleon Bonaparte:De Bourrienne, p. 418. :Everyone knows the adage... Had Bonaparte been a Latin scholar he would probably have reversed it and said, Si vis bellum para pacem. In other words, a leader who is planning a war should put other nations off guard by cultivating peace. Conversely, another interpretation could be that preparing for peace may lead another party to wage war. =Si vis pacem para pactum= The idea of ensuring peace by deterring warlike powers through armaments took an ominous turn in the 20th century with the increased militarism of Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers, suggesting that perhaps merely being prepared for war is not enough and that it is necessary to wage war in order to deter war. In the United States, the National Arbitration and Peace Congress of 1907, presided over by Andrew Carnegie, had addressed this issue years earlier: :These vast armaments on land and water are being defended as a means, not to wage war, but to prevent war.... there is a safer way ... it requires only the consent and the good-will of the governments. Today they say .... If you want peace, prepare for war. This Congress says in behalf of the people: Si vis pacem, para pactum, if you want peace, agree to keep the peace.Bertholdt, p. 333 =Si vis pacem fac bellum= \\"If you want peace, make war\\". The solution does not cover the case of the nation that does not desire peace. Imperial Germany went to war in 1914 and was castigated by Richard Grelling, a German-Jewish pacifist, in J'Accuse (1915). In 1918 Grelling wrote again, this time as an expatriate in Switzerland. Citing Woodrow Wilson's \\"The world must be safe for democracy\\" speech before Congress on April 2, 1917, Grelling says:Grelling, p. 208. :When all other means fail, ... the liberation of the world from military domination can in the extreme case only take place by battle. ... in place of si vis pacem para bellum a similarly sounding principle ... may become a necessity: Si vis pacem, fac bellum. =Si vis pacem para pacem= \\"If you want peace, prepare for peace.\\" The great wars of the 19th and 20th centuries were opposed by the philosophy of pacifism, which in the 19th century was associated with early socialism, even though the socialism of the 20th century often lacked pacifistic tendencies, preaching violent revolution instead. The pacifism that opposed the world wars traced its lineage to Barth√©lemy Prosper Enfantin, an early French socialist and one of the founders of Saint-Simonianism. As early as April 2, 1841, he had said in a letter to General Saint-Cyr Nugues:de Saint- Simon, Enfantin, p. 34. :Le fameux dicton ... me semble beaucoup moins vrai, pour le XIXe si√®cle, que Si vis pacem, para pacem. :The famous dictum ... seems to me much less true, for the 19th century, than Si vis pacem, para pacem. with reference to Algeria. By way of elucidation Enfantin goes on to say that war could have been avoided if a proper study of Algeria had been made. =The parabellum= Luger model P08 (1908) chambered in 9mm Parabellum The main clause of the adage was used as a motto by German arms maker Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM), and is the source of the term Parabellum as applied to firearms and ammunition (especially the 9mm Parabellum cartridge). The term is an opposed parallel to the American use of \\"peacemaker\\" to mean the Colt Single Action Army handgun.

While Lucky Luke revisited factual events in Wild West history, Punaniska mostly had completely fictional stories, most of which were absurdly humorous. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wallu.htm Despite depicting a unilingually English culture, the comic was unilingually Finnish. A great deal of its humour depended on Finnish puns that were difficult, if not impossible, to translate into foreign languages. Still, one album was published in Germany in 1993. The comic began in the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomathttps://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wallu.htm , replacing an earlier Finnish comic strip called Taneli, a comic about a kindergarten-aged boy. It quickly rose in popularity and spawned fifteen comic book albums, which featured Punaniska comics drawn also by other Finnish artists (and some others, too, like Hunt Emerson https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wallu.htmfrom Birmingham, England), and articles about the American Wild West. In 2003 it started again, now in a small Finnish golf magazine called \\"Gaddie-magazine\\". This new comic strip is called Viheri√∂iden Punaniska \\"Redneck on the Green\\" and here Punaniska plays the old Western style golf. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/w/wallu.htm Characters * Punaniska : The main character. Modelled after Rauli Nordberg, writer of this comic strip, Punaniska was a stereotypical \\"rough and tough\\" cowboy. He had a taste for whiskey and women, and an itchy trigger finger. His most notable characteristic was his poor personal hygiene. * Dolly : A beautiful woman whom Punaniska lusted after. The relation was mostly (but not entirely) one- directional, as Dolly didn't care much for Punaniska. Dolly's profession was apparently a singer at a saloon. * Calamity Jane : In the comic, Calamity Jane was an ugly old woman who lusted after Punaniska. Because of her appearance, Punaniska despised her, and did everything he could to get away from her. However, like the real Calamity Jane, the character was good with a shotgun and had ways of getting her man. * Billy the Kid : Like Lucky Luke, the comic emphasised \\"the Kid\\" aspect, carrying it even further. Where the Billy the Kid in Lucky Luke was a pre-teenaged brat, the Billy the Kid in Punaniska was an infant, who hadn't even learned to walk yet. He talked in baby-talk, pronouncing \\"R\\" as \\"L\\" (which led to some untranslatable Finnish puns), and was sometimes overruled by his mother. * T√∂rtt√∂-Bill : A wannabe cowboy, with good intentions, but had a serious lack of intelligence. He wore a raccoon hat. * Psycos-Bill : An outlaw, famous for the duels he had fought. At one time he showed his revolver gun, whose handle had dwindled to almost nothing due to all the notches he had carved.

The column was syndicated throughout the U.S. and Canada. Cohen is also known as the author of several books, a playwright, and the host of the public radio show Person Place Thing. Career Cohen graduated from the University at Albany, SUNY in 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts in music. He received an MFA in music composition from the California Institute of the Arts. In 2011, Cohen received the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University at Albany. He spent several years \\"writing humor pieces, essays, and stories for leading newspapers and magazines,\\" including The New Yorker, Harper's, and The Atlantic; his first paid, published piece was in 1976 for The Village Voice. In 1981, his book of satiric letters, Modest Proposals, was published by St. Martin's Press. In 1989, his collection of humor pieces, Diary of a Flying Man, was published by Knopf. In 2002 The Good, the Bad, & the Difference: How to Tell Right from Wrong in Everyday Situations was published by Doubleday. His book Be Good: How to Navigate the Ethics of Everything was released by Chronicle Books in August 2012. Cohen was a writer on Late Night with David Letterman for 950 episodes over seven years, starting in 1984. He shared in three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing for his work on the show. Perhaps his biggest contribution was the invention of Letterman's famous feature, the \\"Top Ten List.\\" Cohen wrote for TV Nation, sharing in a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series in 1995. In 1996, he became the original head writer for The Rosie O'Donnell Show. Cohen wrote for Slate starting in 1996. At Slate, he became known for \\"News Quiz\\", a satiric reader- participation feature which began in February 1998 and ended in November 2000. He also co-wrote a first-season episode of Ed, first broadcast on February 14, 2001. Cohen wrote The Ethicist column in The New York Times Magazine between 1999 and 2011. From 2001 to 2005, he also answered listeners' questions on ethics for the National Public Radio radio news program, All Things Considered. The Times ended Cohen's stint as The Ethicist, making his final column Sunday, February 27, 2011. The column continued with the same format but a new byline until early 2015, when it abandoned the question and answer format for a discussion format among a number of persons. Cohen donated $585 to MoveOn.org's voter registration effort in 2004, apparently in violation of Times policy, which had banned political donations in 2003. The Spokane, Wash., Spokesman-Review decided on June 20, 2007, to drop Cohen's column, which had been scheduled to begin running in the paper on the following Saturday, because of his donation. Cohen responded that he saw no ethical violation, because he viewed MoveOn as no more activist than other organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America. Nonetheless, he said he would not make such donations in the future. Cohen wrote a play about the eighteenth century boxing champion Daniel Mendoza. The Punishing Blow debuted in 2009 at the Woodstock Fringe Festival and ran in 2010 at Manhattan's Clurman Theater. In winter 2012, public radio station WAMC launched Cohen's new show Person Place Thing. In the show's first season, Cohen interviewed guests Dick Cavett, Jane Smiley, Susie Essman, Dave Cowens, Michael Pollan, John Hockenberry, Rickie Lee Jones, Ed Koch, Samantha Bee, RL Stine, and Sir Roger Bannister.http://personplacething.org/  Cohen's ethical beliefs  In a public speech archived as a podcast on the New York Times podcast website, Cohen outlines his personal beliefs about ethics as being ultimately dependent on a person's immediate circumstances, while dismissing the notion that personal moral character might influence an individual's ethics. Cohen categorically rejects the idea that individual people are inherently good or bad, asserting that in his opinion all individuals have in them the capacity to do good or bad at different times, in different contexts. In Cohen's view of ethics, individuals are all more or less the same with respect to ethics, but society is often to blame for the very existence of an ethical dilemma, which aligns him (by his own admission) with many of the beliefs of the Society for Ethical Culture; a fundamental premise of this ethical framework is that humans are morally obligated to promote changes in society so all people can lead more ethical lives.

M√°rio Sacramento was born in √çlhavo, Aveiro District and studied medicine in Coimbra, Lisbon, Porto and finally graduated in Paris. He started his writing activity very soon and became a regular contributor to several newspapers and magazines, such as \\"O Diabo\\" (The Devil), \\"Sol Nascente\\" (Rising Sun), \\"V√©rtice\\" or the \\"Di√°rio de Lisboa\\" (Lisbon Daily). Sacramento also published several essays about E√ßa de Queiroz, Moniz Barreto, Ces√°rio Verde, Fernando Namora or Fernando Pessoa, that made him become a respected person among the Portuguese intellectuals. Due to his intellectual activities and Anti-fascist and democratic feelings, Sacramento soon developed connections to the Portuguese Communist Party, at the time, the only organized resistance movement against the dictatorship. Because of that he became a member of the Central Commission of the youth wing of the Movement of Democratic Unity (Portuguese: Movimento de Unidade Democr√°tica - Juvenil or MUD), the only opposition movement \\"allowed\\" by the regime, that congregated almost all those who were against the dictature. There, he developed his political activities and became famous among the democratic resistance. He was one of the main organizers of the 1st and 2nd Republican Congresses in Aveiro, congresses that in a somewhat secret way, traced important guidelines to the anti-fascist struggle, and was honored in the 3rd, that was only carried out after his death. Sacramento was arrested for 5 times by the political police, the PIDE, the first one in 1938, when he was a member of the students union in a highschool in Aveiro. Nowadays, M√°rio Sacramento is one of the most well-known persons of Aveiro, and his name is present in several places like schools, streets and avenues. \\\\--- ¬´M√°rio Sacramento, La vie et l'Oeuvre¬ª, These de Doctorat, Sorbonne, DEC. 2002¬ª [doctors degree thesis, in Sorbonne] by Eunice de Almeida Malaquias Vouillot : M√°rio Sacramento, a Neo-Realism Portuguese writer, his life and work, is a two-volumes biography, divided into four parts. The first three parts relate the essayist's life, who was born in Ilhavo, on July 7, 1920, and who died on March 27, 1969, in Porto. His fondness for literature was revealed when he was a teenager. His struggle for social justice under the ¬´Estado Novo¬ª repressive regime led him five times to prison, between 1938 and 1962. He ended his medical studies in 1946 at Lisbon University where he had participated to the ¬´MUD Juvenil¬ª Central Commission. He organized the First Republican Congress in 1957. In 1961, he graduated in gastroenterology, in Paris. He took part in many political and literary demonstrations, and in two conferences on childhood. His first essay, E√ßa de Queir√≥s, uma Est√©tica da Ironia (1945) was awarded the Oliveira Martins prize. Other essays such as Fernando Pessoa, Poeta da Hora Absurda (1959), Fernando Namora, a Obra e o Homem (1967), H√° uma Est√©tica Neo-Realista? (1968) have punctuated his life. We have gathered according to themes his three prefaces and his articles gathered within the three books Ensaios de Domingo (1959,1974, 1990) which raised him to the rank of Neo-Realism theorist, as well as articles about his dialogue with Catholics (1967-1969) where he affirms his humanistic convictions and open-mindedness in Fr√°tria, Di√°logo com os Cat√≥licos (1971).

These men, who would be known as the Beckett Land Company, consisted of Conant, Elijah Alford, Nathan Birchard, Gideon Bush, Dillingham Clark, Elisha Clark, Isaac Clark, Benjamin Higley, Aaron P. Jagger, Enos Kingsley, Jeremiah Lyman, Bill Messenger, Ebenezer Messenger, Benjamin C. Perkins, John Seely, and Alpheus Streator. On November 11, 1810, the Beckett Land Company purchased about from Caleb Strong. The land was divided into 100 lots, and allotted according to each family's investment in the company. Conant, his wife Elizabeth, Dillingham and Abigail Clark, and Alpheus and Anna Streator donated portions of their allotments near the center of the township for a village green, which was common practice for townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The group of sixteen families then departed from Massachusetts on May 2, 1811.Windham - 1811 - 1850 Six weeks later, they arrived in the purchased survey township, which was located immediately south of Nelson Township in the Connecticut Western Reserve. This new township, known today as Windham Township, was survey town 4 in range 6 of the Western Reserve. The first religious service in the new township was held on July 28, 1811 in the home of one of the settlers. This service was very likely Congregationalist, as several of the families belonged to the Congregational Church in Becket, Massachusetts. The Congregational Church eventually constructed a building on the Green, and today that church still remains on the Green as a member church of the United Church of Christ. The Windham Historical Society notes that the township was originally named Strongsburg, however, some sources cite the original name as Strongsburgh. The namesake was original landowner Caleb Strong, who was by then the Governor of Massachusetts. There is some discrepancy in how this township came to be known as Windham. According to the Windham Historical Society, the name of the township \\"was changed to Sharon, by an act of legislature in about 1820‚Ä¶. A few years later the name was again changed to Windham, which it has remained to present.\\" The Historical Society also cites political concerns as the reason the name was changed from Strongsburg to Sharon. However, on Windham Township's website, March 2, 1813 is cited as the date on which \\"the Township was made a district by itself and the name was changed to 'Sharon'.\\" The website goes on to state that in 1820, by an act of legislature, the name was changed again to Windham. Yet another source, The Ohio Gazetteer, and Travelers's Guide, states that the name was changed from Sharon to Windham in January, 1829. Still another source places these dates as 1817 and 1820, respectively. Common to most sources are a few claims which reasonably can be ascertained to be fact: * Caleb Strong was the original namesake of the township. * The name of the township was changed from Strongsburg/Strongsburgh, to Sharon, and again to Windham. * The second name change, from Sharon to Windham, was in honor of Windham, Connecticut‚Äîhome to at least some of the township's original settlers. Government The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1.

Geography Located in the northeastern part of the county, it borders the following townships and municipalities: The village of Windham, which became independent of the township in 1993,Census Bureau data is almost completely surrounded by Windham Township. The village of Windham borders Braceville Township in Trumbull County at the village's easternmost boundary. Formed from Town 4, Range 6 of the Connecticut Western Reserve, Windham Township covers an area of 23 sq mi. The township is nearly bisected from east to west by Interstate 80, also known as the Ohio Turnpike. The Ravenna Training and Logistics Site covers most of the southern half of the township. Hiram Township once adjoined Windham Township at the latter's northwesternmost point. When the village of Garrettsville annexed this portion of Hiram Township, that ceased to be true.Hiram Township website References External links *County website *Windham Chamber of Commerce (WindhamOhio.net) Category:Townships in Portage County, Ohio Category:Populated places established in 1813 Category:English-American culture in Ohio Category:Townships in Ohio ","title":"Windham Township, Portage County, Ohio"},{"id":"1921259","text":"An ab anbar (water reservoir) with double domes and windcatchers (openings near the top of the towers) in the central desert city of Yazd, Iran A windcatcher (wind tower, wind scoop) is a traditional architectural element used to create natural ventilation and passive cooling in buildings. Windcatchers come in various designs: unidirectional, bidirectional, and multidirectional. Windcatchers are widely used in North Africa and in the West Asian countries around the Persian Gulf, and have been for the past three thousand years. Neglected by modern architects in the latter half of the 20th century, the early 21st century saw them used again, to increase ventilation and cut power demand for air-conditioning. Generally, the cost of construction for a windcatcher-ventilated building is less than that of a similar building with conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The maintenance costs are also lower. Unlike powered air-conditioning and fans, windcatchers are silent and continue to function when the electrical grid power fails (a particular concern in places where grid power is unreliable and expensive, such as India and California). Windcatchers rely on local weather and microclimate conditions, and not all techniques will work everywhere; local factors must be taken into account in design. Structure and function Windcatchers vary dramatically in shape, including height, cross-sectional area, and internal sub-divisions and filters. The construction of a windcatcher depends on the prevailing wind direction at that specific location: if the wind tends to blow from only one side, it may have only one opening, and no internal partitions. In areas with more variable wind directions, there may also be radial internal walls, which divide the windtower into vertical sections. These sections are like parallel chimneys, but with openings to the side, pointing in multiple directions. More sections reduce the flow rate, but increase the efficiency at suboptimal wind angles. If the wind hits the opening square-on, it will go in, but if it hits it at a sufficiently oblique angle, it will tend to slip around the tower, instead. Windcatchers in areas with stronger winds will have smaller total cross- sections, and areas with very hot wind may have many smaller shafts in order to cool the incoming air. Windtowers with square horizontal cross-sections are more efficient than round ones, as the sharp angles make the flow less laminar, encouraging flow separation; suitable shaping increases suction. Taller windcatchers catch higher winds. Higher winds blow stronger and cooler (and in a different direction). Higher airs are also usually less dusty. If the wind is dusty or polluted, or there are insect-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever, then air filtering may be necessary. Some dust can be dumped at the bottom of the windcatcher as the air slows (see diagram), and more can be filtered out by suitable plantings or insect mesh. Physical filters generally reduce throughflow, unless the flow is very gusty. It may also be possible to fully or partially close the windcatcher off. The short, wide right-triangle-prism are usually bidirectional, set in symmetrical pairs, and are often used with a (evaporative cooling unit) and a (roof lantern vent). Wide s are more often used in damper climates, where high-volume air flow is more important compared to evaporative cooling. In hotter climates, they are narrower, and air is cooled on its way in. They are more commonly used in Africa. , on the other hand, are multisided (usually 4-sided), and they are typically tall towers (up to 34 meters tall) which can be closed in winter. They are more common in the Gulf region and in areas with dust storms. Taller windcatchers also have a stronger stack effect. Windcatching has gained some ground in Western architecture, and there are several commercial products using the name windcatcher. Some modern windcatchers use sensor-controlled moving parts or even solar-powered fans to make a semi-passive ventilation and semi-passive cooling systems. Windscoops have long been used on ships. Windcatchers have also been used experimentally to cool outdoor areas in cities, with mixed results; traditional methods include narrow, walled spaces, parks and winding streets, which act as cold-air reservoirs, and takhtabush- like arrangements (see sections on night flushing and convection, below). =Cooling methods= Night-flushing cools the house by increasing ventilation at night, when the outdoor air is cooler; windtowers can assist night flushing. A windcatcher can also cool air by drawing it over cool objects. In arid climates, the daily temperature swings are often extreme, with desert temperatures often dipping below freezing night. The thermal inertia of the soil evens out the daily and even annual temperature swings. Even the thermal inertia of thick masonry walls will keep a building warmer at night and cooler during the day. Windcatchers can thus cool by drawing air over night- or winter-cooled materials, which act as heat reservoirs. Windcatchers that cool by drawing air over water use the water as a heat reservoir, but if the air is dry, they are also cooling the air with evaporative cooling. The heat in the air goes into evaporating some of the water, and will not be released until the water re-condenses. This is a very effective way of cooling dry air. Simply moving the air also has a cooling effect. Humans cool themselves using evaporative cooling when they sweat. A draft disrupts the boundary layer of body-warmed and water-saturated air clinging to the skin, so a human will feel cooler in moving air than in stagnant air of the same temperature. =Forces to move air= A pair of short windcatchers or used in traditional architecture; wind is forced down on the windward side and leaves on the leeward side. In the center, a (roof lantern vent), used to shade the qa'a below while allowing hot air rise out of it. The windcatcher can function in two ways: directing airflow using the pressure of wind blowing into the windcatcher, or directing airflow using buoyancy forces from temperature gradients (stack effect). The relative importance of these two forces has been debated. The importance of windpressure obviously increases with increasing wind speed, and is generally more important than buoyancy under most conditions in which the windcatcher is working effectively. Airflow speed is also important, especially for evaporative cooling (since it only works on dry air, and humidifies the air). It is possible for a windtower-ventilated building to have very high flow rates; 30 airchanges/hour were measured in one experiment. Uniform, stable flow with no stagnant corners is important. Turbulent flow should therefore be avoided; laminar flow is more effective at maintaining human comfort (for an extreme example, see Tesla valve). Other elements are often used in combination with the windcatchers to cool and ventilate: courtyards, domes, walls, and fountains, for instance, as integral parts of an overall ventilation and heat-management strategy. Airflow from wind pressure If a windcatcher's open side faces the prevailing wind, it can \\"catch\\" it, and bring it down into the heart of the building. Suction from the lee side of a windtower is also an important driving force, usually somewhat more constant and less gusty than the pressure on the upwind side.(see Venturi effect and Bernoulli's principle). Routing the wind through the building cools the people in the building interior. The air flows through the house, and leaves from the other side, creating a through-draft; the rate of airflow itself can provide a cooling effect. Windcatchers have been employed in this manner for thousands of years. The windtower essentially creates a pressure gradient to draw air through the building. Windtowers topped with horizontal airfoils have been built to enhance these pressure gradients. The shape of the traditional roof also creates suction as wind blows over it. Airflow from convection Vertical temperature gradient cause by stable stratification of air inside a room. Note hot air rising from the person. Buoyancy is usually not the main effect driving windcatcher air circulation during the day. In a windless environment, a windcatcher can still function using the stack effect. The hot air, which is less dense, tends to travel upwards and escape out the top of the house via the windtower. Heating of the windtower itself can heat the air inside (making it a solar chimney), so that it rises and pulls air out of the top of the house, creating a draft. This effect can be enhanced with a heat source at the bottom of the windtower (such as humans, ~80 Watts each}, but this heats the house and makes it less comfortable. A more practical technique is to cool the air as it flows down and in, using heat reservoirs and/or evaporative cooling. A takhtabush is a space similar to the ancient Roman tablinum, opening both onto a heavily- shaded courtyard and onto a rear garden court (the garden side being shaded with a lattice). It is designed to capture a cross-draft. The breeze is at least partly driven by convection (since one court will generally be warmer than the other), and may also be driven by wind pressure and evaporative cooling, so the garden and courtyard are used as windcatchers. Buoyancy forces are used to cause night flushing (see below). Night flushing The diurnal temperature cycle means that the night air is colder than the daytime air; in arid climates, much colder. This creates appreciable buoyancy forces. Buildings may be designed to spontaneously increase ventilation at night. Courtyards in hot climates fill with cold air at night. This cold air then flows from the courtyard into adjacent rooms. The cold night air will flow in easily, as it is more dense than the rising warm air it is displacing. But in the day, the courtyard walls and awning shade it, while the air outside is heated by the sun. The cool masonry will also chill the nearby air. The courtyard air will become stably stratified, the hot air floating on top of the cold air with little mixing. The fact that the openings are at the top will trap the cool air below, though it cannot cause the temperature to drop below the nightly minimum temperature. This mechanism also works in windtowers. =Subterranean cooling= earth-sheltered room which may be ventilated with windcatchers. The fountain pool adds evaporative cooling. A windcatcher can also cool air by bringing into contact with cool thermal masses. These are often found underground. Below approximately 6m of depth, soil and groundwater is always at about the annual mean-average temperature (MATT) (it is this depth which is used for many ground-source heat pumps, often loosely referred to as \\"geothermal heat pumps\\" by laypeople The author issued an updated version of this article in February 2001.). The thermal inertia of the soil evens out the daily and even annual temperature swings. In arid climates, the daily temperature swings are often extreme, with desert temperatures often dipping below freezing at night. Even the thermal inertia of thick masonry walls will keep a building warmer at night and cooler during the day; in hot-arid climates, thick walls with high thermal mass (adobe, stone, brick) are common (though thinner walls with high resistance against heat transmission are more modernly sometimes used). Windcatchers can thus cool by drawing air over night- or winter-cooled materials, which act as heat reservoirs. Windcatchers are also often used to ventilate lower-level indoor spaces (e.g. shabestans), which maintain frigid temperatures in the middle of the day even without windcatchers. Ice houses are traditionally used to store water frozen overnight in desert areas, or over winter in temperate areas. They may use windcatchers to circulate air into an underground or semi- underground chamber, evaporatively cooling the ice so that it melts only slowly and stays fairly dry (see lede image). At night, the windcatchers may even bring sub-freezing night air underground, helping to freeze ice. =Evaporative cooling= A windcatcher and qanat used for cooling In dry climates, the evaporative cooling effect may be used by placing water at the air intake, such that the draft draws air over water and then into the house. For this reason, it is sometimes said that the fountain, in the architecture of hot, arid climates, is like the fireplace in the architecture of cold climates. Windcatchers are used for evaporative cooling in combination with a qanat, or underground canal (which also makes use of the subterranean heat reservoir described above). In this method, the open side of the tower faces away from the direction of the prevailing wind (the tower's orientation may be adjusted by directional ports at the top). When only the leeward side is left open, air is drawn upwards using the CoandƒÉ effect. This sucks air into an intake on the other side of the building. The hot air is brought down into the qanat tunnel and is cooled by coming into contact with the cool earthThe earth stays cool by virtue of being several meters below the surface. The insulation and heat capacity of the overlying earth maintains the same stable temperature day and night, and as nights in arid climate are quite cold, often below freezing, that stable temperature is quite cool. and the cold water running through the qanat. The air is also evaporatively cooled when some of the water in the qanat evaporates as the hot, dry surface air passes over it; the heat energy in the air is absorbed as energy of vaporization. The dry air is thus also humidified before entering the building. The cooled air is drawn up through the house and finally out the windcatcher, again by the CoandƒÉ effect. On the whole, the cool air flows through the building, decreasing the structure's overall temperature. A is a type of fountain with a thin sheet of flowing water, shaped to maximize surface area and thus evaporative cooling. Windcatchers are often used with salasabils may be used to maximize the flow of unsaturated air over the water surface and carry the cooled air to where it is needed in the building. Wetted matting can also be hung inside the windcatcher to cool incoming air. This can reduce flow, especially in weak winds. However, it can also produce a downdraft of cool air in windless conditions. The evaporative cooling within a windtower causes the air in the tower to sink, driving circulation. This is called passive downdraught evaporative cooling (PDEC). It may also be generated using spray nozzles *which have a tendency to get blocked if the water is hard) or cold-water cooling coils (like hydronic underfloor heating in reverse.  Regional use  =Africa= In Egypt windcatchers are known as malqaf, pl. malaaqef. They are generally shaped as right triangular prisms with the vertical side left open and facing directly up or down wind (one of each per building). They work best if oriented within 10 degrees of wind direction; larger angles allow the wind to escape. Windcatchers were used in traditional ancient Egyptian architecture,Air-conditioning avoidance and only started to fall out of use in the mid-1900s C.E.. Their use is now being re-examined, as air conditioning accounts for 60% of Egypt's peak electrical power demand (and thus the need for 60% of its generating capacity). Windcatchers in Egypt are often used in conjunction with other passive cooling elements.

The devices were used in Achaemenid architecture. (the English is hard to understancd) In Iran, they are used in the hot, dry areas of the Central Plateau, and in the hot, humid coastal regions. Central Iran shows large diurnal temperature variation with an arid climate. Most buildings are constructed from thick ceramic with high insulation values. Towns centered on desert oases tend to be packed very closely together with high walls and ceilings, maximizing shade at ground level. The heat of direct sunlight is minimized with small windows that face away from the sun. The windcatcher's effectiveness had led to its routine use as a refrigerating device in Iran. Many traditional water reservoirs (ab anbars), which are capable of storing water at near freezing temperatures during summer months, are built with windcatchers. The evaporative cooling effect is strongest in the driest climates, such as on the Iranian plateau, leading to the ubiquitous use of windcatchers in drier areas such as Yazd, Kerman, Kashan, Sirjan, Nain, and Bam. Windcatchers tend to have one, four, or eight openings. In the city of Yazd, all windcatchers are four- or eight- sided. The construction of a windcatcher depends on the direction of airflow at that specific location: if the wind tends to blow from only one side, it is built with only one downwind opening. This is the style most commonly seen in Meybod, 50 kilometers from Yazd: the windcatchers are short and have a single opening. Windcatchers in Iran may be quite elaborate, due to their use as status symbols. A small windcatcher is called a shish-khan in traditional Persian architecture. Shish-khans can still be seen on top of ab anbars in Qazvin and other northern cities in Iran. These seem to function more as ventilators than as the temperature regulators seen in the central deserts of Iran.

Dempster founded the bank George Dempster & Co. (also known as the Dundee Banking Company) in 1763, was a Director of the East India Company from 1769, and served as Provost of St Andrews (1780) and a Director of the Highland Society of Scotland (1789). Dempster, nicknamed Honest Georgehttps://abertay.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/ArtfulandAmbitiousIndividual_r.pdf, was a key figure of the Scottish Enlightenment and respected as an \\"independently minded, incorruptible and moderately radical MP\\". He dedicated the later years of his life to improving Scottish fishing and agriculture and improving the living conditions of his tenants. He was a lifelong friend of the philosopher Adam Ferguson and the minister Alexander Carlyle. Life and work George Dempster was born in 1732 in Dundee, the son of John Dempster 2nd Laird of Dunnichen (near Forfar), a Dundee merchant, and Isabel Ogilvie. George's date of birth is unclear, and has alternatively been given as 8 February or 8 December. He was educated at Dundee Grammar School (c1739‚Äìc1748) and possibly also at the small parish school at Leuchars, Fife. On 24 February 1748 he entered the University of St Andrews and studied there until about 1750, when he left without taking a degree and moved on to study law at the University of Edinburgh. He also studied at the Acad√©mie Royale in Brussels. Dempster was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1755; and about the same time became a member of the Select Society, later becoming a director of this pre-eminent literary and intellectual society of the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1762 he joined the Poker Club of Edinburgh, and may have been a co-founder of this influential body, He, Andrew Erskine, and James Boswell were joint authors and a \\"triumvirate of wit\\", although he later regretted at least one of their attacks, the Critical Strictures on the New Tragedy of Elvira, as he believed the tragedy was better than anything he or his co-authors could have done. He served as Member of Parliament for the Perth Burghs (1761-8 and 1769‚Äì90). Dempster was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1788, upon the proposal of Dr Thomas Anderson, Henry Duncan and John Playfair. He died at Dunnichen, Angus, on 13 February 1818, and was interred at Restenneth Priory, Forfar.
