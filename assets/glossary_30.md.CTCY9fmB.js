The squadron was formed in early 1939 and saw active service in World War II as a fleet co-operation unit providing aircrews for seaplanes operating off Royal Australian Navy cruisers. It was disbanded in late 1944, but was re-raised in 1962 and later became an Army co-operation unit, flying helicopters in support of Australian troops during the Vietnam War. The squadron was disbanded in 1989 when the RAAF transferred its battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army's aviation regiments. History=Fleet co-operation No. 9 Squadron was formed on 1 January 1939 at RAAF Base Richmond by renumbering No. 5 Squadron. On formation, the squadron's first commanding officer was a Royal Air Force officer, Squadron Leader J.A.S. Brown. As Australia's only fleet co- operation squadron No. 9 Squadron operated amphibious aircraft from the Royal Australian Navy's heavy and light cruisers; each cruiser was assigned a single Seagull or Walrus amphibian. During the Second World War aircraft from No. 9 Squadron saw action with their parent ships in most of the world's oceans, ranging from the Arctic to the South Pacific on vessels such as HMA Ships Hobart, Sydney, Australia, Perth and Canberra. The amphibians were used to provide their parent ships with reconnaissance, anti-submarine protection, artillery spotting and general support. While the amphibians provided important support during the early years of the war, as the war progressed the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) enjoyed considerable support from land and carrier based aircraft and the amphibians were no longer necessary. In early January 1943, the squadron was transferred to Bowen, Queensland, from where its aircraft flew patrol operations. During 1944, all remaining RAN cruisers had their catapults removed and No. 9 Squadron was disbanded at RAAF Base Rathmines on 31 December 1944. Casualties during the war amounted to 22 killed, many of whom were lost when the ships they were serving on were sunk. Army co-operation A No. 9 Squadron UH-1D in Vietnam, 1970. No. 9 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Williamtown on 11 June 1962 equipped initially with Walruses before being re-equipped with UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and moving to RAAF Base Fairbairn. While originally formed to provide the RAAF with a search and rescue capability, the squadron's main role rapidly became providing airlift to the Australian Army. The squadron deployed to South Vietnam in mid-1966 as part of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and began flying operations on 30 June 1966. The squadron provided the Task Force with part of its helicopter support, although most of it was provided by the US Army. Problems soon arose between No. 9 Squadron and Army commanders as the Air Board insisted \\"regulations, framed for peacetime, should apply\\". This limited the scope of No. 9 Squadron's operations, and according to Owen Eather, prevented the Iroquois helicopters from operating in \\"'insecure locations' or undertaking roles that were 'offensive'\\". Eather contends that this \\"exhibited a lack of awareness by the RAAF of the requirements of the ground force in South Vietnam\\", and it hampered Army operations to the extent that No. 9 Squadron was temporarily grounded. Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war RAAF, asserts however that the latter report is a myth and that squadron records indicate it operated constantly during the period of its supposed grounding between June and September 1966. During the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 two No. 9 Squadron Iroquois flown by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley completed a hazardous mission to resupply D Company, 6 RAR which was heavily outnumbered and running dangerously low on ammunition. The mission proved vital in ensuring the survival of the Australian infantry until a relief force could fight its way through from Nui Dat and was completed despite heavy rain and the risk of ground fire. Following the withdrawal of the Viet Cong a number of helicopters were used to evacuate the Australian casualties from the battlefield. RAAF- Army relations improved considerably following Long Tan. No. 9 Squadron subsequently developed new operational concepts and procedures, achieving consistently high rates of aircraft availability, mission success and a low loss rate. A close professional relationship was also developed with the Special Air Service which saw the squadron provide rapid and precise insertion and extraction of patrols into jungle landing zones at tree top height. Soldiers from the 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment unloading supplies from a No. 9 Squadron helicopter in 1967 While deployed to Vietnam, in 1967 the squadron was re-equipped with updated versions of the Iroquois, and was also reinforced with personnel from the RAN and the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Operations in South Vietnam proved hazardous, with aircrews regularly exposed to ground fire, poor flying conditions, nighttime medevacs and dangerously small jungle landing zones that were sometimes booby trapped with land mines. The unit lost seven Iroquois and two crewmen in action during its deployment. As part of the general Australian withdrawal, No. 9 Squadron departed South Vietnam on 8 December 1971. Upon its return to Australia, No. 9 Squadron was based at RAAF Base Amberley, where it continued to provide airlift to the Australian Army and search and rescue for the civilian community. Between 1982 and 1986, the squadron contributed eight aircraft and aircrew to the Australian helicopter detachment which formed part of the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. In 1986, the Australian Government decided to transfer all of the RAAF's battlefield helicopter capability to the Australian Army after a decision that all battlefield helicopters should be controlled directly by the Army ‚Äì a decision partly based on the Vietnam experience and problems that arose during the first few months of the deployment by having No. 9 Squadron based in Vung Tau under separate command, rather than co-located with 1 ATF at Nui Dat, approximately north. This had caused a number of problems with support for the task force with the Army initially regarding No. 9 Squadron as being unreliable and unwilling to expose themselves to enemy fire, unlike US Army units. During February 1988, No. 9 Squadron was re-equipped with S-70A Blackhawk helicopters. Upon converting to the new aircraft the squadron moved to Townsville where it was disbanded on 14 February 1989. The squadron's aircrew and aircraft were then used to form 'A' Squadron of the Australian Army's 5th Aviation Regiment. The squadron's last commanding officer was Wing Commander (later Air Chief Marshal) Angus Houston. Aircraft operated No. 9 Squadron operated the following aircraft types: * Supermarine Seagull (1939‚Äì1944) * Supermarine Walrus (1939‚Äì1944 & 1962) * UH-1 Iroquois (1962‚Äì1988) * S-70A Blackhawk (1988‚Äì1989) NotesReferences   Further reading * External links * 9 R Category:Military units and formations established in 1939 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1989 9 9 Category:Cold War history of Australia ","title":"No. 9 Squadron RAAF"},{"id":"4112636","text":"Digital Compression System, or DCS, is a sound system developed by Williams Electronics.

It was established in 1906 as the Provincial Museum after Charles Noddings found a large boulder with a carved face on it in the Beaver Hills area on December 25, 1905. When Noddings donated it to the Province of Saskatchewan, the stimulus for a provincial museum was born. The first museum in Saskatchewan, and the first provincial museum in the three Prairie Provinces, the institution was formed to secure and preserve natural history specimens and objects of historical and ethnological interest. This museum received royal patronage from Queen Elizabeth II, and was renamed the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in 1993. History Between 1906 and 1945 the Museum occupied several premises including the Regina Trading Company Building, the Provincial Legislative Building, and the Normal School (the easternmost historic building on the \\"College Avenue\\" campus of the University of Regina). During the Second World War the Museum's collections were taken out of public display and stored initially in the General Motors Building (east on Dewdney Avenue) to permit the Normal School to be used for the Commonwealth Air Training Plan, and then, when the GM building was also requisitioned, in Pilkington's Glass Company Building. The collections returned to the Normal School in 1944 and opened to the public again in 1946. In 1953, the provincial government began construction of the current museum building on the corner of Albert Street and College Avenue, the site of the abandoned Chateau Qu'Appelle Hotel, as a Saskatchewan Golden Jubilee project. Partly for aesthetic reasons and partly to avoid the expansive task of uprooting the pilings, the museum was built on an angle with a large front lawn. The new premises were opened by Governor General Vincent Massey on May 16, 1955. To reflect the areas of devotion, the museum adopted the name Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History. This name remained until 1993 when they received royal designation from Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada and became the Royal Saskatchewan Museum.  Galleries  The Museum collection, then housed in the Provincial Legislative Building, was decimated by the 1912 Regina Cyclone. The collection was severely damaged again in 1990 when fire broke out in the First Nations Gallery, which was then under construction. Smoke damage required the museum to close for four months. Since then, the museum has undergone significant revitalization with the development of the First Nations Gallery, Life Sciences Gallery, acquisition of the T.rex Discovery Centre and the renovation of the Earth Sciences Gallery.  Earth Sciences Gallery  Life-size cast of Scotty CN T. rex Gallery From how the formation of the Earth provided Saskatchewan with rich mineral resources, to giant reptiles, dinosaurs and other extinct creatures that have lived in Saskatchewan during the past two billion years, the Earth Science Gallery describes Saskatchewan's fascinating ancient history and geological resources. = CN T. rex Gallery = On May 17, 2019 a life-size cast of Scotty, the world's largest T. rex went on display in the two-story CN T.rex Gallery, a gallery within the museum's Earth Science gallery. Originally discovered by Royal Saskatchewan Museum research team in Saskatchewan's Frenchman River Valley on August 16, 1991, specimen RSM P2523.8 is now on display in two locations in Saskatchewan, Regina and Eastend. The gallery highlights Scotty's injuries accumulated over its lifetime, and showcases the flora and fauna that lived alongside the T. rex.  First Nations Gallery  Opened on June 26, 1993, this gallery was a collaborative effort between researchers, Indigenous Elders, students and community members. Showcasing miniature and life-size dioramas, the gallery examines the culture, traditions, trade, treaties and communities of Saskatchewan's Indigenous people over the past 10,000 years.  Life Sciences Gallery  alt= Sixteen detailed life-size dioramas Illustrates the ecoregions and seasons of Saskatchewan. Opened on June, 2001 the gallery describes how different life forms are interconnected. In a celebration of Saskatchewan's landscapes and biodiversity, visitors can see what it's like inside a bear's den, a beaver's lodge or a snake's hibernaculum.  Collections  The museum's has a collection size of over 3.5 million, which includes 3 million archaeological artifacts, 250,000 insects, 37,500 fossils, 10,000 birds, 6,500 plants, 4,000 arachnids, 3,7000 mammals, 500 reptiles and 300 fish. This collection supports research that contributes to the knowledge of Saskatchewan's natural history and Indigenous cultures.  T.rex Discovery Centre  Exterior of the T.rex Discovery Centre, a museum in Eastend, Saskatchewan operated by RSM. On February 14, 2013 the Royal Saskatchewan Museum assumed operations of the T.rex Discovery Centre. Located in Eastend, Saskatchewan, the centre houses a number of fossils from the Cretaceous and Cenozoic periods. The T.rex Discovery Centre was established as a facility to house the fossil record of southwest Saskatchewan. The Town of Eastend, through a series of public meetings identified a need for a palaeontological centre to showcase the rich fossil record of the Frenchman River Valley and the Cypress Hills. The T.rex Discovery Centre opened in 2001 in the Frenchman River Valley, about southeast of Eastend.

The subgraph of blue edges is a sum of ten disjoint pentagons. In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph is a 7-regular undirected graph with 50 vertices and 175 edges. It is the unique strongly regular graph with parameters (50,7,0,1).. It was constructed by Alan Hoffman and Robert Singleton while trying to classify all Moore graphs, and is the highest-order Moore graph known to exist.. Since it is a Moore graph where each vertex has degree 7, and the girth is 5, it is a (7,5)-cage. Construction Here are two constructions of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph. Construction from pentagons and pentagrams Take five pentagons Ph and five pentagrams Qi . Join vertex j of Ph to vertex h¬∑i+j of Qi. (All indices are modulo 5.) Construction from PG(3,2) Take a Fano plane on seven elements, such as {abc, ade, afg, bef, bdg, cdf, ceg} and apply all 2520 even permutations on the 7-set abcdefg. Canonicalize each such Fano plane (e.g. by reducing to lexicographic order) and discard duplicates. Exactly 15 Fano planes remain. Each 3-set (triplet) of the set abcdefg is present in exactly 3 Fano planes. The incidence between the 35 triplets and 15 Fano planes induces PG(3,2), with 15 points and 35 lines. To make the Hoffman-Singleton graph, create a graph vertex for each of the 15 Fano planes and 35 triplets. Connect each Fano plane to its 7 triplets, like a Levi graph, and also connect disjoint triplets to each other like the odd graph O(4). A very similar construction from PG(3,2) is used to build the Higman-Sims graph, which has the Hoffman-Singleton graph as a subgraph. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph is a group of order isomorphic to PŒ£U(3,52) the semidirect product of the projective special unitary group PSU(3,52) with the cyclic group of order 2 generated by the Frobenius automorphism. It acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore, the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph is a symmetric graph. The stabilizer of a vertex of the graph is isomorphic to the symmetric group S7 on 7 letters. The setwise stabilizer of an edge is isomorphic to Aut(A6)=A6.22, where A6 is the alternating group on 6 letters. Both of the two types of stabilizers are maximal subgroups of the whole automorphism group of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph. The characteristic polynomial of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph is equal to (x-7) (x-2)^{28} (x+3)^{21}. Therefore, the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph is an integral graph: its spectrum consists entirely of integers. The Hoffman-Singleton graph has exactly 100 independent sets of size 15 each. Each independent set is disjoint from exactly 7 other independent sets. The 100-vertex graph that connects disjoint independent sets can be partitioned into two 50-vertex subgraphs, each of which is isomorphic to the Hoffman-Singleton graph, in an unusual case of self-replicating + multiplying behavior. Subgraphs and supergraphs There are 1260 5-cycles and 5250 6-cycles in the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph. There are 525 copies of the Petersen graph, with each 6-cycle belonging to exactly one Petersen each. Removing any one Petersen leaves a copy of the unique (6,5) cage. The Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph also contains many copies of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph and the Heawood graph, which are all bipartite, and by coloring them with alternating values of +1 and -1, an eigenvector of the graph can be found, with associated eigenvalue of ‚àí3. (This the only negative eigenvalue of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph.) Taken together, these eigenvectors span the ‚àí3 eigenspace of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph, although they form a highly overcomplete basis: there are many more M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graphs or Heawood graphs than there are ‚àí3 eigenvectors. There are 750 copies of the Heawood graph, and the Heawood graph has automorphism group of order 336. In turn, 750*336 = 252000, the size of the automorphism group of the Hoffman-Singleton graph, which means that the Hoffman-Singleton graph is fixed by fixing any Heawood graph inside of it. Similarly, there are 2625 copies of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph, which has automorphism group order 96, and 2625*96=252000, so the analogous statement holds. The Heawood graph is notably the incidence graph of the Fano plane, and so following the 15+35 construction of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph above, this immediately shows many places where Heawood graphs must occur. Take an independent set of size 15 in the Hoffman Singleton graph. There are 100 of these. Find another independent set that has 8 vertices in common with the first. There are 15 such neighboring independent sets. Discard the 8 common vertices. The 14 vertices that remain form a Heawood graph. There are thus 100*15/2 = 750 Heawood graphs as established earlier. The Hoffman Singleton graph also contains the odd graph O(4), the Coxeter graph, and the Tutte-Coxeter graph as subgraphs. Take any edge of the Hoffman-Singleton graph, and discard those two vertices as well as the 12 vertices directly connected to either of them. The graph that remains is the Sylvester graph on 36 vertices. Because each such edge can be mapped to a distinct Sylvester graph, there are 175 copies of the Sylvester graph in the Hoffman Singleton graph. The Hoffman Singleton graph is contained in the Higman-Sims graph which is therefore a supergraph.

The house was raided by George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, who was looking for John FitzHerbert; the finding of two priests as well was, according to Connelly, \\"an unexpected bonus\\". Fathers Garlick and Ludlam, John FitzHerbert, his son Anthony, three of his daughters, Maud, Jane, and Mary, and ten servants were arrested, and taken to jail. In Derby Gaol, Ludlam and Garlick met with another priest, Richard Simpson, who had been earlier condemned to death but had been granted a reprieve, either, as stated by most sources, including Challoner, because he had given some hope that he would attend a Protestant service, or, as suggested by Sweeney, because the Queen may have given orders to halt the persecution of priests to reduce the threat of invasion from Spain.Sweeney, p. 9. Whether or not Simpson was wavering, he remained firm after his meeting with Garlick and Ludlam. On 23 July 1588, the three priests were tried for coming into the kingdom and \\"seducing\\" the Queen's subjects. Garlick, who acted as spokesman, answered, \\"I have not come to seduce, but to induce men to the Catholic faith. For this end have I come to the country, and for this will I work as long as I live.\\"Camm, Dom Bede. Forgotten Shrines. 1910. Reprinted 2004 by Gracewing Publishing, p. 45. A second altercation with the Bench came when Garlick was asked if he wished to be tried by jury or by the Justices of Assize alone. Garlick, knowing that a verdict of guilty was inevitable, replied that he did not wish his blood to be on the hands of poor men. He was, however, persuaded to yield on this point, and the trial proceeded by jury.Sweeney, p. 10. The three priests were found guilty of treason, and were condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered; the sentences were to be carried out the next day: \\"That you and each of you be carried to the place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution, and be there severally hanged, but cut down while you are alive; that your privy members be cut off; that your bowels be taken out and burnt before your faces; that your heads be severed from your bodies; that your bodies be divided into four-quarters, and that your quarters be at the Queen's disposal; and the Lord have mercy on your souls.\\"Hayward, p. 32. As the three priests left the dock, Garlick exclaimed, \\"I thought that Cain would never be satisfied till he had the blood of his brother Abel.\\"  Execution  Henry Garnet, cited in Sweeney, recounts that the priests spent their last night in the same cell as a woman condemned to death for murder, and that in the course of the night they reconciled her to the Catholic Faith. She was hanged with them the next day. Chapel of St Mary on the Bridge was there at the time and today has a plaque recording Garlick's death. The bridge has gone but its remains can be seen beneath the chapel. On 24 July 1588, the three priests were placed on hurdles and drawn to St Mary's Bridge, where the executions were to be carried out. Garlick remained witty and cheerful to the end. A passer-by reminded him that they had often gone shooting together, to which Garlick replied, \\"True, but now I am to shoot off such a shot as I never shot in all my life\\". When they arrived at the Bridge, the cauldron was not ready for burning the entrails. According to Sweeney, \\"[t]his sort of bungling was frequent in provincial executions; the local men were amateurs, unversed in the ritual of butchery.\\"Sweeney, p. 11. Garlick used the time to give the people a long sermon on the salvation of their souls, ignoring the attempts of officials to make him stop. He closed his speech by throwing into the crowd a number of papers which he had written in prison, and which he said would prove what he affirmed. Bede Camm reports a tradition that everyone into whose hands these papers fell was subsequently reconciled to the Catholic Church. Simpson was apparently to have been executed first, but reports state that Garlick hastened to the ladder before him and kissed it, going up first, either because, as suggested by Anthony Champney,Anthony Champney. History of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, quoted in Challoner, p. 131. Simpson was showing some signs of fear, or, as suggested by Challoner, Garlick suspected that there was a danger that his companion's courage might fail him.Challoner, p. 131 Simpson was executed next, and, according to an eyewitness, \\"suffered with great constancy, though not with such (remarkable) signs of joy and alacrity as the other two\\".Challoner, p. 132 Ludlam was the last of the three to be executed, and is reported to have stood smiling while the execution of Garlick was being carried out, and to have continued smiling when his own turn came.  After his death  A poem by an anonymous writer, who seems to have witnessed the executions, describes the scene as follows: > When Garlick did the ladder kiss, > And Sympson after hie, > Methought that there St. Andrew was > Desirous for to die. > > When Ludlam look√®d smilingly, > And joyful did remain, > It seemed St. Stephen was standing by, > For to be stoned again. > > And what if Sympson seemed to yield, > For doubt and dread to die; > He rose again, and won the field > And died most constantly. > > His watching, fasting, shirt of hair; > His speech, his death, and all, > Do record give, do witness bear, > He wailed his former fall.Quoted in Challoner, p. 131 The heads and quarters of the three priests were placed on poles in various places around Derby. Garlick's student, Robert Bagshaw, writes as follows: \\"And the penner of this their martyrdoms, who was also present at their deaths, with two other resolute Catholick gentlemen, going in the night divers miles, well weaponed, took down one of their heads from the top of a house standing on the bridge, the watchmen of the town (as was afterwards confessed) seeing them and giving no resistance. This they buryed with as great decencie as they could, and soon after the rest of the quarters were taken away secretly by others.\\"Quoted in Sweeney, p. 11 Dr. Cox, a Derbyshire historian writing in the second half of the nineteenth century, and quoted by Sweeney, mentions a tradition that Garlick's head was buried in the churchyard at Tideswell. It has never been found.Sweeney, p. 11 The three priests were declared venerable in 1888, and were among the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.

Founded in 1948, it is one of the oldest orchestras in South Korea. Its first foreign tour came on a 1965 trip to Japan, followed by performances in Southeast Asia in 1977, the United States in 1982, 1986 and 1996, a 1988 tour of Europe before the Seoul Olympics that year, and a 1997 performance in Beijing. The Philharmonic is an incorporated foundation since 2005. Overview Founded in January 1948, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra has a longer history than any other Korean orchestra. In February 1948, the orchestra held its opening concert, conducted by Seong- Tae Kim. In October of the same year, the Seoul Philharmonic Society was formed to provide support for the orchestra. The society published the music monthly Philharmonie in the following year. After a subscription concert in the Seoul Civic Hall on July 25, 1950, the orchestra had to suspend its activities due to the outbreak of the Korean War, but resumed performance with the name of the Naval Symphony Orchestra, five months later. Its first foreign tour came on a 1965 trip to Japan, followed by performances in Southeast Asia in 1977, the United States in 1982, 1986 and 1996, a 1988 tour of Europe before the Seoul Olympics that year, and a 1997 performance in Beijing. The Philharmonic is an incorporated foundation since 2005. In August 1957, the Seoul Metropolitan Council passed \\"The Seoul Metropolitan Ordinances to Install a City-Run Orchestra\\", and the Naval Symphony Orchestra became the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra, the first Korean orchestra funded by a government. The launching ceremony for the orchestra with triple winds took place in the city council's chamber. Saeng-Ryo Kim was appointed its first Chief Conductor. Since then, the SPO has helped the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky take root as a basic repertoire in the Korean music community. Through these concerts, Korean musicians such as Kyung-Sook Lee, Kun-Woo Paik, Kyung-Wha Chung, Dong-Suk Kang and Myung-Whun Chung attained increased recognition. With the aim of growing into a major orchestra, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra was re-launched as an incorporated foundation on June 1, 2005 and appointed Myung-Whun Chung as its Music Director (he had been Artistic Advisor in 2005). Since the re-launch as an incorporated foundation, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra has been performing with such world-class conductors as Lorin Maazel, Charles Dutoit, Leonard Slatkin, Manfred Honeck, Christoph Eschenbach, Francois-Xavier Roth, Alexander Frey, Pinchas Zukerman, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, James Judd, David Afkham, Pascal Rophe, Kirill Karabits, Mikko Franck and Andrey Boreyko, as well as such distinguished soloists as Andr√°s Schiff (Pf), Martha Argerich (Pf), Kyung-wha Chung (Vn), Viviane Hagner (Vn), Mischa Maisky (Vc), Alexander Melnikov (Pf), Ilya Gringolts (Vn), Julian Lloyd Webber (Vc), Valentina Lisitsa (Pf), Nicholas Angelich (Pf), Hakan Hardenberger (Tp), Leonidas Kavakos (Vn), Arcadi Volodos (Pf), Gary Graffman (Pf), Colin Currie (Per.), Alexei Lubimov (Pf), Martin Frost (Cl), and Heinz Holliger (Ob) and Gautier Capu√ßon (Vc). The orchestra focuses on interaction with modern music. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra \\"has the reputation for championing more new music than any other major Asian orchestra\\". It adopted the composer-in-residence system for the first time in Korea when it was re-launched as an incorporated foundation, and welcomed Unsuk Chin as its first Composer-in-Residence. Chin is founder-director of a series of modern music titled Ars Nova since 2006. It has featured conductors such as Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Kwam√© Ryan, Thierry Fischer, Susanna M√§lkki, Fran√ßois- Xavier Roth, Ilan Volkov, Baldur Br√∂nnimann and Roland Kluttig, among others. Until 2011, the series had presented around 100 Korean premieres - half of them being Asian premieres - of works by leading 20th- and 21st-century composers including Anton von Webern, Igor Stravinsky, Olivier Messiaen, John Cage, Giacinto Scelsi, Witold Lutoslawski, Iannis Xenakis, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Pierre Boulez and Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g. In 2009, the series collaborated with IRCAM, the Paris-based centre for electronic music. Korea. Since 2011, the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra has commissioned or co-commissioned orchestral works by composers such as Pascal Dusapin, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Tristan Murail and York H√∂ller for the 'Ars Nova' series. Additionally, several commissions by major Korean composers have been premiered.

A portrait CD with music by Unsuk Chin was named an International Classical Music Award and a BBC Music Magazine Award winner in the Contemporary Music category. Myung-Whun Chung, the orchestra's music director from 2006-2015, resigned the post in December 2015. In September 2016, the orchestra announced the appointments of Thierry Fischer as its principal guest conductor and of Markus Stenz as conductor-in-residence, effective January 2017, with initial contracts of 3 years. In April 2019, the orchestra announced the appointment of Osmo V√§nsk√§ as its next music director, effective January 2020, with an initial contract of 3 years. In 2014, Seoul Philharmonic joined the BBC Proms, which is known as the most prominent music festival alongside with Edinburgh Festival. Seoul Philharmonic was the 2nd to join as an Asian orchestra, after the NHK Symphony Orchestra in the early 2000's.

An equivalent definition of a Moore graph is that it is a graph of diameter k with girth 2k + 1. Another equivalent definition of a Moore graph G is that it has girth g = 2k+1 and precisely \\\\frac{n}{g}(m-n+1) cycles of length g, where n and m are, respectively, the numbers of vertices and edges of G. They are in fact extremal with respect to the number of cycles whose length is the girth of the graph. Moore graphs were named by after Edward F. Moore, who posed the question of describing and classifying these graphs. As well as having the maximum possible number of vertices for a given combination of degree and diameter, Moore graphs have the minimum possible number of vertices for a regular graph with given degree and girth. That is, any Moore graph is a cage.. The formula for the number of vertices in a Moore graph can be generalized to allow a definition of Moore graphs with even girth as well as odd girth, and again these graphs are cages.  Bounding vertices by degree and diameter  The Petersen graph as a Moore graph. Any breadth first search tree has d(d-1)i vertices in its ith level. Let G be any graph with maximum degree d and diameter k, and consider the tree formed by breadth first search starting from any vertex v. This tree has 1 vertex at level 0 (v itself), and at most d vertices at level 1 (the neighbors of v). In the next level, there are at most d(d-1) vertices: each neighbor of v uses one of its adjacencies to connect to v and so can have at most d-1 neighbors at level 2. In general, a similar argument shows that at any level 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k, there can be at most d(d-1)i vertices. Thus, the total number of vertices can be at most :1+d\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(d-1)^i. originally defined a Moore graph as a graph for which this bound on the number of vertices is met exactly. Therefore, any Moore graph has the maximum number of vertices possible among all graphs with maximum degree d and diameter k. Later, showed that Moore graphs can equivalently be defined as having diameter k and girth 2k+1; these two requirements combine to force the graph to be d-regular for some d and to satisfy the vertex-counting formula.  Moore graphs as cages  Instead of upper bounding the number of vertices in a graph in terms of its maximum degree and its diameter, we can calculate via similar methods a lower bound on the number of vertices in terms of its minimum degree and its girth. Suppose G has minimum degree d and girth 2k+1. Choose arbitrarily a starting vertex v, and as before consider the breadth-first search tree rooted at v. This tree must have one vertex at level 0 (v itself), and at least d vertices at level 1. At level 2 (for k > 1), there must be at least d(d-1) vertices, because each vertex at level 1 has at least d-1 remaining adjacencies to fill, and no two vertices at level 1 can be adjacent to each other or to a shared vertex at level 2 because that would create a cycle shorter than the assumed girth. In general, a similar argument shows that at any level 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k, there must be at least d(d-1)i vertices. Thus, the total number of vertices must be at least :1+d\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(d-1)^i. In a Moore graph, this bound on the number of vertices is met exactly. Each Moore graph has girth exactly 2k+1: it does not have enough vertices to have higher girth, and a shorter cycle would cause there to be too few vertices in the first k levels of some breadth first search tree. Therefore, any Moore graph has the minimum number of vertices possible among all graphs with minimum degree d and diameter k: it is a cage. For even girth 2k, one can similarly form a breadth-first search tree starting from the midpoint of a single edge. The resulting bound on the minimum number of vertices in a graph of this girth with minimum degree d is :2\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(d-1)^i=1+(d-1)^{k-1}+d\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k-2}(d-1)^i. (The right hand side of the formula instead counts the number of vertices in a breadth first search tree starting from a single vertex, accounting for the possibility that a vertex in the last level of the tree may be adjacent to d vertices in the previous level.) Thus, the Moore graphs are sometimes defined as including the graphs that exactly meet this bound. Again, any such graph must be a cage.  Examples  The Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton theorem states that any Moore graph with girth 5 must have degree 2, 3, 7, or 57. The Moore graphs are: * The complete graphs K_n on n > 2 nodes (diameter 1, girth 3, degree n-1, order n) * The odd cycles C_{2n+1} (diameter n, girth 2n+1, degree 2, order 2n+1) * The Petersen graph (diameter 2, girth 5, degree 3, order 10) * The Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph (diameter 2, girth 5, degree 7, order 50) * A hypothetical graph of diameter 2, girth 5, degree 57 and order 3250, whose existence is unknown Although all the known Moore graphs are Vertex-transitive graphs, the unknown one (if it exists) cannot be vertex-transitive, as its automorphism group can have order at most 375, less than its number of vertices. If the generalized definition of Moore graphs that allows even girth graphs is used, the even girth Moore graphs correspond to incidence graphs of (possible degenerate) Generalized polygons. Some examples are the even cycles C_{2n} , the complete bipartite graphs K_{n,n} with girth four, the Heawood graph with degree 3 and girth 6, and the Tutte‚ÄìCoxeter graph with degree 3 and girth 8. More generally, it is known that, other than the graphs listed above, all Moore graphs must have girth 5, 6, 8, or 12.; The even girth case also follows from the Feit-Higman theorem about possible values of n for a generalized n-gon.

She worked as a battlefield surgeon for the People's Army of Vietnam and Vietcong during the Vietnam War. Her wartime diaries, which chronicle the last two years of her life, attracted international attention following their publication in 2005.  Early Life  Tr√¢m was born on November 26, 1942 in H√† N·ªôi, Vietnam to a family of doctors that had spanned three generations. Her father, ƒê·∫∑ng Ng·ªçc Khu√™, was a surgeon and her mother, Do√£n Ng·ªçc Tr√¢m, was a pharmacist. Tr√¢m was also the eldest of five siblings, which included three other younger sisters and a younger brother. She went to high school at Chu VƒÉn An High School (Hanoi) and later attended the Hanoi Medical University during college. On December 23, 1966, Tr√¢m, along with many other civilians, boarded a truck to the Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province and began working as a battlefield surgeon.  Diaries  One of Tr√¢m's handwritten diaries was captured by US forces in December 1969. Following her death in a gun battle on June 22, 1970, a second diary was taken by Frederic (Fred) Whitehurst, a then 22-year-old military intelligence specialist. Whitehurst defied an order to burn the diaries, instead following the advice of a South Vietnamese translator not to destroy them. He kept them for 35 years, with the intention of eventually returning them to Tr√¢m's family. After returning to the United States, Whitehurst's search for Tr√¢m's family initially proved unsuccessful. After earning a Ph.D. in chemistry he joined the FBI, but was unable to reach anyone from the Vietnamese embassy. In March 2005, he and his brother Robert - another Vietnam veteran - brought the diaries to a conference at Texas Tech University. There, they met photographer Ted Engelmann (also a Vietnam veteran), who offered to look for the family during his trip to Vietnam. With the assistance of Do Xuan Anh, a staff member in the Hanoi Quaker office, Engelmann was able to locate Tr√¢m's mother, Doan Ngoc Tram, and subsequently reached the rest of her family. In July 2005, Tr√¢m's diaries were published in Vietnam under the title Nh·∫≠t k√Ω ƒê·∫∑ng Th√πy Tr√¢m (ƒê·∫∑ng Th√πy Tr√¢m's Diary (Last Night I Dreamed Of Peace)), which quickly became a bestseller. In less than a year, the volume sold more than 300,000 copies and comparisons were drawn between Tr√¢m's writings and that of Anne Frank. In August 2005, Fred and Robert Whitehurst traveled to Hanoi to meet Tr√¢m's family. In October of that year, Tr√¢m's family visited Lubbock, Texas to view the diaries archived at Texas Tech University Vietnam Archive,Vietnam Archive and then visited Fred Whitehurst and his family. The diaries were translated into English and published in September 2007. They include family photographs and images of Tr√¢m. Translations of the diaries have been published in at least sixteen different languages. In 2009, a film about Tram by Vietnamese director ƒê·∫∑ng Nh·∫≠t Minh, entitled ƒê·ª´ng ƒê·ªët (Do Not Burn It), was released.  Death  Tram was 27 years old when she died on June 22, 1970 in ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï, Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, Vietnam. She and another colleague were killed by a patrol from the US 4th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment in a Free-fire zone while traveling on a trail in the Ba T∆° jungle in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province.

It was written by Paul Lieberstein and directed by Victor Nelli, Jr. The episode first aired on January 26, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Ken Howard as Ed Truck, and David Koechner as Todd Packer. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, a disgusting \\"thing\\" ‚Äì implied to be human feces ‚Äì is left in Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) office, and Michael tries to discover who did it. While his carpet is being replaced, he uses Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) desk, forcing Jim to move away from Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) into the annex. \\"The Carpet\\" is the first and only episode to feature Howard as Truck. However, the death of the character would serve as the main plot for the third season episode \\"Grief Counseling\\". The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. Upon its original broadcast, \\"The Carpet\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 4.6 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, being viewed by 8.6 million viewers. At the time of its release, it was the second most-downloaded episode of a television show on the iTunes store. Synopsis When someone leaves a disgusting substance on the carpet in Michael Scott's (Steve Carell) office, he spends the day at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) desk, relegating Jim to the back room (referred to as the \\"Annex\\") to suffer Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) constant chattering. She asks Jim to hook her up with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). Jim continues to yearn for Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), but her groom-to-be, Roy Anderson (David Denman), is in the office replacing the carpet along with Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), and Jim is unable to speak with her. Michael becomes increasingly incensed at what happened to his office. Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him that he does not need to have his employees be his friends. But Michael's mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.

However, the death of the character would serve as the main plot for the third season episode \\"Grief Counseling\\". Actress Kate Flannery later revealed that, for the old 1980s picture of Michael and Ed, Carell had to wear a mullet wig. Before the episode aired, the cast and crew received news that the show would be renewed for a third season. Jenna Fischer (Pam) noted that \\"It is rare in this business to hear news of a pickup so early\\", but that NBC was very pleased with how well the show was doing. It had previously, and erroneously, been advertised that the show would finish its run at the end of March 2006. Fischer explained that while the season would end ‚Äì actually in May ‚Äì the show would continue. The exact nature of the substance that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never made clear. Fischer only described it as \\"soft [...] smelly [and] brown\\". In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous; Television Without Pity reviewer M. Giant noted that the viewer only gets \\"the merest out-of-focus Blair Witch glimpse\\" of the substance. Fischer also noted that one of the more interesting aspects of the episode was the \\"you [the audience] finally see Pam and Roy getting along.\\" She explained that this was because Roy and Pam returned from \\"a romantic vacation in the Poconos.\\" Deleted scenes include: Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) believing that a higher power brought Michael to his desk, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) speculating on the culprit, Jim unable to handle Kelly's chattering, Jim eating lunch by himself in his car, Michael being unable to complete a sale, Michael stealing a crumpet from Dwight, Dwight and Angela having a secret conversation in the kitchen, and Jim asking Toby Flenderson (Lieberstein) how he handled Kelly's loquaciousness.

Michael later bothers Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) with an impression of the Popeye cartoon character J. Wellington Wimpy. Dwight makes repeated calls to WEZX Rock 107, a Scranton radio station that plays classic rock. Michael snidely compares Darryl and Roy's work to Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools.

It can lead to deafness or blindness if untreated. The classic form of the disease was first described by D.G. Cogan in 1945. Signs and symptoms Cogan syndrome is a rare, rheumatic disease characterized by inflammation of the ears and eyes. Cogan syndrome can lead to vision difficulty, hearing loss and dizziness. The condition may also be associated with blood-vessel inflammation (called vasculitis) in other areas of the body that can cause major organ damage in 15% of those afflicted or, in a small number of cases, even death. It most commonly occurs in a person's 20s or 30s. The cause is not known. However, one theory is that it is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks tissue in the eye and ear. Causes It is currently thought that Cogan syndrome is an autoimmune disease. The inflammation in the eye and ear are due to the patient's own immune system producing antibodies that attack the inner ear and eye tissue. Autoantibodies can be demonstrated in the blood of some patients, and these antibodies have been shown to attack inner ear tissue in laboratory studies. Infection with the bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae has been demonstrated in some patients prior to the development of Cogan syndrome, leading some researchers to hypothesize that the autoimmune disease may be initiated by the infection. C. pneumoniae is a common cause of mild pneumonia, and the vast majority of patients who are infected with the bacteria do not develop Cogan syndrome. Diagnosis While the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests may be abnormal and there may be abnormally high levels of platelets in the blood or too few red blood cells in the blood, none of these findings is a reliable indicator of the disease. A slit-lamp examination is essential. Recent work has suggested that high-resolution MRI and antibodies to inner ear antigens may be helpful. Cogan syndrome can occur in children, and is particularly difficult to recognize in that situation. Treatment For more severe disease, oral corticosteroids may be necessary to reduce the inflammatory response. When large amounts of steroids are required or if the disease is severe and is not responding to steroid therapy, other immunosuppressive medications often are recommended. These immunosuppressive drugs include methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine or azathioprine. In some cases, combinations of these medicines are prescribed. Occasionally, if the disease has damaged blood vessels in the ear, cochlear implantation may be used to restore some sense of hearing. Cinnarizine is mainly used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, vertigo, M√©ni√®re's disease, or Cogan syndrome. Studies have shown it to produce significant improvement in hearing loss in some patients.Timothy C. Hain: Cogan's Syndrome at the American Hearing Research Foundation, Chicago, Illinois 2008. History In 1945, the ophthalmologist David Glendenning Cogan (1908‚Äì1993) first described the \\"nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis and vestibuloauditory symptoms\\" that would later bear his name. In 1963, the atypical form of Cogan syndrome, also known as \\"Logan Syndrome\\" was first described.

It was produced in 2005 by Vladimir V. Kara-Murza. The documentary tells the story of the Soviet dissident movement from its emergence in the late 1950s with the weekly public Mayakovsky Square poetry readings in Moscow. The development of samizdat, opposition demonstrations held in Moscow such as the 1965 Glasnost meeting and 1968 Red Square demonstration, and the harsh repressions unleashed by Soviet authorities against dissenters including forced psychiatric \\"treatment\\", prison camps and deportations, are all part of the film's narrative. The third episode deals with events leading to the collapse of Soviet dictatorship and the democratic revolution of August 1991. The final episode is dedicated to the period after 1991; in it former dissidents discuss why the emergence of democracy in Russia proved to be short-lived, and how it was possible that a former KGB officer, Vladimir Putin, was elected to the Russian presidency. \\"They Chose Freedom\\" is narrated primarily through the interviews of dissidents themselves. The film's participants are Vladimir Bukovsky, Elena Bonner, Sergei Kovalev, Alexander Yessenin-Volpin, Anatoly Sharansky, Yuri Fyodorovich Orlov, Alexander Podrabinek, Eduard Kuznetsov, Pavel Litvinov, Naum Korzhavin, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Viktor Fainberg and Vladimir Dremlyuga. According to director Vladimir Kara-Murza, the principal goal of his documentary was to show that even a small group of citizens that is prepared to defend dignity and freedom is eventually able to prevail over a totalitarian dictatorship. They Chose Freedom was premiered on RTVi network in October 2005. The Russian premiere of the film was held at the Sakharov Center in Moscow in December 2005. In June 2006 the screening of They Chose Freedom was held at the Cinema House in Ekaterinburg. In February 2007 They Chose Freedom was presented at a human rights seminar in Harvard University.

The Philippine cobra is called in Tagalog, in Ilocano and in Cebuano-Bisaya. Etymology Naja philippinensis was described by American herpetologist Edward Harrison Taylor in 1922. The generic name naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word ' () meaning \\"cobra\\". The specific epithet philippinensis is Latin and literally means \\"from the Philippine Islands\\". Description The Philippine cobra is a stocky snake of medium length with long cervical ribs capable of expanding, so when threatened, a hood can be formed. The average length of this species is . The species can grow to lengths of However, subpopulations of the species, particularly specimens from Mindoro Island, are said to attain lengths of , but these are unconfirmed claims. If true, however, 2 m would be very rare and would be considered the absolute maximum for this species.Lutz, M. 2006. Die Kobras des philippinischen Archipels, Teil I: Die Philippinen-Kobra, Naja philippinensis Taylor 1922. Sauria 28 (3): 5-11 The head is elliptical, depressed, slightly distinct from neck with a short, rounded snout and large nostrils. The eyes are moderate in size with dark brown and round pupils, typical of other cobra species and similar to other elapids in general. It has a fairly stocky build for an elapid, and adult snakes are uniformly light to medium brown, while the juveniles tend to be a darker brown in color. They have 23-27 scale rows around the neck and 21 just above the middle part of the body; 182-193 ventrals, 36-49 subcaudals, and basal pairs are sometimes undivided. Distribution The Philippine cobra occurs mostly in the northern regions of the Philippines. They can be found on the islands of Luzon, Mindoro, Catanduanes, Azria and Masbate. This species likely may occur in other neighboring islands, but this remains unconfirmed. Records from the Calamianes group and Palawan require confirmation. Scalation There are 23-27 (usually 25) scale rows around neck, 21 (rarely 23) just ahead of mid- body; 182-193 ventrals, 36-49 subcaudals, basal pairs sometimes undivided.http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~bss166/Taxa/AsNaja.htm Habitat The Philippine cobra's habitat include low-lying plains and forested regions, along with open fields, grasslands, dense jungle, agricultural fields, and human settlements. This species of cobra is particularly fond of water, so it can be found very close to ponds, rivers, or large puddles of water.W√ºster, W. & R.S. Thorpe (1990) Systematics and biogeography of the Asiatic cobra (Naja naja) species complex in the Philippine Islands. In G. Peters & R. Hutterer (Eds.), Vertebrates in the Tropics: 333-344. Museum A. Koenig, Bonn (Naja naja) species complex in the Philippine Islands Diet This species feeds predominantly on small mammals, frogs, and even other snakes. Small rodents such as mice and small rats are their preferred prey and make up the majority of their diets. However, they will also eat other sizable snakes, small lizards, frogs, eggs, and when the opportunity arises, small birds. Predators Predators of this species include humans, birds of prey, the king cobra, and the mongoose. Large rats that have been bitten by this snake and are in a position to fight back, often do so. Although rare, large rats have been known to fatally wound the snake by scratching, biting, or even poking one or both of the snake's eyes out. Of course, the rat ends up succumbing to the venom, but the snake will often sustain eye injury, potentially becoming blind, and severe bites to the snout region leave the snake vulnerable to infections and diseases. Venom The venom of the Philippine cobra is a potent postsynaptic neurotoxin which affects respiratory function and can cause neurotoxicity and respiratory paralysis, as the neurotoxins interrupt the transmission of nerve signals by binding to the neuromuscular junctions near the muscles. Research has shown its venom is purely a neurotoxin, with no apparent necrotizing components and no cardiotoxins. These snakes are capable of accurately spitting their venom at a target up to away. The symptoms of a bite might include headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, and difficulty breathing.Envenomation and Treatment Bites by the Philippine cobra produce prominent neurotoxicity with minimal to no local signs. A study of 39 patients envenomed by the Philippine cobra was conducted in 1988. Neurotoxicity occurred in 38 cases and was the predominant clinical feature. Complete Respiratory failure developed in 19 patients, and was often rapid in onset; in three cases, apnea occurred within just 30 minutes of the bite. There were two deaths, both in patients who were moribund upon arrival at the hospital. Three patients developed necrosis, and 14 individuals with systemic symptoms had no local swelling at all. Both cardiotoxicity and reliable nonspecific signs of envenoming were absent. Bites by the Philippine cobra produce a distinctive clinical picture characterized by severe neurotoxicity of rapid onset and minimal local tissue damage. Although venom toxicity values can vary greatly even among specimens of the same species, the Philippine cobra is considered to possess one of the most toxic venom among all of the Naja (cobra) species based on murine , according to most toxinology studies. The average subcutaneous for this species is 0.20 mg/kg (lowest value 0.14 mg/kg) and the average venom yield per bite is 90‚Äì100 mg. Only the Caspian cobra (Naja oxiana) has produced a more potent venom, producing an average of 0.18 mg/kg (lowest value 0.1 mg/kg).

Notburga was a cook in the household of Count Henry of Rattenberg, and used to give food to the poor. She is the patron saint of servants and peasants. Life Notburga was a cook in the household of Count Henry of Rattenberg, and used to give food to the poor. But Ottilia, her mistress, ordered her to feed any leftover food to the pigs. To continue her mission, Notburga began to save some of her own food, especially on Fridays, and took it to the poor. According to her legend, one day her master met her and commanded her to show him what she was carrying. She obeyed but instead of the food he saw only shavings, and instead of wine, vinegar. As a result of Notburga's actions, Ottilia dismissed her, but soon fell dangerously ill. Notburga remained to nurse her and prepared her for death. Next, Notburga worked for a peasant in Eben am Achensee, on the condition that she be permitted to go to church evenings before Sundays and festivals. One evening her master urged her to continue working in the field. Throwing her sickle into the air she supposedly said: \\"Let my sickle be judge between me and you,\\" and the sickle remained suspended in the air. In the meantime, Count Henry had suffered difficulties, which he ascribed to his dismissal of Notburga, so he rehired her. Shortly before her death she is said to have told her master to place her corpse on a wagon drawn by two oxen and to bury her wherever the oxen stood still. The oxen drew the wagon to the chapel of St. Rupert near Eben, where she was buried. Veneration Notburga's cult was ratified on March 27, 1862, and her feast is celebrated on September 13. She is usually represented with an ear of corn, or flowers and a sickle in her hand; sometimes the sickle is suspended in the air.

They were the largest and fastest motorcycles of their time, and appealed to both sport riders and police departments. Police favored them for traffic patrol because they were faster than anything else on the roads. The company began during the golden age of motorcycling, and ended during the Great Depression.www.HendersonKJ.com Henderson Motorcycle Co. = The founders: William and Tom Henderson In 1911 the American Henderson Motorcycle Co, 268 Jefferson Ave., Detroit, Michigan, was formed by William G. Henderson in partnership with his brother Tom W. Henderson. Will had the ideas and enthusiasm for motorcycling, and Tom had the better financial acumen. The brothers were inducted to the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998. =1911 prototype= The Henderson brothers constructed a single prototype motorcycle during 1911. The prototype had the belt drive typical of the times, but this was changed to chain drive for production models. =1912 Henderson Four= Henderson Motorcycle promptly announced a new 57 cubic inch (934 cc) IOE four- cylinder 7 hp motorcycle, with the engine mounted inline with the frame and chain drive. Production began in 1911, using the in-line four-cylinder engine and long wheelbase that would become Henderson trademarks, and it was available to the public in January 1912. Advertisements boasted 7 HP and a price of $325. It was the third four-cylinder production motorcycle built in the United States, and featured a folding hand-crank starter handle. =1913 Model B= Improvements included a better brake (singular), lower seating position, improved girder forks and a rectangular fuel tank, which replaced the previous cylindrical tank. It was in this year that Carl Stearns Clancy of New York returned from circling the globe on a 1912 Henderson, armed with many photographs to prove it. SuperXowners history (retrieved 12 October 2006) =Heath-Henderson B-4= The Heath-Henderson B-4 engine was a modified Henderson motorcycle engine produced for use in Heath Parasol aircraft. =1914 Model C= The 1914 Model C had a two-speed gearbox incorporated in the rear hub, as well as lighter pistons and adjustable seat springs. (The first Henderson to have gears.) =1915 Model D and E= Henderson 1915 Shortly after the Model D was announced, it was followed by a Model E, with the wheelbase reduced from 65 to 58 inches, a raised instep on the footboards and a two-speed rear hub. Prices ranged from $295 for the standard model and $335 for the two-speed model. =1916 Model F= 1916 Henderson Model F The shorter wheelbase became the standard, and the engine now incorporated a cam gear driven \\"mechanical oiler\\", and a kick-start. Prices were dropped initially, but due to the impact of World War I on supplies of material and the costs of production, they were increased by $30, with the standard model costing $295 and the two-speed $325. =1917 Model G= Henderson 1917 The old splash lubrication was superseded by wet sump lubrication. A three-speed gearbox was now attached to the engine and incorporated a heavy-duty clutch. Sales soared and new dealerships were established. Alan Bedell averaged 48 mph for 1154 miles at Ascot Park in California setting a new 24‚Äëhour record, and then, on June 13, 1917, broke the transcontinental long distance record of 1915 (set by \\"Cannonball\\" Baker on an Indian Twin,) when he rode his 1917 Henderson from Los Angeles to the city of New York (3,296 miles) in seven days, sixteen hours, and fifteen minutes. The roads outside of towns were primitive by today's standards, and the ride would have been more like an off road ride than the highway tour of today. The Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining- Sea Memorial Trophy Dash was named in Baker's honor. Roy Artley also broke Baker's Canada to Mexico record by nearly nine hours, making the journey in just over seventy-two hours. Despite record breaking and racing successes, the effects of World War I on sales had damaged their financial position. Excelsior Motor Mfg. and Supply Co. In 1917 the Hendersons sold the firm to Ignaz Schwinn, owner of Schwinn, the manufacturer of Schwinn bicycles and Excelsior motorbikes. TotalMotor Excelsior-Henderson Precis (retrieved 12 October 2006) Production was moved to Schwinn's Excelsior Motor Mfg. & Supply Co., 3701 Cortland Street, Chicago, Illinois. Hendersons were marketed extensively overseas as well as in the United States during the Schwinn years. Today, there are almost as many extant Hendersons in Europe and Australia/New Zealand as in the United States. The Excelsior name had already been used in Germany and Britain, so export models were marketed as the \\"American-X\\". GlobalNet No.10 - Excelsior(retrieved 16 November 2006) When production resumed for the new Model H, the engine serial numbers began with a Z, instead of the older H. 1918 Model H * Engine: inline IOE * Cylinders: Four * Displacement: 67 cubic inches (1100 cc) * Bore & Stroke: 2.53 √ó 3.0 inches (64.3 √ó 77.7 mm) * Carburetor: Schebler * Ignition: Magneto * Transmission: 3-speed * Forks: Henderson spring fork * Brakes: Band, rear only * Tire size: 3.00 √ó 28 inches (7.62 √ó 71 cm) (front and rear) Initially Bill and Tom Henderson worked in management at Excelsior (with Tom receiving twice the pay of Bill), but Tom soon left, early in 1919, to become a Henderson exporter. 1919 Model Z and Z-2 The 1919 Model Z included a GE generator on the Z 2 \\"electric\\" model. The 70 cubic inch (1147 cc) 4-cylinder developed 14.2 H.P. This model had a new Henderson logo which included the red Excelsior \\"X\\". Arthur O. Lemon In 1915 Arthur O. Lemon had joined Henderson as a salesman, and was employed in the Excelsior Engineering Department after the sale of Henderson. Lemon designed an updated motor for the 1920 Model K. Bill Henderson and Arthur Lemon had worked closely together in the past, but Bill didn't like Lemon's changes toward heavier motorcycles. He left in 1920, before the Model K came into production, to form the Ace Motor Corporation, where he would make the lighter, faster motorcycles he had envisioned. Arthur Lemon was then put in charge of engineering for Excelsior and Henderson. =1920 Model K= The Model K weighed more, produced more power, and was more durable and reliable than its predecessors. The 79.4 cubic inch (1301 cc) side-valve engine, with 2.6875 inch (68.3 mm) bore, and 3.5 inch (88.9 mm) stroke, was rated at 18 hp (28 bhp). The K had a top speed of 80 mph (128 km/h). The Henderson Model K was the first motorcycle to use full pressure engine lubrication. It was also the first motorcycle to offer an optional reverse gear (for use with sidecars). The frame had steel forgings on every joint. Forks and handlebars were the same as the Series 20 Excelsior. Among its several advanced features were electric lighting and a fully enclosed chain. The K continued on sale to 1922, with sales increasing despite the post World War I depression. Increasingly, Henderson motorcycles were being used by law enforcement agencies, and their reputation continued to improve, with durability and distance records often falling to them. =1922 DeLuxe= In 1922 the 28 hp (at 3400 rpm) DeLuxe was released. Improvements included a larger, more efficient carburetor, improved intake manifold and rear brakes; redesigned crankshaft, cylinder head cooling, exhaust system and seat. There were also optional Lynite die-cast alloy pistons and a revised reverse gear. The heavier Police Department version was demonstrated first to the Chicago Police, and achieved 98 mph. When it was demonstrated to the San Diego Police a genuine 100 mph was achieved. Harley-Davidson decided to challenge Henderson to a contest that was held at Dundee Road, Chicago, in April 1922. The Harley won the first heat, but lost the other eleven, with the Henderson exceeding 100 mph. This was a shining hour for Henderson. Between May 30 and 31, 1922, Wells Bennet and his Henderson Deluxe set a new 24‚Äëhour endurance record (including all the intermediate records) at the Tacoma Speedway, Washington, clocking up 1562.54 miles averaging 65.1 mph. This record was not beaten until 1933, by a Peugeot with a team of four. The solo record was not bettered until 1937 when Fred Ham's 61 cubic inch Harley averaged 76 mph. On December 11, 1922, William Henderson was killed in a motor accident testing his new Ace. In 1923 Arthur O. Lemon left Excelsior to become chief engineer for Ace. =1925 DeLuxe= 1926 Henderson, on display at Clark's Trading Post, Lincoln, New Hampshire The frame was redesigned with a downward slope to the rear for a lower centre of gravity. This enabled the fitting of a shorter, wider, 4 United States gallon (15 litre) fuel tank. Three ring alloy pistons were now standard, the cylinders and camshaft were changed, low and reverse gear ratios were altered and it was fitted with larger 3.85 inch tyres. =1927 DeLuxe= Henderson De Luxe 1300 cc SV 1927 The 1927 DeLuxe featured machined and polished \\"Ricardo\\" cylinder-heads and developed 35 hp at 3,800 rpm. HendersonMotorcycle History of the Henderson 1918 ~ 1931 (Retrieved 19 November 2006) The clutch was strengthened with two extra plates. There was a new tank top instrument cluster, featuring speedometer, ammeter, oil pressure gauge and a headlight switch. There were new valve spring covers and an updated Zenith carburetor. On January 27, 1927, the Indian Motorcycle Company purchased the Ace Motor Corporation. Arthur Lemon moved to Indian, where the Ace was to become the Indian Four. =1928 The Last DeLuxe= The 1928 DeLuxe engine had higher compression, and hardened, polished steel valve guides. The front end was changed to leading link forks and a front brake was added. The wheels were also changed to drop center rims (may have happened mid year). Arthur Constantine In June 1928, Schwinn approached Arthur Constantine from Harley-Davidson, to become Chief Engineer. Constantine looked at the existing model, and embarked on a redesign. =1929 Henderson Streamline Model= The Streamline model, commonly called the \\"KJ\\", appeared in 1929, and featured improved cooling and a return to the IOE (inlet over exhaust) valve configuration, gave 40 bhp @ 4000 rpm. It had a five main bearing crankshaft, and down draft carburetion. Advertisements boasted of \\"57 New Features\\". The Streamline was fast - capable of a genuine 100 mph (160 km/h), and advanced for its time, with such features as leading-link forks and an illuminated speedometer built into the fuel tank. The Streamline model was produced from 1929 until 1931, and sold for $435. On Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929, the Wall Street stock market crashed, but Henderson sales remained strong, and business continued. At this point Excelsior Motor Mfg. & Supply Co. was one of America's \\"Big Three\\" of motorcycle production, alongside Harley-Davidson and Indian. Motorbite history (retrieved 12 October 2006) =1930 Henderson \\"Special\\" KL= On April 29, 1930, the new Henderson \\"Special\\" KL solo was demonstrated on a new, smooth concrete Illinois highway. Joe Petrali achieved 116.12 mph and 109.09 mph on two recorded runs, averaging 112.61. The higher compression two-ring pistons, and an enlarged 1.25 inch (32 mm) carburetor, meant the KL engine produced 45 hp at 4,500 rpm. The KL was remarkably flexible in top gear, pulling smoothly from 8 to 110 mph. They were even more popular with police departments in the United States. The \\"Special\\" (KL) model was priced $30 more than the regular KJ model, and was available in 1930 and 1931. An unusual end The summer of 1931 saw Schwinn call his department heads together for a meeting at Excelsior. He bluntly told them, with no prior indication, \\"Gentlemen, today we stop.\\" Schwinn felt that the Depression could easily continue for eight years, and even worsen. Despite the full order book, he had chosen to pare back his business commitments to the core business, bicycle manufacture. By September 1931 it was all over. Henderson History (retrieved 14 October 2006) =Revival= In 1993, Dan Hanlon secured the rights to the Excelsior-Henderson trademarks and founded the Excelsior-Henderson Motorcycle Company in Belle Plaine, Minnesota. The company designed and built nearly 2000 Super-X motorcycles, powered by a 1386 cc v-twin engine between 1998 and 2000, before the company succumbed to the financial turmoil in the marketplace. =Barnard cyclecar= The Barnard cyclecar, manufactured in London by the St Mark's Engineering Co in 1921-22, used a 1169cc Henderson engine, which was possibly procured as surplus equipment after the end of World War 1.

It was written by B. J. Novak and directed by Dennie Gordon and first aired on February 2, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Melora Hardin as Jan Levinson, Craig Robinson as Darryl Philbin, and Patrice O'Neal as Lonny. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes frustrated when he is not allowed to listen in on a \\"women in the workplace\\" seminar that Jan is conducting, so he conducts his own \\"men in the workplace\\" seminar in the warehouse, where talk of a warehouse union emerges. Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) considers graphic design. The genesis for the episode came from an idea cast members Angela Kinsey and Fischer had while spending time together on the set of the series. During the filming, Carell and the warehouse men were filmed on one set and Fischer and the office women filmed on another. The episode was viewed by 5.42 million viewers, which was the lowest number since the first season finale \\"Hot Girl\\". \\"Boys and Girls\\" received largely positive reviews from critics. Plot Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) leads the female Dunder Mifflin employees in a \\"women in the workplace\\" seminar. Miffed at being excluded, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) conducts a competing ‚Äúmen in the workplace‚Äù seminar in the warehouse. Roy Anderson (David Denman) approaches Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) under the belief that Jim used to like Pam, assuring Jim that he is not mad since Jim apparently liked Pam a long time ago. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and his equally irritated crew are forced to participate in Michael's shenanigans, which culminates in Michael trying to drive a forklift, and knocking down several shelves. Michael's recklessness makes a complete mess of the warehouse while jeopardizing the employees' safety. Michael's plans to hold his own seminar backfire when the warehouse workers' gripe session leads to them deciding to form a union. After Michael balks at stopping them, Jan intimidates them into reconsidering, citing a liquidation of the branch if it were to unionize. Jan urges Pam to take a corporate training program in graphic design in New York City when Pam reveals that she wants to be a graphic designer, but Roy quashes the idea. Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish, which creates tension between them. Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life now, and that they do not even make her dream house in Scranton, but then breaks down and cries in front of the camera. As the day comes to a close, Michael leaves the warehouse in complete disarray, and Darryl promises that ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù Production Jenna Fischer (pictured) and Angela Kinsey came up with the idea for the episode while on the set of The Office. \\"Boys and Girls\\" was directed by Dennie Gordon; it was written by B. J. Novak, who plays Ryan Howard on the show. The genesis for the episode came from cast members Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer. The two originally formulated the premise while spending time together on the set of The Office: \\"What if Jan came into the office and did a 'Women in the Workplace' seminar, and Michael got all jealous?\\" They presented their concept to executive producer Greg Daniels, who liked the idea. Daniels subsequently assigned the idea to Novak, who crafted the final episode. Pam's monologue on reading about a girl who lived in a house with a terrace was based on a real book from the Choose Your Own Adventure series (although not specifically identified as such in the episode) that Fischer had read when she was a child. When the show's cast and crew appeared at the Paley Center, Fischer related that Novak asked her if she had any personal stories that could relate to what Pam was feeling at the time the episode was being written. She then came up with the storybook idea, which was immediately written and filmed for the episode. Fischer later called the episode \\"both the most masculine and most feminine episode of The Office yet\\". This is largely because, during the filming, the different sections were shot separately: Carell and the warehouse filmed on one set and Fischer and the office women filmed on another. The women of The Office later said that \\"it was great\\" to spend time with each other. Fischer later claimed that the women spent a large part of the filming time talking and \\"behav[ing] like seventh- graders.\\" The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael asking Pam and Jim for help choosing a ringtone, Roy and Dwight talking about guns, Dwight shooting his spud gun, and Dwight agrees that \\"there's no place like home.\\" Cultural references Michael compares modern working women to Ally McBeal, the titular lead of the American legal comedy-drama television series of the same name. Dwight compares venturing into the warehouse to the television series Lost, specifically when the characters in Lost meet the mysterious \\"Others\\". When Michael is sitting with his shirt unbuttoned, one of the warehouse workers calls him \\"Hasselhoff\\", a reference to actor David Hasselhoff. Kelly baits Jan by feigning ignorance about the various Baseball metaphors for sex. The blow- up doll with Michael's face on it is a reference to the earlier second season episode \\"Sexual Harassment\\". Reception \\"Boys and Girls\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 2, 2006. The installment was viewed by 5.42 million viewers. The episode was, at the time, the lowest rated entry in the series after the first season finale \\"Hot Girl\\". Alt URL It was eventually beaten by the eighth season episode \\"Jury Duty\\", which was viewed by 5.31 million viewers. \\"Boys and Girls received largely positive reviews from television critics. Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called it \\"another brilliant episode\\", noting that Carell was \\"at his obnoxious and comedic best\\". He also complimented the maturation of Jim and Pam's relationship, writing that it \\"seems like it's coming to a cliffhanger in the next few weeks.\\" M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a positive review and awarded it an \\"A‚Äì\\". Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict awarded the episode a \\"B\\" and called it \\"a solid but uneventful\\" outing for the show. Elements of \\"Boys and Girls\\" have been analyzed in a legal context. Jan's threat to have the warehouse closed if the employees unionize is unlawful under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.

Unlike Mantis, Chang and Riddler's Revenge, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996, Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in 1997 and Six Flags Magic Mountain in 1998 respectively, Georgia Scorcher did not continue the trend of the world's tallest and fastest stand-up roller coasters. Its layout is more modest, in fitting with the long, narrow site selected for it. The track was originally painted yellow with purple supports. For the 2019 season, the track was repainted cherry red with dark grey supports. Track layout Georgia Scorcher departs the station and climbs its lift hill. Then drops down a 101 ft drop. Then the roller coaster enters its vertical loop. It then climbs to the right, circling back towards the station before diving sharply down to the left, entering a non-inverting inclined loop that threads through the center of the vertical loop. After exiting the element, the roller coaster then climbs a small hill and is twisted over on its right side, twisting back as it enters its second inversion, a corkscrew. The roller coaster climbs up to the left, crossing over the start of the lift hill, before diving down and performing a ground-level 270-degree helix turn, crossing itself again as it rises one final time to enter the brake run, returning to the station via a U-turn to the left.

It was written and directed by Jessica Bendinger, writer of Bring It On; the film marks her directorial debut. It was produced by Touchstone Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment and was released in theatres on April 28, 2006. Plot Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a rebellious 17-year-old who has a run-in with the law when she and two friends go biking through a residential construction site in Plano, Texas. Haley is arrested and forced by a judge to return to the regimented world of competitive gymnastics. Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. One year earlier, she made it to the World Championships, but she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed, making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics. Haley goes to the elite Vickerman Gymnastics Academy (VGA) in Houston, her ultimate nightmare, run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges). Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again ‚Äì at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts ‚Äì as well as her past ‚Äì causes conflicts. At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired ‚Äì the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley says, \\"It doesn't matter how well you do. It's how well you follow their rules.\\" In addition, Haley is severely stressed by her domineering mother, who has arrived to watch the meet. Her conduct at the World Championship (\\"Worlds\\") has not been forgotten by the other athletes, and they treat her with open hostility. Haley finally breaks down in the middle of her balance beam routine and, in a repeat of the World Championships, leaves the arena before completing the competition. Before she leaves, she reveals to Vickerman the reason she walked out of Worlds: she had just discovered that her mother was having an affair with her then-coach, and her parents got divorced as a result. Haley then goes back to the judge who sentenced her to the gymnastics academy to inform her that she has dropped out and wants to be sent to either a juvenile hall or military academy. But the judge tells Haley that someone (obviously Vickerman) had just paid off all of her debt for the property damages in her incident with the law, that she is no longer under any legal issues, and that having jerks for parents doesn't need to ruin her life. Haley then approaches Vickerman, who confirms it by claiming that he used the money that her father had paid him for her gymnastics training. Vickerman persuades Haley to remain with the academy a while longer so she can continue with her training to reach Nationals. Although she did not complete the invitational, Haley continues to train and, with three of her teammates Mina (Maddy Curley), Wei Wei (Nikki SooHoo) and Joanne (Vanessa Lengies), qualifies for the National Championships. The biased judging leaves her far back in the all-around standings, but this does not keep her out of the event finals. In the first event final, vault, Mina executes an extremely difficult maneuver perfectly but receives a low score (9.500 out of 10). When Vickerman questions the judges, he learns that Mina was penalized on the technicality of showing a bra strap. Haley is next up. However, instead of vaulting, she shows her bra strap to the judges and forfeits her turn in disgust (otherwise known as a \\"scratch\\"). One by one, the other gymnasts follow suit, earning a string of zeroes and forcing the judges to award Mina the vault gold medal anyway. Haley's bold action sparks a movement. The gymnasts talk among themselves and realize that if they could choose the winner, the judging would be fair. They convince all the others in the competition to do the same, choosing one person from each event who they, by consensus, deem the best to be the \\"winner\\". The winner completes her routine; the others jump on and off the apparatus and scratch. It seems the movement will be ruined when Tricia Skilken (Tarah Paige), a longtime judges' favorite and Haley's former teammate and best friend, arrives and threatens the choice of winners by competing herself.

He previously worked as a writer and a curator. Life and career=The 1990s and the Young British Artists Saatchi arrived at Gambler in a green Bentley and, according to Freedman, was immediately impressed by (and then bought) Hirst's first major \\"animal\\" installation, A Thousand Years, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding off a rotting cow's head.\\"Market News:Counter\\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 March 2003, Retrieved 2 April 2006 (The installation was later a notable feature of the Sensation exhibition.) At this early stage, Freedman was financing the production of Hirst's vitrines, and has commented that not many people attended these early shows, including Freeze. In 1994, Freedman toured the US with Tracey Emin, driving in a Cadillac from San Francisco to New York, making stops en route where she gave readings from her autobiographical book Exploration of the Soul to finance the trip. The couple also spent time by the sea in Whitstable together, using the beach-hut, which she uprooted and turned into art in 1999 with the title The Last Thing I Said to You is Don't Leave Me Here, and which was destroyed (along with her \\"tent\\") in the 2004 Momart warehouse fire. In 1995, Freedman curated the show Minky Manky at the South London Gallery. At the time Emin was relatively unknown. Freedman, concerned that he would be accused of nepotism, challenged Emin to make a great work. The result was Emin's famous \\"tent\\" Everyone I have Ever Slept With 1963‚Äì1995, which was first exhibited in the show. Freedman's interview with her appears in the catalogue. Other featured artists were Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Damien Hirst, Mat Collishaw, Gilbert & George, Critical D√©cor and Stephen Pippin. Freedman said one of the show's themes was: :the artist as a subject, and (to) explore the relationship between the art on the wall and its creator, to make the whole thing more humanistic. And in there somewhere there is the beginnings of a thesis on the relationship and similarities between madness and modernism, for example, defiance of authority, nihilism, examples of extreme relativism, strange transformations of the self, irrationality, and things like that.\\"Do You Want to Be in My Gang\\" , Liz Ellis, 2 February 1997.

As a Liberal and Nationalist member of the House of Representatives, he became a prot√©g√© of Prime Minister Billy Hughes and was groomed as his successor. He served as Minister for Trade and Customs (1919‚Äì1921), Defence (1921‚Äì1923), and Health (1921‚Äì1923), but his prime ministerial aspirations were brought to an abrupt halt by his defeat at the 1922 federal election. Massy-Greene subsequently served two terms as a Senator for New South Wales (1923‚Äì1925, 1926‚Äì1938), but never regained his earlier influence in politics. In retirement he held numerous company directorships. Early life Walter Massy Greene was born on 6 November 1874 in Camberwell, Surrey, England (now part of South London). He was the second son of Julia (n√©e Sandeman) and John Greene, a brewer and hotel proprietor. He was of Anglo-Irish heritage on his paternal side, his father being a grandson of Irish MP William Greene and Archdeacon Richard Hobson. His maternal grandfather was General Robert Turnbull Sandeman, and his uncle Sir Robert Groves Sandeman was a colonial administrator in India. The family surname was Greene, but at some point Walter chose to treat his middle name as an additional surname; he officially added a hyphen in March 1933. The name \\"Massy\\" derived from William Greene's father-in-law Hugh Massy, 2nd Baron Massy. Massy-Greene at a young age Greene grew up in Wimbledon before boarding at Lynton House College in Oxfordshire. He was sent to Australia in 1891 for health reasons, and worked as a farm and sawmill labourer in northern Tasmania for a period. He was later joined by his family who took up land near Kyneton, Victoria. In 1895, Greene joined the Bank of New South Wales and was posted to the gold-rush town of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. After a few years he joined the bank's head office in Sydney, and then was transferred to Lismore, New South Wales. From 1902 he farmed a property near Nimbin with his two brothers. He was elected to the newly created Terania Shire Council in 1906 and chosen as the inaugural shire president. Politics Massy-Greene, 1920s Massy-Greene joined the newly created Federal Liberal League in 1909. At the 1910 federal election, he was elected to the Division of Richmond with the support of small farmers. He joined the parliamentary Liberal Party and soon became known for his attacks on the Fisher Government's financial legislation. Massy-Greene retained his seat at the 1913 election, which saw the Liberals win a one-seat majority in the House of Representatives. He was appointed as party whip by Prime Minister Joseph Cook, and subsequently played a key role in maintaining party discipline. In 1917, following the Australian Labor Party split of 1916, the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party formed a coalition and Massy-Greene became a member of the resultant Nationalist Party. He continued to represent Richmond until 1922 when he was defeated by a Country Party candidate. He was appointed as a Nationalist Party Senator for New South Wales in 1923 and served to the 1925 election, when he was elected to the Senate from July 1926. He remained in the Senate until his retirement in 1938. In the fourth Hughes Ministry Massy-Greene was an Honorary Minister in charge of matters relating to price-fixing (27 March 191817 January 1919). He was then promoted to be Minister for Trade and Customs (17 January 191921 December 1921). On 10 March 1921 he became the first Minister for Health, a position he held until 5 February 1923. He then became Minister for Defence until 5 February 1923. He was relegated to the back bench during the Bruce Ministry. In the First Lyons Ministry he became the minister assisting the Leader of the Government in the Senate (6 January 193223 June 1932) and Assistant Treasurer (6 January 193225 September 1933). He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1933, in recognition of his service as Assistant Treasurer.It's an Honour He subsequently formally changed his surname to Massy-Greene to reflect his usage over the previous two decades. Later life Massy-Greene in 1938 Business career In 1936, Massy-Greene became chairman of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd. on its formation, a post which he held until his death. He was also the chairman of the Emu Bay Railway Company and a director of the Electrolytic Zinc Company, Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd., Yarra Falls Ltd., and many other companies. Other activities During World War II, Massy-Greene served as chairman of the Treasury Finance Committee and as a member of the National Security Capital Issues Advisory Board and Defence Board of Business Administration. In 1940, he led the Australian delegation to the Eastern Group Supply Conference which led to the creation of the Eastern Group Supply Council. Although he never attended university, Massy-Greene also served on the University of Melbourne council from 1939 to 1949, including as deputy chancellor from 1945 to 1947. Personal life Massy-Greene married Lula May Lomax in Mungindi, New South Wales on 6 February 1915. The couple had three children together. His son Sir Brian Massy-Greene served as chairman of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. After the deaths of George Pearce and Billy Hughes in 1952, Massy-Greene was the sole survivor of the Hughes Nationalist ministries. On 13 November 1952, he was admitted to Freemasons Hospital, Melbourne, where he underwent an operation on his gall bladder the following day. After \\"progressing satisfactorily\\" he died on 16 November. A state funeral was held at St John's Anglican Church, Toorak, before a cremation at Springvale Botanical Cemetery.

Written by Michael Schur and directed by Greg Daniels, the episode first aired in the United States on February 9, 2006 on NBC. The episode guest stars Craig Anton, Andy Buckley, Charles Esten, and Conan O'Brien as himself. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) travels to New York City to give a presentation, but accidentally tells everyone that he \\"hooked up\\" with Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Meanwhile, the rest of the office is jealous when Phyllis Lapin's (Phyllis Smith) boyfriend Bob Vance gives her several gifts. Also, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) gives Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) a bobblehead model of himself. The episode was the first time that Pam Beesly (Fischer) had a different hairstyle. In addition, many of the scenes were improvised, including Dwight's line about ham and Michael's antics in New York. \\"Valentine's Day\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics and was watched by 8.95 million viewers. Plot Before a Valentine's Day meeting at the corporate offices in New York City with Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and the new CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael Scott (Steve Carell), defending Jan to the other branch managers, lets slip that he and Jan \\"hooked up\\". At the meeting, Michael shows a sentimental video about the staff at his branch called \\"The Faces of Scranton\\" before providing data on the financial status of his branch as asked. Craig (Craig Anton), from the Albany branch, is completely unprepared for the meeting and attempts to cover for it by insinuating that Jan is giving Michael preferential treatment because of the supposed sexual encounter between them. Due to Wallace hearing this accusation, Jan is convinced that her career is over. Michael defuses the situation by telling the CFO that it was a bad joke and Jan is innocent of any unethical behavior. As Michael leaves, Jan kisses him in the elevator, but groans when she realizes they were caught on camera. Back in the office, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) gives Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) a \\"Dwight\\" bobblehead doll, and he gives her a key to his home. Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith) is inundated with gifts from her boyfriend Bob Vance (Robert R. Shafer), while Pam Beesly is irritated with Roy Anderson (David Denman) when the only thing he gives her for Valentine's Day is the promise of the \\"best sex of [her] life\\". Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is forced to listen to Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) talk about her recent date with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who immediately regrets the entire encounter because it happened the day before Valentine's Day. He then turns down Kelly for another date on Valentine's Day. At the end of the day, Jim tells Pam \\"Happy Valentine's Day\\" and she watches him longingly as he leaves. Production This episode was the fourth episode of the series directed by series creator Greg Daniels. Daniels had previously directed the first season episode \\"Basketball\\", along with the second season episodes \\"The Dundies\\" and \\"The Client\\". \\"Valentine's Day\\" was written by Michael Schur, who plays Dwight's Amish cousin Mose. In the DVD commentary for this episode, Greg Daniels described how some of Michael's actions in this episode, such as having the requested branch info, unlike Craig, and saving Jan's job by deflecting Craig's comments when talking to David Wallace, were scripted to show how he plausibly remains employed. For the first time ever on The Office, Pam Beesly's (Jenna Fischer) hair is in a different style. Several hairstyles were shown to Greg Daniels before the one used in the episode was selected.Fischer, Jenna (Actor). 2006. \\"Valentine's Day\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Dwight's line about a ham being a romantic gift was written during filming on the set. The writers did not have a punchline in the scene, so they came up with several alternatives, including ham, as well as \\"a boombox\\". Most of the street scenes in New York City were improvised. They had to be kept short because crowds quickly formed around Steve Carell when he was recognized.Daniels, Greg (Director/Producer). 2006. \\"Valentine's Day\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Conan O'Brien appeared in a cameo in the episode. He previously worked with Daniels on the writing staffs for Not Necessarily the News, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons and the two also went to Harvard University together. The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael handing out plastic roses, Michael choosing the most attractive part of a woman, Creed calling everybody \\"Ace\\", Michael meeting Devon in New York, the Vance Refrigeration employees getting into a fistfight, Michael wondering why his meeting is on Valentine's Day, Jim learning that Dwight has a girlfriend, and Kevin learning that his fianc√©e has returned to town. Cultural references Michael notes that New York is the \\"city so nice they named it twice\\". He then proceeds to explain that the other name is Manhattan, failing to realize the limerick refers to the city of New York, which also lies in the state of New York. Later, he eats pizza at a Sbarro restaurant, a chain restaurant, but calls it his \\"favorite New York pizza joint\\". At Rockefeller Center, Michael thinks he sees Tina Fey, but it turns out to be a random person. Unbeknownst to Michael, Conan O'Brien walks past him. Near the end of the episode, Michael is posing in front of a Broadway sign for Fiddler on the Roof, and he says \\"Oy, vey! Schmear!\\" in a Yiddish accent. Michael's \\"Faces of Scranton\\" video plays over \\"With or Without You\\" by the Irish rock band U2. Michael later quotes a line from the 1980 comedy film Airplane! when he talks to Jan: \\"Don't call me Shirley\\". When preparing to enter the Dunder Mifflin office for his presentation, Michael is seen sitting by the fountain in front of the tower at 1251 Sixth Avenue, directly across the street from Rockefeller Center. He gets up and walks toward the street, then is seen speaking to the camera in the lobby of the Simon & Schuster building at 1230 6th Avenue, indicating that Dunder Mifflin corporate has offices in that building. Reception \\"Valentine's Day\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 9, 2006. The episode was viewed by 8.95 million viewers. This marked a dramatic improvement from the previous episode \\"Boys and Girls\\", which was viewed by only 5.42 million viewers. \\"Valentine's Day\\" received mostly positive reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad wrote that \\"The Office continues to deliver outstanding episodes week after week.\\" Sciannamea went on to say that the episode was \\"one of their best\\" and that it left him \\"wanting more\\". \\"M. Giant\\" of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a \\"A\\". Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict was pleased with the entry and awarded it an \\"A‚Äì\\". He named the highlight of the episode \\"Michael's overwrought 'The Faces of Scranton' presentation played over U2's 'With or Without You.'\\" Betsy Bozdech of DVD Journal called the episode \\"memorable\\" and noted that it illustrated Pam and Jim's relationship ebb and flow. Francis RizzoIII of DVD Talk declared that Ryan's statement about beginning to date Kelly before Valentine's Day was \\"one of the funniest lines in the entire season.\\" After the episode, fans wanted their own bobblehead dolls of Dwight. A petition was started to get NBC to sell them at their online store. NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000 bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately. The network decided to make more, and since then, the bobblehead has become the best- selling merchandise on the NBC website, and has sold over 150,000 units.

It is now widely accepted that the name of the village, Landkey, is derived from the Llan of Kea, 'Llan' is the south-western Brythonic (and Welsh) for an area of ground around a church or chapel, which in this case was Saint Kea's hermitage. Kea and a brother Celtic monk, Filia, are known to have worked together in the evangelisation of these parts, probably in the late 5th century. The coming of the Saxons often caused the changing of Celtic church dedications to those of more universally accepted and known saints. However, place names are more difficult to change. Thus Saint Kea's name persists in the village name of 'Landkey' and some 6 milies away Filia's name is contained in the village of 'Filleigh'. Today, the dedication of both parish churches is to St. Paul. St Paul's Church Landkey church, dedicated to Saint Paul, is an attractive building, entirely late 15th century, except for the chancel which was rebuilt in 1870. The interior is plastered and whitened throughout, with ceiled and bossed roofs, and possesses an elegant early perpendicular font dating from c.1400. The North aisle contains three stone effigies of the Beaupels, who held the manor of Landkey under the Bishop of Exeter. The small South transept is the Acland Chapel, and contains a fine coloured monument to Sir Arthur Acland (d.1610) and his wife. The Aclands, one of the most notable of Devon families, originated within the parish at Acland Barton, from which they took their name in the time of King Henry II (1154-1189). They continued to own it until 1945, when Sir Richard Acland sold it to the tenant. Sir Arthur Acland (d.1610) purchased the estate of Killerton some 32 miles to the south, where the family later were seated. The parish now forms part of the \\"Benefice of Swimbridge with West Buckland and Landkey\\"; the current incumbent is the Revd. Peter Bowers.  Mazzard Fruit  Landkey is noted for its variety of sweet cherry called Mazzard fruit which was discovered by local farmers in the early 1800s. Landkey Parish Council have rescued Mazzard trees from the brink of extinction; they were once common in North Devon, but had almost died out. The parish council won a ¬£35,000 matching grant through the Countryside Agency's Millennium Green project to pave the way for creating a orchard as part of a wider Millennium Green project. All the 2 ft-high saplings were bought from Thornhayes Nursery at Cullompton, who also grafted the mazzard buds onto infant trees. All the mazzards - prunus avium - in varieties Greenstem Black, Black Bottler, Dun Small Black and Hannaford are thriving on the green. Venn Quarry Venn Quarry is located in open countryside 3 km to the south-east of Barnstaple. It lies to the north of Codden Hill, equidistant between the villages of Bishops Tawton and Landkey. It produces a high PSV gritstone, for which there is an increasingly important market for wearing courses in road making and repair. In addition, the quarry also produces aggregates for the construction industry and materials for a concrete batching plant located at the eastern end of the site. Quarrying for gritstone commenced at Venn in the 1930s, which predated the introduction of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and it has been in continuous operation since. There have been a number of planning permissions granted for extensions to both the working area and for mineral waste tipping. Venn Quarry was mothballed on 8 September 2006.

Written by Paul Lieberstein, and directed by Charles McDougall, the episode first aired in the United States on March 2, 2006 on NBC. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) helps Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) with an important speech that he is going to give. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) plans a vacation to avoid Pam Beesly's (Jenna Fischer) wedding. The speech scene employed over 500 extras, an unusual occurrence for the series. Much of Dwight's speech is based upon a real speech by Italian leader Benito Mussolini. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. In its original broadcast, \\"Dwight's Speech\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 4.4 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, being viewed by 8.4 million viewers.  Plot  Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is named Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and must make a speech at an association meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him tips on how to give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from speeches by famous dictators, such as Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar. Meanwhile, back in the office, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) begins to write invitations for her approaching wedding with help from Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling). Kelly talks about her dreams of getting married someday and is visibly hurt when Ryan responds to her flirtatious question about future weddings by saying he doesn't think he'll ever tie the knot; when Kelly leaves the room, Pam advises Ryan to be considerate of Kelly's feelings but Ryan curtly notes \\"I know what I said.\\" Jim makes plans for a vacation anywhere away from Scranton. While that is going on, the other employees subtly duel over the thermostat. At the end of the episode, Jim tells Pam that he will be going to Australia and unfortunately, he will be missing her wedding because of it.  Production  right \\"Dwight's Speech\\" was directed by Charles McDougall, making it his second directing credit after the earlier second season episode \\"Christmas Party\\". \\"Dwight's Speech\\" was written by Paul Lieberstein, who plays human resources director Toby Flenderson. Lieberstein later revealed that Jim never went on his trip to Australia, noting \\"The whole Pam thing took him by surprise, he transferred and then wasn‚Äôt really up for vacation. Unless, of course, we find a good joke in his vacation.\\" During the earlier scenes when Dwight is in Michael's office, Pam can be seen in the background talking to Meredith. According to actress Jenna Fischer, she and Kate Flannery stayed in character and acted out mundane talking scenes. Although they were not recorded, the dialogue was very detailed. In a guest post written for TV Guide, Fischer described several of the conversations, which ranged from Pam and Meredith discussing \\"the problems with the new quality-assurance computer-input program\\", that the computers don't \\"accept both alpha and numeric characters\\", \\"backlog [of] receipts dating to 2001\\", and that Dunder Mifflin \\"changed to all-numeric product codes in 2004 and the computer system does not allow for the earlier records.\\" The speech scene employed over 500 extras, which was unusual for The Office, and was hectic for the crew to organize. Jim claims that he stole pieces of Dwight's speech from Mussolini. The first line of Dwight's speech, \\"Blood alone moves the wheels of history\\", is paraphrased from a speech Mussolini gave in Parma on December 13, 1914, advocating Italian entry into World War I. The actual quote is, \\"It is blood which moves the wheels of history!\\"Mussolini and Severino, p. 17 The line \\"I say to you, and you'll understand, that it is a privilege to fight\\" in turn is taken from Mussolini's Declaration of War against the United States, where he said, \\"I say, and you all feel, that it is a privilege to fight with them.\\" However, Dwight's line \\"No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself\\" is taken from a 1918 speech by Vladimir Lenin.Report at a Joint Session off the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, The Moscow Soviet, Factory Committees and Trade Unions The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Dwight coming to work wearing sunglasses, Michael criticizing Dwight's speaking skills, Dwight trying to tell another joke to the office, Ryan bringing the wrong type of stamps for Pam's wedding invitations, and an extended scene of Michael's unfunny and extremely awkward speech. Cultural references In order to practice his public speaking skills, Dwight tries to convince the office that Brad Pitt was in a car accident. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) then states that it \\"is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.\\" During the meeting in the break room Dwight references Good Morning, Vietnam. Michael later references the movie at the actual convention when he is filling time for Dwight. When Jim asks the office where he should go for vacation, Kevin tells him he should go to Hedonism Resorts, describing it as \\"Club Med, only everything is naked.\\" Toby tells him he should go to Amsterdam, while Creed informs him that he should go to Hong Kong. Dwight later reveals that he will be going to New Zealand to \\"walk the Lord of the Rings trail to Mordor and I will hike Mount Doom.\\"  Reception  \\"Dwight's Speech\\" originally aired on NBC on March 2, 2006. The episode received a 4.4 rating/10 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 4.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode was viewed by 8.4 million viewers, and retained 88 percent of its lead-in My Name Is Earl audience. Alt URL An encore presentation of the episode on August 15 received a 1.9 rating/6 percent share and was viewed by over 4.6 million viewers and retained 100 percent of its lead-in audience. Alt URL \\"Dwight's Speech\\" received mostly positive reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad wrote that he wonders if the Jim-Pam relationship \\"will reach some sort of resolution or become a season-ending cliffhanger\\". Sciannamea also noted that \\"you know you're living in a Bizarro World when Dwight wins Dunder Mifflin's salesman of the year award.\\" M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an \\"A‚Äì.\\" Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk felt that Dwight's enlarged role was great, but noted that the episode was not as funny as his \\"strange behavior\\" in \\"The Injury.\\" Betsy Bozdech of DVD Journal described \\"Dwight's Speech\\" as an instant classic. Not all reviews were so glowing. Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict felt that \\"Dwight's Speech\\" was \\"one of the few misfires\\" of the season, noting that it \\"certainly has laughs\\", but that \\"its humor is a bit too absurd compared to the show's usual riffs on office ennui\\". He ultimately gave the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\", but wrote that \\"Dwight's Speech\\" being the worst episode of the season was a \\"testament to the show's excellence.\\" IGN ranked the scene with Dwight making his speech as its third-best moment in the first two seasons, and called Wilson's performance a \\"hilariously spot-on impersonation of Mussolini's crazed arm movements.\\"Goldman, Eric; Zoromski, Brian (September 20, 2006) The Top 10 Moments from The Office IGN.

Biography Vladeta Jerotiƒá grew up as the only child of an official of the Royal Court of Audit (Glavna kontrola) in Zadarska Street of the old Belgrade quarter Kosanƒçiƒáev venac. He attended the primary school and the gymnasium in his native place and graduated with maturity diploma in 1942. The young man could not continue his education at the university, because the academic institution was closed in the years of the German occupation during World War II in Yugoslavia. In his memoirs, he described his parental home as non-nationalist, non-chauvinist and non-communist, and that no one from his whole family joined Tito‚Äôs Partisans or Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks. Jerotiƒá remained true to this principle and he never became a member of the Communist Party or any other political organization. In 1945, he began studying at the Medical Faculty and obtained his doctorate as MD in 1951. He specialized in neuropsychiatry and psychotherapy and spent several years for further professional training in Germany, Switzerland and France. During his stay in Bern, the young doctor had written contact with Hermann Hesse in 1959, which is listed and archived in the inventory and the collection of the Swiss Literary Archives. In 1961, he came back to Belgrade and worked at the institute of occupational health. In 1963, he moved to the Dragi≈°a Mi≈°oviƒá hospital in Dedinje and became appointed chief of the department for psychiatry in 1971‚Äì85. Since 1985, he lectured for more than a decade on pastoral psychology at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology of the University of Belgrade. In 2000, he was elected as a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in the Department of Language and Literature, where he became a corresponding member in 1994. He was honorary president of the Serbian Analytical Society and a member of the International Association of Applied Psychology. Jerotiƒá received the 2003 Isidora Sekuliƒá Award for his autobiography Putovanja, zapisi, seƒáanja: 1951‚Äì2000 (Voyages, Notes, Memories) and the Dositej Obradoviƒá Award 2014 for his life achievement. Over and above that, he was honored with numerous other prizes in recognition of his work since 1982.Autobiography, excerpt on Project Rastko, retrieved 17 June 2018.Biography in: Leksikon pisaca Jugoslavije, Volume 2, Matica srpska, Novi Sad 1979 (WBIS)Biography in: Ko je ko u Srbiji, Bibliofon, Belgrade 1996 (WBIS)Jerotiƒá in: Inventory of Swiss Literary Archives, retrieved 2018-11-03.Dragi≈°a Mi≈°oviƒá Hospital, official website; retrieved 17 June 2018.Biography Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, retrieved 5 June 2018.List of members, Serbian Analytical Society, retrieved on 2018-10-28.Srpski citatni indeks, Studies and articles by Vladeta Jerotiƒá.Proceedings of the 2nd Conference of EPCD 2006 (Between National and Religious Identity and Globalism, p. 257), retrieved 2018-10-28.Slovo Ljubve Conference 2004 in Vienna, Information service of the Serbian Orthodox Church, retrieved 2018-10-29.Lecture in Munich 2016, Orthodox Church Munich, retrieved 2018-11-04.Jerotiƒá cited in: Marko ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Serbian Dreambook: National Imaginary in the Time of Milo≈°eviƒá (Google Books), retrieved 2018-10-29.Autobiography (first part), Television documentary of Studio B, YouTube Channel of Agape TV series, retrieved on 2018-10-28.Autobiography (second part), Television documentary of Studio B, YouTube Channel of Agape TV series, retrieved on 2018-10-28.  Religious views  He can be described as a believing Christian of the Serbian Orthodox religion, but he always wisely exerted the principles of respect, tolerance and openness towards other religions, based on the long-term knowledge from his psychological work. Jerotiƒá described the human psyche as divided into three \\"parallelly and continuously active\\" layers based on beliefs and traditions from either paganism, the Old Testament or the New Testament. Jerotiƒá often compared and combined beliefs and teachings from different religions: \\"A man/woman is spiritually restless when she/he both loves and hates one and the same person (his/her child, spouse) sometimes or for a long while. She/he is unhappy when his/her love remains unrequited, she/he is then capable of turning into hate the love previously felt, unhappy when in fear of the loss of a loved one, deeply sorrowful and restless when the loss actually occurs. On the basis of this truth, the great Indian philosopher Buddha grounded his philosophical teaching incorporating the four truths and the eightfold path to salvation. However, one thing remains clear to the Christian and the psychologist that people shall remain restless as long as they love and hate.\\"Foreword by Jerotiƒá in: Self-Image of Adolescents in the Protestant Family: A Study of Seventh-Day Adventist Families in Predominantly Orthodox Serbia, Edwin Mellen Press, Lewiston 2014.Jerotiƒá cited in: Alija Izetbegoviƒá, Islam between East and West (Google Books), retrieved 2018-11-02.Cited from: About our spiritual restlessness, article by Jerotiƒá in: Iskon - pravoslavni ilustrovani ƒçasopis No. 8/2005. Death and legacy Jerotiƒá died on 4 September 2018 in Belgrade at the age of 94 and the numerous obituaries in the Serbian media appreciated his personality, integrity and philanthropy and presented the respect and importance that the Serbian society and its public pay tribute to him. He was buried in the New Cemetery. In 2007, the Jerotiƒá Foundation (Zadu≈æbina Vladete Jerotiƒáa) was established, which manages and preserves the extensive legacy of his lifetime achievement, consisting of more than over 500 publications, including about 200 studies and articles in scientific journals.About the Foundation, website CompanyWall, retrieved on 2018-10-28.

It went into effect on the day it was signed. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on September 8, 1937.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 181, pp. 102‚Äì105. Polikarpov I-16 with Chinese insignia. I-16 was the main fighter plane used by the Chinese Airforce and Soviet volunteers. Effects At first the treaty led to improving relations between the Kuomintang government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Soviet Union. Following the signing of the pact, the Soviet Union began sending aircraft to the Chinese national government in Operation Zet, as well as economic aid to help stave off Japanese occupation. Chiang hoped that was a precursor to Soviet intervention into the war, however as time passed he soon realized that the Soviet Union was constricted in what aid it could actually provide because it did not want to upset the tacit alliance with the United Kingdom, France, and later the United States, which favored China in the war but would back Japan against the Soviets to weaken both. The treaty also allowed the Soviets to focus its attention more on the West, where Nazi Germany was building up for what appeared to be war with the Soviets, especially after the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact had been signed. The pact contributed to the worsening relationship between China and Germany, which had already seen the end of German military assistance in China. Breach by Soviet Union Ironically, in 1937, while the pact was being signed, the Soviets brazenly breached it before and after the signing, conducting the Xinjiang War (1937) from August to October. The Soviet Army was assisting its puppet Governor Sheng Shicai in Xinjiang. The Kuomintang Muslim General Ma Hushan led the 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) to resist the invasion. Before the invasion, Ma Hushan had communicated with Chiang Kaishek, and he mentioned to Peter Fleming that Chiang was going to send help to fight the Soviets. However, the outbreak of war with Japan led Ma Hushan to face the Soviet Invasion on his own, despite resisting and killing Russian soldiers, Ma Hushan's forces eventually succumbed to Soviet mustard gas bombardment, and Ma Hushan fled to India, where he took a steamer back to China. Sheng Shicai then invited Soviet forces to garrison in Turfan, right next to Gansu province. The Republic of China government was fully aware of the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang province and of Soviet troops moving around Xinjiang and Gansu, but was forced to mask the maneuvers to the public as \\"Japanese propaganda\\" to avoid an international incident and for continued military supplies from the Soviets. The Chinese government responded with its own military moves. The Muslim General Ma Buqing then virtually controlled the Gansu corridor. Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but since the Soviet threat was great, Chiang made some arrangements regarding Ma's position. In July 1942 Chiang Kai-shek instructed Ma Buqing to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai.Hsiao-Ting Lin: War, Leadership and Ethnopolitics: Chiang Kai-shek and China's frontiers, 1941-1945, in: Journal of Contemporary China, Volume 18, 2009, Issue 59, pp. 201-217.Nationalists, Muslim Warlords, and the ‚ÄúGreat Northwestern Development‚Äù in Pre-Communist China Chiang named Ma Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten Sheng Shicai's southern flank in Xinjiang, which bordered Tsaidam. After Ma evacuated his positions in Gansu, Kuomintang troops from central China flooded the area and infiltrated Soviet occupied Xinjiang, gradually reclaiming it and forcing Sheng Shicai to break with the Soviets. The Ili Rebellion broke out in Xinjiang when the Kuomintang Chinese Muslim Officer Liu Bin-Di was killed while fighting Turkic Uyghur Rebels in November 1944. The Soviet Union supported the Turkic rebels against the Kuomintang, and Kuomintang forces were fighting back. The Kuomintang Chinese government ordered Muslim General Ma Bufang several times to march his troops into Xinjiang to intimidate the pro Soviet Governor Sheng Shicai. This helped provide protection for Chinese settling in Xinjiang. Ma Bufang was sent with his Muslim Cavalry to Urumqi by the Kuomintang in 1945 during the Ili Rebellion to protect it from the Uyghur army from Hi (name for Ili at that time).

He was in his 68th year, i.e. 67 years old in 1573. 1573 - 67 = 1506 ‚Äì1583), of Oxburgh Hall, King's Lynn, Norfolk, was the eldest son of Edmund Bedingfeld (1479/80‚Äì1553) and his wife, Grace (d. in or after 1553), the daughter of Henry Marney, 1st Baron Marney. Marriage Bedingfeld married Katherine (d.1581), the daughter of Sir Roger Townshend of Raynham, Norfolk and Amy Brewes, daughter and co-heiress of William de Brewse, of Wenham Hall, Suffolk, and Stinton Hall in Norfolk.G.H. Dashwood, The Visitation of Norfolk in the year 1563 (Miller & Leavins, Norwich 1878), Vol. I, pp. 306-08. Education In 1528, he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. Career Bedingfeld held various posts, including, privy councillor to King Edward VI and Queen Mary I; knight of the shire for Norfolk; Constable of the Tower of London; 1555 Lieutenant of the Tower of London and captain of the guard; 1557 vice-chamberlain of the household of Mary I. After the death of King Edward VI, in 1553, Sir Henry Bedingfeld, and Sir Henry Jerningham (grandfather of the 1st Baronet Jerningham) were the two most instrumental supporters with placing Mary Tudor on the throne; arriving at her aid with 140 well-armed men. After this event, \\"Bedingfeld proclaimed the queen at Norwich, he was afterwards rewarded for his loyalty with an annual pension of 100 pounds out of the forfeited estates of Sir Thomas Wyatt; made a Privy Councillor by Mary I and Knight Marshal of her army, and, subsequently Lieutenant of the Tower of London.\\" While he held the post of Constable of the tower of London, he was employed in the same capacity as his father had been with Katherine of Aragon, and was entrusted with the care of Queen Elizabeth I, at Woodstock Palace. Bedingfeld's care of Elizabeth I during this period, has been the subject of controversy.Sir Henry Bedingfeld - Catholic Encyclopedia article After Elizabeth's accession to the throne in 1559, she would address Sir Henry Bedingfeld at court as \\"Her Gaoler\\", however, the following sheds a flood of light, on the truth of this matter, that suggests that this term was in all probability, applied loosely, and in good spirit. Further to this, The contemporaneous evidence that has been published by the Norfolk and Norwich Arch√¶ological Society suggests that conduct of Elizabeth's 'Jaioler' was more in alignment with that of a true gentleman. Moreover: \\"Following Wyatts rebellion, Mary I appointed Sir Henry Bedingfeld custodian of Elizabeth, when that princess was confined in the Tower and at Woodstock, on suspicion of being concerned in Wyatt's rebellion; and so little did Elizabeth resent his severity during the time of her imprisonment, that after her accession, she addressed him as her \\"trusty and well-beloved,\\" employed him in her service, and granted to him the manor of Caldecot in Norfolk, which still forms part of the Oxburgh estate at the present day.\\" \\"He was undoubtedly one of the foremost Englishmen of his day, respected by two sovereigns, and occupying prominent and honourable positions, his loyalty being unimpeachable; yet Foxe, the martyrologist, with his wonted dishonesty, has without the slightest foundation, and so effectually, blackened his fame, that almost every subsequent writer on this period has reproduced the calumnies set forth with malice prepense in the Acts and Monuments. John Strype was the first unquestioning copyist of Foxe; Burnet was the second; and Sir Reginald Hennell is the most recent.\\" Sir Henry Bedingfeld's reputation suffered from the proliferation of misconceptions concerning his care of Queen Elizabeth I. Bedingfeld's friend and fellow Privy Councillor was Sir Henry Jerningham, and together they shared a mutual friendship with another fellow privy counsellor and secretary of State during the reign of Mary I, Sir John Bourne. The Bedingfelds were also closely connected to the ancient family of Beaupre, of Beaupre Hall Outwell/Upwell, Norfolk. Portraits His portrait was as Oxburgh Hall, where it was described in the following manner: > Body full, face turned very slightly towards the sinister, grey eyes full, > long nose, light brown hair, round beard and moustache turning grey, soft > black cap right down on the head. Dress : Black doublet, high shoulders to > it, and high black collar, very wide behind, small white frill all round the > face ; the right hand is forward clenched, probably holding gloves, frill > round the wrist, a ring with ‚Äú An eagle displayed ‚Äù thereon, being on the > third finger of the hand. S. Inscribed : ‚Äú Anno D. 1573 √¶tatis su√¶ 68.‚Äù ‚Äú > Sir Henry Bedingfeld Governor of the Tower.‚Äù An engraving is in the National Portrait Gallery. A miniature, oil on ivory, dated c.1700‚Äì1799, is today at Oxburgh Hall, which now belongs to the National Trust. The miniature was previously in the ownership of the Conyngham family, Marquesses Conyngham, at Slane Castle, County Meath, Ireland. Elizabeth I's Royal Progress in Norfolk in 1578 According to Francis Blomefield, Rector of Fersfield in Norfolk Elizabeth I visited him on her progress in Norfolk in 1578: > Sir Henry Bedingfeld was one of those gentlemen that appeared in arms at > Framlingham in Suffolk, in defence of Queen Mary, and her title to the > crown, and brought with him 140 men completely armed. This gentleman had the > care and charge of the Lady Elizabeth for some time, and stands charged by > Mr. Fox with severity towards her; but the royal visit which she either did, > or designed to pay him, in her Progress into Norfolk, shows as if it was not > as that author represents it. It being unlikely she would then have designed > him such an honour. That the Queen was wont to call him her Jaylor, may be > true, but that seems to have rather been a term of royal familiarity, than > contempt; for had it been the latter, he would scarce have been so much at > court as it appears he usually was. Elizabeth's Stay at Woodstock in 1554‚Äì5 Perhaps the best account of Princess Elizabeth's stay with Sir Henry Bedingfield is given by Katherine Bedingfield in the book The Bedingfields of Oxburgh, published privately in 1912. This seems to be the Katherine (1861‚Äì1939) who married Raoul Bisshopp Bedingfield (1835‚Äì1910). This account neither dismisses Elizabeth's terror and well-founded fears at these events, nor unnecessarily villifies. Katherine Bedingfield writes: The following letter relates to the Princess and her arrival at the Tower. > \\"To the right worshipfull Sir Henry Bedingfeld Knt., give these, Written in > haste. My dutye remembered these shal be to advyse you that on friday my > lady Elisabeth was sent to the tower at 10 of the cloke, the Parliament shal > be holden at Westminster the daye afore assured and the Quene is in good > helthe, thanks be to God, who preserve you in much worshipe thys good > fryday, rydyng by the way, by yours to commande, Thomas Walters.\\" Sir Henry is described by his historians as a stern Norfolk knight, \\"in whose courage and probity\\" the Queen knew she could confide. The Princess was for some time in his custody, and in after years, when Queen, used to playfully call him her gaoler. However, when she first saw Sir Henry, and the hundred men-at-arms, with their blue coats, under his command, enter the inner court of the Tower, she asked in terror \\"if the Lady Jane's scaffold was removed.\\" The Lieutenant of the Tower endeavoured to calm her by saying there was no cause for alarm, but his orders were to consign her into the charge of Sir Henry Bedingfeld, to be conveyed to Woodstock. \\"Elizabeth, not knowing what manner of man Bedingfeld was, inquired whether he made conscience of murder, if such an order were entrusted to him.\\" The 19th of May she was removed from the Tower, first by barge at the Tower Wharf, and so to Richmond, where she had an interview with the Queen. The next day she crossed the river at Richmond, to proceed on her journey to Woodstock. The letters and State documents relating to this journey throw further light upon it. Sir Henry's note on the affair was as follows: \\"A memoriall off all letters, warrants, etc., whyche I have to shewe concerning the s'vice aboute my lady Elizabeth's grace, whereunto I was commanded by the Queue's highnes, which s'vice began the 8th off May 1554 ‚Äî fyrst yere off hyr moste noble reign.\\" Anthony, Humphrey, and Edmund, brothers of Sir Henry, appear to have formed part of the guard brought by him to the Towner. In Sir Henry's report to the Queen of the journey from the Tower of London to Woodstock, he noted that the people between London and Windsor were not \\"hoole on matters of Religion\\" ... that \\"theye be fullye fyxed to stonde to the late abolyshyng off the byshopp off Romez aucthorite, as heretofore agaynste the order of all charite hath been establyshed by statute lawe within thys Realme.\\" The letter goes on to say that \\"My Ladye Elisabeth's grace\\" had not \\"been verye well at ease,\\" and yet she wanted to go out walking. \\"In the whyche and other lyke hyr requests I am mervolouslye pplexed to graunte hyr desyer or to saye naye.\\" Then came \\"a remembrance off the journeye made by my Ladye Elizabeth's grace from Wyndsore to Syr Wyllm Dormer's house at West Wyckhm the xxth off maye 1 marie regine. Ffyrst when hyr grace cam to the castell gate to take hyr lytter, there stoode off Master Norrey's svnts xvj, in tawneye coots, to receyve hyr oute, at whyche place there weere sum people to behold hyr. . . . Itm, hyr grace passed the towne off Wyndsore wth moche gasyng off people unto Eton Colledge, where was used the like, as well by the scollers as others; the lyke in villages and ffeldes unto Wycombe, where most gasyng was used, and the wyves had p.pared cake and wafers wch at hir passing bye them, thei delyvered into the lytter. She receyved yt wth thanks untyll by the quantitee she was accombred and wth the herbes delyvered in with the wafers trobled as she sayde, and desyred the people to cease.\\" At West Wycombe, Sir William Dormer and 17 servants in \\"blewe coats\\" awaited her, half-a-mile from his house, with Lady Dormer and her daughter-in-law. At Woburn Sir Henry began talking with a \\"husbande man,\\" and found him \\"a verye protestunte, and thought there were many about there of \\"the same opinion.\\" From the Dormers' house the Princess and suite went on to Lord Williams and thence to Woodstock. When the party arrived at this place Queen Mary sent instructions to \\"her trustie and right well beloved counsellor Sir Henry Bedingfeld knyght.\\" She had reason to believe that Elizabeth was implicated in some conspiracy against her, and she wrote that in the face of so much evidence it was difficult to believe that her sister was guiltless of the charges brought. Sir Henry was admonished to continue his \\"accustomed diligence in the charge by us comitted to yow.\\" Then followed a report that \\"my ladye Elizabeth's grace ys daylye vexed with the swellyng in the face and other parts off hir bodye,\\" and Sir Henry deputed Edmund his brother to declare the same to \\"my lorde Chamberlayne\\" and to ask for a doctor. \\"Doctour Owen\\" wrote directions to Sir Henry on the subject, and apparently thought it was not the \\"tyme off the yere to minster purgacions owing to the distemperaunce of the weather.\\" Then came a long letter to the Council relating various conversations between Sir Henry and the Princess, to which is added the following, \\"My lords it hath come to my knowledge by dyvse creditable and wrshipfull psons, that the remayneng off Cranmer, Rydleye, and Latimer, at Oxforde, in such sort as theye dooe, hath done nooe smal hurte In theys parts, even amonge thoose that were knowne to be goode afore.\\" The Queen's next letter to him affords proof of her thoughtfulness for others. > \\"The Queene's letter unto me.\\" \\"Mary ye Quene. By ye Quene. \\"Trustye and > right well beloved, we gret you well, and wheare we understande yt by > occasion of certyn our instructions Latelye gyvene unto you, ye doe > continuallye make your personall abode within that our howse of Woodstock > without removing from thence, at anye time, which thing might p'adventure in > continuance be both som daunger to your helth, and be occasion also yt ye > shall not be so well able to understande the state of the countreye theare > abowts, as other wyse ye might.

The Princess asked for and obtained through Sir Henry's intervention a doctor and surgeon, and was bled in the arm and foot. She also requested to be moved nearer London, as there was great difficulty in conveying provisions to Woodstock during the winter. At length came a letter from the Queen ordering Sir Henry to bring Elizabeth with all speed to Hampton Court, and the good \\"gaoler\\" was free to return home. Thomas Parry Princess Elizabeth had an ally in her time at Woodstock: > Thomas Parry, the princess cofferer had to provide for her household but on > 26 May, three days after her arrival at Woodstock, the Council told > Bedingfield that there was no reason for Parry to stay there. Elizabeth's > guardian communicated this decision to Parry, who baffled him by staying in > the town. Parry now proceeded to make Bedingfield's life a misery. He first > objected to the provisioning of his retinue out of Elizabeth's resources, > until Bedingfield was commanded to supply them by a special warrant. This > was simply a harassing tactic, for books were being conveyed to Elizabeth, > some of which Bedingfield suspected of being seditious, and when Parry sent > him two harmless ones he was forced to return them for want of explicit > instructions. Bedingfield complained that he was helpless, as ‚Äòdaily and > hourly the said Parry may have and give intelligence‚Äô, and once again the > cofferer's position was referred to the Council.

At length the Council forbade such large meetings and, from > Bedingfield's subsequent silence on the point, it seems that the order was > obeyed. Elizabeth's fondness for Sir Henry Bedingfeld may have been remembered mischief. Last Years Whatever Elizabeth's feelings towards him were, they did not protect him from his love for the Old Religion. His last years were marred by accusations of recusancy.

The state highway runs from MD 16 near Secretary east to MD 313 in Eldorado. MD 14 connects those two towns with the towns of East New Market and Brookview in northern Dorchester County. The state highway also shares a concurrency with MD 331 between the communities of Rhodesdale and Shiloh Church. The sections of MD 14 between East New Market and Eldorado were constructed between 1911 and 1914. The highway through Secretary was constructed in the late 1920s. The portion of MD 14 east of Shiloh Church was first marked as part of U.S. Route 213 (US 213) in 1927. In the early 1930s, US 213 was rerouted through Vienna; as a result, MD 14 was extended to its present eastern terminus in Eldorado. Route description View west along MD 14 in East New Market MD 14 begins at an intersection with MD 16 (Mt. Holly Road) a short distance west of East New Market. The state highway heads north as two- lane undivided Secretary Road in a straight line before curving to the east and crossing the Warwick River, where the highway's name changes to Main Street and the route enters the town of Secretary. MD 14 intersects Poplar Street, which leads to the suicide bridge over Cabin Creek, before leaving the town. The state highway's name changes to Secretary East New Market Road as the road turns southeast toward the second town. MD 14 passes through East New Market on Academy Road and Railroad Avenue, with the name change occurring at the center of town at the highway's second intersection with MD 16, known at this point as Main Street. After intersecting MD 392 (East New Market Bypass) and crossing the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, MD 14 leaves the town limits of East New Market. MD 14 continues east as East New Market Rhodesdale Road. The state highway passes North Dorchester High School before the western intersection with MD 331 (Shiloh Church Hurlock Road) in the hamlet of Shiloh Church. MD 14 and MD 331 head east in a concurrency to the community of Rhodesdale, where MD 331 splits to the southeast toward Vienna as Rhodesdale Vienna Road. MD 14 crosses an unused rail right-of-way owned by Delmarva Power and Light Company and continues east as Rhodesdale Eldorado Road. The state highway curves northeast and briefly passes through the town of Brookview before crossing Marshyhope Creek on the Brookview Bridge. Shortly after crossing the creek, MD 14 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 313 in the town of Eldorado. MD 313 continues northeast as Eldorado Road and southeast as Sharptown Road. History The first section of MD 14 to be constructed as a modern highway was between East New Market and Shiloh Church in 1911. The next two sections were constructed as part of the major north- south highway of the Eastern Shore; the Shiloh Church-Brookview segment was built in 1912 and the Brookview‚ÄìEldorado portion was completed in 1914. When route numbers were first assigned in 1927, MD 14 was placed on the western section and US 213 was marked on the two eastern sections. MD 14 between Secretary and East New Market was constructed in 1926 and 1927. The final section between the western junction with MD 16 and Secretary was paved in 1929 and 1930. While the modern bridge over Marshyhope Creek at Brookview was completed in 1932, it served a lighter traffic load than the previous bridge because of the opening of a new bridge over the Nanticoke River at Vienna the previous year. By 1933, US 213 was relocated through Vienna and MD 14's eastern terminus was moved from Shiloh Church to Eldorado. MD 14's concurrency with US 213 became a concurrency with MD 331 in 1939 when the two latter highways swapped corridors due to the completion of the new Choptank River Bridge in 1935.

In late 2017 it amalgamated with the Australian College of Christian Studies (formerly known as Tabor College NSW). It offered courses on site and by distance education, with courses accessed from 105 countries and in 125 languages.

Bible colleges primarily offer undergraduate degrees, but may also offer graduate degrees, lower-level associate degrees, certificates or diplomas in specialized areas of Christian training where a full degree is not required. Bible colleges can be found throughout the world but are concentrated in North America. The South Pacific Association of Evangelical Colleges has stated that more than half of all Protestant missionaries in the world were graduates of Bible colleges. In North America, there are over 1,200 post-secondary Bible institutes.Todd C. Ream, \\"Protestant Bible Institutes in the United States\\", in The International Handbook of Protestant Education, ed. William Jeynes, David W. Robinson, Springer, 2012, pp. 123-136; William C Ringenberg, The Christian college: a history of Protestant higher education in America, Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1984. The Association for Biblical Higher Education asserts that Bible colleges produce \\"a large percentage of North American evangelical missionaries and serve as a primary training center for local church leadership\\". History In the United States and Canada, the origins of the Bible college movement are in the late 19th-century Bible institute movement.History: Biblical Higher Education , American Association of Bible Colleges website (accessed November 19, 2007) The first Bible schools in North America were founded by A. B. Simpson (Nyack College in 1882) of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and D. L. Moody (Moody Bible Institute in 1887). Many were established as a reaction against established theological colleges and seminaries, which conservatives believed were becoming increasingly liberal and undermining traditional Christian teachings, such as Biblical inerrancy. The American Bible college movement developed in reaction to the secularization of U.S. higher education. The \\"Bible institute/college movement\\" has been described as \\"a protest to the inroads of secularization in higher education and as a base for the education of lay workers and full-time Bible teachers, evangelists, and pastors\\".Larry J. McKinney, \\"THE FUNDAMENTALIST BIBLE SCHOOL AS AN OUTGROWTH OF THE CHANGING PATTERNS OF PROTESTANT REVIVALISM, 1882-1920\\", Religious Education: The official journal of the Religious Education Association, 84:1, 589-605. Page 594 As one historian put it, \\"It is not a coincidence that the Bible institute movement grew up during the very period when the philosophy of naturalism became prevalent in American education\\".Frank E. Gaebelein, quoted in McKinney (1989:590) Between 1882 and 1920, 39 Bible schools were founded in the United States.McKinney (1989:599) Programs Bible colleges generally confer bachelor's degrees, most often in biblical studies and various divisions of Christian ministry, pastoral ministry and worship ministry or church music. Michel Deneken, Francis Messner, Frank Alvarez-Pereyre, La th√©ologie √† l'Universit√©: statut, programmes et √©volutions, Editions Labor et Fides, France, 2009, p. 61 Some Bible colleges offer degree programs in ministry- related areas that also have secular application, such as Christian education. Beyond the undergraduate level, some others have established seminaries and graduate divisions. At some Bible colleges, associate's degrees, diplomas, or certificates are available. These programs are generally designed for laypersons (such as Sunday school teachers) who neither want nor need a bachelor's degree to perform their Christian service, but who desire additional training in such areas as Bible studies or the teachings and practices of their denomination. Many Bible colleges offer correspondence or online training.

Accreditation Each country has its own governmental process for approval or accreditation of higher education. The Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) accredits many Bible colleges in the United States. Bible colleges may also be accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, by regional accreditors, or by international counterparts. About 25 U.S. Bible colleges hold accreditation by regional accreditors, which accredit most academically oriented colleges and universities in the United States.Megan Boehnke, Johnson Bible College announces new name, Knoxville News Sentinel, April 29, 2011 In the UK, from 2007 to 2012, all Bible colleges (along with all independent colleges of higher education) needed to be accredited under the authority of UK Border Agency by either the British Accreditation Council (BAC) or Accreditation Service for International Colleges (ASIC). The government then changed this in 2012 to the need to have compulsory \\"Education Oversight\\" from organisations such as QAA, ISI and Bridge Schools Inspectorate.UK Border Agency Education Providers, UK Border Agency, August 28, 2013 In the United States, many Bible colleges and institutes purposefully operate without conventional educational accreditation, or even governmental licensing. These institutions typically claim exemption due to the religious nature of their programs, that involving an outside agency in this capacity would compromise or limit their theological mission. Affiliations Bible colleges are usually associated with evangelical, conservative, Christian fundamentalist denominations. Their primary purpose is to prepare people for roles in Christian ministry.Bible Schools, in The Canadian Encyclopedia (1st page in online version of article) The Bible-centered curriculum is typically supplemented by structured programs of Christian service.Bible Schools, in The Canadian Encyclopedia (3rd page in online version of article) Professor salary and teacher-student ratio In the United States the average salary for a full professor at a Bible institute was around $49,000 in 2012.

It was the largest Labor Day firework show in the United States, and was considered a top attraction in the region. The event was held on Volunteer Landing and accompanied by live music and festivities. Boomsday's firework display attracted over 325,000 spectators every year. Fireworks were set off from the Henley Street Bridge (to a lesser extent Baptist Hospital and the Gay Street Bridge) and spectators could view the show from the riverfront, hillsides, or on boats from the Tennessee River. In 2006, Boomsday was expanded to a three-day event lasting through Labor Day weekend, causing Knoxville to lose money, and the city reverted to the one-day event in 2007. The fireworks display was choreographed to music with one such selection being Madonna's Lucky Star in which all the bursts were star shaped. The Tennessee Volunteer's fight song with the bursts being the team's colors bursting in front of Neyland Stadium was always a perennial crowd pleaser. Other musical selections included Smoke on the Water from Deep Purple, the theme from Jaws, and Born to Be Wild from Steppenwolf, just to name a few.

In a career that spanned seven decades, Toledo produced thousands of works of art and became widely regarded as one of Mexico's most important contemporary artists. An activist as well as an artist, he promoted the artistic culture and heritage of his home state of Oaxaca. Toledo was considered part of the Breakaway Generation of Mexican art. Early life and education Toledo was born in Juchit√°n (or Mexico City, according to some sources) in 1940, the child of Francisco L√≥pez Orozco and Florencia Toledo Nolasco. He studied at the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Oaxaca and the Centro Superior de Artes Applicadas del Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, Mexico, where he studied graphic arts with Guillermo Silva Santamaria. As a young man, Toledo studied art in Paris where he met Rufino Tamayo and Octavio Paz. Career Self- portrait Toledo worked in various media, including pottery, sculpture, weaving, graphic arts, and painting. There have been exhibitions of his work in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Japan, Sweden, the United States, as well as other countries. His work is known for its portrayal of flora and fauna, mythical imagery, and erotic content. Art critic Dore Ashton characterized Toledo as \\"a modern artist who, like others such as Paul Klee, Marc Chagall and Mir√≥, has learned the value of the sweeping glance into the minutest corners of nature.\\" At the age of 19, a solo exhibition of his work in Fort Worth, Texas, received international attention. Toledo lived and worked in Paris starting in 1960 and returned to Mexico in 1965. He lived briefly in New York in the late 1970s, holding an exhibition at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York. In 1980, Mexico City's Museo de Arte Moderno hosted a retrospective of his art. His work was shown at both the Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum of Chicago in 1984. Toledo settled in Oaxaca in the 1980s. Toledo was featured at the Venice Biennale in 1997. An exhibition of over 90 of his works was shown at the Whitechapel Gallery in London and the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid in 2000. In 2017, the Fondo Cultural Banamex published a four-volume catalogue of Toledo's work, the result of a five-year investigation to track pieces held in museums, galleries, and private collections around the world. Art activism \\"Chivo\\" (Goat) Toledo's social and cultural concerns about his home state led to his participation in the establishment of an art library at the Instituto de Artes Gr√°ficas de Oaxaca (IAGO), as well as his involvement in the founding of the :es:Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo de Oaxaca (MACO), the Patronato Pro-Defensa y Conservaci√≥n del Patrimonio Cultural de Oaxaca, a library for the blind, a photographic center, and the Eduardo Mata Music Library. A cultural conservationist, Toledo fought against the building of a McDonald's in Oaxaca City and led protests to stop the construction of a convention center on a local mountain. Following the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero, Toledo made an exhibition of kites to remember the students, honoring a tradition from Oaxaca.

The Doodletown Pipers (also known as the New Doodletown Pipers) were a 1960s and 1970s easy listening vocal group founded by Ward Ellis, George Wilkins, Bernie Brillstein and Jerry Weintraub. The Doodletown Pipers made numerous appearances on network television (including The Ed Sullivan Show), and worked with such names as Count Basie, The Carpenters, Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Gorshin, Alan King, Mike Post, Sarah Vaughan, John Wayne, and Rowan and Martin. Members of the group included \\"Mic\\" Bell, Mike Campbell, Jim Gilstrap, Teresa Graves, Augie Johnson, Rod Anderson, Tom McKenzie, Samantha Lessard, and Oren Waters. The Doodletown Pipers are considered by some to be the epitome of bland, squeaky- clean popular music. One critic describes their music paradoxically as \\"dull- as-lint\\" yet at the same time \\"weirdly but undeniably charming.\\" [] On his television program, Roger Miller referred to them as the \\"Poodletown Diapers\\". Development The Doodletown Pipers' first appearance was on The Red Skelton Show with 30 members in the group. The group was then cut down to 20 members when they opened for George Burns and Lainie Kazan at the Nugget in Reno, Nevada in June, 1966. The original members were Holly Mershon, Teresa Graves, Helen (Aiken) Maxwell, Joy Jolley, Helen Sexton, Natalie Cirello, Jill McDonald, Kathy Cahill, Lynn Dolin, Pat Henderson, Karen Warren, and Linda A., Mike Campbell, \\"Little Ricky\\" Richard Doran, \\"Big Bob\\" Anderson, Gene Meyer, Tommy Webb, Russell Carson, Bill Lively, Marshall Ramirez, Emmitt Cash, and Bob Kenny. Some of the first replacements were Rod Anderson, Steve Sweetland, Jim Gilstrap, Augie Johnson, Ellie Mandel, Elaine Blakely, Lorna Wright, Pam Feener, Sharry Dore, Larry Puma, Kathy Wright, Jan Bunch, Patty \\"Chocolate\\" Banks, Samantha \\"Sammie\\" Williams, and Taffy Jones. The group worked non-stop from 1966 through the late 1970s. They toured with Nancy Wilson, who was an early supporter of the group. They also opened for, among others, Perry Como, Jane Morgan (whose husband, Jerry Weintraub, was one of the group's managers), Eddie Fisher, Shelley Berman, Phil Harris, and Henry Mancini. The Pipers also worked such venues as The Greek Theater, Madison Square Garden, Avery Fisher Hall, The Sands, Sahara, Flamingo and Frontier Hotels in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and Reno, Nevada. The DTPs had two television shows. The Smothers Brothers' 1967 Summer replacement show called Our Place co-starring Jack Burns, Avery Schreiber and Rowlf the Dog (puppeteered by Jim Henson). It was produced by Ed Sullivan. The second show was six (6) one-hour specials starring the DTPs with guest-stars such as Norm Crosby. They were also semi-regulars on The Roger Miller Show on NBC. They were also regulars on The Carpenters TV show Make Your Own Kind of Music. They did a tremendous amount of television appearing on The Jerry Lewis Show, The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show, and The Ed Sullivan Show, (6 times, once following a promotional video for The Beatles' \\"Hello, Goodbye\\"). They appeared on specials including \\"Rodgers & Hart Today,\\" the Emmy-award winning Sing Out Sweet Land with John Wayne, and numerous shows with Bing Crosby and Perry Como, among others. While their early records had reasonable success, after they were signed by Bell Records as \\"The New Doodletown Pipers\\" by TV composer and record producer Mike Post in 1971, their new records met with little success. Their last appearance may have been in 1987, when they appeared on Dave Letterman's Old Fashioned Christmas, a special episode of Late Night with David Letterman. Post-Pipers Some of the members continued their careers after they left the DTPs. Teresa Graves became a regular on Laugh-In and later starred on Get Christie Love!. Helen Maxwell fell victim to a stalker and became a nationally recognized public safety/criminal justice journalist (ABC 20/20, CBS This Morning, Home Show) appearing on more network television shows for that, than for singing and dancing. Taffy Jones later became a regular on The Dean Martin Show as one of the four Ding-a-ling Sisters touring with Engelbert Humperdinck and Bob Hope, and made numerous appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and of course, appeared with Dean Martin at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. Taffy also worked with Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams, Phyllis Diller, Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, Wayne Newton, Joey Bishop, Petula Clark, Don Ho, Juliet Prowse, Ginger Rogers, Bill Cosby, and Red Skelton, to name a few. Steve Sweetland became a very well known European and New York voice teacher. Tommy Webb spent years touring with Mac Davis and Connie Stevens. Lynn Dolin worked on \\"The Johhny Mann Show\\" and had a solo career in the Christian music field. Jim Gilstrap became a legendary studio singer/contractor and worked with Stevie Wonder for years (his is the first voice you hear on \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life.\\" \\"Little Ricky\\" Richard Doran toured with the National company of the Tony Award winning show George M! and co-starred in the movie \\"Harrad Summer.\\" Patty \\"Chocolate\\" Banks was an original member of Graham Central Station as well as Rose Royce. Holly Mershon has continued to work as an actress, background singer, model and of all things, a professional clown, appearing recently in a festival in Barcelona, Spain with her partner. Mike Campbell is a well known jazz singer and voice teacher with CDs on Palo Alto, I.T.I., Audiophile and Celeste Records. He has opened for Sarah Vaughan among others, and has appeared in Japan, Australia, Sweden, and all over the United States in jazz festivals, concerts and clinics. He heads the Vocal Department at the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, Calif.. Mic Bell was nominated for a Tony Award for his performed as \\"Joe\\" in the Broadway revival of Showboat. Tom McKenzie later became a studio singer, as well as the lead singer of The Archies singing group on the U.S. of Archie Show, and certain episodes of the Groovie Goolies cartoon series. Oren Waters has sung background vocals on numerous singles, albums and CDs, including those recorded by Michael Jackson and Neil Diamond. In 1970, Rod Anderson began directing the shows and entertainment at the Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii and then the Owner/Director of Universal Artists Management booking mainland and local groups in Hawaii and producing concerts and convention shows. Bernie Brillstein went on to become one of Hollywood's most powerful managers, with clients including John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Jim Henson, and Chris Farley. Music directors included Ed Lojeski, who is now the music director at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Westlake Village, Calif., George Wilkins, who became a staff composer for Disney theme parks and music composer for the famous Teddy Ruxpin toys, and Richard Bellis and John Beal, who became successful TV and film composers. Popular culture The group received a publicity boost when they were mentioned in a 1997 episode of The Simpsons entitled \\"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\\": :Homer: \\"We don't have anything in common. Look at these records: Jim Nabors, Glen Campbell, the Doodletown Pipers. Now look at her records! They stink!\\" The group were also mentioned in season 6 of the movie-lampooning TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000, the episode (episode #620) in which Mike and the bots watch the 1967 Italian spy film Danger!! Death Ray. Shortly after the opening credits end, the wordless-vocal theme song (that plays periodically throughout the film) continues over the action. As the song ends, robot Crow affects the voice of a radio DJ, saying: \\"That was Bop-ba-dop-a-da- da by the Doodletown Pipers!\\" The Main Street Singers and New Main Street Singers in A Mighty Wind are partially inspired by The Doodletown Pipers.

Biography Obreg√≥n was born in Barcelona, Spain. He was the son of a Colombian father and a Catalan mother. The Obreg√≥n family owned a textile factory in Barranquilla, Colombia. Most of his childhood was spent in Barranquilla and Liverpool, England. After returning to Barranquilla, he decided to become an artist. He studied fine arts in Boston for a year in 1939, then returned to Barcelona to serve as Vice Consul of Colombia for four years. He married Ilva Rasch-Isla, the daughter of poet Miguel Rasch-Isla, during his time in Spain. In 1948, he became Director of the School of Fine Arts in Santaf√© de Bogot√°, where he was influenced by the fresco style of artists Pedro Nel G√≥mez and Santiago Martinez Delgado. He left the School of Fine Arts and moved to France with his second wife, Sonia Osorio; he later married his third wife, English painter Freda Sargent. After traveling around Europe, he returned to Barranquilla in 1955. Obreg√≥n died on April 11, 1992, succumbing to a brain tumor. He lived and worked exclusively in Cartagena for the last 22 years of his life, from 1970 until his death in 1992. Career Obreg√≥n presented his first solo exhibition in Colombia in 1945. He participated in the fifth and sixth Sal√≥n de Artistas Colombianos in 1944 and 1945, which attracted attention from press and critics. In 1945, Obreg√≥n settled in Barranquilla where he won first prize for Dorso de mujer at the first and showed his second solo exhibition in February 1946. In 1949, he moved to Paris and exhibited work throughout France, Germany and Switzerland. He then moved to Alba, near Avignon, where he remained until 1955. A painting from that year, Still Life in Yellow, shows that his personal style was fully developed, with the formal elements that came to characterize his work. In 1955, Souvenir of Venice (1954) was acquired for the Museum of Modern Art New York, making Obreg√≥n one of the few Colombians in the museum's collection. In 1962, he won the Sal√≥n de Artistas Colombianos Prize, establishing him as a major 20th century Colombian artist. Style and elements Obreg√≥n is primarily a painter. His compositions are usually divided horizontally into two areas of different pictorial value or size, but of equal visual intensity. Other elements are placed against them. His style is characterized by use of color, exploration of traits and strokes through brush handling, and employment of transparency and impastoes. Landscapes were translated into geometric symbols of Colombia. Obreg√≥n is a good example of the abstract Surrealist trend in Latin America. Color plays a fundamental role in integrating the structures of his design, using geometric forms and expressionism. Both on an affective level and as a unifying element of the composition, color is an essential part of Obregon's style. The elegiac and dramatic tone of El Velorio, for example, is heightened by the dominance of the red color in the geometrically articulated composition. Critic Marta Traba identified a series of characteristic elements in Obregon's work: personal poetic values; self-sufficiency in regard to reality, indeed starting from it; expressive intention; freedom of form; search for identity based on the landscape, zoology, and flora; elliptic space people by magic elements; and contempt for urban culture. Also unique to Obregon is that instead of faithfully painting what he sees, he made extensive use of his personal imagination and vitality. From his still lifes of the 1950s to his landscapes of the sky, the sea and the buildings of Cartagena de Indias, where he worked until his death, Obreg√≥n's work is multifaceted. He conveys his feeling for the geography and wildlife of Colombia, his love of family and his passion for women. His subjects remind the viewer of loyalty, friendship, memory and ultimately of the wonder of life, however insignificant it may seem in terms of the cosmos. Often all of them are accompanied by lush samples of fauna and flora, where, in some cases, the protagonist is the flower, and Flor de mangle [1965], or chameleons, as in Dos cameleons [1962], Jardines tropicales [1962] and sister piece Homenaje a Zurbaran [1962], and Jard√≠n barroco [1965]. As a significant event in the El √∫ltimo c√≥ndor [1965], the artist has the animal recumbent, purple latter, denouncing the real danger of extinction which is his kind, next to a colorful mangrove, paradoxically also affected by human intervention. Periods Between 1942 and 1946, Obreg√≥n assimilated different influences. His painting shows the influence of Picasso and Graham Sutherland, although these are only points of departure. Between 1947 and 1957, influenced by Goya and Picasso, he painted themes such as lunatic asylums, madmen in cafes, and dogs. He was witness to the popular revolt of April 9, 1948, and became especially interested in interpreting that event, which would reach its maximum expression in his oil Violencia. In his third period, from 1958 to 1965, Obreg√≥n made another trip to Europe and the United States. During the 1960s, Obreg√≥n used a pictographic system of his own invention, with formal and chromatic symbols. This system was recognized at the Ninth S√£o Paulo Biennial, where he represented Colombia in his own pavilion and was awarded the Francisco Matarazzo Sobrinho Grand Prize for Latin America. After 1966, once he earned wide recognition at home and abroad, he switched from oils to acrylic. Influences Over a period of four decades, Obreg√≥n incorporated into his painting a repertory of themes that are unmistakably Colombian in character. Obreg√≥n took influence from European culture, while retaining an Andean imagery and stylistic creation, using guitars, bulls, and the Andean condor in his pieces. In 1959, Obreg√≥n painted his first condor, which has since appeared in almost fifty canvases during his career. While alluding to the nation, as the condor figures in Colombia's coat of arms, in Obreg√≥n's work, the condor also refers to the exaltation of the might of American nature, the ideal of liberty, and the power of vitality. The use of guitar iconography may have come from the influence of Picasso, whose Cubist influence was the starting point for Obreg√≥n's artwork. At different times throughout his career, Obreg√≥n produced works related to political violence in Colombia, such as La Violencia, since 1948. Estudiante Muerto, awarded the national prize for Colombia at the 1956 Guggenheim International Exhibition, belonged to a group of paintings commemorating students and popular leaders who lost their lives during this period of social unrest. The \\"Big Five\\" Obreg√≥n is the artist perhaps most closely identified with the spirit of artistic renewal manifested in the 1950s in Colombia. It was during this period that Obreg√≥n, Enrique Grau, Fernando Botero, Eduardo Ram√≠rez Villamizar and √âdgar Negret, came to be known as the \\"Big Five\\" of Colombian art. Also in 1956, Obreg√≥n's Cattle Drowning in the Magdalena River was awarded first prize at the Gulf Caribbean Competition in Houston, Texas, an exhibition that also included works by others from the \\"Big Five\\". La Violencia works El Velorio (The Wake), also known by El estudiante (The Student) and other similar names, was one of Obreg√≥n's most prominent commentaries on La Violencia. In this piece, Obreg√≥n displays his early cubist influence, evident in the reduction of details and objects into elemental shapes. While the simple image appears to display a body, with bandages covering the man's body and a partially severed leg, the context of the piece provides more information. Obreg√≥n painted this piece during La Violencia in Colombia. Obreg√≥n was one of the first Colombian artists to comment on La Violencia. El Velorio refers to a specific event that happened on June 8 and 9 of 1954; a student uprising at the National University against the dictatorship of President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla resulted in the massacre of thirteen students by army forces. Contemporaries Ignacio G√≥mez Jaramillo and Enrique Grau also witnessed this event, but Obreg√≥n's painting is more abstract and more expressive than their interpretations of the same event. The departure from anecdotal issues and the use of non-naturalistic lines and colors and fragmentation of the figure with expressive purposes in El Velorio influenced other artists interested in addressing the socio-political issues during the sixties. In La Violencia (1962), Obreg√≥n conveyed the ominous atmosphere and perversion evident in the violence that occurred in rural areas. This painting suggests the figure of a woman on her back, a figure which blends with the landscape. She has been attacked and killed; the skin of her face and seems to have been torn up. The gray body with scratches and subtle touches of red creates an impression of desolation. While the presentation date of La Violencia cannot tie the painting to any specific instance, it can be inferred that he was aware of the atrocities of the time. Murals Tierra, Mar, y Aire (Earth, Sea, and Wind) is a mural currently on the fa√ßade of the Mezrahi building, located at 53 Carrera and 76th Street in Barranquilla, Colombia. Obreg√≥n was commissioned to create the mural by Samuel Mezrahi, father of the current owner and resident of the building, Mair Mezrahi-Tourgemen, when the artist was at the midpoint of his artistic career. Obreg√≥n was paid 15,000.00 pesos to complete the project. It took Obreg√≥n around a year to finish the mural, as he chose an extremely delicate and time-consuming approach, requiring a complex process called mosaic. To construct the mural, he glued individual pieces of cristinac on the wall of the Mezrahi building. Tierra, Mar y Aire covers the entire height of the three-story building wall. The surface of the work measures . Obreg√≥n utilized intense colors and symbols that pay tribute to the tropical nature of the area. Although, the mural is in need of repair, no effort has been made as the materials are no longer being manufactured. Cosas de Aire (Air Things), created in 1970, was donated by The BBVA Bank of Colombia to the Museo de Arte Moderno de Barranquilla in 2008. It is an acrylic mural on mortar cement, measuring 16.5x9 meters, featuring bright and sweeping geometric patterns, devoid of the brushstrokes that are typical of his work. It is the last of a series of five murals painted by Obreg√≥n in Barranquilla. Exhibitions and awards *1956 Cattle Drowning in the Magdelena River, Gulf Caribbean Competition, Houston, Texas.

An octapeptide as well as a Pro-Ser-Thr-rich C terminus may also be present. Pax proteins are important in early animal development for the specification of specific tissues, as well as during epimorphic limb regeneration in animals capable of such. The paired domain was initially described in 1987 as the \\"paired box\\" in the Drosophila protein paired (prd; ). Groups Within the mammalian family, there are four well defined groups of Pax genes. *Pax group 1 (Pax 1 and 9), *Pax group 2 (Pax 2, 5 and 8), *Pax group 3 (Pax 3 and 7) and *Pax group 4 (Pax 4 and 6). Two more families, Pox-neuro and Pax-Œ±/Œ≤, exist in basal bilaterian species. Orthologous genes exist throughout the Metazoa, including extensive study of the ectopic expression in Drosophila using murine Pax6. The two rounds of whole-genome duplications in vertebrate evolution is responsible for the creation of as many as 4 paralogs for each Pax protein.

He is the only character whose parents are shown other than the exception of Duck's mother in one show who is a chicken. Little Bear lives in a stucco, wood, plaster, and brick house. He is always kind and loves to play and explore with his friends. His catchphrase is \\"Hmmmm... Interesting!\\" * Emily (voiced by Jennifer Martini) is a 7-year-old little girl who is Little Bear's best friend. In the summer, Emily vacations with her parents by the river near Little Bear's home. Emily carries around a doll named Lucy everywhere she goes and is very attached to her. Emily gave Little Bear Lucy when she was leaving to go back to school but then took her back, saying that she just remembered that \\"Lucy has to go to school\\", too. Emily eventually moves to the forest permanently and lives there with her grandmother. * Owl (voiced by Amos Crawley) is a male owl who is sometimes pompous, yet he is very wise. He lives in a treehouse, and can be quite serious at times. Although Owl enjoys fun games, he will only participate if the gameplay is sensible. It is also shown that reading is his hobby. * Duck (voiced by Tracy Ryan) is a female duck with yellow feathers, an orange beak and a long neck. Slow and smart at the same time, Duck is one who gets herself into comical situations. She lives in a nest, although in one episode, she expressed longing for a house and tried to live in a house boat. It floated downriver filled with frogs and Duck lived happily in her nest. She loves playing \\"princess\\" and pretend. She was hatched in a nest of chicks, because \\"some eggs got mixed up\\", and Little Bear taught her to fly when she was a duckling. She never has any ducklings of her own, but she is sometimes seen babysitting a group of them. * Cat (voiced by Andrew Sabiston) is a laidback, slothful male cat who enjoys prowling at night, playing tricks on passersby, and eating. When he and his friends must get to a certain place in the woods, Cat often leads them through one of his shortcuts. His catchphrase is \\"Boo!\\" * Hen (voiced by Elizabeth Hanna) is a fussy, feisty chicken who lives in a large chicken coop. She is classy, sophisticated and enjoys cleanliness, though her several nieces and nephews often mess up her spotless house. However, she never turns down the opportunity for fun. Hen has also been shown to be fond of opera, but it seems that she is not good at singing it. * Mother Bear (voiced by Janet-Laine Green) is Little Bear's mother. She enjoys cooking and is always there to help Little Bear if he needs it. She also seems to be very tidy and does not like it when the house becomes messy. She normally wears a pink shirt and a blue skirt with a white apron. * Father Bear (voiced by Dan Hennessey) is Little Bear's father and Mother Bear's husband. His occupation is a fisherman and sometimes takes Little Bear out fishing. He has been to many places and likes to keep things that are old, even if they have to be thrown away.

He wears a green suit but with khakis and a dark red tie with brown shoes. * Rusty Bear (voiced by George Buza) is Father Bear's younger brother and Little Bear's uncle. He mentions that he lives in the woods, and that he would prefer to live there because it is quiet and peaceful. He is a very large bear, slightly taller and huskier than Father Bear. He has a deep voice, wears overalls, and has a red handkerchief around his neck. He is only seen in a few of the Little Bear episodes. Little Bear is fascinated with Rusty's outdoor ethic, and whenever he shows up, Little Bear is tempted to emulate his rustic character. * Granny (voiced by Kay Hawtrey) Emily's grandmother, who she lives with in the summer and then permanently, has traveled the world and has many odd pieces of furniture. She is the owner of Tutu. * Tutu (voiced by Tara Strong) is Emily and Granny's dog. She acts very hyper and she can understand humans. According to Granny, she only speaks French, yet she understands English. * Mitzi (voiced by Ashley Taylor) is a 5-year-old mischievous, sometimes rather unthoughtful tomboyish monkey who lives in a tree house in the forest around Little Bear's home.

Little Bear and Little Ick form a bit of a sibling relationship together like Little Bear feeling left out because Mother Bear seems to be paying more attention to Little Ick. Little Ick is the baby raccoon's nickname from Little Bear because \\"Ick\\" is the only thing the baby can say. * Marshmallow ‚Äì Marshmallow is a baby white skunk who is found by Owl and Little Bear in an episode and plays with Duck, Little Bear, Owl, and Cat in the episode \\"Little Footprints\\".

Fusion Pass gives holder access to two Mount Hood resorts. The Oregonian, October 28, 2007.  Expansion  In the summer of 2001, Cooper Spur was purchased by an affiliate of Mount Hood Meadows named Meadows North LLC, and announced its intention to develop the Cooper Spur area as a year round destination resort with additional lifts, runs, and accommodation. A July 18, 2001 proposal included developing a golf course, 450 housing units, a conference center, ice rink, swimming pool, amphitheater, shopping mall, and other developments. The development was opposed by groups which favor preserving and expanding wilderness areas of northern Mount Hood. Other concerns include potentially disrupting a key elk migration route, watershed disruption for two thousand nearby residents, and deforestation. A controversial land swap was concluded with Hood River County by Meadows North LLC which increased the acreage adjacent to Cooper Spur owned by Meadows North LLC. In the summer of 2002, the decades-old T-bar lift was replaced with a double chair, and excavation work created a tubing area. After Meadows North LLC abandoned its initiative to develop Cooper Spur, a proposal was made to trade Cooper Spur's facilities, existing , and its special-use permit which authorizes of development in exchange for of Forest Service land near Government Camp. The proposal became a provision of House Bill 5025 [109th] (Mount Hood Stewardship Legacy Act) and passed the House, but expired without senate approval. According to a GAO assessment, the value of lands were not appraised equivalently and probably not fairly.

It was revealed by the Associated Press on October 15, 1984. The ninety-page book of instructions focused mainly on how \\"Armed Propaganda Teams\\" could build political support in Nicaragua for the Contra cause through deceit, intimidation, and violence. The manual also discussed assassinations. Footnote 105 The International Court of Justice case Nicaragua v. United States found that the publication of this manual had \\"encouraged acts ... contrary to general principles of humanitarian law.\\" However, the CIA claimed that the purpose of the manual was to \\"moderate\\" the extreme violence already being used by the Contras. Authorship Cover of the US Army's Handbook on Aggressor Insurgent War (1967) The manual was written in October 1983 by a CIA contract employee who used the alias John Kirkpatrick, who \\"was a U.S. Army counterinsurgency specialist, with experience in the Vietnam War-era Phoenix Program, working under contract to the CIA's International Activities Division.\\" Duane Clarridge, who oversaw the writing of the manual, claimed in his 2009 book that John Kirkpatrick was brought in to prepare a course for the Contras on how to interact with the civilian population and outline the rule of engagement, and that he also produced a manual consisting of this curriculum material. Kirkpatrick based his work off of existing US Army manuals, particularly 1968 Green Beret lesson plans used at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School,The source does not specify enough to be certain, but this may have been Field Manual 33-1 the Green Berets' Lesson Plan 643, Armed Psyop: Implicit and Explicit Terror (April 1968), and Field Manual 30‚Äì104, Collaborators on developing the manual included CIA Contra coordinator Ray Doty, Nicaraguan Democratic Force director of communications Edgar Chamorro, Noel Ortiz, and Laura Ortiz. Publication history The manual was written in English, and then translated into Spanish by Edgar Chamorro. It was printed in ninety pages under the pseudonym Tayac√°n in late 1983. Chamorro objected to two portions in the document, namely the sections on hiring professional criminals for special jobs and killing colleagues to create martyrs for the cause. He arranged for these two pages to be physically torn out from 2000 copies. However, 5000 copies were printed, so some commentators have reasoned that some copies were distributed with these sections intact. Political reaction A Reagan administration official stated privately that the manual had been written by an \\"overzealous\\" independent low-level employee under contract to the CIA. Further, the manual had not been cleared for publication, was \\"clearly against the law\\", and that it violated Reagan's 1981 Executive Order banning political assassinations. On October 18, 1984, President Ronald Reagan ordered CIA Director William Casey to initiate an investigation by the agency's Inspector General. Reagan stated that \\"whoever is guilty [of preparing the manual], we will deal with that situation and they will be removed.\\" In a news conference on November 7, the day after his reelection victory, Reagan dismissed the entire controversy as \\"much ado about nothing\\". Shortly thereafter, a White House spokesman said Reagan had approved the Inspector General's report recommending discipline of several mid-level officials. Five mid-level CIA employees received punishments ranging from written reprimands to suspension without pay for \\"poor judgment and lapses in oversight\\" because of the manual. In 1987, it was found that Casey blocked any punishment of the two senior CIA officials involved with producing and distributing the manual, including one, Duane Clarridge, who after initially denying that he had anything to do with the manual, admitted he was \\"fully responsible\\" for the document. In closed testimony to a congressional committee, Casey reportedly declared, \\"There's no reason to discipline them for one little slip-up.\\" Under political pressure to remove Clarridge from his role, he was promoted to chief of the CIA's European operations. Contents The manual recommended \\"selective use of violence for propagandistic effects\\" and to \\"neutralize\\" (i.e., kill) government officials. Nicaraguan Contras were taught to: > [lead] demonstrators into clashes with the authorities, to provoke riots or > shootings, which lead to the killing of one or more persons, who will be > seen as the martyrs; this situation should be taken advantage of immediately > against the Government to create even bigger conflicts. The manual also recommended: > selective use of armed force for PSYOP [psychological operations] effect. > ... Carefully selected, planned targets ‚Äî judges, police officials, tax > collectors, etc. ‚Äî may be removed for PSYOP effect in a UWOA [unconventional > warfare operations area], but extensive precautions must ensure that the > people \\"concur\\" in such an act by thorough explanatory canvassing among the > affected populace before and after conduct of the mission. Nicaragua v. United States The manual was one of the issues the International Court of Justice (IJC) analyzed in the Nicaragua v. United States 1986 ICJ 1 case. The court's jurisdiction for this case was disputed by the United States, an issue that has never been resolved. The ICJ statements included: \\"Finds that the United States of America, by producing in 1983 a manual entitled Operaciones sicol√≥gicas en guerra de guerrillas, and disseminating it to contra forces, has encouraged the commission by them of acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law; but does not find a basis for concluding that any such acts which may have been committed are imputable to the United States of America as acts of the United States of America.\\" \\"The Court has to determine whether the relationship of the contras to the United States Government was such that it would be right to equate the contras, for legal purposes, with an organ of the United States Government, or as acting on behalf of that Government. The Court considers that the evidence available to it is insufficient to demonstrate the total dependence of the contras on United States aid. A partial dependency, the exact extent of which the Court cannot establish, may be inferred from the fact that the leaders were selected by the United States, and from other factors such as the organisation, training and equipping of the force, planning of operations, the choosing of targets and the operational support provided. There is no clear evidence that the United States actually exercised such a degree of control as to justify treating the contras as acting on its behalf.\\" \\"Having reached the above conclusion, the Court takes the view that the contras remain responsible for their acts, in particular the alleged violations by them of humanitarian law.

Specimen from the Allan Herbarium in Lincoln, New Zealand. Image used with permission from Landcare Research 2019 copyright CC-BY 4.0 Halocarpus bidwillii, the mountain pine or bog pine, is a species of conifer in the family Podocarpaceae. It is native and endemic to New Zealand. It is an evergreen shrub favouring both bogs and dry stony ground, seldom growing to more than high. The leaves are scale-like on adult plants, long, arranged spirally on the shoots; young seedlings and occasional shoots on older plants have soft strap-like leaves and broad. The seed cones are highly modified, berry-like, with a white aril surrounding the single long seed. Halocarpus bidwillii in Tongariro National Park, on NW slopes of Mount Ruapehu  Species Description  Although it is called a pine, the mountain pine is more like a shrub, anywhere from 2‚Äì12 feet high or up to 3.5 meters high, and with a short trunk that ‚Äúrarely exceeds‚Äù 1 foot in diameter and more commonly has a thickness up to 38 cm. Bark takes on a red to brown appearance and leaves have a green color when fresh, but can become brown to red when they are dried out. Sometimes as the horizontal branches grow, they form roots forming a \\"bush\\" around the parent shrub which creates a vast mini-forest that looks like a huge, low tree or shrub. The parent tree may die, leaving its outliers intact which are thin and red. Thus from a distance, it may seem that one mountain pine is actually a whole forest of trees, perhaps explaining where the name ‚Äúpine‚Äù arose to describe this short shrub. Depending on the maturity of a mountain pine, the shrubs take on rather drastic differences in leaf appearance. In the juvenile state, leaves are linear, flat and spreading much like a pine tree, while in the mature state, leathery leaves 1-2mm long take on an overlapping scaled appearance, much like the scales of a fish. In the flowering months of October to December small male cones 3-5mm in length, take on a brown to red appearance at the end of the mountain pine‚Äôs scale like leaves, and stomata are able to be seen by the naked eye as white spots. Pollen particles are solitary, terminal, ca. 3‚Äì5 mm long. Appendage is adnate to base of carpel, cortex, inverted, with a drooping ovule. The fruit of mountain pine consists of a dark brown, black-brown to purple-brown seed in a fleshy, waxy white cup. Seeds are 2‚Äì3 mm long, subglobose, compressed, with a white to yellow aril. The aril is V-shaped under the seed. Seeds are hairless, smooth, 3.0-4.5 mm long (including arils), and take on a dark brown or dark brown to dark purple brown appearance; seeds are also typically shiny, oval oblong, and compressed. In his initial discovery of the species, Kirk identified 2 forms of mountain pine within the species that he differentiated mostly on the basis of branch shape. The alpha or erecta form of mountain pine has flat and ribbed leaves with branches being slender, while the beta or reclinata form has distinct mid-rib leaves and stout branches. These two forms are very difficult however to differentiate and as such these species-specific distinctions aren‚Äôt made in current descriptions and literature of the species.  Taxonomy = Etymology  This species was named in honour of the botanist and explorer John Carne Bidwill.  Geographic Distribution  Natural global range Mountain pine is a species endemic to New Zealand. New Zealand range Mountain pine are native to New Zealand and grow from Coromandel to the extreme south; as the latitude increases, they are found at lower altitudes. In the North Island, mountain pine can be found in Taupo county near Rotoaira and in the central volcanic plateau and Kaingaroa plains. In the South Island, as the name implies, mountain pine are common in mountainous regions in Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago, with some plants found as high as 4500 ft above sea level in the Canterbury alps. Mountain pine can also be found on Stewart Island directly at sea level.  Habitat Preferences  The mountain pine has a wide range of habitats, but mostly prefers montane to subalpine habitats from 39¬∫ latitude southward. Within its range, the annual average temperature is 8.5‚ÑÉ, the coldest month average minimum temperature is -0.8‚ÑÉ, and the annual average precipitation is 2458 mm. In the North Island, mountain pine are found exclusively in montane to alpine habitats and usually between 600 ‚Äì1500m elevation. However, mountain pine can also thrive in low land conditions, and their presence on Stewart Island at sea level serves as an example for this. Mountain pine are also hardy plants growing in a wide range of ground conditions. Mountain pine can grow in both bog environments and in dry stony ground, with mountain pine growing extremely well in the Te Anau stony ground environment and just as effectively in wetland margins, frost flats, and riverbeds.  Life Cycle  Like all conifers, the mountain pine life cycle is dependent on cones. Male and female flowers are found on separate trees ‚Äì male cones 3-5mm long are at the tips of branches and female flowers grow solo or in pairs and form just below the tips of the branches. From the time of seeding, male conifers will take about 2‚Äì3 years to reach maturity. When they have matured, male cones appear during the flowering season which runs from October to December, but most often occurs during October and November. Depending on the exact location, cone development can vary with North Island mountain pine producing cones more toward the October end of the range. By the end of November, the once juvenile reddish cones take on more brown character and begin to shed pollen. Around this same time, ovules grow at the tips of the branches and once fertilized by the pollen they develop a white aril at the base. Seeds begin to develop in the following months up until the fruiting season, which occurs from February to June. By February, green fruits mature, but do not ripen until mid to early March. Once they begin to ripen, fruits ripen quickly and take on a purple to black color similar to the shade of an eggplant. The seeds themselves are only 3-4mm long and have regular grooves stretching the length of the seed. Mountain pine can often be confused with closely related H. biformis, but a key difference between these 2 species‚Äô seeds is that mountain pine seeds are typically smaller and squatter than those of H. biformis.  Diet and Foraging  Mountain pine are one of the three most frost resistant types of conifers, and can typically resist frosts beyond -7 ¬∞C. Similarly resilient, mountain pine are often found in poor soils. True of many conifers, mountain pine actually prefer leached, low nutrient, and poorly drained soils, with many pollen diagrams showing that mountain pines thrive in infertile bogs. Although tolerant of frosts past -7 ¬∞C, mountain pines are typically found in environments with a mean annual temperature of 8.5 ¬∞C and an average minimum temperature of -0.8 ¬∞C. Mountain pine also live in environments that average 2458mm of precipitation a year.  Predators, Parasites, and Diseases  Thriving without true fruits, the mountain pine has few predators which are mostly herbivorous insects. Briefly, the 4 main categories of insects that prey on mountain pine are: beetles, sucking bugs, caterpillars, and mites. Weevils, a specific type of beetle, feed on all Podocarpaceae (mountain pine‚Äôs taxonomic family), and larvae thrive in any kind of decaying wood, including mountain pine. More specific, scale insects, Eriococcus dacrydii, live on the stems and leaf scales of the Halocarpus species, and even more specific, (Dugdale, 1996) found a species of conifer associated moth that uses the mountain pine as its host plant, appropriately named Chrysorthenches halocarpi. The caterpillars of Chrysorthenches halocarpi feed on the mountain pine shoots and when too many are present, the mountain pine appears bronze and growth can be stunted. Finally, Tuckerella flabellifera, red mites with white scales from Tasmania, live on young mountain pine plants and presumably feed on the young leaves and wood. In addition to insect predators, mountain pine also suffers from a nematode disease which is caused by the pine wood nematode. Infected trees are characterized by having yellow to brown or red to brown needles, wilting, and stopped resin secretion. In extreme cases, this disease can lead to death in which the wood takes on a blue appearance. Treatments for the disease are mostly done after tree death and consist of cleaning and cutting dead wood.  Nomenclature  The epithet bidwillii is in honor of John Carne Bidwill (1815-1853) who was an Australian botanist born in England and became the first director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. However, H. bidwilli did not always identify with its current name. Kirk first discovered the species in 1877 under the name Dacrydium bidwillii, a name that is still presently used at times to reference the species, and this naming was suggested by Sir Joseph Hooker. It wasn‚Äôt until 1982 when C.J. Quinn proposed an alternative taxonomy for the species based on ovule morphology and orientation, that the species obtained the current scientific name of Halocarpus bidwillii.  Identification  Bog pines are easily recognized when fruiting by the waxy white (very slightly yellowish) arils subtending the seed. Vegetatively compared with other species of Halocarpus, mountain pine have the growth habits of smaller multibranched shrubs to small trees, weak keel-shaped leaves, and more slender, initially quadrangular branchlets. The seeds of mountain pine are distinguished from H. biformis (with which it most often confused) by the ventral and dorsal surfaces which are usually significant longitudinally grooved (sometimes only on the ventral surface).  Uses of Mountain Pine  When Kirk first described the mountain pine, he declared it to be of ‚Äúlittle economic value‚Äù except perhaps for firewood. Perhaps he was unaware at the time, but Kirk should‚Äôve specified that mountain pine could only be used for firewood without its bark. Mountain pine is one of the few New Zealand conifers that is able to resist fire, mostly because of its thick bark, but also because of its ability to recover through basal resprouting after a fire event. Other uses of the raw wood include timber production for use in buildings and railway sleepers. Another potential use for mountain pine could be for decoration. Kirk commented on the ‚Äúattractive character‚Äù of mountain pine, citing its symmetrical growth, and suggested that it could become an ornamental plant. Aside from decoration and perhaps firewood, no other uses of mountain pine or its products have been described to date.  Insecticidal Activity  One trait of the mountain pine that is recently receiving academic attention, but has not yet been realized by the commercial sector is the use of mountain pine plant extract as an insecticide. Extracts of mountain pine foliage have shown the presence of organic compounds like diterpenes, phyllocladane and isophyllocladene and extracts of mountain pine leaves were shown to have been toxic to the codling moth, and partially toxic to the housefly. In these experiments milled leaf powders of several conifers (including the mountain pine) were incorporated into the diet of several insects and the mountain pine powder had over 75% mortality rate on the codling moths tested, and 55-75% mortality on the houseflies tested. Potentially toxic effects of mountain pine extract have also been studied in the germination of lettuce seeds. Foliage extracts from mountain pine significantly (p < 0.01) reduced germination when the extract came from both juvenile and adult pines, which did not differ from each other. Aside from germination, both juvenile and adult pines inhibited root hair growth. (Perry, 1995) hypothesized that these inhibitory effects of mountain pine might be due to allelopathic potential, since mountain pine often grow without any other vegetation below their shrubs. Further research is needed before mountain pine extract becomes of any commercial value.

It was established in end of the 17th century during the Genroku era of the Edo period. Towards the later Edo period, one of the most important educational institutions of the shogunate, the Sh≈çhei-zaka Gakumonjo (), or Sh≈çheik≈ç (), was founded on its grounds. Sh≈çheik≈ç Colonnade along the courtyard sides  Background  The Yushima Seid≈ç has its origins in a private Confucian temple, the Sensei-den (ÂÖàËÅñÊÆø), constructed in 1630 by the neo-Confucian scholar Hayashi Razan (1583‚Äì1657) in his grounds at Shinobu-ga-oka (now in Ueno Park). The fifth Tokugawa sh≈çgun, Tsunayoshi, moved the building to its present site in 1690, where it became the Taiseiden (Â§ßÊàêÊÆø) of Yushima Seid≈ç. The Hayashi school of Confucianism moved at the same time. Under the Kansei Edict, which made neo- Confucianism the official philosophy of Japan, the Hayashi school was transformed into a state-run school under the direct control of the shogunate in 1797, the most important school of this kind in the country. The school was known as the Sh≈çhei-zaka Gakumonjo (ÊòåÂπ≥ÂùÇÂ≠¶ÂïèÊâÄ) or Sh≈çheik≈ç (ÊòåÂπ≥Èªå), after the supposed birthplace area of Confucius (ÊòåÂπ≥, Sh≈çhei in Japanese). During the time of the Tokugawa shogunate, the school attracted many men of talent, but it was closed in 1871 after the Meiji Restoration. The school campus at the time covered a much larger area than the current grounds of the temple, including where the modern Tokyo Medical and Dental University stands. The rector of Shoheik≈ç was for all intents and purposes at the head of the educational system in Edo. The position was held by the head of the Hayashi clan.  Education at Sh≈çheik≈ç  The school had three kinds of students: , and attending only open lessons. The Keikonin were from the Hatamoto and Gokenin families in Edo, direct vassals of the Shogunate. A small dormitory for them was available, but its capacity was limited, and most Keikonin students would commute daily from their Edo estate. A larger dormitory was available for the Shosei resident trainees, who were coming as scholarship students from all Han fiefs of the country. Besides lessons, the Shosei students lived on campus and spent a lot of time scholarly debating among themselves, naturally creating a strong alumni network spanning all over the country, which was key during the Meiji restoration. An introduction by a Keikonin following by an interview by the teaching staff was needed to enroll the school. Courses were focusing on confucian teachings with in-depth studies from start to end of Chinese texts. Unsurprisingly, the Four books and Five classics were studied extensively. On top of lessons for the resident students and the Keikonin, there were open courses available to the common people everyday. Several kinds of examinations were performed, from the , held yearly to evaluate younger trainees and whether they could continue or not their studies, to the prestigious , held only 19 times in the whole history of the school.

The site of the school is now occupied by the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. The colour scheme of the original Taiseiden is believed to have been one of vermilion paint with verdigris. After being burnt down on a number of occasions, the Taiseiden was rebuilt in 1799 in the style of the Confucian temple in Mito, which used black paint. This building survived through the Meiji period and was designated a national historical site in 1922, but was burnt down in the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of the following year. The current Taiseiden is in reinforced concrete and was designed by It≈ç Ch≈´ta. Inside the compound is the world's largest statue of Confucius, donated in 1975 by the Lions Club of Taipei, Taiwan. There are also statues of the Four Sages, Yan Hui, Zengzi, Kong Ji, and Mencius. In the 1970s, the Taiseiden was used as the location for scenes in NTV's Monkey television series.

Location The airport is located within the administrative area of Xianyang city, which gives the airport its name. It is northwest of Xi'an city centre, and northeast of the centre of Xianyang. History Before Xianyang Airport was built, Xi'an was served by Xi'an Xiguan Airport. In 1984, the State Council of China and the Central Military Commission proposed to build a large civil airport on the site of Xianyang's airfield. Phase 1 of the airport commenced construction on August 1987, and was finished and opened on 1 September 1991. Xi'an Xiguan Airport was closed at the same time. Phase 2 started in August 2000, and was finished on 16 September 2003. Another 7.592-billion-yuan project is scheduled to be completed by 2020. Finnair's service to Helsinki was the first intercontinental route out of Xi'an, launching on 14 June 2013. It is now a seasonal route. Terminal 3 and second runway Terminal 3 and the second runway were opened on 3 May 2012, increasing the airport's capacity to more than 33 million passengers a year. The new terminal alone can handle 22 million passengers a year, twice as many as the other two terminals combined. Airlines that moved into the new terminal are China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, and Shanghai Airlines. The second runway is 3,800 meters long and is large enough to handle the Airbus A380.

Mehldau studied music at The New School, and toured and recorded while still a student. He was a member of saxophonist Joshua Redman's Quartet with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade in the mid-1990s, and has led his own trio since the early 1990s. His first long-term trio featured bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy; in 2005 Jeff Ballard replaced Rossy. These bands have released a dozen albums under the pianist's name. Since the early 2000s Mehldau has experimented with other musical formats in addition to trio and solo piano. Largo, released in 2002, contains electronics and input from rock and classical musicians; later examples include touring and recording with guitarist Pat Metheny, writing and playing song cycles for classical singers Ren√©e Fleming and Anne Sofie von Otter, composing orchestral pieces for 2009's Highway Rider, and playing electronic keyboard instruments in a duo with drummer Mark Guiliana. Aspects of pop, rock, and classical music, including German Romanticism, have been absorbed into Mehldau's writing and playing. Through his use of some traditional elements of jazz without being restricted by them, simultaneous playing of different melodies in separate hands, and incorporation of pop and rock pieces, Mehldau has influenced musicians in and beyond jazz in their approaches to writing, playing, and choice of repertoire. Early life Mehldau was born on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida.Kennedy, Gary W. \\"Mehldau, Brad\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz (2nd edition). Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online.

Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but by the age of 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson. Keith Jarrett's Bremen/Lausanne helped Mehldau realize the potential of the piano as an instrument. Mehldau attended William H. Hall High School and played in its concert jazz band.Staudter, Thomas (January 22, 2002) \\"A Jazz Pianist Comes Back for a Show in His Hometown\\". The New York Times. From the age of 15 until he graduated from high school he had a weekly gig at a local club, and performed for weddings and other parties, often with fellow Hall student Joel Frahm.

He studied under pianists Fred Hersch, Junior Mance and Kenny Werner, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. In 1989 Mehldau was part of saxophonist Christopher Hollyday's band that toured for several months; as a result of playing so often with one group, Mehldau was able to assimilate the music of Wynton Kelly and McCoy Tyner, his two principal influences on piano up to that point, and began to develop his own sound.Milkowski, Bill (December, 1998) \\"Brad Mehldau: Keyed In\\". JazzTimes. Before the age of 20 Mehldau also had gigs in Cobb's band, along with fellow student Peter Bernstein on guitar. Later life and career=1991‚Äì1998 Mehldau's first recording was for Hollyday's The Natural Moment in 1991; his first tour of Europe was also with the saxophonist that year. Mehldau's interest in classical music returned when he was in his early twenties, and spurred him into developing his left-hand playing. He led his own trio from at least 1992, when he played at New York's Village Gate.\\"Arts and Leisure Guide\\" (October 25, 1992) The New York Times. p. H39.

The Guardian. p. 45. The appreciation was not universal: some of the pianist's self-penned liner notes and interview comments, which included philosophical musings and complaints about comparisons with pianist Bill Evans, engendered dislike in some, thereby, in critic Nate Chinen's words, \\"leaving Mehldau with a lingering reputation for pretentiousness and self-indulgence.\\" Many critics did, though, reassess their judgment of his main influences, which previously had often been given as Evans,Nicholson, Stuart (September 19, 1999) \\"Some Call It Plagiarism.

When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled > back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment > right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant > being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing ‚Äì > you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together > the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time. In Stuart Nicholson's words, \\"Mehldau's art is not based on negotiating his way through a harmonic sequence with a string of bravura licks [...] Instead he patiently weaves melodic developments from motifs, fragments and inversions of the [...] songs he plays into the fabric of his extemporizations, making the tunes gradually assume the proportions of an alternative composition.\\"Nicholson, Stuart (December 2001) \\"Brad Mehldau Trio: Progression: Art of the Trio, Volume 5\\". JazzTimes. Fordham stated that \\"Mehldau demonstrates immense attention to detail, control of dynamics, and patience in developing an improvisation's shape over a longer span than the chorus-structure of a popular song.\\" Mehldau often plays a separate melody with each hand, and one of the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint.Berendt, Joachim-Ernst; Huesmann, G√ºnther (2009) The Jazz Book: From Ragtime to the 21st Century (7th edition). Chicago Review Press. p. 394. . He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to: \\"If I'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that'll find its way in. If it's McCoy Tyner, there'll be more of that.\\" Mehldau's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters; for example, he plays his arrangement of \\"All the Things You Are\\" on Art of the Trio 4 in 7/4 time, and \\"I Didn't Know What Time It Was\\" on Art of the Trio 1 in 5/4.Gioia, Ted \\"The Dozens: Twelve Essential Brad Mehldau Performances\\" . jazz.com Retrieved February 17, 2014. He developed this ability over a period of around a year, with the help of Rossy. Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano.Goldberg, Joe (August 3, 2006) \\"When Classical Meets Jazz\\". The Wall Street Journal. p. D5. Compositions Fordham described Mehldau's compositions as \\"miniature tapestries of taut lyricism and surprising turns\\". Mehldau himself indicated that some of his compositions address a specific need, such as integrating a particular rhythm into his trio, while others emerge from something he has played while improvising. In the latter case, Mehldau likened the difficulty of the composition process to that of a game of chess: \\"The opening is always easy for me, the middle gets more difficult, more of an intellectual process, more trial and error at work, and the end is always difficult for me.\\" These struggles to find satisfactory endings stem from the tension between needing to close a piece and his desire to leave a sense of open-endedness ‚Äì \\"an escape duct of possibility\\".

Influence Mehldau's trio was, in Hobart's words, \\"the first successfully to add post- Beatles pop into the jazz repertoire without trivialising either\\", and shifted the \\"traditional emphasis on bravura technique and group dynamics [...] to a focus on subtleties of touch and where-my-fancy-takes-me musings.\\" Such differences in repertoire and approach became common in small-group jazz. His combining of right- and left-hand playing, moving away from the more typical right-hand dominated playing, also influenced pianists.Kinner, Adam (June 28, 2008) \\"Not Covers, but Springboards to Expression\\". The Gazette. p. E2. Further influences on pianists are his \\"bittersweet left-hand melodies, clusters of dense mid-range chords and ability to conjoin the angularity of [Thelonious] Monk with classical romance\\".Hobart, Mike (May 23, 2017) \\"Brad Mehldau Trio, Barbican, London ‚Äì Inspirational\\".

Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: \\"He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. I told him that I should be arrested for all the stuff I've stolen from him.\\"Ouellette, Dan (January 2013) \\"Blindfold Test\\". Down Beat. p. 106.

It is a white solid that precipitated upon treatment of solutions containing Ag+ with cyanide, which is used in some schemes to recover silver from solution. Silver cyanide is used in silver-plating. Structure Its structure consist of -[Ag-CN]- chains in which the linear two-coordinate Ag+ ions are bridged by the cyanide ions, typical of silver(I) and other d10 ions . (This is the same binding mode as seen in the more famous case of Prussian blue.) These chains then pack hexagonally with adjacent chains offset by +/- 1/3 of the \\"c\\" lattice parameter.

It is commonly found throughout New Zealand and as far south as the Auckland Islands. It grows from sea level up to about , particularly alongside creeks and rivers. It is easily recognised in its native environment by the characteristic appearance of its bark, which peels spontaneously, hanging in red papery strips to show a pale bark underneath. Its scientific name, excorticata, reflects this distinctive property. Fuchsia excorticata is the largest member of the genus Fuchsia, growing to a height of . It is unusual among New Zealand trees in being deciduous in the southern parts of its range. The introduction of the common brushtail possum to New Zealand precipitated a serious decline in this species, particularly where large concentrations of the possum are present. F. excorticata appears to be one of the possum's preferred food sources, and they will browse individual trees to the point of defoliation after which the trees will die. The small dark purple berry is sweet and juicy. It was favoured by MƒÅori who, unusually, gave the fruit its own name of k≈çnini; it was also eaten by European settlers in jams and puddings. Description Fuchsia excorticata is the largest species of Fuchsia in the world. This species differs in appearances from others in New Zealand. This species is deciduous, found most commonly in tree or shrub form. It typically grows to an average height of 12 meters high. It is distinguishable by a noticeably light brown/orange bark, which is extremely thin and paper like, peeling in strips. Overall trunk diameter tends to be 60 cm with stout outreaching branches. Leaves Main description of the leaves of this species include slim petioles, the join being approximately 1-4 cm long. The leaves tend to be up to 10 cm and ranging from 1.5-3 cm wide. Leaves tend to form an oblong shape with a rounded base. Leaves of Fuchsia excorticata have a smooth epidermis with the exception of the margin and veins. The leaf margin is serrated with small teeth. Leaf colour can vary the upper side generally being dark green and the underside being paler and more silver in colour. Leaves can sometimes be suffused with red or purple colouring. Fuchsia excorticata is uncommon for its characteristic of being deciduous in southern areas of New Zealand, where the majority of its competing species are large evergreen species. Therefore, in the winter months Fuchsia excorticata is conspicuous by being found with few to no leaves. Flowers Flowers are usually bright red to purple in colour and often emerge from the main stem. Flowers are solitary and pendulous. The four showy sepals tend to be 5-16 mm long. Filaments tending to range from 7-12 mm in length and purplish in colour. The flowers of Fuchsia excorticata are gynodioecious. Berries Berries range to approximately 10 mm long, ellipsoid-oblong shaped, dark purple to almost black in colour. Distribution=Natural global range Fuchsia excorticata is endemic to New Zealand. New Zealand range Fuchsia excorticata has a range throughout the North and South Islands, as well as Stewart Island and the Auckland Islands. Habitat preferences Fuchsia excorticata is common in lowland and lower mountainous forest areas, especially on the forest margins, in clearings, and by streams. Even if a forest is close to being destroyed, or is destroyed, tree fuchsias are more than often not still standing because they are close to indestructible. This species is also abundant in cold mountain areas in the South Island. Life cycle/phenology The seeds of Fuchsia excorticata are fairly small, though are known to have persistence in the soil. It is unknown how long they are viable for, but can germinate in just two weeks if the conditions are suitable. In dark conditions, germination could take up to eight weeks. Because the seeds are so small, seedlings are fragile and may have a hard time establishing themselves. F. excorticata is a gynodioecious species, meaning it has separate hermaphrodite (male and female) and female parts . The female plants have a much harder time becoming pollinated, due to the limited number of birds (especially tui and bellbirds), which are the main pollinators of F. excorticata. This species flowers from August to December and produces berries from December to March. Soil preference Tree fuchsia can grow in riparian soil and can be utilized as a predecessor species for areas where conditions and soils are not the best. It likes moist soil with a canopy overhead for shade. Predators, parasites, and diseases Local birds such as tui, bellbirds, kerer≈´, and silvereyes feed on tree fuchsia. Tui and kerer≈´ eat the flowers and fruit; other birds consume the nectar. Tree fuchsia can, and has in some locations, been pushed out of its habitat by plant competitors such as banana passionfruit and Buddleia. Mammalian threats, such as goats, have been known to forage on tree fuchsia, but they do not have as large an effect as possums. Possums put the tree at risk because they eat the fruit and seeds, and does this without stopping when seed production is low. Cultural uses Known as k≈çtukutuku in MƒÅori, Fuchsia excorticata had many uses for the MƒÅori people and early settlers of New Zealand. These uses included eating, making jams, and use by MƒÅori woman in vapor baths after childbirth. The plant also contains tannins in the bark was used as a natural agent in leather tanning. Fuchia excorticata was also used to produce bright coloured dyes.

He was born in Lochovice in Bohemia and began his professional career as an oboist in the service of Countess Netolicka. In 1777 he moved to Munich to serve in the court orchestra of Elector Maximilian Joseph. That year in Munich, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was greatly impressed by the wind band trained by Fiala, and helped Fiala secure a position in 1778 after the death of the Elector. In 1785 Fiala moved to Vienna, and in 1786 to Saint Petersburg where he worked in the court of Catherine the Great. In 1790 he moved to Prussia where he served as a viola da gamba player in the court of Friedrich Wilhelm II. Finally in 1792 he became Kapellmeister in Donaueschingen, where he spent the rest of his life. Works Fiala wrote one concerto for viola da gamba, a concerto in B-flat maj for oboe and orchestra, various dances, chamber compositions and symphonies. A concerto for English horn (transcribed from a work originally for viola da gamba) was published in 1957 in Czechoslovakia. Ancestry During Josef Fiala's tenure in the court of Friedrich Wilhelm II, The king honored Josef by giving him his own family crest, which still exists today. The heritage of this particular Fiala family stems back to Bohemia (currently the Czech Republic), which at the time of Stefan Antoni Fiala was concurrently moved to Poland. Bohemia was a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire and subsequently a province in the Habsburgs‚Äô Austrian Empire. As Prague was the capital city of the Holy Roman Empire at that time, it is believed that one of the Habsburg members of the Royal family made a decree and named a small rural street after Josef Fiala's family name (Fialova), due to the services of Josef Fiala as Kapellmeister. This street can still be found today, outside the city of Prague. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century the balance of the family was primarily living in Poland, with future generations moving to the United Kingdom and the United States.

Following the defeat of the communist Tet offensive in January and February, in late April two Australian infantry battalions‚Äîthe 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR)‚Äîwith supporting arms, were again deployed from their base at Nui Dat in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province to positions astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict renewed movement against the capital. Part of the wider allied Operation Toan Thang I, it was launched in response to intelligence reports of another impending communist offensive, yet the Australians experienced little fighting during this period. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong successfully penetrated the capital on 5 May, plunging Saigon into chaos during the May Offensive in an attempt to influence the upcoming Paris peace talks scheduled to begin on the 13th. During three days of intense fighting the attacks were repelled by US and South Vietnamese forces, and although another attack was launched by the Viet Cong several days later, the offensive was again defeated with significant losses on both sides, causing extensive damage to Saigon and many civilian casualties. By 12 May the fighting was over, and the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were forced to withdraw having suffered heavy casualties. US casualties were also heavy and it proved to be their most costly week of the war. 1 ATF was redeployed on 12 May to obstruct the withdrawal of forces from the capital, with two battalions establishing a fire support base named FSB Coral, just east of Lai Kh√™ in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, in an area of operations known as AO Surfers. However, poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning led to delays and confusion during the fly-in, and the Australians had only partially completed FSB Coral by the evening. The North Vietnamese mounted a number of battalion-sized assaults on the night of 12/13 May, with a heavy bombardment from 03:30 signalling the start. Exploiting the disorganised defence to penetrate the Australian perimeter, the North Vietnamese 141st Regiment temporarily captured a forward gun position during close-quarters fighting, before being repulsed by superior firepower the following morning. Casualties were heavy on both sides but the Australians had won a convincing victory. The following day 1 RAR was deployed to defend FSB Coral, while 3 RAR established FSB Coogee to the west to ambush staging areas and infiltration routes. Coral was again assaulted in the early hours of 16 May, coming under a heavy barrage followed by another regimental-sized attack. Again the base was penetrated but after a six-hour battle the North Vietnamese were forced to withdraw after suffering heavy losses. Expecting further fighting, the Australians were subsequently reinforced with Centurion tanks and additional artillery. On 22 May, FSB Coral was again attacked overnight, coming under a short but accurate mortar bombardment which was broken up by Australian artillery and mortars. The Australians then moved against the communist base areas east of Route 16, with 3 RAR redeploying to establish FSB Balmoral on 24 May, to the north. Now supported by tanks which had arrived from Coral just hours before, the infantry at Balmoral were subjected to a two-battalion attack by the North Vietnese 165th Regiment. Following a rocket and mortar barrage at 03:45 on 26 May, the attack fell primarily on D Company before being repelled with heavy casualties by the combined firepower of the tanks and infantry. The next day the Australians at Coral assaulted a number of bunkers that had been located just outside the base, with a troop of Centurions supported by infantry destroying the bunkers and their occupants without loss to themselves. A second major North Vietnamese attack, again of regimental strength, was made against Balmoral at 02:30 on 28 May but was called off after 30 minutes after being soundly defeated by the supporting fire of the tanks, artillery and mortars. Regardless, the battle continued into June as the Australians patrolled their area of operations. However, with contacts decreasing, 1 ATF returned to Nui Dat on 6 June, being relieved by US and South Vietnamese forces. The battle was the first time the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army units operating in regimental strength in conventional warfare. During 26 days of fighting the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong sustained heavy losses and were forced to postpone a further attack on Saigon, while 1 ATF also suffered significant casualties. The largest unit-level action of the war for the Australians, today the battle is considered one of the most famous actions fought by the Australian Army during the Vietnam War. Background=Military situation South Vietnamese population centres and installations targeted by the Viet Cong during the 1968 Tet Offensive Based in Nui Dat in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province, the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) was part of US II Field Force, Vietnam (IIFFV), under the overall command of Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand. By early 1968, 1 ATF had been reinforced and was at full strength with three infantry battalions supported by armour, artillery, aviation and engineers, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group (1 ALSG) based at the port of V≈©ng T√†u. Commanded by Brigadier Ron Hughes, 1 ATF had continued to operate independently within Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy, and while the war had become a series of large-scale search-and-destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, the Australians had largely pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign despite the differences between Australian and American methods at times producing friction between the allies. Regardless, 1 ATF was also available for deployment elsewhere in the III Corps Tactical Zone and with the province coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians would increasingly spend a significant period of time conducting operations further afield. The Tet Offensive began on 31 January 1968, with 85,000 to 100,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops simultaneously assaulting population centres and allied installations across South Vietnam in an attempt to incite a general uprising against the South Vietnamese government and its American supporters. In response, 1 ATF was deployed along likely infiltration routes in order to defend the vital Bi√™n H√≤a‚ÄìLong Binh complex near Saigon between January and March, as part of Operation Coburg. Heavy fighting resulted in 17 Australians killed and 61 wounded, while North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties included at least 145 killed, 110 wounded and five captured, with many more removed from the battlefield. Meanwhile, the remaining Australian forces in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy were stretched thin, with elements of 3 RAR successfully repelling an assault on B√† R·ªãa and later spoiling a harassing attack on Long ƒêi·ªÅn and conducting a sweep of H·ªèa L√≤ng, killing 50 Viet Cong and wounding 25 for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded. At the strategic level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late-February the communist offensive collapsed after suffering more than 45,000 killed, against South Vietnamese and allied losses of 6,000 men. Regardless, it proved to be a turning point in the war and although it had been a tactical disaster for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory as confidence in the American military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in the United States. Prior to Tet, American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that General William Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the offensive, and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched, had shocked the American public and contradicted such predictions of imminent victory; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would no longer seek a second term in office. Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel. On the ground, the war continued without respite and Hughes‚Äîthe 1 ATF commander‚Äîturned his attention to D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion, deciding to strike at its base areas in the Minh Dam Secret Zone located in the Long H·∫£i Hills south of Long ƒêi·ªÅn and ƒê·∫•t ƒê·ªè, from Nui Dat. The 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5 RAR) had suffered heavy casualties in February 1967 while operating in the Long H·∫£is, which were heavily defended by mines and booby traps; despite previous operations by the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in June 1966 and two smaller South Vietnamese operations, the area had remained a Viet Cong safe haven. However, this time the Australians would use two battalions supported by tanks and air strikes in an attempt to reduce the base area. Operation Pinnaroo began on 27 February, with 2 RAR and 3 RAR cordoning off the complex with the rifle companies patrolling and ambushing at night in order to prevent the Viet Cong from escaping. On 8 March the Australians conducted a wide encircling movement to tighten the cordon, while a sustained bombardment by US B-52 heavy bombers and artillery targeted the hill the next day. A combined force of infantry from 3 RAR supported by armour then advanced on the foothills, before clearing the minefields and destroying an extensive base area which included a deep cave system that had first been used by the Vi·ªát Minh against the French in the 1950s. Each Australian rifle company then methodically searched its area of operations, while engineers destroyed the underground facilities; a task which required the use of tonnes of explosives. alt=Soldiers wearing flak jackets and helmets are prone on an open field at the base of a large vegetated hill The operation lasted until 15 April, with mines‚Äîincluding many M16s that had been lifted by the Viet Cong from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians at ƒê·∫•t ƒê·ªè‚Äîonce again claiming a significant toll. Ten Australians were killed and another 36 were wounded, while known Viet Cong casualties included 21 killed, 14 wounded and 40 captured. Fifty-seven camps and bunker systems were also destroyed, as were large quantities of weapons, munitions and supplies. Judged a success by the Australians despite their heavy losses, the operation had resulted in significant disruption to the Viet Cong and hindered their operations for some time. Regardless, with 1 ATF lacking the manpower to hold the area, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to permanently occupy the Long Hais meant that any gains were only fleeting, and the D445 Battalion headquarters soon returned to the area after ejecting a South Vietnamese regional force company a few months later. Meanwhile, 7 RAR had finished its last operation in March and was relieved by 1 RAR on 9 April, returning to Australia having completed its twelve-month tour. Prelude=Planning and preliminary operations alt=A number of Asian civilians standing amid ruined buildings and rubble. Despite their losses during the previous fighting, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong appeared to have gained the initiative. Indeed, although the Tet offensive had devastated the Viet Cong, costing them about half their strength in the south, the Defense Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam‚ÄîGeneral V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p‚Äîhad moved quickly to replace these losses with reinforcements, and by early May 15,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were serving in Viet Cong units in South Vietnam. On 8 April, Westmoreland launched a series of large-scale sweeps involving over 70,000 South Vietnamese, American, Australian, New Zealand and Thai troops, code-named Operation Toan Thang I. Meanwhile, on 5 May the Viet Cong launched attacks against 119 provincial and district capitals, military installations and major cities during the May Offensive in an attempt to gain an advantage at the first session of peace negotiations scheduled to begin in Paris on the 13th. Saigon was successfully infiltrated in an event that received widespread international media coverage and resulted in considerable embarrassment for the Americans and their allies, with as many as five of the 13 attacking Viet Cong battalions penetrating the city's outer defences, plunging the capital into chaos and resulting in heavy civilian casualties. After three days of intense fighting American and South Vietnamese forces successfully repelled the assault while, as the peace talks neared, a fresh wave of attacks was launched on Saigon several days later. However, by 12 May the fighting was over, and the communists were forced to withdraw having suffered more than 5,500 dead in just over one week of fighting. US casualties were also heavy, amounting to 652 killed and 2,225 wounded, which made it the most costly week of the war for the Americans. The Australians were initially employed on operations inside Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province during Operation Toan Thang I. Viet Cong activity in their traditional base areas in the Hat Dich north of Nui Thi Vai hills, had been increasing in February and March and 3 RAR subsequently commenced operations along the north-western border of Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province on 21 April. These operations resulted in little contact. In light of this, the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam‚ÄîMajor General Arthur MacDonald‚Äîbelieved that the task force would be better employed against North Vietnamese conventional forces, rather than in local pacification operations; later, following a request from Weyand, 1 ATF would again redeploy outside the province. As such, in an operation similar to those three months earlier at Bi√™n H√≤a, it was planned that 1 ATF would be used to help block infiltration towards Saigon. Overall responsibility for the defence of the capital was assigned to US IIFFV, and included the US 1st, 9th, and 25th Division, as well as the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade, 1 ATF, and a number of South Vietnamese units. The main deployment began on 25 April in response to intelligence reports of another impending offensive, with 1 ATF headquarters established at the US Bearcat Base, while 2 RAR and 3 RAR deployed to the Bi√™n H√≤a‚ÄìLong Kh√°nh border to block likely infiltration routes east of the large American base complex at Long Binh, which included Bi√™n H√≤a Air Base and the large Long Binh Logistics Depot. Meanwhile, the task force base at Nui Dat was defended by one infantry battalion, a squadron of tanks and the remainder of the cavalry. The SAS squadron also remained in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy during this period, continuing reconnaissance and surveillance operations in the province. 2 RAR was tasked with patrolling and ambushing tracks and likely rocket-launching sites to disrupt the expected attack against Saigon. The battalion established FSB Hunt, and conducted a number of small but successful ambushes. Meanwhile, 3 RAR established FSB Evans and conducted search-and-ambush operations before returning to Nui Dat on 3 May after being replaced by 1 RAR, which then joined 2 RAR for a sweep. In response to the attacks on Saigon, elements of 1 ATF redeployed on 5 May, relieving the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade in an area of operations (AO) known as AO Columbus so that it could be released for operations elsewhere, with companies from both battalions deploying to ambush suspected infiltration routes in the expectation of an attack by the 274th Regiment from the Viet Cong 5th Division. Five days later 2 RAR was relieved by 3 RAR, having completed its last major operation before returning to Australia. The Australians waited for the Viet Cong to make their move, but they again proved elusive and contact was only light, and by 10 May just six had been killed and one wounded after 21 days of operations. Having missed the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese units as they infiltrated the capital, it was planned that the Australians would be again redeployed on 12 May in order to obstruct the withdrawal of these forces following their defeat in Saigon. The task force would subsequently concentrate astride Route 16 on one of the major north-south supply routes north-east of Saigon, just east of Lai Khe in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, in a new area of operations known as AO Surfers. Meanwhile, US forces would operate in support on the flanks. Opposing forces 1 ATF would move with its headquarters and two infantry battalions‚Äî1 RAR and 3 RAR‚Äîas well as cavalry, artillery, engineer, and aviation elements operating in support, including M113 armoured personnel carriers from A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, 105 mm M2A2 howitzers from 12th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, Bell H-13 Sioux light observation helicopters from 161st Reconnaissance Flight and mortar locating radars from 131st Divisional Locating Battery. The concept of operations called for the establishment battalion AOs, named Bondi, Manly and Newport. 1 RAR was allocated to AO Bondi with artillery support from the 102nd Field Battery established at a fire support base, named FSB Coral. 3 RAR was initially allocated to AO Manly, west of Bondi, and would also be supported from FSB Coral by its own supporting battery, 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery. The operation would be conducted in three phases. 3 RAR‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jim Shelton‚Äîwould conduct an air assault into Coral early on 12 May, with the lead elements securing the landing zone for the fly-in of the remainder of the battalion, and 1 RAR under Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Bennett. Leaving its supporting artillery and one infantry company for protection, 3 RAR would then move west to establish blocking positions and patrol AO Manly in order to intercept North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces attempting to withdraw from the south and south-west. Meanwhile, 1 RAR would establish its supporting artillery and mortars at FSB Coral, and then with one company, clear Route 16 to the village of Tan Uyen, to the south. The battalion would then occupy blocking positions and patrol AO Bondi. 1 ATF headquarters would then move from Bearcat to FSB Coral on 13 May, while the forward task force maintenance area would move from Bearcat by road convoy and be operational by 14 May. alt=A large number of well equipped Asian soldiers sitting in rows on the ground, wearing pith helmets and holding assault rifles. A number of People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units had been identified in AO Surfers, including the regular North Vietnamese 7th Division‚Äîconsisting of the North Vietnamese 141st and 165th Regiments under the command of Nguyen the Bon, the Viet Cong 5th Division‚Äîconsisting of Viet Cong 274th and 275th Regiments, and the ƒê·ªìng Nai Regiment. These divisions were believed to have participated in the assault on Saigon and allied intelligence considered it likely they would attempt to withdraw through the Australian area of operations in order to regroup. Other forces included North Vietnamese 85th Regiment as well as the 165th, 233rd, 269th, 275th, D280 and 745th Viet Cong Infiltration Groups and various units used for reconnaissance, guiding, logistics, liaison and other tasks. In total, an estimated strength of 3,000 to 4,000 men. Regardless, despite earlier warnings that they may concentrate up to regimental-strength, a breakdown in the passage of intelligence led the Australians to believe that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would remain dispersed in small groups in an attempt to avoid detection. As such the Australians assumed that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would pose little threat and envisioned patrolling from company harbours to find and ambush them as they withdrew. Meanwhile, due to the risk of heavy ground fire, only a very limited aerial reconnaissance of the new area of operations was undertaken and this later had significant implications. Battle=Occupation of FSB Coral, 12 May 1968 On the night of 11/12 May, only a few hours before the Australian redeployment was scheduled to commence, forces from US 1st Division operating in AO Surfers were attacked just west of the proposed landing zone (LZ). Continuing through the night and into the following morning, the fighting prevented the Americans from leaving the area and led to initial delays in occupying FSB Coral. Further delays arose after the terrain around the proposed LZ was found to be unsuitable for helicopters, and Shelton was forced to designate a new location to the south-west for his battalion. Meanwhile, the American company providing security for the lead Australian elements had to redeploy to secure the new LZ. Communications were problematic throughout the operation and this further compounded the delays. The first infantry company to fly in‚ÄîB Company, 3 RAR under the command of Major Bert Irwin‚Äîwas already airborne and Shelton directed them to the new LZ. On landing, Irwin moved quickly to the original position, and despite rapidly clearing it, the insertion was further delayed. alt=Colour image of a large two-rotored helicopter flying past a line of trees and preparing to land in an open area cleared of vegetation. In the foreground are a large number of tents, hootchies and ground sheets, while a number of soldiers are standing around an artillery piece. Purple smoke is rising from the position. 1 ATF was not well practised in flying in and setting up a large fire support base, and a poorly co-ordinated, prolonged and dislocated operation caused considerable delay in getting on the ground, and the scattering of a number of units. Confusion continued to affect the operation, with 161st Battery, RNZA arriving by CH-47 Chinook before FSB Coral was ready, and being forced to land in an improvised LZ in a clearing to the south-west. Meanwhile, the continued presence of American forces in AO Manly also prevented 3 RAR from deploying as planned, and as the battalion began landing it was forced to remain on the western side of the FSB. 102nd Field Battery, the direct support battery for 1 RAR, was subsequently landed at FSB Coral and Major Brian Murtagh, second-in-command of 12th Field Regiment and the artillery tactical headquarters, was subsequently designated as the FSB commander, even though his guns were now physically dislocated from each other. These delays in turn affected the fly-in of 1 RAR, with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO Columbus before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral. Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15:30 to discuss aspects of the defence, as well as events planned for the following day. The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16:10, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight, more than four hours late. It became clear to Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy to the east of the FSB, and with just two hours before last light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions, the last of which were not established until 17:00. Due to the hurried deployment, by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their supporting elements were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups, rather than in a co-ordinated defensive position. The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally, yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly‚ÄîCommanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment‚Äîboth remained in Bearcat. Hughes was not present either, having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat, and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day. There had been little opportunity for co-ordination, with the Australian infantry strung out along the routes away from FSB Coral in preparation for their move the next day. 3 RAR was responsible for the security of FSB Coral, with D Company defending the north-west approaches, while the remaining three companies were dispersed over to the west, spread between the FSB and the 161st Battery, RNZA gun positions to the south-west. 1 RAR occupied the eastern approaches, with its rifle companies dispersed over harbouring in night ambush positions, while C Company was isolated to the south-east picketing the road to Tan Uyen in order to provide security for the convoy due to arrive from Bearcat the following day. Bennett kept his anti-tank and assault pioneer platoons inside the FSB to protect the battalion command post, while the mortar platoon would be particularly exposed, being located adjacent to the 102nd Field Battery gun position in an open area on the outer edge of the base facing to the north and east. The rifle companies to the north-east provided the only protection, yet there were large gaps between these positions and they could be easily bypassed. Although the Australians made further efforts to co-ordinate their defences prior to last light, attempting to tie in their positions to achieve mutual support between the sub-units, these arrangements remained incomplete as night fell. alt=Aerial photo of a large open area bordered by thick vegetation. A road runs from top to bottom through the middle of the position while a range of field defences, earthworks and armoured vehicles are evident. Smoke is rising from the position. Command posts were dug in and weapons pits and shell scrapes were commenced, yet many were not completed to any depth due to a lack of time, while a heavy rainfall started at 18:00 and soon filled the pits with water anyway. No claymore mines or barbed wire were laid out either, as the wire had not yet arrived, while lack of materials also prevented the construction of overhead protection. 7.62 mm M60 machine-guns were placed out around the perimeter, but there was no time to test fire them or to properly tie in their arcs of fire. Meanwhile, 90 mm M67 recoilless rifles (RCLs) from the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon armed with High Explosive Anti-tank (HEAT) and anti-personnel flechette ammunition were sited to support the forward machine- guns. Due to their previous experiences fighting the Viet Cong in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province, the Australians were not overly alarmed despite the defences at FSB Coral suffering due to the hasty deployment and, although the recent fighting involving the US 1st Division only to the west may have been additional cause for concern, its extent was unknown to the Australians at the time. Expecting the North Vietnamese to be operating in small groups while trying to avoid battle as they had done during the last three weeks, there was little thought of a major threat to the FSB. Commencing night routine, sentries were posted while the rest of the Australians stood down to get some sleep. First attack on FSB Coral, 12/13 May 1968 alt=Map of the area of operations detailing locations referred to in the text. Unknown to 1 ATF, the headquarters of the North Vietnamese 7th Division was located approximately to the east of FSB Coral and several units of the division were also based in the vicinity. The North Vietnamese 165th Regiment was operating to the north and the 141st Regiment to the east, while the battalion-strength 275th Infiltration Group had only recently arrived, having left the Ho Chi Minh Trail on the Cambodian border just 48 hours earlier. The North Vietnamese divisional commander had quickly dispatched reconnaissance elements to observe the fly-in of the Australians and their defensive preparations during the afternoon, and they soon reported the opportunity to attack the exposed gun positions of the 102nd Field Battery. One battalion of 141st Regiment, augmented by the 275th and 269th Infiltration Groups, was subsequently tasked to attack FSB Coral that night. This reconnaissance had not gone unnoticed by the Australian infantry, however, and companies from both 1 RAR and 3 RAR had fleeting contacts with small groups of North Vietnamese at last light and into the evening. D Company, 1 RAR‚Äîunder Major Tony Hammett‚Äîcontacted a ten-man group of North Vietnamese while moving into ambush positions north of FSB Coral late in the afternoon. In a brief exchange the North Vietnamese broke contact after losing one killed, firing rocket-propelled grenades into the trees above the Australians and wounding one of them. During the evening B Company, 1 RAR‚Äîunder the command of Major Bob Hennessy‚Äîhad a further contact to the east with another ten-man group. Later, Major Colin Adamson's A Company detected 20 North Vietnamese moving on the perimeter utilising newly issued Starlight scopes and subsequently killed and wounded some of them. However, such events appeared to be chance encounters and caused the Australians no particular concern. By midnight the rain had stopped, and five minutes later the 1 RAR mortar position was probed and a fire-fight ensued, resulting in possibly three North Vietnamese being killed. Later it became apparent that they had been marking assault lanes, while at 02:25 three North Vietnamese from a forward reconnaissance party walked into a D Company, 1 RAR ambush and in the ensuing contact one was killed before they again broke contact, firing rocket-propelled grenades that killed one Australian and wounded 11 from a single platoon. Yet despite a number of minor clashes the North Vietnamese successfully bypassed the Australian rifle companies, conducting a forced march under cover of darkness and rain to dig in within of FSB Coral undetected. Finally at 03:30, rocket and mortar fire began falling on FSB Coral, concentrating on the 102nd Field Battery and the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon positions in an intense bombardment lasting five minutes. Following a ten- minute pause a number of flares signalled the start of the assault. Intending to capture the field guns, two North Vietnamese companies rushed the Australians from the north-east firing their AK-47 assault rifles, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon taking the brunt of the initial attack, while the 1 ATF Defence Platoon was also pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire. The New Zealand howitzers and 3 RAR mortars began firing in support, however they failed to halt the North Vietnamese and the initial assault succeeded in over- running the 1 RAR mortars, killing five and wounding eight. The flank of the main assault force then ran through the position at speed before moving on towards the gun position. During their earlier reconnaissance, the North Vietnamese had likely observed the guns to be laid facing east and had probably planned to assault from the north as a result, yet shortly before the main attack the battery had fired a mission to the north and the guns were now directly facing their axis of assault. Moving in long straight lines across a frontage of 150 to 200 men, the main North Vietnamese assault moved against the gun position as the Australian gunners opened fire over open sights with flechette rounds at point blank range, with thousands of darts ripping through their ranks and breaking up successive waves into small groups. Amid the confusion, follow-up sections hesitated upon reaching the mortar position, while other groups skirmished around the flanks and between the artillery and mortars. Meanwhile, the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon‚Äîcommanded by Lieutenant Les Tranter‚Äîalso engaged with Splintex from their 90 mm RCLs, firing across the front of the mortars and relieving the immediate pressure on them. However, with the North Vietnamese having successfully achieved a break-in, and faced with the possibility of imminent annihilation, the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon second-in-command‚ÄîLieutenant Tony Jensen‚Äîwas forced to direct the RCLs onto his own position, to which Bennett agreed. As the North Vietnamese attempted to turn the captured mortars against the Australians, the flechette darts swept the area, clearing everything above ground, causing heavy casualties among the assaulting force and damaging a number of mortar tubes. Elsewhere, the North Vietnamese assault had reached the Australian gun position, over- running two guns as desperate close quarters fighting broke out between the emplacements. The attackers subsequently succeeded in capturing No. 6 gun on the extreme edge of the gun-line and then attempted to destroy it with satchel charges. In both the mortar and artillery positions the North Vietnamese and Australians occupied adjacent pits, fighting each other at close range for their possession. The gun position officer‚ÄîCaptain Ian Ahearn‚Äîco-ordinated the defence, and the Australians finally drove off the assault with grenades and small arms, as well as Splintex rounds fired from the Anti-Tank Platoon. Meanwhile, with the assault falling mainly on 1 RAR and 102nd Field Battery, to the west 3 RAR had largely remained out of contact. Although the North Vietnamese troops were well trained and equipped, they were ultimately unable to prevail against the superior firepower of the Australian infantry and gunners, which had turned the battle in their favour. Throughout the night, fire support was co-ordinated by the 1 RAR command post and the fire support co-ordinating centre, which controlled integral fires from 102nd Field Battery, its direct support battery, as well as from 161st Battery RNZA and the 81 mm mortars from 3 RAR. Yet the Australian gunners soon ran out of Splintex rounds, and they were forced to use standard high-explosive with their direct-action fuses set to 'delay'. The guns were then depressed to fire the shell at the ground approximately in front of the emplacement, which caused the round to ricochet and explode in the air above the heads of the assaulting force, an expedient which proved very effective. The Australians were also supported by artillery from a number of neighbouring American batteries that were in range, as well as by aerial strafing from helicopter gunships and continuous illumination by flares. Forward observers adjusted the artillery to within of the Australian position, while AC-47 Spooky gunships fired thousands of rounds into the assaulting forces. After an hour of intense fighting, by 04:30 the main attack began to falter and the North Vietnamese subsequently withdrew into a rubber plantation to the north-east, carrying many of their dead and wounded. However, in an attempt prevent the Australians from following them a company-sized force remained, and the Australian gunners attempted to engage them with their remaining Splintex rounds and high explosive. Taking advantage of the extinguishing of a fire that the Australians had been using to direct the helicopter gunships, the North Vietnamese again attacked at 05:00 in an effort to further cover their withdrawal. Greatly reduced in strength, the attack was quickly broken up in a crossfire of high explosive and Splintex. A series of sporadic contacts then took place between the Australians and withdrawing North Vietnamese parties, while at 05:30 a helicopter light-fire team became effective and forced the North Vietnamese rearguard to abandon its positions. Also during this time, rockets and mortars had landed on B Company, 1 RAR to the south-east, killing one Australian and wounding another. At 05:45, 161st Battery RNZA began firing on likely withdrawal routes as the pre-dawn light began to appear. The Australians then began a sweep of their position, with the 102nd Field Battery clearing the gun position while Bennett accompanied the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon and a regimental medical officer's party to clear the rest of the perimeter. A number of North Vietnamese soldiers were subsequently located, with the last killed in the gun position at 06:10. The two patrols then met in the mortar position while a patrol from 3 RAR carried out a similar sweep from north to south, and FSB Coral was finally cleared by 06:25. By 06:30 the evacuation of the Australian dead and wounded began by helicopter. The North Vietnamese finally completed their withdrawal by 08:00. alt=A damaged artillery piece sits in the foreground while a number of rifles resting against it. In the background a number of Caucasian soldiers stand in the background next to a hootchie. The fighting had been costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew- served weapons had also been captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was little doubt that the Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly- in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid in the direction of the main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified. 1 ATF consolidates in AO Surfers, 13‚Äì15 May 1968 The 1 ATF forward tactical headquarters arrived from Bearcat by CH-47 on 13 May, while additional personnel and stocks were brought in by road convoy to establish the forward task force maintenance area. Hughes arrived at 08:00 and directed Bennett to redeploy his companies in all-round defence of FSB Coral, with 1 RAR consolidating their defensive arrangements with wire, sandbags, overhead protection and claymore mines, while tripod-mounted machine-guns were also emplaced to fire on fixed lines. Meanwhile, 3 RAR established FSB Coogee in AO Manly west, with C Company securing the fire support base while the other three rifle companies conducted search operations which resulted in one being Australian killed. 161st Battery RNZA was then redeployed by air to Coogee. M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) from A Squadron, 3 CAV (less one troop)‚Äîunder the command of Major John Keldie‚Äîarrived at Coral the same day, after escorting the rear echelons and 155 mm M109 self-propelled artillery from A Battery, US 2/35th Artillery Regiment. The M113s were then split between the fire support bases, with 1 Troop assigned to 1 RAR and 2 Troop to 3 RAR, with Keldie appointed as local defence commander at FSB Coral in order to co-ordinate the actions of units on the perimeter. 1st Field Squadron also provided engineer teams to each combat arm, while other elements prepared command post bunkers and fortifications within the fire support bases. alt=A soldier searches a number of dead bodies which lay strewn amidst the grass. The unsuccessful assault against FSB Coral on the night of 12/13 May had demonstrated that the North Vietnamese would react violently to Australian attempts to control AO Surfers, and with 1 ATF deployed astride a key route to Saigon and threatening a number of communist bases and staging areas located nearby, further heavy fighting was expected over the following days. In response, the Australians were forced to refine their tactics and Hughes decided to establish strong defensive positions in order to destroy the North Vietnamese by fire, rather than by the painstaking patrolling more familiar to the Australians. The FSBs would be heavily defended by night, while the battalions would conduct defensive patrols by day. Later, fighting patrols up to company-size with armoured support would then be used to locate and destroy the Viet Cong main force bases. As such the Australian concept of operations subsequently evolved from one of searching and clearing in order to locate and cut infiltration and withdrawal routes, into a series of reconnaissance-in- force operations from heavily defended bases. Meanwhile, in AO Manly, 3 RAR continued patrolling for the next seven days, successfully ambushing staging areas and infiltration routes between 13‚Äì19 May for the loss of one soldier killed. On 14 May there were a number of patrol clashes in AO Bondi, as both sides tried to determine the intentions of the other. The Australians sent out platoon-sized defensive patrols between from Coral and in nine contacts they suffered three killed and five wounded, while North Vietnamese casualties included 12 killed and two wounded. Later, two more Australians were wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fired into FSB Coral. During the afternoon, the patrol activity resulted in heavy fighting, and two separate actions fought within half an hour of each other by different platoons from 1 RAR led to two Australians being awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM)‚ÄîLance Corporal David Griffiths and Private Richard Norden. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong appeared to be probing the Australians to gain information on their dispositions and these efforts continued the following day with the defenders observing two North Vietnamese near the perimeter of FSB Coral, while patrols from 1 RAR later contacted a number of small groups and uncovered a recently used company-sized camp just from the base. By 15 May, the Australians considered their defences to be properly co-ordinated, while nearby the North Vietnamese 141st Regiment was again preparing to attack Coral after evading the intensive patrolling. Yet that night a large number of lights and flares were observed by the defenders, effectively warning them of the impending assault. Second attack on FSB Coral, 16 May 1968 At 02:30 on 16 May the North Vietnamese began a heavy barrage of rocket-propelled grenades and mortar fire, concentrating on A Company 1 RAR, 1 ATF headquarters, and the forward task force maintenance area. Now heavily reinforced, the Australian and American artillery and mortars quickly responded with heavy counter-battery fire, with a total of 60 guns from three batteries of 105 mm field guns, one battery of 155 mm howitzers, one battery and nine 81 mm mortars firing in support, augmented by air support from three heavy fire teams (each of three UH-1 helicopter gunships) and three fighter- bombers with bombs and napalm. Regardless, at 02:40 the North Vietnamese launched a battalion-sized attack, which initially fell on A and B Companies. Even with the artillery and mortars concentrating on close defensive fire tasks, the assault was largely held at the perimeter, although they did succeed in over-running part of 3 Platoon, A Company. Commanded by Lieutenant Neil Weekes, the platoon had been hit heavily by indirect fire during the initial bombardment and had suffered several casualties. Concentrating on the gap created in the Australian perimeter, the North Vietnamese then assaulted with the support of 12.7 mm DShK heavy machine-guns. Ordering his men to fix bayonets, Weekes successfully reorganised the defences however, and called in close mortar fire to stabilise the position, resulting in heavy casualties among the assaulting force. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership. Unable to achieve a break-in, the North Vietnamese then broadened their attack to include C Company, engaging three of the four Australian companies on the perimeter. Yet after successfully opening a number of gaps in the wire, they failed to press home their attack. By 04:00 A Company was still heavily engaged and the Australians called in helicopter light-fire teams and AC-47 Spooky gunships, which dropped flares continuously from 04:30 to illuminate the battlefield. By 05:00 the main attack was halted and the North Vietnamese began withdrawing, just as the Australians were beginning to run low on ammunition. During the lull A Company was resupplied by APC, while the Australians pushed an RCL team forward to provide additional support. At 05:15 the North Vietnamese attacked again, targeting the boundary between A and C Companies on the northern edge of the perimeter, only to be repulsed by mortar fire. Later a two-battalion attack on A, B and C Companies was also turned back. The Australians then counter-attacked with elements of A Company supported by APCs, regaining the lost 3 Platoon section post. Finally, after a six-hour battle the North Vietnamese broke contact at 06:30 and withdrew with their dead and wounded, fighting a series of rearguard actions to prevent follow-up. The Australians also began collecting their casualties for evacuation, while another resupply was completed with APCs. 1 RAR subsequently commenced a clearance of the area, with the four Australian rifle companies patrolling to a depth of , killing one North Vietnamese soldier and capturing another. Five Australians had been killed and 19 wounded, while two US artillerymen were also wounded during the fighting. Only 34 North Vietnamese bodies were counted on the perimeter at dawn, however intelligence later indicated that fewer than 100 of the 790 attacking troops had survived unwounded. Meanwhile, in an attempt to disrupt the North Vietnamese withdrawal, Keldie led a troop of cavalry from Coral, engaging a North Vietnamese battalion during a pursuit that lasted until 15:00. alt=Four main battle tanks on a road kick up dust as they move towards a defensive position. On 17 May, General Westmoreland visited FSB Coral and congratulated the task force on its defence. Both Australian battalions continued to patrol with minor contacts, and during one such incident at least six North Vietnamese were killed when a group of approximately 35 was engaged by artillery and armed helicopters after being observed by scouts from B Company, 3 RAR. During the week that followed Australian patrols clashed with groups of North Vietnamese moving through AO Surfers, many of them from the North Vietnamese 165th Regiment, which was believed to be withdrawing into War Zone D after attacking Tan Son Nhut Air Base, near Saigon. A Company, 3 RAR subsequently occupied a blocking position on the Suoi Ba Pho creek, ambushing North Vietnamese moving northwards and directing mortar firing onto evasion routes, killing eight and capturing two. Elsewhere, C Company, 3 RAR located and destroyed a number of base camps in the vicinity of FSB Coogee. Meanwhile, with the approval of MacDonald, Hughes departed on a long-planned leave to Singapore on 18 May, and Colonel Donald Dunstan, the task force second-in- command, took over as Commander 1 ATF on 20 May. A respected and experienced leader, he quickly took control amidst growing tension. At 01:00 on 22 May FSB Coral was again attacked, though not on the same scale as before, coming under a short but accurate mortar bombardment that was subsequently broken up artillery and mortar fire. In order to bolster his defences and provide an increased offensive capability, on 21 May Dunstan ordered the Centurion tanks from C Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment to redeploy the from Nui Dat. Under the command of Major Peter Badman, the slow-moving armoured column departed on 22 May, traversing the difficult terrain that included a number of old, rusting Bailey bridges, which threatened to collapse under the 50-tonne weight of the Centurions. Moving via the inland route under cover provided by an observation aircraft from 161st Reconnaissance Flight, they drove north on Route 2, then west on Highway 1 to Long Binh where they staged overnight. Just north of Blackhorse Base Camp the lead vehicle of the convoy hit a road mine, damaging a dozer tank but resulting in no casualties. They finally arrived at FSB Coral at 02:30 on 23 May. Four tanks from 1 Troop were subsequently allocated to 1 RAR, while 2 Troop was allocated to 3 RAR. Two American M42 40 mm Self- Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns had also accompanied the tanks and further strengthened the Australian FSBs in a ground support role. First attack on FSB Balmoral, 26 May 1968 alt=Two soldiers manning a machine-gun in a heavily sandbagged pit observe the perimeter of their defensive position through the vegetation With 3 RAR achieving limited results in AO Manly, MacDonald suggested that Dunstan establish the battalion in a new location east of Route 16 in order to locate and destroy the North Vietnamese bases suspected to be in the area. 3 RAR subsequently occupied FSB Balmoral in AO Newport, north of Coral, on 24 May in the hope of provoking another battle. Shelton was keen to avoid the mistakes that had been made during the earlier occupation of FSB Coral however, and he sent two companies forward on foot to occupy the new fire support base while the battalion tactical headquarters accompanied them in APCs. During the insertion there were a number of contacts between the Australians and North Vietnamese, with at least one North Vietnamese soldier being killed. Yet with B and D Companies securing the landing zone, the remainder of 3 RAR was inserted by helicopter from FSB Coogee in the late afternoon. FSB Balmoral would be developed as a battalion defensive position only, and 161st Battery RNZA was subsequently flown to FSB Coral, in order to concentrate all of the artillery in that location from where they would be able to cover the whole of the new AO. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese had been caught by surprise and, with no time prepare an attack, they were unable to respond on the first evening. Regardless, 3 RAR worked quickly to establish their defensive position, digging in and laying wire and claymore mines. On 25 May, 3 RAR began local defensive and familiarisation patrols. Four Centurion tanks from 2 Troop, C Squadron were ordered to redeploy to FSB Balmoral to bolster the defences, escorted by two infantry platoons from B Company, 1 RAR under Captain Bob Hennessy. En route, the North Vietnamese engaged the Australian infantry from a series of bunkers, pinning them down with machine-gun fire at close range. In response the Australian tanks moved forward, suppressing the bunkers with canister rounds while the infantry was extracted. The Australians had struck the edge of a large, defended base camp estimated at company-size, however under orders to continue to Balmoral before nightfall, they broke contact. The column subsequently arrived at FSB Balmoral without further incident at 15:30 and B Company, 1 RAR then returned to FSB Coral by helicopter. At least two North Vietnamese were killed in the encounter, while one Australian was wounded. Although a relatively minor action, the tanks had been decisive and the engagement was early proof of their effectiveness in co-operation with the infantry. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese commander was no longer able to tolerate the Australian encroachment into his base areas, and with FSB Balmoral located just away, he subsequently tasked the 165th Regiment, commanded by Phan Viet Dong, to attack Balmoral. That evening tracer rounds, shots and lights again alerted the defenders of an impending attack. At 03:45 on 26 May the North Vietnamese began a heavy bombardment with mortar and rockets, accompanied by machine-gun and small-arms fire. Immediately following the barrage, Balmoral was subjected to a ground assault across the open ground from the north-east by a force of up to battalion strength, falling primarily on D Company, commanded by Major Peter Phillips. At the same time the North Vietnamese conducted a feint on the southern perimeter opposite A Company‚Äîunder Major Horrie Howard‚Äîusing Bangalore torpedoes to break through the wire, although the gap was not exploited. Two Centurions that had been sited directly on the main axis of assault but concealed during the day, rolled forward under the cover of darkness. Their machine-guns and canister rounds proved telling during the fighting; the main attack stalled as it reached the wire before being repelled with heavy casualties by the combined firepower of the Australian infantry and tanks. Meanwhile, as sporadic mortar, RPG and small-arms fire continued, to the south FSB Coral was also hit with suppressing fire from mortars, recoilless rifles and RPGs between 04:15 and 04:30, killing one Australian and wounding another. The defenders at Balmoral then directed fire from helicopter and AC-47 Spooky gunships onto likely assembly areas and mortar base plate locations. Around 05:00 the North Vietnamese finally broke contact and withdrew, removing the majority of their casualties under covering fire as the Australian artillery fired on their escape routes. Clearing patrols from 3 RAR then swept the area at first light but found only six North Vietnamese dead and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and equipment. The Australians subsequently began the evacuation of their casualties, having lost a further three dead and 14 wounded. Bunker clash and patrolling in AO Surfers, 26‚Äì27 May 1968 alt=A two engined jet aircraft in mid-flight, a single bomb is evident on an underwing pylon. Dunstan subsequently directed the clearance of the bunker system that had been located the previous day, and a combined force of D Company, 1 RAR and 1 Troop C Squadron under the command of Major Tony Hammett was tasked with carrying out a reconnaissance-in-force. Departing at 06:00 on the morning of the 26 May, at 12:27 the lead Australian infantry platoon was hit by small arms fire and RPGs from Coral, after having paused to direct an air strike by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF onto a nearby bunker system. In what would become the first Australian combined infantry and tank assault since the Bougainville campaign against the Japanese in the Second World War, the tanks were called forward and attacked the bunkers with anti-tank solid shot and machine-guns, while the infantry indicated targets with their M79 grenade launchers. Moving forward two or three abreast, the Centurions crushed many of the bunkers with their tracks and engaged others at point-blank range with their main armament. Further bunkers were exposed when the foliage was cut away by canister rounds and the infantry followed the tanks using rifles and grenades, while assault pioneers provided support with a flame-thrower as artillery and mortar fire engaged targets further away. The bunkers were well constructed and camouflaged, while visibility was limited to just among the dense vegetation and consequently many were not located by the Australians until they were upon them. The bunkers were sited to be mutually supporting, and the North Vietnamese defending them responded with a crossfire of RPG-2s, although the heavy armour of the Centurions proved impervious and they remained undamaged. During a three-hour battle the Australians and North Vietnamese fought each other from bunker to bunker. However, with aerial reconnaissance revealing that the bunker system was part of a much larger base area, and with the Australian force judged too small to deal with it, Bennett directed Hammett to retire by late afternoon. Amidst a heavy rain the Australians broke contact at 16:00 under the cover of artillery and mortar fire, and they moved quickly back to FSB Coral. Fourteen bunkers had been destroyed, while seven North Vietnamese bodies were counted and quantities of weapons, ammunition and documents were also captured. Yet many more men were undoubtedly entombed in the bunkers after being crushed by the tanks, making a comprehensive body count impossible. Although it had been a fierce engagement the Australians suffered no casualties, a fact which was attributed to the effectiveness of the tanks, and further validated Dunstan's decision to call them forward from Nui Dat. Second Lieutenant John Salter was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during this and other actions. Over the following days 1 ATF continued patrolling, although these operations resulted in only small-scale contact with the North Vietnamese. On 27 May an Australian OH-13 helicopter was damaged by ground fire during a reconnaissance flight outside AO Newport, and air strikes on the area exposed several bunkers which were likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as a headquarters; they were subsequently destroyed by artillery fire. Second attack on FSB Balmoral, 28 May 1968 alt=A number of Asian men wearing blindfolds are standing while a number of caucasian soldiers stand behind them. A second regimental-sized attack against 3 RAR at Balmoral was launched by the North Vietnamese at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60 mm and 80 mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the North Vietnamese sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the North Vietnamese on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and AC-47 Spooky gunships engaged the North Vietnamese, directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30. At first light a clearing patrol from D Company, 3 RAR swept the area with tanks and APCs in support, killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B-52 bomb craters to the north of Balmoral. The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners, while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded. Quantities of weapons, clothing, ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians. Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle. Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years, evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15-year-old boys into its combat units; as had happened after the earlier fighting, their bodies were collected by a bulldozer and buried in a mass grave. Later, a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north-east of Balmoral during an aerial reconnaissance by an OH-13 helicopter, and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing defensive fire tasks early in the battle. The successful defence of Balmoral and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling. The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers, and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or Balmoral. Operation Toan Thang I concludes, 28 May ‚àí 6 June 1968 The Australians continued to patrol aggressively, with further clashes occurring between companies from 1 RAR and 3 RAR, and the North Vietnamese. On the morning of 30 May, C Company, 1 RAR under Major Ian Campbell had patrolled into a bunker system east of FSB Coral and was contacted by a large dug-in North Vietnamese force. At 08:30 the lead platoon, 9 Platoon, came under fire and was pinned down by RPGs and 7.62 mm RPD light machine-guns. Meanwhile, 7 Platoon moved to assist but was also pinned down, with one section suffering heavy casualties and losing an M60 machine-gun. Campbell struggled to establish a company defensive position, pushing 8 Platoon forward covered by armed helicopters and indirect fire. Yet with the two forces facing each other at only , the Australian artillery and mortars were rendered ineffective and Dunstan subsequently dispatched two tanks from Coral to reinforce them as heavy fighting developed. Supported by APCs, the Australian infantry and tanks then assaulted and cleared several bunkers, allowing the lead platoon to withdraw after three hours of fighting. Suffering one killed and seven wounded, C Company broke contact by 11:55, withdrawing as artillery, mortars and air strikes engaged the bunker system. Three days later C Company returned to the area to recover the lost machine-gun only to find the position as they had left it; strewn with dead bodies and caved-in bunkers with the battlefield having been abandoned by the North Vietnamese, who had also withdrawn following the Australian assault. The tanks had destroyed at least eight bunkers, while North Vietnamese casualties included 24 dead and a further eight believed killed. Another group of 13 had also been engaged in the open by artillery, and were also possibly killed. alt=A number of armed soldiers moving in a tactical formation move through the trees towards some barbed wire. The North Vietnamese then appeared to abandon AO Surfers to the Australians, and increasingly diverted their movement around Coral and Balmoral. Operation Toan Thang I continued for another six days regardless, and 1 ATF patrolled extensively into June. However, with contacts decreasing, on 1 June General Weyand judged the Australian blocking operation to have been successful in limiting the communist offensive against Saigon, and directed US and ARVN units to relieve them. Meanwhile, Hughes returned from leave and visited Dunstan at FSB Coral to discuss the situation and the task force's redeployment to Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy. FSB Balmoral was subsequently declared closed on 5 June, with 3 RAR and its direct support battery returning to Nui Dat by air, while FSB Coral was also closed the following day. The operation finally concluded on 6 June, with 1 RAR returning to Nui Dat by CH-47 after handing over the area of operations to the US 1st Infantry Division, while the logistic, artillery and armoured elements returned by road convoy. Yet the approach of the wet season concerned Hughes, who believed it could hinder the movement of the Centurions and leave them stranded from base until the dry season. Nonetheless, the tanks departed FSB Coral on 5 June; travelling via Bearcat and Route 15, the road move went without incident and they returned to Nui Dat by 17:00 on 6 June. Aftermath=Casualties Although Operation Toan Thang I had begun relatively quietly for the Australians it had ended far more spectacularly. During 26 days of fighting they had inflicted punishing losses on the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong and forced the North Vietnamese 7th Division to postpone a further attack on Saigon. North Vietnamese and Viet Cong casualties in AO Surfers included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured, while Australian losses were 25 killed and 99 wounded. Five New Zealanders and five American soldiers were also wounded. Westmoreland had been impressed by the results achieved by 1 ATF in May and June, and while US and South Vietnamese forces had undoubtedly borne the brunt of the fighting for the allies during this time, 1 ATF had featured prominently in American reports. The battle was the first occasion that the Australians had met the North Vietnamese Army in regimental strength, and operating in depth in a series of engagements akin to conventional warfare they had ultimately fought their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. For their involvement in the action the Royal Australian Regiment, the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and 1st Armoured Regiment were all subsequently awarded the battle honour \\"Coral-Balmoral\\", one of only five presented to Australian units during the war. On 14 May 2008 the 102nd Field Battery, RAA was awarded the honour title \\"Coral\\" in recognition of their involvement in the battle, the first such award to an Australian sub-unit. Assessment The fighting represented a watershed in the campaign for the Australians, and while they had deployed outside Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province previously, they now faced regular North Vietnamese formations and Viet Cong Main Force units operating in battalion and regimental strength, rather than southern Viet Cong guerrillas. With 1 ATF deploying astride their lines of communication the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had been forced to respond, resulting in a set-piece battle far removed from the counter-insurgency doctrine the Australians normally espoused. Yet while the battle ended in victory for 1 ATF, they had come close to suffering defeat at the hands of the North Vietnamese. Inexperienced at large air-mobile operations, poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning had caused delays and confusion during the fly-in to FSB Coral, leaving the Australian force exposed to attack on the first night. The North Vietnamese had fought in greater numbers, with heavier firepower and greater intensity than previously experienced by the Australians in Vietnam, forcing them to refine their tactics. Later, the Australian use of platoon patrols to search an area and conduct ambushes was challenged by the constant movement of North Vietnamese forces operating in superior strength, which threatened to quickly overwhelm an isolated patrol. Meanwhile, prolonged operations outside of Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy during the first half of 1968 had placed considerable strain on the Australian logistic system. Australian logistic resupply arrangements for Operation Toan Thang I had been modelled on the experience of Operation Coburg, and again required the V≈©ng T√†u-based 1 ALSG to be split in order to provide a forward logistic element at the US base at Long Binh. A forward task force maintenance area had also been established, first at Bearcat and then later at FSB Coral. Re-supply by road had continued daily from Long Binh to Bearcat, while following the move to Coral re-supply was primarily by air due to the threat of possible interdiction. Movement from unit echelons in the forward maintenance area was also undertaken by helicopter. Units in the field received one fresh meal each day, with the other two meals based half on the American C ration and half on the Australian combat ration. Although the supply of fuel and ammunition was generally satisfactory, stocks had run dangerously low on one occasion during heavy fighting at FSB Coral due to the calculation of usage rates based on previous operations, requiring an emergency night-time resupply by Chinook while the base was under attack. Re- supply of water had also been particularly difficult due to unavailability of a permanent water point. Ultimately water had to be delivered by air from Long Binh at a rate of per day using rubber fuel bladders. alt=The boodies of a number of Asian soldiers wearing khaki and webbing lie dead in a bomb crater filled with water which is coloured red. While many of the failings in Australian command arrangements evident from the initial stages of the battle were rapidly rectified as 1 ATF developed more exact standard operating procedures, future operational planning would need to pay greater heed to intelligence when determining the strength of patrols, as well as providing for quick reaction forces and rapidly responsive indirect fires to support sub-units operating independently. Ultimately though the firepower of the Australian combined arms teams proved decisive. Indeed, while the value of using armour in Vietnam was originally questioned by the Australian Army, the performance of the tanks during the fighting at Coral and Balmoral demonstrated their advantages once and for all. Indeed, whereas before the battle some infantry had doubted the usefulness or necessity of the Centurions, afterwards they did not like working without them. Over the next four years the tanks would provide invaluable close support, particularly during the clearance of bunker systems, proving to be powerful weapons in both offence and defence and were later credited with limiting casualties among the Australian infantry. In contrast, for the North Vietnamese the battle was just one part of the May Offensive, although they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack‚Äîa fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time. They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack on the first night in an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications; however, while the attacks on Coral and Balmoral had been well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion. Meanwhile, rigid command-and-control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules, preventing them from taking the initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations. Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability, with the North Vietnamese commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral on the first night, and mounting very similar attacks against Balmoral on the nights of 26 and 28 May, both of which ended in costly failures. Subsequent operations Meanwhile, 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (4 RAR) had arrived to replace 2 RAR. Joined by two New Zealand infantry companies‚ÄîW and V Companies‚Äîit was designated 4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) and under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lee Greville they commenced operations in June. Later, on 13 June, 1 RAR was again deployed to protect the bases at Long Binh and Bi√™n H√≤a from rocket attacks, operating to the north and east of Bi√™n H√≤a as part of a wider allied operation, known as Operation Toan Thang II. On 23 June the battalion was joined by 4 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) and 1 ATF headquarters was deployed under Dunstan's command as the operation expanded. On 3 July, 1RAR was relieved by 3RAR and returned to Nui Dat. Largely uneventful, the operation resulted in minimal contact and lasted until 18 July. Three Viet Cong were killed and 13 captured, while Australian casualties included one killed and one wounded. The Australians then attempted to interdict Viet Cong supplies, with a small force of tanks and APCs supported B Company 3 RAR occupying the area along Route 15 to the west and north-west of Baria between 25‚Äì30 June during Operation Ulladulla. As part of the operation the tanks ambushed a river and sank seven loaded sampans with their 20-pounder main armament. On 10 June 1968, General Creighton Abrams replaced Westmoreland as COMUSMACV and the change in command had resulted in a transformation of both the concept of the war and its conduct. Abrams directed that the allied main effort would switch to protecting population centres, rather than searching for and attempting to destroy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong main force units as they had done previously. Equally, the prosecution of the war would increasingly be handed over to the South Vietnamese under a policy of Vietnamization, with the Americans aiming to keep North Vietnamese and Viet Cong units off balance to prevent them from interfering with resupply and reinforcement until the South Vietnamese could fight the war on their own. For the Australians the change in allied strategy foreshadowed a return to the pacification of Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province. Operations outside the province over the previous eighteen months had been costly, and of the 228 Australians killed and 1,200 wounded during the war to that point, almost two-thirds had been killed since January 1967. From July, 1 ATF completed a number of search-and- clear operations along the northern border areas and west of their Tactical Area of Responsibility in Phouc Tuy Province. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong began their third general offensive for the year on 17 August 1968, attacking dozens of towns and military installations throughout South Vietnam with rockets and mortars, including Saigon. As part of the allied response the Australians were deployed to defend Ba Ria, the provincial capital, while during 20‚Äì23 August, B and C Company, 1 RAR with a troop of Centurion tanks were involved in intense urban fighting while supporting South Vietnamese forces to clear a company-sized force from D445 VC Battalion occupying Long Dien. At least 17 Viet Cong were killed during the fighting, while Australian casualties included six wounded. During the next three weeks, all three Australian battalions were deployed on search-and-destroy operations, yet the Viet Cong successfully eluded them. Continuing until 30 September, the renewed offensive lacked the scale of the previous attacks and again resulted in heavy communist casualties, failing to produce lasting military gains and contributing to an overall decline in Viet Cong and North Vietnamese combat power in the south. Yet such failures were neither final nor decisive and Hanoi seemed to increasingly hold the upper hand. The war continued regardless, while allied military strategic objectives were increasingly coming into question. In late-1968 1 ATF was again deployed outside its base in Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy, operating against suspected communist bases in the May Tao and Hat Dich areas as part of Operation Goodwood. The operation led to sustained fighting during a 78-day sweep between December 1968 and February 1969 and later became known as the Battle of Hat Dich.

At 5 pm EST, the format changed to an alternative music format. The station was notable at the time as an internet radio station targeting the geographic market of New York City and inclusion of on-air disc jockeys. Wave Radio ceased operations on September 20, 2004. KISS iFM becomes Wave Radio In November 2003, KISS iFM received a cease and desist order from WRKS (known as 98.7 KISS FM) requesting that the station discontinue the use of its name, citing confusion of the names in the New York City area. The station's branding was removed and continued operating without a name. On December 20, 2003, the station re-launched as Wave Radio (referred to on-air as \\"New York's Wave Radio\\"). On-air staff The original air staff schedule from Spring 2004 included: * Mike Summer * Michael Scott * V.G.

A player-coach (also playing coach, captain- coach, or player-manager) is a member of a sports team who simultaneously holds both playing and coaching duties. A player-coach may be a head coach or an assistant coach. They may make changes to the squad and also play on the team. Very few current major professional sports teams have head coaches who are also players, though it is common for senior players to take a role in managing more junior athletes. Historically, when professional sports had less money to pay players and coaches or managers, player-coaches were more common. Likewise, where player-coaches exist today, they are more common at, but not exclusive to, the lower levels where money is less available.  Player- coaches in basketball  Bill Russell served as the player-coach of the Boston Celtics from 1966 to 1969, winning 2 NBA championships in that timespan. The player-coach was, for many decades, a long-time fixture in professional basketball. Many notable coaches in the NBA served as player-coaches, including Bill Russell and Lenny Wilkens. This was especially true up through the 1970s, when the league was not as financially successful as it is today, and player-coaches were often used to save money. The practice fell out of favor in the 1980s (though Mike Dunleavy Sr., while an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks, once came out of retirement and played several games when a rash of injuries decimated the team). Today, the collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and the players' union prohibits the use of player- coaches, in order to avoid circumventing the league's salary cap, as coaches' salaries are not counted under the cap. Therefore, if a player is to serve as a coach, he would have to receive commission from his contract as a player. The player, then, is not technically an official coach of his team but instead simply a coach in name. One example of a player in recent years who was groomed for eventual official coaching duties using this practice was Avery Johnson.  Player-coaches in American football  In the early days of professional American football, player-coaches were a necessity, as coaching from the sidelines at the time was not allowed under the rules of most leagues. The National Football League eventually allowed sideline coaches in the late 1920s, and they quickly became the norm. During the 1920s, legendary player-coaches in the NFL include Curly Lambeau (who played for the Green Bay Packers from 1919 to 1929, and served as their head coach from 1919 to 1949) and George Halas who held similar roles for the Chicago Bears, a team for which he was also part-owner and business manager. Jimmy Conzelman was player- coach for four teams during the 1920s. In the mid-1950s Tom Landry played defensive back while serving as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants. In the early 1970s, when Landry was coach of the Dallas Cowboys, he made running back Dan Reeves a player-coach. In the television era, pro football evolved into a higher-impact two-platoon game, so players serving as head coaches became impractical. More modern players have acted as player-assistant coaches in an unofficial capacity, such as journeyman quarterback Steve DeBerg, who served as an unofficial mentor for younger, more skilled arms while also serving as their backup. With on-field playcalling a function usually assumed by the coaching staff by the dawn of the 21st century, quarterbacks such as Peyton Manning, Brett Favre and Tom Brady essentially assumed roles as on-field offensive coordinators by taking leading roles in playcalling and gameplanning. Player-coaches in cricket Player-coaches in cricket are almost unheard of, although professional coaches are a relatively recent innovation and a similar role was generally filled by the team captain; this may still be the case in amateur competition. Internationally, Shane Deitz was appointed non-playing coach of Vanuatu in 2014 and, after meeting the necessary residency qualifications, made his international playing debut in 2018, at the age of 42. Similarly, former Australian international Ryan Campbell was appointed as a non-playing batting coach of Hong Kong in 2013,\\"HKCA appoints Ryan Campbell as Specialist Batting Coach\\" ‚Äì ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 28 January 2016. and after meeting the residency qualifications made his playing debut for Hong Kong in 2016, at the age of 44.\\"Hong Kong pick ex- Australia keeper Campbell for WT20\\" ‚Äì ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 28 January 2016.  Player-managers in association football  In association football, this situation usually arises when a manager leaves a team suddenly, and the chairman has to make a quick decision to appoint someone new as a caretaker manager. The chairman will usually either ask a coach to take temporary charge or turn to one of the club's most senior players. If this particular player gains good results for the team during his time in charge, he may be appointed full-time manager, which leaves him a player‚Äìmanager. However, there are instances when a free agent is appointed by a new team as a manager and offers his playing abilities. Notable football player‚Äìmanagers include Kenny Dalglish (Liverpool), Graeme Souness (Rangers), Glenn Hoddle (Swindon Town and Chelsea), Bryan Robson (Middlesbrough), Peter Reid (Manchester City), Ruud Gullit (Chelsea) and Gianluca Vialli (Chelsea). Dalglish won a double of the league title and FA Cup in his first season as player-manager, and continued to win two more league titles and an FA Cup before retiring from playing completely five years after becoming manager. Souness won three Scottish league titles and several cup competitions when he was player-manager of Rangers. He then succeeded Dalglish as Liverpool manager just before Rangers won another Scottish league title, but at the age of 38 he did not register himself as a player for Liverpool. In 1997, Ruud Gullit won the FA Cup with Chelsea in his first season as player-manager, also making history by being the first foreign and non-white manager to win a major trophy in English football. He was sacked nine months later, and Chelsea appointed another player-manager (Gianluca Vialli) in his place. Within weeks of taking over, Vialli guided Chelsea to victory in the League Cup, and two months after that, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup.One's Kompany: just where have all the player-managers gone?, FourFourTwo, 22 May 2019Act: Top 10 player-managers in English football include legends from Chelsea, Liverpool and Rangers as Vincent Kompany takes up new role at Anderlecht, TalkSport, 21 May 2019 A number of bigger clubs have appointed player-managers on a temporary basis but not given them permanent contracts. Notable cases include Ossie Ardiles (Tottenham Hotspur) in 1987 and Dave Watson (Everton) a decade later, although Ardiles later returned to Tottenham as manager in 1993 after managing three other clubs. During the first decade of the 21st century, however, the concept gradually fell into almost total disuse and was normally only practiced by smaller clubs. In March 2013, a BBC Sport article suggested that the concept of having a player-manager had gone out of fashion, with only two clubs in the English professional leagues using player-managers at that time. The chief executive of the League Managers Association stated his belief that the increased workload for managers made combining the two roles difficult. The last permanent player-manager in the top flight of English football was Gianluca Vialli, who retired from playing in 1999 when he was the manager of Chelsea. The governing bodies have also imposed requirements for managers to hold professional coaching qualifications, which few players obtain before retiring. There have been four player-managers in the Premier League since 2000: Stuart McCall, who managed two Bradford City games on an interim basis in late 2000, Garry Monk, who was appointed interim player-manager of Swansea City in February 2014, after their manager, Michael Laudrup, was sacked, and Leon Britton who also became player-manager of Swansea City after the sacking of Paul Clement. Ryan Giggs was appointed player-coach at Manchester United by David Moyes on 4 July 2013 and Giggs served as interim player-manager until the appointment of Louis van Gaal on 9 May 2014 as manager following Moyes' dismissal. On the 6 May 2014, in what turned out to be his final game as a player, Ryan Giggs substituted himself on against Hull in the closing minutes at the age of 40. As of 2019, Vincent Kompany serves as player-manager for RSC Anderlecht.  Player-managers in baseball  While no Major League Baseball (MLB) team has been led by a player-manager since 1986, they were once common. Cap Anson, Connie Mack, John McGraw, Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Joe Cronin, Mickey Cochrane, Solly Hemus, Lou Boudreau, Joe Torre, and Frank Robinson are among those who spent time as player-managers. In this capacity, Robinson became the first African-American manager in MLB history when he was named the Cleveland Indians' player-manager in . Fred Clarke spent the longest time as a major league player-manager, serving as such for the Louisville Colonels from to and the Pittsburgh Pirates from to . The most recent player-manager in MLB was Pete Rose, who, upon being traded from the Montreal Expos to the Cincinnati Reds in August , was immediately named the Reds' manager. Rose managed and served as a backup infielder until the end of the season, when he retired as a player. (He continued to manage the Reds until when he was suspended indefinitely by MLB for gambling on baseball.) In , Chicago White Sox general manager Kenny Williams said that he considered hiring veteran first baseman Paul Konerko as a player-manager to replace departing manager Ozzie Guill√©n. Williams instead hired retired player Robin Ventura for the position. In their final game of the season, the Miami Marlins allowed Martin Prado to serve as player-manager. Prado started the game at third base and played for three innings before taking himself out of the game. MLB rules are different for trips to the mound by the manager if he is a player-manager (this is with regard to being required to change pitchers after two visits). A player- manager places himself into or out of the lineup just as he would any other player.

The story is set in 2040, after economic strife and a pair of nuclear attacks have led to civil war, causing the United States to split into two hostile and competing nations: one a moderate Islamic republic with its capital in Seattle, the other a breakaway Christian Bible Belt built on the ashes of the former Confederacy and with its capital in Atlanta. The hardcover edition of Prayers for the Assassin was published in the United States in February 2006 by Charles Scribner's Sons.  Plot summary  The book starts off during the second American Civil War with a Muslim soldier dying in 2017, at the battle of Newark. Flash forward to the Super Bowl in 2042 in Seattle, the capital of the new Islamic Republic, the majority of whose inhabitants have converted to Islam. The nation's culture is a fusion of traditional American and Islamic: the Super Bowl is still played, but the cheerleaders are sword-wielding men and the participants break at half-time for afternoon prayers. As the story opens, the country is facing a crisis, with competing political and religious factions threatening to destroy the fragile peace that exists within the Islamic States of America. At the same time, behind the scenes, a messianic figure known as the Wise Old One contrives to seize power for himself, and fulfill the ancient prophecy of the restoration of the Caliphate. The story's protagonist is Rakkim Epps, a Muslim and ex-Fedayeen shadow warrior. Epps must risk everything to save the life of Sarah Dougan, the young historian he loves. It becomes known that it was in fact Muslim extremists who launched the attacks, including the dirty bomb in Mecca. A fourth, more powerful bomb (later found in China) was scheduled for detonation but the small group of Muslim extremists assigned the task succumbed to radiation poisoning before it could be put into play. Once the truth was exposed, the parties stepped back from the brink and sought to find a common ground from which to start a more trusting, more open-minded dialog. Thomas \\"Redbeard\\" Dougan, Sarah's uncle, dies in the aftermath. At the epilogue, Rakkim is in a mosque, performing his salat, or ritual prayer. There is a final showdown between Darwin, the \\"evil\\" assassin and Rakkim, with both of them almost dying. Rakkim finishes the showdown by killing Darwin with a knife throw to the face, but the rest of the ending sets up the conditions for the sequel.  The New America  After nuclear suitcase bombs completely destroy New York City and Washington D.C. and a dirty bomb irradiates Mecca the United States is split into four pieces. The Islamic Republic comprises the west coast, southwest, and most of the Midwest. After the bomb attacks were revealed to have been done by Israeli agents and many celebrity conversions (including country star \\"Shania X\\") a large proportion of the country converted to Islam. The new country was founded as a beacon of light, but has failed to live up. Civil liberties are severely curtailed with the first and second amendments removed and a Wahabi/Talibanesque religious police called the Black Robes gaining more and more power. Jews (blamed for the destruction of Washington and New York) are ostracized and Catholics have taken the role of second class citizens. The roads are falling apart, satellite communications are often down, and the I.R. lacks scientific growth, living off excess technology stored by the former United States. The U.S. military has advanced little, with modern technology the best it can produce, the main reason that the two main power countries Russia and China avoid an attack is the elite training of the Fedayeen corps. The Fedayeen are essentially the guards of the republic, mostly made up of converts and veterans of the civil war. They are loyal to the democratic Islamic government though they are constantly courted by the extremist Black Robes whose police force are bitter rivals of the Fedeyeen. Many landmarks and warships were renamed after Islamic figures, the best example being the renamed the USS Osama bin Laden or Seattle's football facility is called Khomeini Stadium. It is mentioned that the new government attempted to destroy Mount Rushmore, but gave up due to the sheer size of the monument. The Bible Belt, a partially recognised separatist republic that comprises the old south plus Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia and most of Missouri disputed between itself and the Islamic State. After the transition millions of evangelical Christians immigrated here. Its government is thought to be much looser and decentralized, resembling the old Confederacy. The technology they possess is not made clear, although it is mentioned they have the only recipe for Coca-Cola. Nevada is its own free state with a large and growing population, it serves exactly the same capacity as it does now. The Mormon territories comprise Utah, plus parts of Colorado and Idaho. Little is mentioned about it. They may however not be a separate state, the map in the book (the UK version of the book does not contain a map) suggests they may just be an autonomous region within the Islamic Republic. Parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Southern California have been claimed by the Aztlan Empire (formerly Mexico) and tension between the I.R. and A.E. have risen due to land claims. Hawaii is described in the same context as Canada so could be independent. Alaska and the most Northerly New England States are not described. Canada has snatched some of Minnesota and Wisconsin as \\"ancestral lands\\" for its native population. Additionally, Southern Florida has become its own state, using a flag similar to Puerto Rico or Cuba. The Islamic Republic has long been suffering an internal war between its moderate/modern wanting to preserve its democratic traditional government and fundamentalist factions wishing to create a fundamentalist Islamic State under the strict form Sharia law.  Characters  *Rakkim Epps: The story's protagonist, a Muslim ex-Fedayeen shadow warrior, who is currently running a night club in Seattle's Christian Zone, where Muslims and Christians alike can commit illegal acts and businesses. He is hired to track down Sarah (his longtime love interest) by her uncle, when it is discovered that she has disappeared. *Sarah Dougan: Rakkim's lover, a young college professor who attracts a great deal of controversy in her short career, having recently authored a book on the American's conversion to Islam which angered the country's fundamentalist population. While working on her latest book, one of her sources informs her to go into hiding because her work has attracted the attention of a mysterious figure who was behind her father's assassination. *Thomas \\"Redbeard\\" Dougan: Sarah's uncle and head of the Department of State Security. He is seen as the constant target of the country's fundamentalist leaders, a true patriot of his country. He took in Rakkin while he was a young orphan; he also raised Sarah after his brother's assassination and her mother's mysterious disappearance. They had a falling out when Rakkim joined the Fedeyeen and were not on speaking terms after he refused to grant Rakkim's request to marry Sarah. With the disappearance of his niece and knowing that his rivals were closing in on him, he overcomes his estrangement with Rakkim and asks him to find Sarah. *The Old One aka Hassan Muhammad: a terrorist mastermind responsible for the shaping of much of the current world. Although his actual age is unknown due to scientific procedures that help him live longer, he is estimated to be around 70‚Äì90 years old. Possibly a Yemeni who speaks his English with a British accent, presumably indicating where he received his education. He is the one who ordered the assassination of Sarah's father and discovers that her latest work could threaten to expose his life's work. *Darwin Conklin: A psychopathic ex-Fedayeen assassin hired by the Old One to track down Sarah (despite being described by the Old One's son as a demon), he leaves a bloody trail of murders throughout his journey. *Mullah Ibn Azziz: The new leader of the Blackrobes order, a young extremist who seeks to create a fundamentalist society cleansed of Catholics, Jews, and non-fundamentalist Muslims.

The New Zealand release date was 18 October 2007. Backstory In the slums 300 years ago, male children began to be born as vampires. They have enhanced hearing, sight, agility, stamina, and reflexes. In this reality, vampires are considered a more perfect version of humans, i.e. closer to God, and constitute an elite. They have created a church and are called \\"Brothers\\". They wear unadorned, long black coats, and appear monk-like. The Brothers state that they exist only to serve humans, to protect and guide them. Brothers live longer than humans: the oldest is over 300 years old and as yet none have died. Vampires are removed from their mothers at birth, indoctrinated into the Brotherhood, and raised to believe they are evolved humans whose role is to serve. Human churchgoers donate blood for the Brothers to drink, though Brothers never drink blood straight from the human body. Churchgoers wear rosaries; however not all humans are churchgoers. During rare ceremonies humans drink the Brothers' blood, which gives them visions and some may experience prescience. The liturgy of the church states that mingling the blood of the two races makes one titular \\"Perfect Creature\\". Brothers hold religious education classes for human children. They are taught that Brothers are a step in human evolution, and learn that genetic research is banned because nothing but evil comes from it ‚Äì the deadly influenza which is rife in the city, included. Genetic research is banned for humans as a method of control by the Brothers so that humans are prevented from getting rid of vampires or gaining independence. It was mentioned that before the co-existence of human and vampire, vampires were killed, at birth. Plot The film opens as a pregnant woman (Danielle Cormack) gives birth to a vampire. A young Brother, Silus, aged 10‚Äì13 is told this child, Edgar and he are from the same mother. Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him. Captioned \\"100 Years Later.\\" Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires (Saffron Burrows) is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus (Dougray Scott) is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar (Leo Gregory). Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood. The newspapers have published a fake story of the death of the killer; a deranged human who believed he was a Brother. Edgar is being held in a \\"brace\\", a spiked body restraint in a cell in the church basement. Because Silus is soon to be made a member of the \\"inner circle\\" he is told the full details of what happened to Edgar. The cardinals are worried that not a single Brother has been born for 70 years, and that a female vampire has never been born. Although they have publicly banned genetic research, the church has been carrying it out in secret. Edgar has been developing a virus to inject into pregnant women, to force the baby to be born a vampire. Alas the virus has mutated, and it has turned the women into violent, insane, psychopaths. Ten of Edgar's research subjects are already dead, and the last one is dying. Edgar has also become infected, and is now insane, although the effect is slower due to his strong immune system. Silus visits Edgar, who vows to escape and finish off Lilly. Edgar accuses Silus of being in love with Lilly, despite Brothers being forbidden to love. The night Silus is at a ceremony in the church for his investiture as a cardinal Edgar escapes, killing the guards and receptionist, and disappears into Jamestown. He enlists the help of a local named Freddy to help him catch Lilly. Edgar has installed a tap and tube system into his forearm, so he can turn on a flow of his own infected blood at any time. He catches a policewoman and fills her mouth with his blood. Freddy insists on getting his own share as well, not knowing it is infected. Silus is guarding Lilly at her apartment with Lilly's colleague Jones. When she is sleeping Silus shows some affection for her by imagining kissing her. Later, Silus leaves to investigate a noise downstairs and Lilly and Jones patrol around. When Lilly approaches a window, Edgar bursts through from outside and grabs her. Silus and Edgar grapple, however Silus is knocked unconscious long enough for Edgar and Lilly to disappear. The virus has spread throughout Jamestown. The government has instituted a quarantine, and soldiers shoot anybody who attempts to leave. Humans are rioting outside the churches, and throwing their rosaries back at the Brothers. Silus discovers Edgar's location is Jamestown's water source. Edgar is dripping his blood into the water supply, infecting all of Jamestown. However, each suburb has its own separate water supply. Silus is determined to go in and rescue Lilly, however another cardinal tells him that Jamestown will be burned to the ground to make sure that the virus dies, and Edgar with it. He warns Silus that his own career will be doomed if he ignores the \\"greater good\\" and breaches quarantine. Silus breaks through into Jamestown and heads to the aquifer, dodging the infected. Lilly is handcuffed to a water pipe in a locked basement. Edgar comes in and she tries to persuade him to stop but instead he challenges her about her dead child, saying that her race is good at abandoning children. Edgar finds Silus and they fight. Just as Silus is winning, Edgar throws him backwards onto the prongs of a steam injector. As Silus lies groaning, and possibly dying, on the ground, Edgar approaches with a portable steam injector. When Edgar depresses the trigger steam comes out. Edgar threatens to burn Silus's face off so that he will be more of a monster just like him. Lilly comes up behind Edgar and kills him by stabbing another steam injector into the back of his skull. Silus escorts Lilly from the water facility. He kisses Lilly and says she must do something. He gestures to a building then tells Lilly she must look after what she will find in there and keep it away from the Brotherhood. Lilly enters the building, and finds the other Brother, a dead woman, and a baby. The Brother tells Lilly the infant is the first female vampire ever born. The virus has created her and she is truly the first Perfect Creature. Silus is branded a heretic, and must stay in hiding. Meanwhile, Lilly is caring for the baby and Silus is watching over her. The movie ends with Silus saying that he is being hunted but he will always fight back, leaving scope for a second movie. Cast *Dougray Scott as Brother Silus *Saffron Burrows as Capt.

It is most commonly used to treat hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. It is generally less preferred than levothyroxine. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Side effects may occur from excessive doses. This may include weight loss, fever, headache, anxiety, trouble sleeping, arrythmias, and heart failure. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally safe. Regular blood tests are recommended to verify the appropriateness of the dose being taken. Liothyronine was approved for medical use in 1956. It is available as a generic medication. A month's supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 247 as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about 22.40. In 2017, it was the 252nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical uses Liothyronine is a generally less preferred option to levothyroxine (T4) for people with hypothyroidism. It may be used when there is an impaired conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. The dose of liothyronine for hypothyroidism is a lower amount than levothyroxine due it being a higher concentrated synthetic medication. About 25 Œºg of liothyronine is equivalent to 100 Œºg of levothyroxine. In thyroid cancer or Graves' disease, ablation therapy with radioactive iodine (131I) can be used to remove trace thyroid tissue that may remain after thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). For 131I therapy to be effective, the trace thyroid tissue must be avid to iodine, which is achieved by elevating the person's TSH levels. For patients taking levothyroxine, TSH may be boosted by discontinuing levothyroxine for 3‚Äì6 weeks. This long period of hormone withdrawal is required because of levothyroxine's relatively long biological half-life, and may result in symptoms of hypothyroidism in the patient. The shorter half-life of liothyronine permits a withdrawal period of two weeks, which may minimize hypothyroidism symptoms. One protocol is to discontinue levothyroxine, then prescribe liothyronine while the T4 levels are falling, and finally stop the liothyronine two weeks before the radioactive iodine treatment. Liothyronine may also be used for myxedema coma because of its quicker onset of action when compared to levothyroxine. Use for the treatment of obesity is not recommended. Depression Adding liothyronine to tricyclic antidepressants appears useful, especially in women. An algorithm developed from the STAR*D trial recommends liothyronine as an option when people have failed two antidepressant medications. Pregnancy Per the U.S. FDA, liothyronine is categorized as Pregnancy Category A.Cytomel (Liothyronine Sodium) Drug Information: Warnings and Precautions - Prescribing Information at RxList, retrieved on 29-October-2014 Thyroid hormone is minimally transferred to the fetus or placenta, however as of October 2014, studies have not shown any adverse effects to the fetus. Hypothyroid mothers should continue to take thyroid hormone replacement therapy throughout pregnancy to avoid adverse events.\\"Liothyronine (Lexi-Drugs)\\". LexiComp. Retrieved 29 October 2014. Nursing Breastmilk contains a low amount of thyroid hormone, so it is important to exercise caution when breastfeeding while taking liothyronine. Elderly Older people should be started on lower doses of liothyronine. Plasma T3 concentrations in this population are decreased by 25% to 40%. TSH must be routinely monitored since there is a risk of coronary artery disease, hyperthyroidism and excessive bone loss from inadequate or abnormal thyroid replacement. Contraindications Any person with a hypersensitivity to liothyronine sodium or any active ingredient of the formulation should not be on this medication. If there is uncorrected adrenal insufficiency or thyrotoxicosis, a different approach to therapy must be considered. Side effects Liothyronine may cause a number of side effects, mostly similar to symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which include:MedlinePlus. \\"Liothyronine.\\" Last accessed July 14, 2007. * weight loss * tremor * headache * upset stomach * vomiting * diarrhea * stomach cramps * nervousness * irritability * insomnia * excessive sweating * increased appetite * fever * changes in menstrual cycle * sensitivity to heat Boxed warning The package insert contains the following boxed warning, as do all thyroid hormones: > Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other > therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity.

Larger doses may produce serious or > even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in > association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their > anorectic effects. Pharmacology Liothyronine is the most potent form of thyroid hormone. As a salt of triiodothyronine (T3), it is chemically similar and pharmacologically equivalent to T3. As such, it acts on the body to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. As monotherapy or in combination therapy with SSRIs, liothyronine may also enhance generation of new neurons in the central nervous system. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. In comparison to levothyroxine (T4), liothyronine has a faster onset of action as well as a shorter biological half-life, which may be due to less plasma protein binding to thyroxine-binding globulin and transthyretin. Pricing The British Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the alleged \\"excessive and unfair pricing\\" of liothyronine tablets in 2017. It alleged that Advanz Pharma overcharged the NHS from before 2007 to July 2017. The price of a pack increased by almost 1,600% from ¬£4.46 before it was debranded in 2007 to ¬£258.19 by July 2017.

The Bulletin calls it \\"a fast-paced vampire novel with an anti-Buffy heroine and a studly vampire who aren't going to let a little thing like death stand between them.\\" Plot summary The book is set in the fictional town of Ramsa, New York, and centers around teenager Jessica Ashley Allodola. Jessica is gorgeous and has a perfect body, but the people in her town avoid her. At Ramsa High, many students are afraid of her and some think she's a witch. Instead of trying to bond to people, Jessica writes books about vampires and witches. She has just published her first book, \\"Tiger, Tiger\\", under the pen name Ash Night. As her senior year starts, there are two new students, Caryn Rashida and Alex Remington. Jessica is instantly stunned by the fact that Alex looks exactly like Aubrey, a character in \\"Tiger, Tiger.\\" However, since Jessica believes vampires aren't real, she convinces herself that he's not Aubrey. Both Caryn and Alex show an interest in Jessica. Jessica finds Alex fascinating but considers Caryn a nuisance. After a few clues, Jessica finds out that the books she has been writing are completely true. That Alex is actually the vampire Aubrey and Caryn is a Smoke witch. Many of the vampires wish to kill her for exposing their secrets. Aubrey had initially planned to kill her, but after meeting her, he's uncertain of what to do. After Jessica is attacked by Fala, another vampire, Aubrey changes Jessica into a vampire. Throughout the story, Jessica pieces together clues regarding her birth. Her mother was Jazlyn and had been offered immortality numerous times by Siete, the creator of the vampires. After her husband's death, the pregnant Jazlyn accepted the offer in a moment of desperation and Siete changed her. However, after years of life as a vampire, her regret became too strong. A Smoke witch, Monica, offered to give her back her humanity. Monica died in the process, but she succeeded. A few months later, Jazlyn's child was born. However, the child, Jessica, held no resemblance to either of her biological parents. Instead, after almost two decades in an undead womb, she resembled Siete. Her green eyes, black hair, pale skin, and vampiric traces in her aura were all from him and Jazlyn could not look at her. So Jazlyn gave Jessica up for adoption. Reception The second novel of the series received a generally positive review, especially from critics that review primarily young adult novels. Teen People said the book was \\"a good Gothic chiller,\\" while Boston Magazine said it was \\"elaborately imagined,\\" whilst the New Yorker said, \\"Amelia has an uncanny understanding of the kind of narrative that makes for a successful potboiler: she's skilled at creating characters the reader easily and instantly bonds with, and she's resourceful when it comes to putting them in jeopardy.\\" Kirkus Reviews found Demon In My View \\"Full of atmospherics, but weak on style\\" and \\"Not bad for a 15-year-old, but not a well-written, fully realized novel either. \\" while Publishers Weekly wrote \\"Atwater-Rhodes exercises impressive control over the complex lineages she has imagined, and she comes up with creative solutions to advance her story.

Her line of witches are the most powerful of the mortal vampire-hunting witches and are very attack oriented. In the hunt for Nikolas, a vampire that killed a Vida a century ago, Sarah finds Christopher and Nissa, sibling vampires who don‚Äôt kill when they need to feed. Instead, they feed on animals and willing humans. As Sarah‚Äôs friendship with Christopher begins to turn into something more, she is forbidden to see him by her domineering mother, Dominique. Ultimately, when Sarah discovers Christopher‚Äôs true identity and his tie to Nikolas, Sarah finds that she may have to re-think her attitude and her whole world view. After intense internal debate Sarah decides to reveal her identity to Christopher and a wall appears between them. This whole event finally garners her mother's attention and Sarah's mother binds her powers and calls a trial for Sarah's violations( which include associating with vampires and revealing her identity). She manages to escape with the help of her sister Adianna. Christopher's attitude towards her pushes her further into the Vida mind-set and she decides to hunt down Nikolas through Christopher. She gains an opportunity to kill Nikolas but hesitates when she thinks it is Christopher (as Nikolas and Christopher are twin brothers). Nikolas then over-powers Sarah and marks her. Sarah's pride is seriously injured and after an encounter with Christopher and a very traumatized victim of another vampire, Sarah receives an invitation from Nikolas to a party. Sarah decides to go against the warnings of Nissa and attends the party. There she attempts to fight Nikolas but without the full use of her bound powers she stands little chance. Adianna shows up and attempts to rescue Sarah but finds her-self unable to defeat Nikolas. Nikolas uses Adianna as a hostage for Sarah to surrender all her weapons (which are the only way for her to use her magic to kill vampires). Christopher shows up and attempts to talk them down but he eventually loses control due to Sarah's attempts to fight back and he begins fighting Sarah as well. Christopher and his brother overpower Sarah and attempt to blood-bond her to them. However, Sarah's witch blood rejects the vampires' blood and Adianna, her older sister, tells them it will kill her. Christopher is in love with Sarah and can't bear what he's done. In the end, he turns her into a vampire and asks her to live with them, because he loves her. Sarah accepts to stay a vampire, but says that she isn't ready to be with them yet. She refuses to stay with them because she can't follow their trail of killing people every time she feeds.

On display at the Mus√©e Bolo, EPFL, Lausanne. Ohio Scientific Inc. (also known as Ohio Scientific Instruments) was an Ohio-based computer company that built and marketed microcomputers from 1975 to 1981. Their best-known products were the Challenger series of microcomputers and Superboard single-board computer kits.  Products  Ohio Scientific Challenger 4P One of their first products, launched in 1977, was the OSI Model 500 system, a very simple single board computer based on the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. It needed an external video monitor as it had an internal character-based video controller and ran Microsoft BASIC. Storage was to any cassette by FSK encoding. The Challenger III, introduced in August 1977, had a maximum of 53 KB of static RAM and used 8\\" 370 KB floppy disks in its dual floppy drive system. It was also sold in an optional 4' high 19\\" rack mount cabinet with wheels, version C3-B, that included a hard drive. (Ohio was the first company to use a Winchester hard drive in its PCs.) This was intended for an office environment and used a standard computer terminal, like the Hazeltine 1420 (or 1500), which was optionally supplied through factory sales. The terminals were the same ones as used with mainframe computers of that era. With the largest hard drive available, 74MB, the system cost just under $13,000. The least expensive version without the rack or hard drive was $3995 MSRP, a phenomenal performance-to-cost ratio for the time. The Challenger III also had the capability to support non-floppy or hard drive Challenger 2P computers through a simple network using RS-232 links. OSI's later products were also 6502-based, the Superboard II, Challenger 1P, Challenger 2P, Challenger 4P and Challenger 8P, introduced in 1979 and discontinued in 1981. Original Ohio Scientific motherboard designs used 7400-series TTL chips. Instead of using a floppy disk controller IC, OSI used a Motorola MC6850 ACIA Serial Port ACIA chip and a Motorola MC6821 (PIA) chip for the Disk Drive Controller, which made OSI 8\\" & 5-1/4\\" Floppy Disks unreadable by other computer systems. Superboard II in a home built wooden case meant to mimic the extremely popular Apple II computer Superboard II - single board computer with home built case opened The Superboard II was the least expensive computer, retailing for around the $279 price range, with an onboard BASIC programming language. It came without a case or power supply. It was a single board computer with the keyboard integrated on the same printed circuit board. It was shipped with 4KB of RAM (upgradable to 8KB), a 2KB BIOS in ROM (known as SYNMON as the ROM was labeled 'SYN600' or 'SYNMON 1.0') and an early version of Microsoft 8K BASIC. OSI 6502 BASIC Version 1.0 Revision 3.2 (c) 1977 By Microsoft. The version OSI C1P / 600D Superboard II (occasionally advertised as the 'Colorboard') featured an unpopulated socket for an extra 1k √ó 4-bits of video RAM to hold character color information. The implementation of this was detailed in the OSI user group newsletter which was published around four times a year. The 600D also featured two video modes: 32√ó32 (~24√ó24 visible) for 'graphics', or 64√ó16 (~48√ó15 visible) for text where each text line had a blank line between it and the next. The mode could be selected by a poke to the keyboard register. The computer couldn't write to the video memory without glitching the display. There was an add-on graphics card for the Superboard that would display 256 by 256 pixels. It came with software to draw 3D graphics.The keyboard polling register (a simple 8-bit TTL Latch) was also used as a very crude digital-to-analog converter by means of a resistor ladder connected to an 'audio out' socket to the right of the keyboard. Unusual for the day, but reflecting the home built nature of personal computers of this era, the company supplied full crude schematics of their hardware. This allowed the Computer Hobbyist or 3rd-party companies to create after-market field modifications, such as increased clock speed, increasing the cassette tape drive storage speed, and increased video line length, as well as reverse video (white screen with black text). The C2P video systems did not have color graphics like the Apple II, just upper- and lower-case text, and some pseudo graphical characters, (comparable to the \\"PETSCII\\" character set of the Commodore PET) for drawing lines and supporting simple games. The Challenger 4P (C4P-MF) came with color display output capability, using a TV or TV converted to have direct video input, and dual 5¬º\\" floppy drives. It also had the ability to connect to external sensors or control external components, through a programmable I/O section mounted on the back. This was a feature no competitor had. Software was also minimal for the non-disk drive versions of the C1P, C2P, and Superboard II. They contained an 8K Basic in ROM and used cassette tapes to load and store programs. Disk-based systems included a bare- bones \\"Disk Operating System\\" that was much handier than using compact cassettes at 1200 baud. Mainly due to the popularity of a UK clone of the Superboard computer called the UK101, the bugs in the BASIC ROMs were eventually fixed, and at least two third-party companies produced their own version of the OS. One version was called 'CEGMON', the other was 'WEMON' produced by Watford Electronics in the UK. Both featured full screen editing (almost identical to the commodore PET), Named cassette file handling (like the PET) and a greatly Improved machine code monitor (also very similar to the Commodore PET). The OSI Challenger III had three processors: a 6502, a 6800, and a Z80. These were software switchable, but only one would be running at a time. Because it had a Z80, the Challenger III could run CP/M, but it booted up in 6502 mode, and the bootstrap would switch processors. The operating systems which ran on the CIII were OSI CP/M, OS-65D, and OS-65U. All three operating systems, at least in the later versions, had directories with file names. OSI/CPM had an assembler, FORTRAN and COBOL compiler, but to make a copy of the CP/M, one had to boot in OS-65D to copy the disk. OS-65D had a Basic Interpreter, Assembler, Editor, Disassembler, and Disk Copy Utility. OS-65U had a Basic Interpreter, and had some simple networking capability, but assembly programs had to be done in OS-65D and then ported over.  History =Origins The company was founded by Mike and Charity Cheiky in 1975 in Hiram, Ohio. Their earliest products were MOS 6502-based systems, the same processor used in the MOS Technology KIM-1, Apple 1, Commodore PET, VIC-20 and many other early micros. The company initially sold a computer trainer, which consisted of the 6502 and enough circuitry to communicate with the processor using switches. This was first advertised for $99 in the February 1976 edition of Byte Magazine. If the trainer was successfully assembled, the owner could trade it, along with another $10, for the company's \\"OSI 400 Superboard System\\", a fully developed single-board microcomputer that could run with either the 6502 or the Motorola 6800. The bare boards were available for as little as $29, or in a variety of kit versions with more or less of the parts needed to build it out. It could support up to eight National Semiconductor 2102 SRAM memory chips for 1024 bytes (1 KB) of RAM, 512 bytes of ROM, an ACIA serial interface chip for RS-232C or a 20 mA current loop interface for a teleprinter, a PIA for 16-parallel I/O lines, and a power supply. Adding a terminal or teletype completed the system. The company also sold one of the earliest floppy disk interfaces and a video card for use with a composite monitor. Challenger By 1978 the company introduced a new main CPU card design, the model 500. This was primarily sold as part of their new Challenger microcomputer systems, but was also available in the Superboard II form. The base model Superboard was essentially the same card as the Challenger, complete with the keyboard, however other versions were available that split out the functionality into separate cards connected together along an 8-connector backplane using 48-pin Molex connectors. End of OSI In March 1981 OSI was sold to M/A-Com Inc. of Burlington, Massachusetts. OSI then concentrated on business systems. In May 1982 the OSI name was changed to M/A-Com Office Systems Inc.

The band consists of Marko Nyberg, Johanna Kal√©n and Antony Bentley. History=2002‚Äì2010 Husky Rescue was formed by Marko Nyberg, who began composing under the name in 2002, wanting to create cinematic music influenced by film, photography and painting. He has counted film director David Lynch and French composer Erik Satie among his influences. When recording the band's debut album Country Falls, Nyberg recorded around twenty musicians and singers for use on the album‚Äîeach of them a good friend of Nyberg's and all Helsinki- based. As Nyberg puts it himself: > \\"Every track is designed to be a warm breeze to counter the chill of daily > life, whether you live in cold climes or not. All moments from life become > part of the music. Husky Rescue reflects our background in Helsinki where > the winter nights are so cold and long while the summer is hot and short, > but oh so sweet. It's melancholic music but there is always hope. Husky > Rescue's music is like the first snow on the ground when you can still see > the green grass through the snow. It's like spring's sunbeam after the long, > dark, sunless winter time.\\"Quote source Husky Rescue's line-up from 2002 to 2010 consisted of Nyberg (bass), Reeta- Leena Vestman (n√©e Korhola, vocals), Ville Riippa (keyboards), Maria Ilmoniemi (keyboards), Anssi Sopanen (drums) and Miika Colliander (guitar). The band's debut album Country Falls was released worldwide in October 2004 on Catskills Records and in the US on 12 April 2005 on Minty Fresh. The cinematic sceneries found on the debut were further developed on 2007's Ghost Is Not Real which turned up the sonic experimentation and detailed production without sacrificing the catchy, pop aesthetic. Nyberg's sense of dynamics and tendency towards delicacy on the album were described by Pitchfork Media as \\"an imagined collaboration, perhaps, between Ingmar Bergman and Jean-Pierre Jeunet\\". Learning about a reported UFO sighting near his residence just outside central Helsinki further turned Nyberg's interest towards the nature, thus propelling a new wave of inspiration. He saw hope and beauty in the Northern surroundings, and embarked on a solitary songwriting trip to Lapland. Heavily featuring Jari Salo, one half of the duo Pepe Delux√© and a long-time friend of Marko's, Husky Rescue's third album Ship of Light was released in January 2010. The album was met with positive reviews in the media, such as The Guardian giving it four out of five stars and comparing the sound to \\"the kind of adult pop that Air were promising us with their first album\\", or The Sunday Times naming the album CD of the week and rating it four stars. Ben Hogwood of Music OMH remarked that the album continued in the tradition of their previous albums with \\"beautifully icy string colours\\" and \\"imaginative touches of orchestration.\\" Husky Rescue have performed at several music festivals such as Lollapalooza, Glastonbury, South by Southwest, and Austin City Limits. They have toured extensively in the UK and Europe, and played select shows in North America. 2010‚Äìpresent After touring their 2010 album Ship of Light, culminating in their last performance at Flow Festival in Helsinki in August 2011, the band reorganized and renewed. Prompted in part by long-standing singer Vestman taking the opportunity to study musical theatre at the Royal Academy of Music in London, Nyberg decided to strip everything down and start afresh, to head into a more intimate, bright and natural direction. Deciding on a new singer he met up with a Swedish vocalist Johanna Kal√©n in Stockholm and drafted in his old English friend, Antony Bentley, they formed the new line-up and started working on new material. Having written several new songs they decamped to Greenpoint, the Brooklyn studio of an enthusiastic vintage keyboard collector, to record them. Now finished they will be released in 2012. The first single of the new material, \\"Deep Forest Green\\", was released on 27 January 2012 and made available as a free download on the band's SoundCloud profile. Style and use in other media The band's unique sound reconstitutes influences of alternative country, depressive disco, and pop into distinctive, cinematic soundscapes. From the beginning, digital illustrator Kustaa Saksi has crafted the visual side of the project, capturing the mood with his detailed yet minimalist style, reminiscent of the ukiyo-e paintings and masking-based comic style of Japan. Due to the visual character and ability to convey emotion and mood, Husky Rescue's music has been placed in several advertisements and TV shows. \\"My World\\" was used in Hyundai's Think About It advertisements. \\"New Light of Tomorrow\\" was used in a P&O; TV commercial and on the HBO TV series The Sopranos. \\"New Light of Tomorrow\\" and \\"The Good Man\\" were both used on the second season of One Tree Hill, while \\"Rainbow Flows\\" was featured in Beck's Italian beer commercial. Nyberg scored two Finnish motion pictures; Sixpack (Pussikaljaelokuva) in 2011 and Twisted Roots (V√§√§r√§t Juuret) in 2009, of which a soundtrack album was also released.

Its chancery, designed by Egon Eiermann and opened in 1964, is located in northwest Washington, D.C. As of 2018, the German ambassador to the United States is Emily Haber.https://www.germany.info/us-en/embassy-consulates/embassy- washington/-/2108358  History =Early period Germany and the United States first established diplomatic relations in 1871, the year of the establishment of the German Empire. Theodore Roosevelt and aide de camp Col. Bingham depart the chancery of the German embassy in the presidential state coach following a return visit to Prince Henry of Prussia in 1902. In 1894 the German embassy occupied a new chancery at 1435 Massachusetts Avenue. That building, constructed in 1873 as a private residence on a design by Adolf Cluss, was subsequently expanded to include 70 rooms, and would be occupied by Germany ‚Äì with wartime interruptions ‚Äì for nearly 50 years. The opening of the embassy was marked by a formal ball attended by 500 members of the Washington diplomatic corps, along with several members of the United States Congress and Chief Justice of the United States Melville Fuller. Music was provided by a detachment of the United States Marine Band. In this early period the embassy also hosted the return visit of President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt to Prince Henry of Prussia during the prince's official visit to the United States in 1902. During the years prior to American entry into World War I, Franz von Papen was posted at the embassy as a military attache, though was ultimately declared persona non grata by the U.S. government as a result of suspected espionage. In February 1917 the United States terminated diplomatic relations with Germany. Staff of the embassy were returned their passports by the U.S. government and departed for Germany shortly thereafter. Following the conclusion of World War I, in 1921, Germany reestablished diplomatic relations with the United States and the German embassy reoccupied its former chancery. The Massachusetts Avenue chancery of the German embassy pictured in the early 20th century. In the spring of 1938 the German government approved plans for construction of a new chancery. Construction, however, was ultimately sidetracked by the war in Europe. 1941 San Francisco incident A serious diplomatic incident occurred in January 1941 when U.S. Navy sailors Edward Lackey and Harold Sturtevant, both on leave from the psychiatric ward of the Navy's Mare Island Hospital where they had been treated for sleep walking, scaled a fire escape, tore down the flag from the German consulate in San Francisco and destroyed it. According to the sailors, they were unaware the building at which the flag was being flown was the German consulate. In his memoirs, consul Fritz Wiedemann, who witnessed the incident, recalled it as \\"both surreal and comical\\". The United States government issued an apology to Germany. The two sailors were briefly jailed and dismissed from military service, though following the onset of war with Germany they were pardoned and allowed to reenlist. World War II Ambassador Hans-Heinrich Dieckhoff is photographed by journalists leaving a meeting at the U.S. State Department in 1938. On December 12, 1941 ‚Äì following Germany's declaration of war against the United States ‚Äì Switzerland assumed the role of protecting power of Germany in the United States and took custody of the chancery of the German embassy; staff were, meanwhile, interned at the Greenbrier until an exchange of diplomats was arranged the following year. During World War II, Switzerland used parts of the chancery to house its own staff, thereby alleviating a housing shortage for Swiss diplomatic personnel in the United States. Following the German military surrender in May 1945, Switzerland acknowledged the extinction of the German state and declared itself absolved of protecting responsibilities. The chancery of the embassy was surrendered by Switzerland to the United States government as trustee of the Allied Control Council that month. Upon receiving custody of the building, the United States government removed all documents and files that had been left behind by the German delegation and held them until 1950, at which point they were given to the then newly established West German government. Post-War J√ºrgen Chrobog was German ambassador to the United States in the early 2000s. The furnishings of the former German chancery were sold at auction by the U.S. government in 1948, fetching slightly less than $50,000. The chancery was auctioned by the U.S. government in 1951. Morris Cafritz was the high bidder, however, the government subsequently rejected his bid as too low. It was thereafter sold by the U.S. government to James S. Kerwin for $165,000. United States Senator William Langer opposed the sale, saying the site should be held in trust by the U.S. government for the future use of Germany. Four years later, the property was razed and turned into a parking garage. In 1955 the United States established diplomatic relations with West Germany. The United States awarded the Federal Republic of Germany $300,000 from the earlier sale of the chancery and its furnishings, and a new chancery was occupied in Foxhall that year. The facility was constructed in a modern style and featured modern interior decor as, according to German diplomats at the time, the country \\"has no antiques now\\". East German representation The German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the United States began full diplomatic relations in 1974. The GDR maintained an embassy on Massachusetts Avenue near Dupont Circle in a leased property. In 1990 the facility was abandoned mid-lease on the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the GDR and, though the FRG agreed to assume all debts and obligations of the former East Germany, an attorney for the landlord would later write that \\"without disclosing any confidences, I can say that our client did not necessarily find the Federal Republic and its embassy entirely consistent in its public and private positions\\". Facilities The entrance of the German chancery pictured in 2014. Chancery West Germany, along with Denmark and Switzerland, was a trailblazer in the use of modern architecture for diplomatic facilities in Washington. In 1964 it opened its new and current chancery, designed by Egon Eiermann. The building's design evoked the Bauhaus school and \\"was meant as a disavowal\\" of the Nazi architecture of Albert Speer. The chancery building and consular building underwent a $46.5 million renovation that was completed in 2014. *Renovation of the German Embassy in Washington: Client: Federal Republic of Germany represented by the BBR, Bonn, ¬© HPP Hentrich-Petschnigg & Partner GmbH + Co.

Ungers, who aimed to \\"find an architectonic expression for the residence of the German ambassador that would be associative of the characteristics\\" of Germany. The Washington Post has called the residence \\"one of the most conspicuous diplomatic pads in town\\" and, in 2015, described it as \\"a Bauhaus-inspired take on classical Washington\\" that did not appear dated, even more than two decades after it was built. The residence, pictured in 2008. The entrance hall contains two paintings by Gerhard Merz as well as a series of woodcuts on canvas by Markus L√ºpertz. The dining room contains paintings by Bernard Schultze and a red lacquered partition/folding screen by Simon Ungers. The ladies' sitting room has an olive green- and brown-colored carpet by Rosemarie Trockel, while the gentlemen's sitting room contains paintings by Christa N√§her of the four classical elements.  Consulates  Germany maintains consulates general in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, and San Francisco. There are honorary consuls in more than a dozen U.S. cities.

Russian Tsardom and Empire  Territorial development of the Muscovy between 1390 and 1533 The name Russia for the Grand Duchy of Moscow started to appear in the late 15th century and had become common in 1547 when the Tsardom of Russia was created. For the history of Rus' and Moscovy before 1547 (see Kievan Rus' and Grand Duchy of Moscow). Another important starting point was the official end in 1480 of the overlordship of the Tatar Golden Horde over Moscovy, after its defeat in the Great standing on the Ugra river. Ivan III (reigned 1462‚Äì1505) and Vasili III (reigned 1505‚Äì1533) had already expanded Muscovy's (1283‚Äì1547) borders considerably by annexing the Novgorod Republic (1478), the Grand Duchy of Tver in 1485, the Pskov Republic in 1510, the Appanage of Volokolamsk in 1513, and the principalities of Ryazan in 1521 and Novgorod-Seversky in 1522.Allen F. Chew, An Atlas of Russian History: Eleven Centuries of Changing Borders (2nd ed. 1967). pp 14‚Äì43. After a period of political instability, 1598 to 1613 the Romanovs came to power (1613) and the expansion-colonization process of the Tsardom continued. While western Europe colonized the New World, the Tsardom of Russia expanded overland ‚Äì principally to the east, north and south. This continued for centuries; by the end of the 19th century, the Russian Empire reached from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and for some time included colonies in the Americas (1732‚Äì1867) and a short-lived unofficial colony in Africa (1889) in present-day Djibouti.John Channon, The Penguin historical atlas of Russia (1995) pp 8‚Äì12, 44‚Äì75. Expansion into Asia The first stage from 1582 1650 so I North-East expansion from the Urals to the Pacific. Geographical expeditions mapped much of Siberia. The second stage from 1785 to 1830 looked South to the areas between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The key areas were Armenia and Georgia, with some better penetration of the Ottoman Empire, and Persia. By 1829, Russia controlled all of the Caucasus as shown in the Treaty of Adrianople of 1829. The third era, 1850 to 1860, was a brief interlude jumping to the East Coast, annexing the region from the Amur River to Manchuria. The fourth era, 1865 to 1885 Incorporated Turkestan, and the northern approaches to India, sparking British fears of a threat to India in The Great Game.Brian Catchpole, A map history of Russia (1983) pp 6‚Äì31.Allen F.

Russia proper became the Russian SFSR (1917‚Äì1991) and eventually the Russian Federation (1991‚Äìpresent). Its area of effective direct control varied greatly during the Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì1922. Eventually most of the former Eurasian lands of the Russian Empire were consolidated into one or more of each of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union (1922‚Äì1991).

The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria was an unrecognized secessionist government of the Chechen Republic during 1991‚Äì2000, which fought two wars against Russia until the government was exiled in 2000. The Russian Federation has been involved in territorial disputes with several its neighbours, including with Japan over the Kuril Islands, with Latvia over the Pytalovsky Raion (settled in 1997), with China over parts of Tarabarov Island and Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island (settled in 2001), with its coastal neighbours over Caspian Sea boundaries, and with Estonia over the adjoining border. The RF also had disputes with Ukraine over the status of the federal city of Sevastopol, but agreed it belonged to Ukraine in the 1997 Russian‚ÄìUkrainian Friendship Treaty, and over the uninhabited Tuzla Island, but gave up this claim in the 2003 Treaty on the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait. In 2014, when months of demonstrations in Kyiv forced pro-Russian Ukrainian president Yanukovych to flee his post, Russian troops occupied Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, and after a hasty referendum the Kremlin announced that it had enlarged itself by the annexation of the Crimean republic and Sevastopol. The annexation was not recognized by Ukraine or most other members of the international community. The Russian Federation has also used its armed forces, illegal armed formations, and material support to deny neighbouring states their sovereignty over Transnistria in Moldova, part of the Donbas region of Ukraine, and Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia.

It is the largest provider of VCE, VET and VCAL in the state of Victoria. Bendigo has four government-funded Year 7 to 10 secondary schools: Eaglehawk Secondary College, Bendigo South East College, Crusoe College and Weeroona College Bendigo. Students from these schools transition to BSSC for their final two years of schooling in Years 11 and 12.  History  Administration building of Bendigo Senior Secondary College The Bendigo Continuation School opened on 27 April 1907, with the aim of preparing students for entry into the public service, teacher training, university or other education. In 1912, the school was renamed as Bendigo High School. The school incorporated nearby buildings such as the Sandhurst Corporate High School (later St Andrew's College) and eventually the James King Hall and administration block were built in 1930. The former Bendigo Supreme Court was used to serve as the music rooms when it was obtained in 1959, after the relocation of Bendigo Girls' High School. Other additions include the Alexander Wing (1967) and the Commonwealth Library (1977). The last year Bendigo High School provided the full range of secondary school courses from Years 7 to 12 was in 1975. In 1976, the school became Victoria's first senior high school providing courses in only Year 11 and Year 12. The school phased in this change with the removal of the lower years which was complete in 1979. In 1984, the school was renamed as Bendigo Senior High School. In 1990, the school was renamed as Bendigo Senior Secondary College. In 1991, a building program saw the construction of new buildings, with an overall upgrade all of the facilities starting from 1995. The site is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.  Notable achievements and projects  In 2001, Bendigo Senior Secondary College was the first government school in the world to be accredited with the Council of International Schools. In 2011 BSSC was bench- marked again and welcomed international scrutiny. NETschool is an extension of BSSC and offers VCE, VCAL and VET. It provides curriculum access for 15 - 18 year old students who have been outside mainstream schooling or training. BSSC also runs an online program which they deliver the college program through. It was setup to help students in other schools in Victoria. This program is expected to continue to expand in the future.

Beregis Avtomobilya, US titles Uncommon Thief, or Watch out for the Automobile) is a Soviet 1966 crime comedy-drama film directed by Eldar Ryazanov, based on a screenplay by Emil Braginsky and produced by the Mosfilm. The film stars renowned Soviet actors Innokenty Smoktunovsky, Oleg Yefremov, Anatoli Papanov, Andrei Mironov, Georgiy Zhzhonov, among others. Beregis' Avtomobilya is recognized for its noir genre satire as uncommon part of the Brezhnevist society. It is credited to have given Ryazanov a start in depicting Soviet political structure satire as a class of comedy cult films.  Plot summary  The movie plot evolves around Yuriy Detochkin (Smoktunovsky), a humble Soviet insurance agent suffering from a minor mental disorder.(the name hints to his childishness) Detochkin applies great resourcefullness and exceptional driving skill to stealing cars from corrupt Soviet officials in a Robin Hood way, disappointed by the Militsiya (Soviet police) being unable to fight them efficiently. One of the Detochkin's un-innocent victims is Dima Semitsvetov (Mironov), a retail embezzler hilariously trolled, but still tolerated by his colourful father-in-law Sokol- Kruzhkin (Papanov), a retired Soviet Army officer. Detochkin sells the stolen cars and anonymously transfers the money to the accounts of various orphanages. Detective Maxim Podberyozovikov (Yefremov) investigates his crimes and tries to prosecute him, but faces a serious moral problem in doing that, partly because the suspect appears to be his amateur theater mate and friend. Cast * Innokenty Smoktunovsky as Yuriy Detochkin, former taxi driver, now an insurance agent and a fighter for justice * Oleg Yefremov as Maxim Podberezovikov, detective, working on Detochkin's Cause * Lyubov Dobrzhanskaya as Detochkin's mother * Olga Aroseva as Lyuba, a trolley-bus driver, Detochkin's bride * Andrei Mironov as Dima Semitsvetov * Anatoli Papanov as Sokol-Kruzhkin, father-in-law of Dima Semitsvetov * Tatyana Gavrilova as Inna, wife of Dima Semitsvetov * Georgiy Zhzhonov as a patrol policeman * Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev as an acting coach * Donatas Banionis as a priest, buyer of Detochkin's Volga car * Lyubov Sokolova as a judge * Vyacheslav Nevinny as a car mechanic * Gotlib Roninson as Yakov Mihailovich, Senior Insurance Agent, Detochkin's boss * Galina Volchek as a customer * Sergey Kulagin as Philippe Cartuzov, a pub manager * Yakov Lents as Tobacconist's shop salesman * Nikolay Parfyonov as a prosecutor * Victoria Radunskaya as Tanya, criminalist * Boris Runge as a man with suitcases Voice cast * Author's narration read by Yury Yakovlev  Interesting facts  Beware of the Car sign was common for Soviet cities * In the film, Detochkin and Podberezovikov act together in an amateur theater which rehearses Hamlet. This is a play from Innokenty Smoktunovsky's real-life acting career: he was reputed as the \\"best Hamlet on the Soviet stage\\" and starred in a Hamlet film adaptation. * The waltzWaltz - instrumental - MP3 - 3,7 MB - 128 Kbps at Cinema music (1938 - 1985) website performed in the film is a distinguished melody composed by Andrei Petrov. Sergey Nikitin's repertoire includes a song named Glassy Gentleman (lyrics by Evgeny Evtushenko), which used a waltz from the film. * All cars stolen by Detochkin are \\"Volga\\"s - the most prestigious Soviet car model of the time. The fact that \\"Volga\\" was the standard personal car for Soviet elite is the intentional satire element of the film which Eldar Ryazanov found very hard to get approved. * American cars can be spotted in the petrol station scene: a 1955 Buick and a 1955 Oldsmobile. This would have been an extremely rare sighting since the United States had sanctions with the USSR and did not sell cars within the Eastern Bloc.  Famous quotes  Many quotes from the film became catch phrases and are still used today: \\"Isn't it time to blow at William, at our Shakespeare?\\", \\"Here is Grundig tape recorder. Four tracks, stereophonic, elegant design...\\", \\"Free Yuriy Detochkin!\\" and many other (see Wikiquote). Awards The film was the leader of Soviet film distribution for 1966 watched by 29 million people (11 place). Innokenty Smoktunovsky was recognized as the Best Actor of 1966.

The embassy is located at Belgrave Square, in Belgravia. It occupies three of the original terraced houses in Belgrave Square and a late 20th-century extension.  History  The German Embassy, c. 1930 The Prussian Consul-General was housed at 9 Carlton House Terrace in the so-called Prussia House. After World War II Prussia House was requisitioned as enemy property and the Federal Republic of Germany moved its consulate and diplomatic operations to Belgrave Square, still operating as a consulate general. The consulate became a fully functional embassy in June 1951, the FRG leasing the building for 99 years in 1953. In the 1970s, office space in the embassy was tight so an extension was erected at Chesham Place, inaugurated in 1978. It won the Westminster City Council prize for architecture. In 1990, after German reunification, the East German embassy building at 34 Belgrave Square became part of the German embassy.

His doctorate was granted in 1927 from Vienna University, having earlier studied under Richard Robert. He conducted freelance throughout the decade of the 1920s. He was a critic for Berlin newspapers from 1927 to 1933 and taught theory and appreciation courses in Vienna from 1934 to 1938. He emigrated to the US in 1940, teaching at Wellesley College until 1942, when he took a job as a machinist in the war effort. From 1946 to 1948 he taught theory at The New School in New York, and joined the faculty at St. John's College, Annapolis in 1948. He remained at St. John's, teaching music as part of their Great Books program, until his retirement in 1964. His explanations of music theory were heavily indebted to the theories of musicologist Heinrich Schenker, and his understandings of musical perception owed much to Gestalt psychology, as well as German phenomenology. Zuckerkandl believed music was part of the \\"mystical aspect of human existence\\", and sought to explain its existence in all cultures as a universal phenomenon. He was not well known until scholars rediscovered his works in the 1990s.

Life Jordan was born in New York City on March 6, 1864. He graduated from the City College of New York and began his literary career as editor of Book Chat in 1884. He joined Current Literature in 1888 and became its managing editor. In 1891 he left Current Literature and moved to Chicago where he started a lecture program on his system of Mental Training. He returned to Current Literature in January 1894 as its managing editor and then resigned again in August 1896. In 1897 he was hired as the managing editor for The Ladies Home Journal, after which he edited The Saturday Evening Post (1888‚Äì89). From 1899 to 1905 he was the editor and vice- president of Continental Publishing Company. He was the editor of the publication Search-Light between 1905 and 1906. On July 26 of 1891, the Chicago Inter-Ocean published an interview with Mr. Jordan where he discussed his thoughts about education and \\"Mental Training\\". After the article was published he received so many requests for information that he scheduled a trip back in October to lecture on the subject. The Inter-Ocean in a September 24 article reported that: > During the past few weeks the calls from Chicago have been so numerous, > enthusiastic and positive for lecture courses and private society classes > that he has concluded to resign his position in New York and come to > Chicago. He remained in Chicago for two years and then returned to Current Literature in 1894. In 1894 he published a short 20-page pamphlet entitled Mental Training, a Remedy for Education (this was republished again in 1907), that summarized his lectures. The opening paragraph starts as follows: > There are two great things that education should do for the individual‚ÄîIt > should train his senses, and teach him to think. Education, as we know it > to-day, does not truly do either; it gives the individual only a vast > accumulation of facts, unclassified, undigested, and seen in no true > relations. Like seeds kept in a box, they may be retained, but they do not > grow. This style of speaking plainly about a principle and then drawing mind- pictures using analogies is a style that he utilized broadly in all his writings. It is style well suited to the general subject of self-improvement that was the focus of most of his publications. After he returned to New York, The Literary Review said the following: > Though Mr. Jordan has won a fine reputation as an editor he is one of the > youngest of the magazine editors in this city. He has delivered many > lectures on mental training in New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and other > cities, and his system has been received with great favor in all of these. > During the last year he has brought Current Literature to a place of really > notable excellence by the keen watchfulness which he keeps over the literary > work that is being done both in this country and in England, by his catholic > taste, and by his swift judgment. Besides being a first-rate editor and > lecturer he is an admirable writer, as his vigorous editorials prove. Thus > far nearly all of his contributions to the magazine have been unsigned, and > his forthcoming book, it is thought, will establish his reputation as an > author with a distinct and forcible style as well as of strong and original > thought. He published his first book, The Kingship of Self-Control, in 1898 and his last in 1926, two years before his death. In 1907 he published a pamphlet entitled The House of Governors; A New Idea in American Politics Aiming to Promote Uniform Legislation on Vital Questions, to Conserve States Rights, to Lessen Centralization, to Secure a Fuller, Freer Voice of the People, and to Make a Stronger Nation. This work was circulated to each state governor, US President Theodore Roosevelt and members of his cabinet. The concept was well received, and the first meeting of the governors was held in Washington January 18 through 20, 1910. Jordan was elected secretary of this body at the first meeting and then dropped as secretary in September 1911. Nevertheless, the group became part of his legacy, and his part in its formation was often cited in later references to him by the press. Jordan was married to Nellie Blanche Mitchell on May 6, 1922, in New York City at the Grace Episcopal Church. He died of pneumonia in New York City on 20 April 1928 at his home.  Works  Jordan wrote a number of personal improvement and self-help books in the early 1900s, one of the most popular being The Majesty of Calmness. His other works include: *Mental Training, 1894 *The Kingship of Self-Control, 1898 *The Majesty of Calmness, 1900 *The Power of Truth, 1902 *Self-Control, Its Kingship and Majesty, 1905, The Kingship of Self-Control and The Majesty of Calmness published as a single book. *The House of Governors, 1907 *The Crown of Individuality, 1909 *The Power of Purpose, 1910, subset of The Crown of Individuality. *Little Problems of Married Life, 1910 *Five National Platforms: Dissected, Classified and Indexed, 1912 *What Every American Should Know, A Voters Handbook of the Presidential Campaign ‚Ä¶, 1916 *Feodor Vladimir Larrovitch: An Appreciation of His Life and Works, 1918 *What Every American Should Know About the League of Nations, 1919 *One Hundred Years of Fire Insurance, 1919 ‚Äî co-authored with Henry R.

Grant had come across the book while in England sometime between 1903 and 1906. He purchased more than four thousand copies from the English publisher and before leaving England ordered another thousand. He also distributed more than seven thousand copies of just the first chapter. In a letter to Jordan dated October 5, 1907, Grant said: \\"I know of no book of the same size, that has made a more profound impression upon my mind, and whose teachings I consider of greater value.\\"BYU Studies, vol. 43, no. 1 (2004).

It covers an area of approximately 1,167 acres and contains 220 houses. The River Ash flows through the north of the parish. Widford had a population of 534 people in the 2011 census.  History  The name Widford comes from the old English word 'wid' meaning willow tree and the word 'ford' The Widford commons were extensive and were enclosed under an award of 1856. There was a wood called Lily Wood to the west of the village which was cut down in the late 19th century. Between 1870 and 1872, John Marius Wilson described Widford as: \\"a parish, with a village, in Ware district, Herts; near the Buntingford railway, 4 miles E by N of Ware. It has a post-office under Ware, and a r. station.\\"  Demography and employment left The population of Widford was first recorded in 1801 at 361. The population peaked in 1841 at 539. In the most recent census in 2011 the population was measured as 534. leftThe data included in the graph shows that in 1881 there was one sector of employment that was significantly more popular than any others. This sector was the agriculture sector which had a total of 81 people working in.  Buildings and landmarks  Widford School is a combination of a primary school and a pre-School. There are approximately 60 pupils with a capacity for a maximum of 8 children per year group. Widford School has been open since 1875. The Village Hall, on Bell Lane at the south of the civil parish, provides for local individuals and organisations. It was built in 1910 by George S Pawle. The primary use of the hall at inception was as a drill hall for the Hertfordshire Regiment TA; it was then used by a Regiment from Staffordshire. It was for village activities and events before it was bought in 1956, after volunteers raised money to buy the building and renovate it. These volunteers then cared and maintained the hall. A new kitchen was added in 2009. The hall has two main rooms: a function room and a smaller room. The function room has a removable stage and has capacity for 100 people. The smaller room is more of a committee room with capacity for 30 people. The Widford pub is The Green Man. A local campaign helped keep the pub open after a possible closure. There is a disused single-platformed railway station in Widford. The station was used between 1873 and 1963 as part of the Ware to Buntingford Branch Line. Construction of the railway began in 1859, and four years later the line was complete and nearly fourteen miles long. A coal and garden product distribution centre uses the site. The railway line is used by walkers and cyclists. Widford allotments hold more than 20 plots; these were created in 1978 after the land was purchased by Widford Parish Council.  Church  The parish church is St John the Baptist. The oldest parts of the church date to the early 13th century, with further work in the late 13th and 14th. The church registers, at Hertfordshire County Record Office, date from 1558. The church graveyard was closed for burials in 1903 when a new graveyard on the other side of Ware Road became available. The Church is supported by an independent, non-religious charity called The Friends of Widford Church. The purpose of the charity is to support the parochial church council and to care for the management and maintenance of the church.  Sport and recreation = Playing field  Widford Playing Field includes a children's play area, a football pitch and a cricket strip. The playing field has green areas of planted trees and hedges. The development of the playing field came after Askey's Field was bought in 1979 by volunteers from the Village Hall Community who raised the money for purchase.  Cricket Club  The ground of Ware Cricket Club is one of the few privately owned cricket grounds in the country. The club has two teams that compete in the Saracens Hertfordshire Premier Cricket League.  Notable people  * John Eliot was born in Widford. He was a Puritan missionary to the American Indians He developed an interest in Indian language and translated the Bible into Algonkian which is an American Indian, Algonquian language. * Arthur Percival who lived in Widford following the end of the Second World War, he was a British Army officer who is best known for his involvement in the Second World War.

Exterior view of the German Embassy Canberra in the late 1950s German Embassy Canberra in 1980  History of diplomatic relations  Germany and Australia celebrated the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic relations on 28 January 2012. The two countries can look back on a successful shared history. During years past, they have been able to intensify and deepen their relationship in various ways. In 1879, the consulate-general in Sydney was opened under the command of imperial minister and foreign minister Otto von Bismarck.Weihrauch, Philipp. Die Geschichte des Generalkonsulats Sydney, published 13 June 2013, p. 1. The first consul back then was Dr Richard Krauel. After the outbreak of World War I, diplomatic relations ended and the consulate-general in Sydney was closed. On 24 March 1924 however, it reopened in Melbourne and four years later on 1 October 1928 the consulate moved back to Sydney. Due to the beginning of World War II, the consulate-general was again closed in 1939.Weihrauch, Philipp. Die Geschichte des Generalkonsulats Sydney, published 13 June 2013, p. 2. After years without any sign of communication, diplomatic relations were resumed in 1952. After World War II, Dr Walther Hess, West-Germany‚Äôs first ambassador, had to face a very controversial reception in Sydney, his arrival attended by protests and demonstrations. However, he succeeded in redefining German- Australian relations.The Sunday Morning Herald of 22 June 1952, p. 3. It took quite a while until a suitable chancery was found, which is why the German Embassy conducted its business in Sydney. It was not until 1955 that the Embassy moved to Australia‚Äôs capital, Canberra. A consulate-general was founded in Sydney. On 22 December 1972, the German Democratic Republic began diplomatic relations with the accreditation of Ambassador Hans Richter, but these ended on 3 October 1990 when the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, a few GDR diplomats remained at the German Embassy in Canberra until 1992 to conclude administrative matters. On 28 January 2013, Germany‚Äôs Foreign Minister Westerwelle and Australia‚Äôs Foreign Minister Carr signed the Berlin-Canberra Declaration of Intent, confirming a strategic partnership on the occasion of the 61st anniversary of German-Australian relations.http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Aktuelle_Artikel/Australien/130128-BM- Carr.html This declaration of intent includes sections such as foreign policy, security policy, industry and trade, science and research, energy and climate protection as well as development cooperation. Germany and Australia are planning on working together even more closely in the future. In 2015 Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the creation of an Australian-German Advisory Group.http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2015/04/2015-04-08-deutsch- australische-beratergruppe.html Chaired by Prof. Dr. Anne B√∂hmer, Minister of State in the German Foreign Office, and Mathias Cormann, Minister for Finance of Australia, the Advisory Group met for the first meeting in Berlin on 10 July 2015.

Heading up the brook from the confluence with the Passaic River, one encounters the borough of Hawthorne, the village of Ridgewood, the borough of Midland Park, and the township of Wyckoff. History Goffle Brook has seen human occupation for hundreds of years, as evidenced by abundant Lenape camp sites along its banks. Two such camps are known to have existed near the brook‚Äôs mouth, while another two existed about one and a half miles upstream on the east bank. A fifth camp, still locally remembered, sat at the confluence of Deep Voll Brook and Goffle Brook.Henry B. Kummel.

See Page 77, Archaeological Survey, Sites in Northern New Jersey. Available via Google Books During the American Revolutionary War, General Lafayette stationed his men along the banks of the brook. In 1780, Major Lee‚Äôs Virginia light horse troop occupied the east bank of the brook, while Lafayette‚Äôs light infantry corps occupied the flanks of First Watchung Mountain to the west. Lafayette‚Äôs headquarters sat on the western bank of the brook in what is now Goffle Brook Park south of Diamond Bridge Ave in Hawthorne.John Austin Stevens, et al.

Travels in North America in the Years 1780, 1781 and 1782. (Published for the Institute of Early American History and Culture at Williamsburg, Va.) University of North Carolina Press, 1963. Prior to the twentieth century, the brook‚Äôs gradation supported saw, grain, and grist mills. It was probably instrumental in initial settlement and farming of the northern Passaic River valley.Norman F. Brydon. The Passaic River: past, present, future. Rutgers University Press, 1974. In addition to it uses as a drinking water supply and an energy source for mills, the brook has served as a focus for human creativity. New Jersey native William Carlos Williams immortalized the brook in his 1949 poem Spring is Here Again, Sir. The poem opens with the line, Goffle brook of a May day blossoms in the manner of antiquity.William Carlos Williams, edited by Christopher John MacGowan. The Collected Poems of William Carlos Williams: 1939-1962. New Directions Publishing, 1988. , See Page 190. Available via Google Books Today, Goffle Brook serves as the centerpiece of Goffle Brook Park and Kings Pond Park, providing fishing and ice skating opportunities to local residents.The Village of Ridgewood Division of Parks, Shade Tree, and School Grounds - Village Parklands Relationship with the NYS&W; Railway The New York, Susquehanna & Western Railway parallels Goffle Brook for the majority of its route through Hawthorne, Ridgewood, Midland Park, and Wyckoff, running roughly along the centerline of the Goffle Brook drainage basin. The railroad crosses the brook only twice, once in Ridgewood and again in Midland Park. Tributaries Traveling north along the brook from its mouth, the first tributary encountered is Janes Brook, in Hawthorne. Much of this small stream, which can be found in the wooded, southern section of Goffle Brook Park, was converted to a buried sewer in the twentieth century, but a tiny portion still remains at the surface where it empties into Goffle Brook. The second tributary encountered along Goffle Brook is Deep Voll Brook or Deep Brook (captioned name used by the USGS in 1995), which joins Goffle Brook just north of Goffle Hill Road at the far northern end of Goffle Brook Park in Hawthorne. Deep Voll Brook, which flows from northwest to southeast, is the most significant tributary of Goffle Brook, draining a sizeable portion of the northeastern corner of First Watchung Mountain in Hawthorne and Wyckoff. Beyond Deep Voll Brook are two smaller streams that join Goffle Brook relatively close to each other. Both of these less significant tributaries appear to be unnamed. After these two tributaries is yet another tiny tributary that drains a small swamp at the head of Kings Pond, a manmade lake in southwest Ridgewood. Continuing north, past the tributary at Kings Pond, Goffle Brook splits into western and eastern branches at Maple Lake, a former manmade swimming hole that was drained in the late 1980s. Of the two branches, the eastern branch is less significant, extending a short distance through Wyckoff before ending just inside the southern limit of Waldwick. The western branch almost completely bisects the town of Wyckoff through the midsection, ending west of Russell Ave at Goffle Pond, the source of Goffle Brook. Dams Seven dams exist along Goffle Brook, although ten existed historically. In Hawthorne, a former dam at the southern end of Goffle Brook Park once held back Mill Pond. A dam just south of Goffle Hill Road now forms Arnold's Pond, often referred to as the Duck Pond. In Ridgewood, a dam just north of Rock Road forms Gypsy Pond, and a bigger dam just a little further upstream holds back Kings Pond. The current fourth and fifth dams exist just to the west of where Goffle Road crosses the brook in Midland Park. A dam that was destroyed during a storm lies just upstream from Sicomac Avenue bridge. This dam was held back the waters to form Morrow Pond which was a swimming hole in Midland Park. North of Canterbury Lane in Wyckoff a dam used to exist which held back Maple Lake, now a wetland in danger of development. Two more dams create large lakes on the north and south sides Wyckoff Ave, again in Wyckoff.

A professional sociologist, Kelus is best known for a number of ballads which gained him a nickname of the Bard of the opposition and Polish Woody Guthrie. After a brief period at the faculty of law, Kelus graduated from the faculty of sociology of the Warsaw University. After the events of March 1968 he became involved in various groups of the democratic opposition to the Communist regime of the People's Republic of Poland. Arrested in 1969 for his involvement in smuggling books published in Paris by Jerzy Giedroyc's Kultura through the Tatra Mountains, he was sentenced to imprisonment in the so-called Tatra Climbers' Trial. Released from the prison after the advent of Edward Gierek's rule, Kelus was involved in the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR) where he organized legal and financial aid to workers and labor activists persecuted by the communist authorities. About that time his songs, passed in bootleg copies outside of the official market and without acceptance of the censorship, became one of the symbols of the opposition. During that time he also translated several songs by Czech artist Karel Kryl. Simultaneously to his anti-communist activities, in the 1970s Kelus was working at the Gynaecological Institute of the Medical University of Warsaw. Dismissed from the job due to his political activity in 1979, Kelus continued his involvement in the opposition. In early 1980s he was among the founders of the Niezale≈ºna Oficyna Wydawnicza CDN, the largest underground printing house of that time. Arrested in 1981 after the imposition of the Martial Law in Poland, Kelus was interned in Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, along with other notable leaders of the Solidarity. During that time JKK's songs were performed by numerous artists, among them Jacek Kaczmarski and Antonina Krzyszto≈Ñ. After the peaceful transition of power in Poland in 1989, Kelus withdrew from public life to a house near Bia≈Çowie≈ºa, where he owns a small beekeeping farm.

He served as Minister for Health (1924‚Äì1925) and Minister for Trade and Customs (1924‚Äì1928) in the Bruce‚ÄìPage Government. He became a Senator for New South Wales in 1917, but resigned in 1921 to seek election to the House of Representatives where he served until his death in 1928. Early life Pratten was born on 7 May 1865 in Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire, England. He was the son of Ann Rebecca (n√©e Vowles) and Herbert Graham Pratten; his mother died in 1870. Pratten was educated at the Merchant Venturers' Technical College and the Bristol Trade and Mining School. At the age of 15, he joined the iron and steel company John Lysaght and Co., based in Bristol. He was sent to Sydney in 1884 to become a clerk at the firm's new Australian branch, working under William Sandford at Five Dock. Business career In about 1888, Pratten established a soft drink company in Ashfield. In 1889, he established a printing firm and arranged for his half-brother Frederick to come out from England. Their company Pratten Bros. became \\"one of the largest of its kind in Australia\\". In 1895, he also acquired Taylor Bros., a jam manufacturer which had been indebted to him. He sold the company a few years before World War I at a substantial profit. Pratten was also a director of the Stanmore Preserving Company, which exported fruit pulp to Europe using newly developed cold-storage techniques. In 1911, he established the Hargraves Consolidated Goldmining Company to take advantage of a government subsidy. He later co-founded the Austral-Malay Tin Mining Company with Ambrose Freeman, which in 1926 was consolidated into Larut Tin Fields Limited. Pratten visited Asia for business reasons on several occasions. He wrote a series of articles for The Daily Telegraph about his 1906 trip to the Philippines, Japan, China, Malaya, Singapore, and India, which in 1908 he published in book form as Asiatic Impressions. He dedicated the book to \\"all Australians who realise the many racial dangers that the future may have in store for our beautiful land\\". His second book Through Orient to Occident (1912) recounted a journey to South-East Asia and China and his experience on the Trans-Siberian Railway. Pratten believed that the economic growth of Asia was both a threat and an opportunity for Australia. He recommended that the federal government place trade commissions in Calcutta and Shanghai. Public life Pratten served on the Ashfield Municipal Council from 1905 to 1912, including as mayor from 1909 to 1911. Pratten Park was named in his honour when it opened in 1912. Pratten was also president of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures from 1912 to 1914. Politics Pratten during his time in the Senate Pratten first stood for federal parliament at the 1910 election, running unsuccessfully as an independent in the Division of Parkes. He was a Liberal candidate for the Senate at the 1914 election, but was defeated. In 1917, Pratten was elected to the Senate as a Nationalist. He spoke on a variety of topics but was particularly interested in economic matters. He argued for more private-sector experience in the Defence Department, opposed financing budget deficits with overseas loans, and argued against the creation of a department akin to the United States Department of Commerce, which he believed was too powerful. Pratten was also interested in reforming parliamentary procedure, suggesting that public servants should be directly questioned by parliament and supporting Josiah Thomas's unsuccessful motion to force ministers in each chamber of parliament to appear in the other chamber to answer questions. Pratten was elected deputy president of the New South Wales National Association in 1920. In November 1921, he resigned from the Senate to contest the 1921 Parramatta by-election, caused by Sir Joseph Cook's resignation. 1922 election and coalition formation Pratten in 1923 After a redistribution Pratten transferred to the new Division of Martin at the 1922 election. The election resulted in a hung parliament with the Country Party holding the balance of power. Pratten played a key role in negotiating a coalition, which saw Stanley Bruce replace Billy Hughes as prime minister and Country Party leader Earle Page become deputy prime minister. For a brief period in January 1923, it was rumoured that he himself would replace Hughes as prime minister, despite having no ministerial experience. Sydney's Evening News definitively reported that either he or Earle Page would lead the next government. In response, he issued a statement to the press stating that he was surprised by the reports and that no overtures had been made to him. The following week, Melbourne's Herald reported that Pratten would likely become deputy prime minister in a government led by Page, while The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Bruce would become prime minister and Pratten would be his deputy. Government minister Caricature of Pratten published in 1928 It had been expected that Pratten would take the trade and customs portfolio in the Bruce‚ÄìPage Ministry, but he was unexpectedly omitted. The Age reported that he had been \\"accepted by every member in the House as a certainty in whatever Cabinet might be constituted\\". Pratten was eventually elevated to cabinet in June 1924, following Austin Chapman's resignation. He was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs and Minister for Health; he relinquished the latter portfolio to Neville Howse in January 1925. As trade minister, Pratten was considered a strong protectionist, believing Australia needed a high- tariff policy in order to protect its local industry from currency depreciation and dumping. However, he also supported Imperial Preference. He introduced legislation to establish the Tariff Board on a permanent basis, and introduced major amendments to the Customs Tariff Act ‚Äì in 1925 to increase duties on imported textiles and in 1926 to increase duties on imported iron and steel. Personal life Pratten married Agnes Wright, the daughter of a business partner, on 29 May 1891. The couple had two sons and three daughters together, including Herbert Graham Pratten who played first-class cricket for New South Wales. Pratten died in May 1928 on his 63rd birthday, suffering a cerebral haemorrhage while addressing a Nationalist women's meeting in Turramurra. He was succeeded in federal parliament by his nephew Frederick Graham Pratten, who won the 1928 Martin by-election.

Hunter Jackson also returns in \\"The Private Pain of Techno Destructo\\", and there is a ballad entitled \\"Sammy\\" about the rotting corpse of Sammy Davis Jr.. \\"In Her Fear\\" is Oderus's swan song, and Beefcake the Mighty gives a memorable song in \\"Hate Love Songs\\" - Casey Orr's last song as a lead vocalist with the band until his return on Lust in Space. Carnival of Chaos is the last Gwar album to feature Peter Lee as Flattus Maximus; due to recurring stomach problems stemming from a gunshot wound sustained in a carjacking four years prior, he left the band shortly after the 1997 Halloween Tour. \\"Don't Need A Man\\" was not originally meant to be a Gwar song. It was supposed to be just Danielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) singing and Michael Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) on piano. It ended up featuring Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha), Derks (sequencing the upright bass part, the piano and the guitar) and Stampe. Derks produced the track, but received no credit. Additionally, Derks wrote \\"Hate Love Songs,\\" and was initially going to sing the lead, but opted instead to have Orr (Beefcake) do it. He is still heard in the background. Approximately nine minutes after \\"Don't Need A Man\\" is a clip of \\"Drop Drawers.\\" This was supposed to appear on the album, along with a complete version of \\"The Private Pain of Techno Destructo.\\" The latter had to be changed, due to Paramount's refusal to give permission to use music from the 1967 Star Trek episode, \\"Amok Time\\" (there is a \\"Slave Pit Single, released after this album, that features it). The former, which included a cover of Billy Thorpe's \\"Children of the Sun,\\" had to be cut, save for a short clip at the end. \\"Drop Drawers\\" can be found on Slaves Going Single, an extremely rare B-sides collection released between We Kill Everything and Violence Has Arrived on Slave Pit Records. The latter can be heard, minus the unlicensed cover, on the album (just after Techno sings \\"You'll just make me...\\"), and the full song (except for a slight cut-off of Techno at the end) on the Rawgwar Slave Pit Single. \\"Sammy\\" is the longest song on this album, despite \\"Don't Need A Man\\"'s 12:40 track length (most of it is silence; the actual song is a little less than 4:30 long). Clocking in at 6:57, it and the title track from their 1999 follow-up, We Kill Everything, were the longest songs by the band until the song \\"War on GWAR\\" (7:21) was released on 2017's The Blood of Gods. Songs from Carnival have not been in the band's setlists for a number of years except for the group occasionally playing \\"Penguin Attack\\" and \\"Back to Iraq\\". Unlike We Kill Everything, where the band readily admits their dissatisfaction for the content (explaining the absence of songs from that album), they have yet to give a definitive reason why. The songs \\"Pre-Skool Prostitute\\" and \\"Hate Love Songs\\" were part of Gwar's 2013 Madness At The Core Of Time Tour setlist.

In the period from 1984‚Äì1988 she and fellow- environmentalists such as David Bellamy, Lily Venizelos, G√ºnther Peter, Nergis Yazgan and Keith Corbett launched a successful campaign to preserve ƒ∞ztuzu Beach as a habitat for the endangered loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). This beach is one of the main nesting places of the species in Turkey and the Mediterranean. Background June Haimoff was born in Essex as Joan Christine Fairey, daughter of Christopher and Madeleine Fairey. As her father was a prominent petroleum engineer, the family often lived abroad (a.o. in Uganda and Iran). In her adult life, she pursued the ambition of becoming an opera singer and did her studies in music, dancing and ballet. When married with Charles Haimoff, she was seriously engaged in painting and had her own art gallery in Gstaad, Switzerland. Conservation campaign She visited southwestern Turkey for the first time in July 1975, when the region was still outside the usual tracks of international tourism, by means of a boat (Bouboulina) purchased in Greece. Between 1975 and 1981 she occasionally stopped at ƒ∞ztuzu Beach and Dalyan on her boat trips and was therefore called \\"Kaptan June\\" (Captain June) by the locals. In 1984 she settled in Dalyan in her own baraka (beach hut) on ƒ∞ztuzu Beach. When it became clear that there were plans to exploit the beach for mass tourism, she started a campaign to preserve ƒ∞ztuzu Beach as a breeding habitat for the loggerhead turtle, which is on the IUCN Red List. In April 1987 building started on an 1800-bed hotel complex by the name of Kaunos Beach Hotel. This caused a storm of protests world-wide. There were protests from the IUCN, Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoologische Gesellschaft Frankfurt. Particularly in the former Federal Republic of Germany the building caused a major uproar, because the German DEG (Deutsche Finanzierungsgesellschaft f√ºr Beteiligungen in Entwicklungsl√§ndern) wanted to use an amount equivalent to 5 million euros from public means under the pretense of development aid. June Haimoff approached the WWF and consequently Prince Philip‚Äîthen President‚Äîasked the Turkish Prime Minister Turgut √ñzal for a moratorium, while awaiting the outcome of an Environmental Impact Assessment. In the meantime the German Federal Government had forbidden DEG to invest development aid money for the building of the Kaunos Beach Hotel.Die Amphibien und Reptilien der S√ºdwest- T√ºrkei , authors: M. Franzen, M. Bu√ümann, Th. Kordges, B. Thiesmeier, Laurenti Verlag, 2008 The project was stopped in September 1987 and in 1988 the Turkish government decided to forbid future building at the beach. The K√∂yceƒüiz-Dalyan region then obtained the status of Special Environmental Protection Area (SEPA). Since then, June Haimoff has dedicated her efforts to assure conservation of the site as well as for attracting international attention to the fate of the turtles \\".Her efforts included writing to the famous British radio writer and broadcaster, and a popular television personality and prominent public figure Daniel Farson, which got a mention in Farson's memoirs \\"Never a normal man\\", published posthumously. p. 408 She herself related the struggle and the victory for the preservation of the turtle species in her book titled \\"Kaptan June and the Turtles\\" published for the first time in 1997. A second edition published in 2002 and titled, this time, \\"Kaptan June and the Dalyan Turtles\\", features a new prologue, two additional chapters, bringing the story up to date, and an index. June Haimoff currently pursues her efforts in a wider frame, and is also concerned with the preservation of the nature in a more general sense with focus on the unique flora and fauna of the K√∂yceƒüiz-Dalyan Special Environmental Protection Area. She is particularly concerned for the protection of the soft-shelled Nile Turtle and the Oriental Sweetgum trees (Liquidambar orientalis), another endemic species proper to the region. Turtle Conservation Foundation In 2009 June Haimoff took an exam to obtain Turkish citizenship to start a foundation to protect the habitat of the loggerhead turtle. The Kaptan June Sea Turtle Conservation Foundation was officially established in February 2011Kaptan June Sea Turtle Foundation gets official go-ahead and has its Information Centre and Museum in Kaptan June's Hut at the minibus side of the beach, overlooking the place where the building of the Kaunos Beach Hotel started in April 1987. Kaptan June Sea Turtle Conservation Foundation website Her work has been recognised by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2011 British New Year's Honors List. June Haimoff still lives in Dalyan in a traditional Turkish house, named \\"The Peaceable Kingdom\\". She lives a very active life, supported by many friends and surrounded by her many dogs and cats.

The train service is operated by Northern Trains, Who usually operate class 142, 150, and 153 units.The line is the northern section of the former Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway; the line from Ormskirk to Liverpool is now part of Merseyrail's Northern Line. Prior to the introduction of the 1970‚Äì71 London Midland Region timetable, it was a secondary main line from Liverpool to Scotland, Blackpool, and Yorkshire. From 4 May 1970, however, the line was severed at Ormskirk. With express trains eliminated, stopping services at the village stations en route were improved, and have retained a similar frequency to this day. Signalling The line is controlled by Preston Power Signal Box (PSB) from where it leaves the West Coast Main Line at Farington Curve Jn by Track Circuit Block signalling regulations until Midge Hall signal box. From here until Rufford signal box, the trains are signalled by Electric Token Block regulations, and from Rufford to Ormskirk the train is signalled by One Train Working with Train Staff regulations. If at any time there is a problem with either the token machine or track circuits showing occupied, then pilotman working must be implemented. History The line remained an important passenger artery into the 1960s, though freight had begun to disappear ‚Äì the goods yards at Croston and Rufford closed around 1964, though that at Ormskirk remained active until 1969. Stopping passenger services were handed over to DMUs from the end of October 1965.http://www.derbysulzers.com/65.html In 1969, the Labour Minister of Transport Richard Marsh refused to agree to British Railways request to withdraw local passenger services between Ormskirk and Preston, and to close the stations at , and . The price for the reprieve of the intermediate stations though, was the line's future as a main line. From October 1969 stopping trains from Blackpool and Preston terminated at Ormskirk, and the last through trains from Liverpool to Preston ran on 3 May 1970. Services to and from East Lancashire via and Blackburn were also withdrawn from 6 October 1969, when the original LO&PR; line via Moss Lane Junction and the curve hence to Todd Lane Junction closed to passenger traffic. All services henceforth ran via Farington Curve Junction and the WCML to reach Preston. The line was then singled with the removal of the old Down Main between Midge Hall and Ormskirk in the summer of 1970, and from Midge Hall to Preston in 1983. Future There have been several proposals to extend the Merseyrail electric service to Preston using this line. This would restore the most direct Liverpool ‚Äì Preston route. The reinstatement of the Burscough Curves has been proposed which would allow services to Southport from Preston and Liverpool via Ormkirk. This could be accompanied by the reopening of Midge Hall station.Networkrail Network Rail Strategic Development Plan for North West Rural 2009‚Äì2014 Preston ‚Äì Ormskirk services were increased to hourly all day in May 2018 (apart from Sundays).

It was published in 1995, after Geisel's death, by Random House of New York. Contents of the book=Visual art The bulk of this collection consists of painting and drawing. It does, however, include photographs of many sculptures created by Geisel. Both forms of art display the characteristic style and form that can be seen in all of his children's books. =Sculpture= All of Dr. Seuss's sculptures display the same themes, which are taxidermy and trophy hunting. Each sculpture takes the form of an imaginary and fantastic creature displayed on a wood mount in the style of a hunting trophy. Most of his pieces in this category make use of authentic animal parts. Introduction/foreword In addition to visual art, Secret Art provides more personal insight into the life of Theodor Geisel. The book opens with a very short introductory letter by Geisel's widow, Audrey Geisel, titled \\"A Personal Note About Theodor Seuss Geisel\\", as well as an introduction by Maurice Sendak, both of which relate anecdotal tales of Geisel's work ethic and artistic vision. Media Dr. Seuss used a wide variety of media in his art. In keeping with the post- modernist tradition, Seuss is very experimental with his media; he even uses a hinged window frame and screen as a frame for one of his oil paintings. Paintings and drawings Theodor Seuss Geisel's favored medium is watercolor, usually either on bristol or illustration board. He also makes ample use of ink or pen, oil, and acrylic. This selection of media helps to expand his distinctive style. Sculpture The most distinct aspect of Geisel's sculpture is his choice of medium. As mentioned above, all of his sculptures take the form of hunting-lodge trophies in the forms of surreal or fantasy animals. As if to enhance this effect, Dr. Seuss uses real parts of dead animals and animal by-products. Each sculpture is hung on a plain wood mount.

Although he was no longer working at the time the terms were coined, he can probably be best defined as a combination of early forms of maximalism and cute formalism. This is evident not only in the visual aesthetic of his work, but also in his work ethic. In the maximalist tradition, his work is very bright, sensual, visually rich, and extremely detailed. He was also very conscientious, and his pieces are all very formalistic and work-extensive. All of his pieces also display a childish and playful nature, with a touch of femininity and a sense of ironic politeness, which leads to the assertion that he was a preemptive cute formalist. This observation is particularly interesting because of the evident Oriental influence on Geisel's art, and both of these movements are centered in Eastern Asian culture (Chinese and Japanese, respectively). Some have labeled Seuss's art as expressionist, but critics of this argument claim that his working style and ethics were not in-line with those of expressionism. Expressionism is usually defined as the exaggeration or over-emphasis of shapes, forms, and colors to heighten emotional reaction. While Dr. Seuss's art is clearly very exaggerated and emotional, many critics do not believe it was created with the deliberate attempt at emotional \\"shock value\\" they see as being characteristic of expressionism. Neither of these arguments has much critical support, but then, neither do many other arguments concerning the classification of Theodor Seuss Geisel; in fact, he died before some of these terms were even coined. His works were quickly acquired by American pop art galleries, and some (but very few) critics consider it kitsch. Perhaps the safest classification is just as transgressive art, or even just the broader umbrella term of postmodernism.

Published in 1992 by Viking, it is a collection of twisted, humorous parodies of famous children's stories and fairy tales, such as \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" and \\"The Gingerbread Man\\". Illustrated in a unique style by Lane Smith, the book won The New York Times Best Illustrated Book award, was a Caldecott Honor book, and has won numerous other awards in various countries. The book has proved to be popular with children and adults, as its lighthearted approach creates interest while educating young readers about some of the features of books (such as title and contents) by poking fun at those conventions. The book was re-released in a 10th-anniversary edition in 2002 and included a new story, a parody of \\"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\" on the dust jacket. Plot The star of the book is Jack of Jack and the Beanstalk, who tells the stories and deals with the rest of the cast. There is a very loud and annoying Little Red Hen that comes in to complain about no one helping her make her bread (or do anything). Chicken Licken believes that the sky is falling and demands that someone call the President until the table of contents crushes her and the others. Jack introduces Little Red Running Shorts, a counterpart of Little Red Riding Hood, by blurting out the entire story ‚Äî including the ending ‚Äî so she and the wolf refuse to be in it. The Stinky Cheese Man, a counterpart of The Gingerbread Man, is afraid to be near anyone because he thinks that they will eat him...but they are really trying to get away from his horrid smell. Also in the book are \\"The Princess and the Bowling Ball\\", \\"The Other Frog Prince\\", \\"The Really Ugly Duckling\\", \\"Cinderumplestiltskin\\" and \\"The Tortoise and the Hair\\". In the first, a retelling of \\"The Princess and the Pea\\", the Prince finally finds a girl he really loves. Sick of his parents rejecting potential wives when they do not feel a pea under 100 mattresses, he slips his bowling ball under her mattresses when his parents have her over. In \\"The Other Frog Prince\\", the frog tells the princess that he will turn into a prince if she kisses him and so she does; he then says \\"I was just kidding\\" and hops back into the lake. \\"The Really Ugly Duckling\\" (a parody of Hans Christian Andersen's \\"The Ugly Duckling\\"), grows up to be a Really Ugly Duck rather than a swan. \\"Cinderumplestiltskin\\" combines \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Rumplestiltskin\\". In \\"The Tortoise and the Hair\\", a re-telling of \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\", the Hare says he can grow his hair (one on the top of his head) faster than the Tortoise can run. So they race, and race, and race, and race; this story has no ending, the last words of it being \\"not the end\\". The foreword includes a parody of \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\" as an example of a \\"Fairly Stupid Tale\\". Also, the table of contents includes the title, \\"The Boy Who Cried Cow Patty\\", a story found nowhere in the book. The latter story was printed on the back of the dust jacket for the book's 10th anniversary edition (whereas the original edition had the Little Red Hen complaining about buying this book, while asking who \\"this ISBN guy\\" is and complaining that she is only in three of the pages as a book gag). In \\"Goldilocks and the Three Elephants\\", Goldilocks enters the house of the elephants, but she cannot climb up on any of the three chairs and eat \\"peanut porridge\\", so she goes home. In the special 10th anniversary edition, \\"The Boy Who Cried Cow Patty\\" is about a boy who cried \\"Cow Patty\\" every time someone did something. One day, he took a shortcut behind Mr. Smith's barn and he jumped over the fence without looking. Not knowing Mr. Smith just shoveled out the cow barn, he lands in a fresh pile of cow patty and cries \\"Fire!\\". The firemen came and asked where the fire was, but the boy said that, if he cried \\"Cow Patty\\", no one would get him.

Zaara is an archaic variant of Sahara, both being English transliterations of the original Arabic word for desert. It is an African region famed for its arid, barren characteristics, and was used by contemporary writers not just as a geographic reference, but also to illustrate the epitome of a dismal wasteland. Modern references to the Sahara as Zaara are very sparse. It generally cannot be found in online dictionaries or encyclopedias, not even as a footnote under the standard spelling. However, a few references can be found in antique books, particularly those regarding the animals of the region and travelogues; and on antique maps, some as recent as 1834.  Literary references  From the chapter on lions in William Smellie's 1781 English translation of Buffon's Histoire Naturelle : :The lions of Mount Atlas, the summit of which is sometimes covered with snow, have neither the courage, the strength, nor the ferocity of the lions of Biledulgerid or of Zaara, whose plains are covered with burning sands. It is chiefly in these fervid deserts that we meet with those terrible lions, who are the dread of travellers, and the scourge of the neighbouring provinces. :In the vast deserts of Zaara, in those that seem to separate two very different races of men, the Negroes and the Moors, in the unpeopled regions that lie about the territories of the Hottentos , and, in general, in all those southern parts of Africa and Asia, which man has disdained to inhabit, the lions are still very numerous, and continue in their natural state. This is a description of the English Mastiff from the Cynographia Britannica, published in 1800. The reference to attacking \\"the lord of the savage tribes\\" means the breed's use as lion-hunters. At the time this was written, lions were commonly referred to as the \\"king of the beasts\\" : :This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the pard, and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the deserts of Zaara or the plains of Numidia. This is an early 19th-century complaint about a 1788 American law that made it easier to market fraudulent land grants. It cites the poor quality of Zaara's land as an example of deceptive marketing. This commentary appears in Blackstone's Commentaries: with Notes of Reference, annotated by St. George Tucker of the College of William and Mary and published in 1803 : :The evil has not rested here; emissaries have been dispatched to every part of Europe with bales of these patents; fictitious plats, and maps of the country, have been offered to the public's eye; rivers and streams have been made to flow where nature has denied water; mountains have been sunk into meadows, and rocks as barren as the sandy deserts of Zaara, have been represented as possessing the fertility of the banks of the Nile. Thousands of ignorant and innocent persons have been defrauded, and, with their families, plunged into irretrievable ruin by these nefarious practices. The Narrative of a Voyage to Senegal in 1816 by Corr√©ard and Savigny, carries this lengthy subtitle : :Undertaken by Order of the French Government, Comprising an Account of the Shipwreck of the Medusa, the Sufferings of the Crew, and the Various Occurrences on Board the Raft, in the Desert of Zaara, at St. Louis, and at the Camp of Daccard. To Which Are Subjoined Observations Respecting the Agriculture of the Western Coast of Africa, from Cape Blanco to the Mouth of the Gambia.

There are small industries specializing in furniture, wooden carts, wheat flour, sawed wood, bricks, coffee toasting, cereals, and milk products. In 2007 there were four banks. In 2006 there were 273 farms with a total area of 17,627 hectares, of which 4,700 hectares were cropland. There were 24,000 head of cattle in 2006. The main crops in planted area were rice, corn, sugarcane, and tomatoes. See IBGE Health and Education Data There were 8 hospitals with 302 beds in 2007 and 23 public health walk-in clinics. The literacy rate in 2000 was 89.4%. There were 23 schools with 7,084 students in 2006. There were three campuses of institutes of higher education: Faculdade de Filosofia do Vale do S√£o Patr√≠cio. - UEG - Faculdade de Ci√™ncias Agr√°rias do Vale do S√£o Patr√≠cio - Faculdades Integradas da Associa√ß√£o Educativa Evang√©lica (extension) *MHDI (2000): 0.782 *State ranking: 28 (out of 242 municipalities in 2000) *National ranking: 1,019 (out of 5,507 municipalities)For the complete list see frigoletto.com.br History Ceres began in 1941 when the Getulio Vargas government created an agricultural colony called Col√¥nia Agr√≠cola Nacional de Goi√°s ‚Äì CANG established on the banks of the left bank of the Rio Almas. 26-32-hectare lots were distributed along with seeds and tools, while free medical and dental care was promised to the new settlers. Each area had to preserve 25% of the land in forest. A house was given to each settler. The head of this project was an engineer Bernardo Say√£o, one of the pioneers of modern Goi√°s. The city of Ceres has its origin in this colony, which at the time attracted migrants from all over the country, attracted by the offers of free land in a fertile valley. In 1947 there were already 10,000 inhabitants. In 1943 Ceres was a district in the municipality of Goi√°s, separating in 1953 to become a municipality. Adib Shishakli, Syria's ex-president, was assassinated in his exile in Ceres by a Syrian druze, Nawaf Ghazaleh.

He is considered a terchen or \\"preeminent tert√∂n\\" (, discoverer of spiritual treasures) and is considered to be foremost of the \\"Five Tert√∂n Kings\\" (). In the history of the Nyingma school in Bhutan, Pema Lingpa is second only in importance to Padmasambhava. Biography Courtyard of K√∂nchogsum Lhakhang in Bumthang where Pema Lingpa is said to have placed this stone plug over the subterranean lake below the temple Pema Lingpa was born in Chel, part of the central Bhutanese region of Bumthang known as the ‚ÄúWheel of Dharma.‚Äù His father was Lama D√∂ndrup Zangpo of the Ny√∂ clan, and his mother, Drogmo Pema Drolma, was bestowed with all the signs of a dakini. Their son was born among many miraculous signs. As an incarnation of the Omniscient One Drim√© Ozer (Longchenpa), Pema Lingpa was extraordinary even as a child. He learned everything from reading and writing to ironwork and carpentry without receiving any instruction. On the tenth day of the first month of autumn in a Monkey Year, Padmasambhava appeared before Pema Lingpa at the holy site of Yig√© Drukma, blessed him, and placed in his hands an inventory of one hundred and eight major termas to be revealed. However, due to the karmic disposition of beings at that time, during his lifetime Pema Lingpa revealed only about half of the prophesied treasures. Nevertheless, the revealed treasures of Pema Lingpa contain the essence of all 108 treasures, which are summarized in the cycles of the three heart practices transmitted to Princess Pemasel by Guru Rinpoche: The Lama Jewel Ocean, The Union of Samantabhadra's Intentions, and The Great Compassionate One: The Lamp That Illuminates Darkness. One well-known story of Pema Lingpa tells of his diving with a burning butter lamp into the Burning Lake in the Bumthang District of Bhutan. He told onlookers that if he was a false spirit his lamp would be extinguished. Disappearing into the bottom of the gorge and feared drowned, he emerged from the water with a statue the size of a fist and a treasure casket tucked under one arm, and the butter lamp still burning in the other. Pema Lingpa was highly regarded by all four of the principal schools of Tibetan Buddhism. He spent his life revealing the precious treasures of Padmasambhava, giving empowerments and teachings, meditating in isolated locations, building and restoring monasteries, and establishing a tradition that endures to this day. Moreover, Pema Lingpa prophesied that in the future he would return as Longsal Nyingpo in the pure land of Pemako, and that those connected with him would be reborn in Pemak√∂ as his students. He married twice. His first wife was Yum Tima (alias Sithar) and his second wife was Yum Bumdren.Bhutan studies Notable descendants of Pema Lingpa include the House of Wangchuck and the 6th Dalai Lama. The Pema Lingpa lineage of empowerments, transmissions and guidance continues today through the three lines of the Body, Speech, and Mind emanations of Pema Lingpa: the Gangteng, Sungtrul, and Tukse Rinpoches, all of whom traditionally reside in Bhutan. Emanation lineages Pema Lingpa incarnations Traditionally, there are three main emanation lineages of Padma Lingpa recognized: #the Peling Sungtrul incarnations: The incarnation of Padma Lingpa #the Peling Thuksay incarnations: The incarnations of Padma Lingpa's son Thuksay Dawa Gyeltshen #the Gangteng Truelku or Peling Gyalse incarnations: The incarnations of Gyalse Pema Thinley; son of Thuksay Dawa Gyeltshen. They are known as \\"Peling Yab-sey-sum\\" meaning incarnations of Father, son and grandson, who are considered to be the combined body and activity incarnations. However mistakenly many refer to three of them as incarnations of speech, mind and body. .Gangteng (2008) p.15 (English) Peling Sungtrul incarnations Lhalung Sungtrul Rinpoche The incarnations are:Harding (2003) p. 138 *Tenzin Drakpa (1536‚Äì1597) *Kunkhyen Tsultim Dorje (1680‚Äì1723) *Dorje Miky≈ç-tsal Ngawang Kunzang Rolpai Dorje (1725‚Äì1762) *Kunzang Tsewang a.k.a.

The Rajasthan Police has its headquarters in Jaipur, the state capital. The motto of the force is ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§• ‡§ï‡§ü‡§ø‡§¨‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§§‡§æ, which means \\"committed to serve\\".  History  History of Indian police under British rule is marked by a series of attempts to introduce more advance standards of conduct and integrity and to raise the tone of the force by improving the pay and prospects of its members. The reconstruction of police was a step towards the improvement of the administration of criminal justice in India. Rajasthan was formed by the merger of the erstwhile princely states. The security and the police forces of the former princely states varied in composition, functions and administrative procedures. Following the merger, the police forces of the princely states united as of January, 1951.  Recruitment and service  Recruitment is generally through the Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC), which conducts a state-level examination called Rajasthan Administrative Service/Sub-ordinate Services Exam (RAS). After passing the exam, recruits undergo training at RPA Jaipur and RPTC. They are governed by Rajasthan Service Rules. The nine organisational units are Crime branch, Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC), State Special Branch, Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS), Planning and Welfare, Training, Forensic Science laboratory, Telecommunications and Traffic Police. As of 2014 the Rajasthan Police employed 82,193 persons.

The Rajasthan Police is headed by the Director General of Police (DGP). Rajasthan is divided into 2 police commissionerate, 7 police range each headed by an Inspector General of Police (IGP). The state is further divided into 40 districts (including 3 rural districts, 2 city districts in Jaipur City and 2 railway police districts), 171 circles, 709 police stations and 788 out-posts. The force had 889 Inspectors, 3366 Sub-Inspectors, 3902 Asst. Sub-Inspectors, 8867 Head Constables and 52,837 Constables and about 700 Indian Police Service (IPS) and Rajasthan Police Service (RPS) officers. Rajasthan Armed Constabulary Soon after independence, the law and order situation along the 1070 km Indo-Pakistani border became a serious problem. Incursions and cattle lifting by Pakistani raiders was a regular feature and it became imperative to put an end to it. In 1949-50, the duty of guarding the border was handed over to the joint forces of the Central Reserve Police and the Provincial Armed Constabulary, which continued until 1952. In 1952, the Government of Rajasthan decided to raise a special force that could not only be deployed along the border but also assist the civil police in combating the dacoity menace. The first headquarters and training centre was established at Bharatpur in 1952 and five battalions received training there. These men, some ex-soldiers drawn from the State forces and some from places outside Rajasthan, were a part of the first 5 battalions of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary. Each battalion consisted of 6 companies and one company remained at the battalion headquarters. These battalions were then dispatched to the border areas of Sriganganagar, Raisinghnagar, Barmer, and Jaisalmer. One unit was stationed at Ghat Gate, Jaipur to check dacoity. Within a year of its inception, the RAC proved its worth both on the border and within the State by successfully carrying out its various duties. The members of RAC displayed gallantry and high sense of morale on occasions that required courage, perseverance, and devotion to duty. Its men battled against all odds, combating not only the enemy but also facing the rigours of the desert areas devoid even of the bare necessities of life. The RAC continued as a temporary force until 1958, there after it was made permanent. From that year up to the late 1970s more battalions of RAC were raised as per the situation and the need. India saw two wars with Pakistan and one with China and there was unrest in Jammu and Kashmir, NEFA, as well as Mizoram. RAC battalions were dispatched to these sensitive areas and earned accolades for their courage and efficiency. In 1962, two companies were taken out of each unit and the 6th Battalion was formed. More battalions followed in the subsequent years. Later, seven of these RAC battalions were merged with the Border Security Force and two with the Central Reserve Police Force. Over a period of time, increasing criminal tendencies, subversive political activities, communalism and violence, have all led to the worsening of the law and order situation all over the country. Rajasthan could not remain unaffected. Hence, the need was felt to create a special task force, familiar with modern techniques necessary to deal effectively with communal disturbances. In 1998, a Special Task Force, along the lines of the Rapid Action Force of C.R.P.F., was formed to maintain peace in the sensitive districts of Rajasthan. These companies are trained and fully equipped to handle riots. The training imparted to the select RAC companies is decided as per requirements. There are 3 companies of RAC, which have drawn expert swimmers from various R.A.C. battalions and are being trained for flood relief work. The 67 years of RAC's existence have been full of legendary stories, of heroic encounters, of gallant men and their dare devilry. One story that is still related with considerable pride is about the unforgettable encounter with dacoits in Thor village of Dholpur - it lasted for 18 hours. The outcome? thirteen dacoits held and no casualties on the RAC side. As on today fifteen battalions of RAC including one special battalion formed by only Ladies Constables Specially trained Unit named Hadi Rani Mahila Battalion and one battalion of MBC are there in the State as Statepara-military force. Out of these 14 battalions of RAC, 11 battalions are deployed in Rajasthan while 3 are in Delhi.

It is named after a historical stone bridge, claimed to be the world's longest, on the Ergene River. It is a strategically important border town, located on the routes connecting Turkey to the Balkans and Europe. Uzunk√∂pr√º is the largest and the second most populous town of Edirne Province. The town is served by Uzunk√∂pr√º railway station.  History  The history of Uzunk√∂pr√º goes back to the Neolithic Era (8000‚Äì5500). In the field surveys conducted in Maslƒ±dere, situated along the route going to Kƒ±rkkavak village to the south, many ware fragments overlaid with ornamental striped and pressed figures have been discovered with designs that have never been encountered in Greece and Bulgaria. Nevertheless, the information about this era is inadequate because the researches haven't been taken further. In addition, the history of the region from these ages to the 15th century BC is still unknown, so the previous claims do not stand. In 15th century BC the land began to be settled by the Thracians and they had become tho sole owner of the place for a long time. However, after the 7th century BC the Thracian domination came to end by the continuous invasions over the years and got into the hands sequentially of Greeks, Persians, Romans and Byzantines. Although the region has a very old past, a city had never been able to be built on the area where today's Uzunkopru exists because it'd been covered with vast swamps and dense forests till the Ottomans. That's why, the closest city to today's settlement built in the region is Plotinopolis, established by the Roman Emperor Trajan (AD 53‚Äì117) on the banks of the Maritsa River between Uzunkopru and Didymoteicho in Greek Thrace, that was named after Trajan's wife Pompeia Plotina and became a bishopric, suffragan of Adrianople. This ancient city is also called Old Uzunkopru. Eventually, the region was captured from the Byzantine Empire after the Ottoman conquest of Adrianople (which became renamed Edirne) in the 1360s, and only afterwards it could be possible for Uzunkopru city to be established. Uzunk√∂pr√º is the first Turkish city established in Rumelia by the Ottoman Empire. It was founded by Great Sultan Murad II in 1427 under the name of Ergene City. The establishment of the city is the result of both the necessity of a settlement place acting as a junction point on the ways connecting the Ottoman capital Edirne to Gallipoli and the Balkans and secondly taking16 years to build the Long Bridge over the Ergene River. Murat II decided to build a stone bridge over the Ergene River when his army couldn't pass the river during a campaign against Gallipoli because of the flood caused by the heavy rain at that time and collapse of the temporary wooden bridges easily. The first 360- arched stone bridge built between 1424‚Äì1427 wasn't found satisfactory, thereby destructed and rebuilt by Murad II. It is that second bridge existing in the city today. The construction of this second bridge had lasted from 1427 to 1443 and could be finished in 16 years. Due to the long- lasting works, the meeting of the needs of the workers and the soldiers protecting them and the area became indispensably necessary and had to be built a mosque, public kitchen, caravanserai, madrasah, hammam and two water mills as facilities besides. Subsequently, families from firstly Edirne and later the Turkmen tribes who had passed onto Rumelia was brought and settled in the region to maintain and develop those facilities, thus it was laid the foundations of the city. This very first settlement called as Cisr-i Ergene (Ergene Bridge) had immediately become the trade route of the merchants carrying goods from Edirne to Gallipoli overland for shipping to Europe, Egypt and Syria, and flourished rapidly. In the beginning of 20th century the small town have mixed population of Turks, Bulgarians, Greeks, Orthodox Albanians, Armenians, Jews, Gypsies etc. In 1913 Turks uprooted 300 bulgarian families –õ—é–±–æ–º–∏—Ä—ä –ú–∏–ª–µ—Ç–∏—á—ä. ‚Äû–†–∞–∑–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–∫–∏–π—Å–∫–∏—Ç—£ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∑—ä 1913 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞‚Äú, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ù–∞—É–∫–∏—Ç–µ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, –î—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∞ –ü–µ—á–∞—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, 1918, and till 1922 evicted all Greeks, Orthodox Albanians, Armenians etc. Uzunk√∂pr√º remained under Turkish sovereignty uninterruptedly till the 19th century. However, in the following years it had been occupied four times up to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire: by Russia twice, from 20 August to 20 November 1829 and 21 January 1878 to 13 March 1879; by Bulgaria, from 2 November 1912 to 19 July 1913 and lastly by Greece, from 25 July 1920 to 18 November 1922. In the last occupation the Greeks renamed Uzunk√∂pr√º Makrifere. The city regained its present name after reconquered by the Turks on 18 November 1922. Eventually, Uzunk√∂pr√º was left in Turkey in the Lausanne Treaty signed after the Turkish Independence War with the Allied Powers with which the Maritsa River became the border between Turkey and Greece. Today, the date of 18 November is celebrated as Uzunk√∂pr√º's Independence Day to commemorate the liberation from the Greek occupation.  Geography  Ergene River upstream seen from the Uzun k√∂pr√º (The Long Bridge). Uzunk√∂pr√º city is located at the westernmost border of Turkey and in the middle of Edirne province. It is bordered by Greece and Meric town to the west, Tekirdag to the east, Kƒ±rklareli to the northeast, Ipsala and Kesan to the South, Edirne city and Havsa to the North. It has an area of 1224 km2 (472 sq mi). Because it was established on Ergene Plain, almost 75% of the city's territory is made up of low-lying areas that has an elevation of 18 m. Small hills and plateaus scattered especially to the north and the south from place to place form the sole heights encountered in the region. The highest point of the city is Suleymaniye Hill with a 221 m (725 ft) height. Uzunk√∂pr√º's weather is under the influence of severe Thracian Transitional Type of the Mediterranean climate which is a mixture of continental and maritime climates. The winds generally blow from the north with medium speed. While summers are hot and near-rainless, winters pass cold and precipitation often takes the form of snow. Most of the rain falls in the spring. Although the city has a semi-humid climate, its flora is steppe. As 70% of the unbuilt area is composed of arable soils that's allocated to cultivation, 20% of the rest is meadows and pastures, and 10% is forests and shrubland. The amount of the forestland has started to increase in the last years in result of the afforestation works.  The Long Bridge, Uzunk√∂pr√º  Uzun k√∂pr√º (The Long Bridge) Uzunk√∂pr√º is the longest historical stone bridge of the world, and gives its name to Uzunk√∂pr√º town. It was built by head architect Muslihiddin between 1427‚Äì1443 to span the Ergene river with the order of Sultan Murad II and brought into use with a ceremony attended by the Sultan himself in 1444. It's been located on a militarily and commercially highly strategic point connecting the capital Edirne to Galipoli and the Western Rumelia. The bridge was built of binding ashlar blocks brought from the quarries in Yagmurca, Eskikoy and Hasƒ±rcƒ±arnavut villages, to each other with Horasan cement. The construction process was supervised firstly by Ghazi Mahmud Bey and after his death by Ishak Bey. Although today its length is 1238.55 m (4063 ft) from the first arch to the last, its original length used to be 1392 m (4566 ft) with extended wings that don't exist today. The reason of why it was built this long was that the region used to be covered with vast swamps in that period. In addition, because the Ergene River causes flood in rainy season, the arches over the river were built high and opened seven bleed ports in them to prevent the bridge from collapse. The wings and arches of the bridge which has 13.56 m (44.48 ft) height, are embellished with several lion, elephant, bird, eagle, tulip and geometric relief motifs. Because it has been through a lot of flood and earthquake disasters since the construction, the bridge underwent many restorations during the tenures of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, Osman II, Mahmud II and Abdulhamid II to repair the damages. In the final restoration made between 1964‚Äì1971 in the Republic period, its width was increased from 5.24 m (17.19 ft) to 6.80 m (22.3 ft) by widening from the both sides and lost its originality. In addition, the initial arch number of 174 reduced to 172 after one of them collapsed in time and two of them were united as one. However, with a new restoration and rehabilitation work thought to be performed, the bridge was planned to return to its original form and get pedestrianized.  Other sights  Monument of Liberty (√ñzg√ºrl√ºk Anƒ±tƒ±)  The Monument of Liberty (Liberty Fountain)  It is the democracy monument erected in memory of the reenactment of the Ottoman Constitution that's one of the milestones of the history of the Turkish democracy. With the re- declaration of the Constitution ( Kanun-i Esasi) on 23 July 1908, the Ottoman Empire's regime was changed from absolute monarchy to parliamentary regime and started an unprecedented era of freedom in the whole Empire. Uzunkopru didn't stay idle to these new political changes and the Liberty Monument was erected at the right side of the bridge's entry in such a political atmosphere to celebrate this great event with the contributions of the District Governor and Ottoman intellectual Mazhar M√ºfit Kansu and the Mayor Hafiz Ismail Yayalar on 11 December 1908. Measuring in height, the monument was placed on a pedestal. Although in its initial form, there were two fountains as one on the front for people and the other on the left for animals, these fountains were removed and covered up in 1938. The four themes of the French Revolution; liberty, equality, fraternity and justice were written on the markers and put atop of the first liberty monument of the Turkish history on the four sides. However, the original markers were lost while the monument was being moved to left of its primary place during the bridge restoration in 1964 and haven't been able to be found so far. The markers existing on the monument today are the replicas of their genuines. The Monument of Liberty was saved from oblivion with a complete restoration and opened to public just 104 years after it was built on 11 December 2012.  The Mosque of Murad II (Muradiye Mosque)  Mosque of Murad II () The Mosque of Murad II which is located in the Muradiye neighbourhood, was built by Ottoman Sultan Murad II (reigned 1421‚Äì1444 and 1446‚Äì 1451) along with the Uzunkopru and opened to service in 1444. It's one of the mosques carrying the title of Selatin, a mosque commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty. Although the Muradiye Mosque was originally built as a part of K√ºlliye, areligious building complex, with a hammam (bayh) and an imaret (public kitchen) around, today only the mosque has survived. The mosque made of rubble is seated on a rectangular base measuring 22 m (72 ft) in length and in width. Although initially the roof used to be structured as a dome, later this dome was removed during the renovation works in Osman II period (1618‚Äì1622) and replaced with a span roof coated with lead. It is the biggest span roofed mosque built up by the Ottomans. It has a capacity of 500 people. On the other hand, with a height, it is pretty low for a mosque. That is why, its windows are almost aligned with the fringes of the roof. In front of the mosque, there is a last congregation porch that has the dimensions of . Although in its original state 12 wooden pillars were used to support the porch, in the restorations performed in the ensuing years, those pillars have been removed and a wall built instead. Apart from this, the mosque hosts a small cemetery in the backside, where the prominent people of the city were interred. The minaret adjacent to the wall of the mosque is made of ashlar and introduced into the body with Turkish triangles on a rectangular pedestal. The minaret body is round and has a single balcony. The courtyard of the mosque has three gates situated as two in the west and one in the east. On the main entrance gate located in the west, there is a marble inscription plaque written by the famous Ottoman historian Abdurrahman Hibri recording that the mosque was built by Murad II in 1443 and renovated by Osman II in 1621. In the courtyard, there is a shadirvan (fountain) covered with a pyramidal spire just across the main entrance. It has an octagonal prism basin and eight taps. The fountain's former eight wooden poles were replaced in a renovation work in 1993 with reinforced concrete columns. The tradition of serving sharbat to the congregation after religious practices in the Ottoman Empire was started for the first time by pouring sharbat from this fountain's taps.  The Church of St. John the Baptist  Church of Saint John the Baptist () The Greek Orthodox Saint John the Baptist Church () was built by the Greek community on behalf of Saint John the Baptist (Ioannis Prodromos) in 1875. It is located in the Muradiye neighborhood in Uzunkopru. The church is built of rubble with red bricks scattered among. It was structured as in basilica style with three naves and semi-dome. The apse and the roof are covered with tile. Also the apse and the naves contains barrel vaulted rectangular windows. The walls of the middle nave are embellished with the frescos depicting twelve apostles separately as six on the right and six on the left. It is known that over 17,000 Greek citizens had been baptized in the St. John the Baptist Church from 1875 until they left the city in 1924 as a result of the Population Exchange Protocol between Turkey and Greece signed in the Treaty of Lausanne. While the Greek citizens were leaving the city, they took all the items belonging to the church including the great bell, which is being used in the Church of Xanthi now. From 1924 to 2011, the church has been left idle without any use. The St. John Church has gained back its old grandeur with the restoration work lasting from 2011 to 2013 by the Uzunk√∂pr√º Municipality, and opened its doors again after a long time with a big ceremony attended by Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople on 16 December 2013. Today, the church serves as the Art and Culture Center of Uzunk√∂pr√º.  Gazi Turhan Bey Mosque and Tomb  Gazi Turhan Bey Mosque and Tomb were built on behalf of Gazi Turhan Bey who was one of the most famous commanders of Sultan Murat II and Mehmet II (Mehmet the Conqueror) era. He was the son-in-law of Sultan Murat II and brother-in-law of Sultan Mehmet II. He is known as the Conqueror of the Morea. His father Pashayigit (Pasha Yiƒüit Bey)and his son Omer Bey were prominent commanders of their times, too. Although his birth and death dates are uncertain, it's generally accepted that he died in mid 1456 and was buried into the tomb built for him in Kƒ±rkkavak village. The village of Kƒ±rkavak, which is 8 km away from Uzunkopru, was bestowed as a foundation on him in exchange for his distinguished services in 1454. He built up a K√ºlliye in this village. Evliya √áelebi mentioned about this village in his famous Seyahatname (Book of Travels) as a village with a beautiful mosque, inn (han) and Turkish bath (hammam) in 1658. Today, only the mosque and tomb of this K√ºlliye still exist. The mosque and the tomb carry the same characteristic structural features with the other contemporary counterparts in Edirne. They both were built on square-plan and made of rubble and brick. In addition the mosque and the tomb which are pretty humble in terms of inner decoration, have single domes covered with lead atop. The mosque was built with one minaret with a balcony and a wooden porch inside as a conclusion of the tradition and the necessity. They both were restored and opened to visit in 2008.  City Museum  City Museum () Uzunk√∂pr√º City Museum () was opened to service on 16 December 2013 with conversion of the ex-Tekel (Turkish State Liquor and Tobacco Company) building to a museum following its restoration. The museum building, which is a historical structure on its own, was constructed as a private mansion in the beginning of the 20th century, and from 1939 it had started to be used as Tekel storage, outlet and lodge. After the abolition of the Tekel in Uzunk√∂pr√º in the 1990s, the building was left disused and had almost come to the brink of collapse. It was recovered by making a museum out of it and transformed into a center sheltering the relics the city possesses. The double-storied museum has six rooms, and each room was turned into chambers, where the artifacts are displayed by classification according to their species. While the historical items are being displayed generally in the three rooms downstairs, the rooms modified as Bride's and Living Rooms and the Coffee Corner upstairs take the visitors to the scenes, where the past is revived. The Museum is open to visit for free every weekday except Mondays and holidays. The Telli Fountain Telli Fountain The Telli Fountain () is a four-sided four-taps stone drinking fountain located in the Telli Square in the center of the city. Taking the ornaments and the design of the fountain in consideration, it is believed that it was built in the Tulip period in beginning of the 18th century. The motifs carved on the stone fountain are curved branches and cypress. There are also relief motifs of Istanbul tulip, which is extinct today. The inscription and the decorations on the fountain were erased during the Greek occupation of Uzunk√∂pr√º. Only their traces are visible today. The fountain was moved to its current place in 1960.

He is the Kate Greenaway medalist (2017) known for his eclectic visuals and subject matter both humorous and earnest, such as the contemplative Grandpa Green which received a Caldecott Honor in 2012 and the outlandish Stinky Cheese Man which received a Caldecott Honor in 1992. Background Smith was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but moved to Corona, California at a young age. He spent summers in Tulsa, and cites experiences traveling there via Route 66 as inspirations for his work which combines high and low brow elements. He studied at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, at the encouragement of his high-school art teacher, Dan Baughman, helping to pay for it by working as a janitor at Disneyland. While still a student he illustrated for alternative newspapers, L.A. Weekly, L.A. Reader and for the punk magazine No Mag. He also illustrated album covers for Oingo Boingo, Good For Your Soul and The Dickies Stukas Over Disneyland. He graduated from Art Center in 1983 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in illustration and moved to New York City where he freelance illustrated for various publications including TIME, Mother Jones, Ms., Sports Illustrated, The New York Times, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, The Progressive, The Atlantic, The Boston Globe, Sesame Street Magazine, and others. Smith is married to Molly Leach, who has designed many award-winning books, including nearly all of Smith's. Children's books Smith is most noted for his work on bestselling and award-winning children's books. He has won the British Kate Greenaway Medal (There Is a Tribe of Kids), the Bratislava Golden Apple (The Big Pets), two American Caldecott Honors (The Stinky Cheese Man and Grandpa Green), five New York Times' Best Illustrated Book awards (Halloween ABC, The Stinky Cheese Man, John, Paul, George & Ben, Grandpa Green and A House That Once Was), and lifetime achievement awards from the Carle Museum of Picture Book Art (2012), and the Society of Illustrators (2014). His illustrations are created in varying media: oil paint, pen and ink, pencil, watercolor, collage and digital. Smith's artwork is also known for its experimental, textural nature. In a 2017 exhibit at the Eric Carle museum of Picture Book Art, Collecting Inspiration, Smith's written appreciation for the art of Alice and Martin Provensen gives us insight into his own philosophy. The statement read: ‚ÄúSome picture book artists are very consistent with their style, which is probably a good thing for business and career. My favorite artists are the ones who try a different look with every book. That‚Äôs why I like the Provensens. Everything they did had a lot of experimentation going on. Like children who haven‚Äôt yet been told not to splatter ink onto their drawings, or not to mix oil paints with watercolors, or that the sky is blue, not green ‚Ä¶ [In my own paintings] from The Stinky Cheese Man I made the textures by combining oil paint with water-based varnishes. You‚Äôre not supposed to do that. It makes the paint bubble up like little pebbles.‚Äù He has illustrated works by Florence Parry Heide, Judith Viorst, Bob Shea, Dr. Seuss, Jack Prelutsky, Eve Merriam, Roald Dahl, George Saunders, Jory John, Chris Harris, and Julie Fogliano. He has both written and illustrated several books, most notably It's a Book (2010), which was a New York Times bestseller for over six months and has been translated into over twenty-eight languages; The Happy Hocky Family (1996), The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country! (2002), Madam President (2008), John, Paul, George, and Ben (2006), and A Perfect Day (2017). On May 5, 2015, Roaring Brook Press published Smith's first middle-grade novel, Return to Augie Hobble, which received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. It was a Washington Post Best Book of the Year. He is also known for his collaborations with Jon Scieszka. Introduced by their wives, Molly Leach and Jeri Hansen in the late 1980s the two collaborated on several award-winning and bestselling books from 1989 to 2007. Their two most popular books, The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs! (1989) and The Stinky Cheese Man (1992) made lists by both TIME magazine and School Library Journal ranking them among the 100 best all-time picture books. (The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!, number 35, and The Stinky Cheese Man, 91). Smith has also illustrated some volumes of Scieszka's The Time Warp Trio novels. He is a five-time recipient of the New York Times Best Illustrated Book award. In 2012 he was named a Carle Honor Artist for lifelong innovation in the field of children's books. In 2014 he received the Society of Illustrators' Lifetime Achievement award. Smith's artistic talents have also been featured in other books and mediums.

Growing up, Seth Wescott went to Mount Blue regional school district in Farmington, Maine. His father Jim Wescott was the Track and Cross Country coach at Colby College. He began snowboarding at age 10, but had also grown up skiing. In 1989, after competing in both sports for a few years, he stopped skiing to focus mainly on snowboarding. Wescott attended Carrabassett Valley Academy where he studied and trained with fellow Olympians Bode Miller, Jeff Greenwood, Kirsten Clark and Emily Cook. He started out at Sugarloaf in Carrabassett Valley, Maine. In his Olympic debut, at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, Wescott won gold in the snowboard cross as the first Olympic champion in the event. Having won gold, Wescott was invited to meet president George W. Bush, but turned down the offer, citing his opposition to Bush's foreign and domestic policies. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Wescott successfully defended his Olympic gold. Wescott, who started off the race in fourth, slowly advanced throughout the field until the end, when he narrowly defeated hometown favorite Mike Robertson on the final jump. Wescott co-owns The Rack, a restaurant and bar near Sugarloaf that caters food and drinks to skiers and snowboarders. On February 25, 2010, Wescott appeared on The Colbert Report.

Hill was the eldest son of Michael Hill of Hillsborough and his wife Anne Trevor, daughter of Sir John Trevor, MP of Brynkinalt, Denbighshire. He was a member of an influential landowning family of County Down, Ireland. His father died in 1699 and Hill succeeded to his estates. He married sometime before 1717, Mary Denton, widow of Sir Edmund Denton, 1st Baronet of Hillesden and daughter of Anthony Rowe, of Muswell Hill, Middlesex. Hill represented Hillsborough in the Irish House of Commons from 1713 to 1715 and subsequently Down from 1715 until 1717, when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Hill of Kilwarlin, in the County of Down, and Viscount Hillsborough. He became an Irish Privy Councilloer on 20 September 1717. At the 1715 British general election he stood unsuccessfully as a Whig for Saltash, but three months later was returned as Member of Parliament for Aylesbury at a by-election on 30 April 1715. In 1722 his friend, the Duke of Wharton returned him as MP for Malmesbury, but he was unseated on petition on 13 December 1722. He was defeated at a by-election at Appleby in 1723, and did not stand for Parliament again. He was appointed Governor of County Down in 1729. Hill had charm but a poor reputation as a wanton and profligate. He tried to recuperate his debts by gambling on horses, and was one of a party of men that were given a whipping by a carter offended by their riding naked with young ladies around Buckinghamshire. Lord Hillsborough died aged 48 in May 1742. He had four sons and two daughters and was succeeded in the titles by his son Wills, who became a prominent statesman. His brother Arthur Hill succeeded to the Trevor estates through their mother and was created Baron Hill and Viscount Dungannon in 1765.

The short chiton she wears, exposing her right breast, and her loose hair, are distinctive characteristics of the competitors in the Heraean Games. This marble statue is likely a Roman copy of a Greek original, from 460 BC. Bronze running girl, 560 BC. The figure is probably from Laconia, and dressed as a competitor in the Heraean Games. The Heraea was an ancient Greek festival in which young girls competed in a footrace. The race was held every four years at Olympia, and probably took place around the same time as the ancient Olympic games. Not much is known about the Heraea, but most of our knowledge comes from Pausanias' Description of Greece. The date that the festival began is uncertain. Pausanias says that the games are (, \\"old\\") There is evidence for cult activity in Olympia as far back as the tenth century BC, but the earliest cultic activity at the site appears to centre around the cult of Zeus; the cult of Hera was certainly in place by about 600 BC, when the first temple of Hera at Olympia was built. It is uncertain whether the races were an original feature of the festival, or a later addition. One story in Pausanias associates the sixteen women responsible for the Heraea with the conflict between Elis and Pisa after the death of Damophon, tyrant of Pisa around 580 BC. If the festival were already established by this point, there may have been a re-organisation around this time (as there was at other Greek festivals in the late archaic period). The only event at the Heraean Games was the stadion, which was one sixth shorter than the equivalent men's race. Only parthenoi (unmarried young women) competed in the games. Competitors raced in three different age categories, though it is uncertain exactly how old the competitors were. They wore a distinctive outfit of a short chiton cut above the knees, which left the right shoulder and breast bare, and wore their hair loose. This outfit may have derived from the exomis, a variant of the chiton worn by labourers and associated with Hephaestus. The winners were awarded a crown of olive leaves and a portion of a cow which was sacrificed to Hera. They were also permitted to dedicate statues inscribed with their name to Hera, though none of these statues survive. The festival of the Heraea was presided over by a group of sixteen women, who as well as conducting the games were responsible for weaving a peplos for Hera and arranging choral dances in honour of Hippodameia and Physcoa. Pausanias gives two stories about these sixteen women. The first is that the Heraia was founded by Hippodamia and the first games were held to celebrate her marriage to Pelops, and she selected sixteen women to compete in the games. The second is that to settle a dispute between Elis and Pisa, the Eleans selected a wise elderly woman from each of sixteen polites in Elis to settle the dispute; these women were also given the responsibility of organising the Heraea. The Heraean Games may have been puberty rites or pre-nuptial rituals. Matthew Dillon argues that as there were three different age categories for competitors, the ceremonies were unlikely to be associated with marriage. On the other hand, the races were associated with a mythological wedding, and other races between girls in ancient Greece (such as a footrace in honour of Dionysos held at Sparta, also described by Pausanias) seem to have been associated with pre-nuptial initiations.

It was built as an arm of the Grand Junction Canal, in two separate phases, opening in 1800 and 1801. It was disused from 1932, but was not finally abandoned until 1964. It is now the subject of a restoration programme with the Buckingham end holding water for a length of nearly 400m. History On 30 April 1793, the Grand Junction Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament, and the act made provision for an arm from the main line to Old Stratford, ending at the former Roman road of Watling Street, which was a major communications route. The continuation to Buckingham was surveyed in 1793, and included in another Act of Parliament, passed in September 1794, which authorised the construction of the Aylesbury, Buckingham and Wendover arms. The initial section to Old Stratford was to be constructed as a broad canal, capable of use by boats which were wide. The Grand Junction Canal had to cross the River Great Ouse at Wolverton, and the original plan was to construct a crossing on the level, with a flight of locks down one side of the valley and another up the other side. The Old Stratford branch would have had a junction with the main line at the lowest level, and followed the course of the Great Ouse valley. From Old Stratford, the canal was to continue as a narrow canal, which would have joined the river at Passenham, effectively becoming a navigation, as a number of locks would have been needed along the course of the river. The plans were changed when it was decided to construct a high level crossing of the Great Ouse, ruling out the possibility of a junction, and so the arm left the main line just above Cosgrove lock, following the north side of the Great Ouse valley, and resulted in a canal which was on one level for most of its length, with just two locks as it approached Buckingham. The Grand Junction Canal, which included the two flights of locks to cross the River Great Ouse, opened in August 1800, and the Old Stratford arm followed six weeks later, in September. The Buckingham branch progressed quickly and was built in 8 months. A formal opening occurred on 1 May 1801, with celebrations as Buckingham. The canal was supplied with water by a feeder from the Great Ouse in Buckingham. The lock flights on the main line were replaced by two embankments and an aqueduct in 1805, but there were problems with the aqueduct, and it was replaced with an iron trough in 1811. The Grand Junction public house was built (before 1830) near to the Buckingham Wharf in the High Street, marking the end of the Buckingham Arm. The pub is now known as 'Number Thirteen' By the 1850s, the canal was suffering from competition from the railways, and the water supply from the river contained much silt, which was deposited in the canal, making navigation difficult. Buckingham Corporation also used the canal as a disposal point for sewage, which added to the problems. Trade continued to reduce, with the Grand Junction company resorting to legal action to prevent the dumping of sewage into the canal in 1890, but Bradshaw's Guide of 1904 lists the upper section as \\"barely navigable\\". Decline In 1919, a section of the canal near Mount Mill Farm was replaced by a concrete trough, in an attempt to reduce leakage. The last recorded commercial traffic was a delivery of chemicals to Leckhampstead in 1932. The arm was blocked at the first bridge in 1944, as a precaution against further leakage, and the temporary dam was never removed. Following a protest cruise on the nearby Aylesbury Arm, the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) tried to promote the idea of restoring the Buckingham Arm in 1961, but there were few local members, and closure of the canal was supported by the local authorities through which the arm ran. The Northampton Chronicle and Echo ran an article on 24 March 1961, suggesting the section from the Grand Union junction to Old Stratford should be re-opened for its amenity value, following which a local IWA member called R Faulkner tried to form an action committee, but again, there was little interest locally. W L Ives, a senior official of British Waterways, presented a paper which outlined the problems of the waterways on 3 November 1961, calling for changes to the way closures and abandonment of canals were handled. Later that month, the Minister of Transport, in dealing with the British Transport Commission bill, stated that no changes which would adversely affect navigation of the first section of the canal would be made immediately. The Buckingham branch was formally abandoned in 1964, but the Old Stratford branch was not. Despite this, the Old Stratford branch was severed by the new route of the A5 road, constructed in 1975/6, and Old Stratford basin was sold in 1991. The route of the Buckingham branch was severed by the construction of the A422 Old Stratford Bypass in 1989/90. Today The overall arm is closed, with the exception of a short stretch (about 200 metres) running westwards from the junction with the Grand Union Canal at Cosgrove towards the A5 dual carriageway and a 400-metre section at Buckingham which was restored in 2013. (The Grand Junction Canal became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929.) Beyond this point the canal can still be followed as a trench running through open fields as far as Old Stratford, where a housing estate has been built over the canal's route. Other remnants of the route are decipherable in the landscape as far as Buckingham. Buckingham Canal Society was formed in 1992, initially with the aim of clearance and photography of the remains. With encouragement from British Waterways, who still owned part of the route, cutting down of the vegetation began on the section from Cosgrove to the A5 road. As the society grew, the restoration of the remains and reinstatement of navigation along the arm became the new aim. Other sections of the route have been tackled as negotiations with landowners have resulted in permissive access. In 2008, the structure of Hyde Lane lock was refurbished, following a grant of ¬£38,000 from Waste Recycling Environmental Limited (WREN) towards the ¬£44,000 cost of the project. This enabled the lock to be restored professionally. In 2010, Halcrow Engineering produced a report, which assessed whether the aim of restoration was realistic. While it identified a number of significant issues, including the crossings of the A5 road and the A413 ringroad, it concluded that reinstatement was feasible, and would bring economic, environmental and social benefits to the area. One possible solution to the A413 crossing would be to terminate the canal outside the ringroad, where there would be room for a new terminal basin which could form the centrepiece of other development. The estimated cost for the restoration was put at ¬£64 million. One interesting aspect of the project is that the original Act of Parliament, granted in 1794, has not been repealed, and therefore its powers still apply. This should make it somewhat easier to achieve the aims of the society than might otherwise be the case. The first section of canal that the group intends to reopen is the stretch from Cosgrove to the A5 road near Old Stratford. Buckinghamshire County Council have produced a leaflet entitled The Ouse Valley Walk, which describes a walk from Buckingham to Milton Keynes, and covers most of the canal's route. Following a grant of ¬£7,000 from the Aylesbury Vale Community Chest, which unlocked a grant of ¬£70,000 from WREN, work began in January 2013 on the relining, restoration and rewatering of a section of the canal at Bourton Meadow, close to Buckingham. The canal is largely intact at this location, and although in private ownership, the restoration is fully supported by the landowners. A ceremonial first sod was cut on 25 January by Lord Boswell of Aynho and John Bercow, the local MP and Speaker of the House of Commons. The bed has been lined with a Bentoline liner, and the towpath has been reconstructed after the works Bentoline is a product which consists of a thick, reinforced fibre layer, into which a layer of bentonite clay is embedded. The clay is retained by an upper layer of synthetic geotextile material. In order to maintain water levels on this section, a solar powered pump was installed during the winter of 2016/2017, which pumps water from the River Great Ouse.

The other four were content validated. However, factor analysis was not used in the development of the test, and many of the scales are highly inter-correlated and conceptually similar. The test is typically used with people aged 13 years and older. It takes about 45‚Äì60 minutes to complete. The revised third edition of the CPI contains 434 items. This latest version requires that the patient's false and true answers be transformed at an additional cost into raw scale and Standard scores by the publisher, who will also provide interpretative report writing. The older CPI with the 462 items is still available for sale by the publisher, Consulting Psychologists Press, and comes with plastic scoring keys and profile sheets, thus allowing each research or clinical psychologist to score the test by hand, a less expensive alternative, perhaps for use in training psychology students.Gough, H.G. (1987) California Psychological Inventory Administrator's Guide. Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc. Subtests As stated in the ETS Test Collection Catalog, The CPI contains the following 20 scales: *Dominance *Capacity for Status *Sociability *Social Presence *Self-Acceptance *Independence *Empathy *Responsibility *Socialization *Self-Control *Good Impression *Communality *Sense of Well-Being *Tolerance *Achievement via Conformance *Achievement via Independence *Intellectual Efficiency *Psychological-Mindedness *Flexibility *Femininity-Masculinity Educational Testing Services. (1992). \\"The ets test collection catalog:Affective measures and personality tests\\", Arizona: Oryx Press. Scoring The inventory contains 434 items which can be scored to yield 18 scales. The 18 scales are further grouped into four classes: (1) measures of poise, ascendancy, self-assurance, and interpersonal adequacy; (2) measures of socialization, responsibility, intrapersonal values, and character; (3) measures of achievement potential and intellectual efficiency; (4) measures of intellectual modes and interest modes.Gough, H.G. & Bradley, P. (1996). \\"CPI Manual.\\" Ed.3. Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press. This paragraph will discuss what are referred to as the Structural Scales of the CPI-462 version, using information being provided by the manual for that version, the CPI Administrator's Guide from 1987.Gough, H.G. (1987). California Psychological Inventory Administrator's Guide. Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc. Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma personality types are conveniently illustrated by a score's placement on a grid defined by the two dimensions - the degree to which the person is norm-favoring or norm- questioning on one dimension (called the v.2 scale), and the degree to which he or she is more externally or internally focused (the v.1 scale). Alpha personality types are more enterprising, dependable and outgoing. Betas are reserved, responsible and moderate. Gammas are adventurous, restless, and pleasure-seeking. Finally, Deltas are withdrawn, private, and to some extent disaffected. In a separate measure known as Realization, also referred to as the v.3 scale, a tester's score may reflect the degree to which he or she is reflective, capable, and optimistic about the present and future, when the score is high, or possesses the opposite characteristics when low. Thus, research scientists or medical or psychology graduate students tend to score high on this scale, while psychiatric patients, juvenile delinquents, prison inmates and even high school students in general (who lack life experience and are still forging a solid sense of identity) tend to score low. Another component of this test are the 20 Folk Concept Scales (18 in the CPI-434 version) - measuring Dominance, Capacity for Status, Sociability, Social Presence, Self-acceptance, Independence, Empathy, Responsibility, Socialization, Self-control, Good Impression, Communality, Well-being, Tolerance, Achievement via Conformance, Achievement via Independence, Intellectual Efficiency, Psychological-mindedness, Flexibility, and Femininity/Masculinity. These scales are called \\"folk\\" as they attempt to capture personality themes that should be broadly cross-cultural and easily understood around the world. This test is thus an attempt to tap into personality factors that arise without exception to some, varying, degree, in all humans regardless of cultural context, and which provide a picture of people's relatively stable tendencies and characteristics, which is as good as any definition for what is loosely termed their unique \\"personality.\\" Validity Correlations between CPI scales and related external criteria tend to fall in the .2 to .5 ranges [citation needed]. This degree of correlation is typical for much of personality research [citation needed]. Extremely high correlations are not likely to be found for personality measures because the scales typically try to assess rather broad behavioral tendencies. Norms are available for males only, females only, and male/female data combined. The CPI has been very popular in research and in individual assessments of adolescents and adults. The fact that it was developed and normed on non-psychiatric or non-clinical populations is regarded almost universally as part of its positive reputation and usefulness among psychologists. Reliability Despite the CPI's dichotomous response format, the reliabilities were uniformly high and held up well in both validation samples, averaging .85 in the scale development sample, .84 in the student validation sample, and even .83 in the much older community validation sample.Soto, J., Christopher, & John, P., Oliver. (2009). Using the california psychological inventory to assess the big five personality domains: A hierarchical approach [Electronic version]. \\"Journal of Research in Personality\\" 43, 25‚Äì38. *The scale development sample consisted of, 433 undergraduate students enrolled in psychology courses at a public university in California. Most participants were in their early 20s. The participants were diverse in terms of ethnicity: 31% were White/Caucasian, 50% were Asian/Asian-American, 8% were Hispanic/Latino, 2% were Black/African-American, and 9% were of another ethnicity. All participants completed the 462-item version of the CPI. *The student validation sample consisted of 396 undergraduate psychology students attending the same university as members of the scale development sample. All members of this sample This sample was similar to the scale development sample in terms of age and ethnicity, 30% White/Caucasian, 46% Asian/Asian-American, 8% Hispanic/Latino, 2% Black/African-American, 14% of another ethnicity. They completed the same version of the CPI within the same time constraints. *The community validation sample consisted of 520 adult residents of the Eugene-Springfield, Oregon area. The members of this sample were more heterogeneous from the other samples, in terms of gender, education, ethnicity, and age. They too completed CPI under the same circumstances as the other two sample groups.Goldberg, L. R. (1999). A broad-bandwidth, public domain, personality inventory measuring the lower-level facets of several five-factor models. In I. Mervielde, I.Deary, F. De Fruyt, & F. Ostendorf (Eds.). Personality psychology in Europe (Vol. 7, pp. 7‚Äì28). Tilburg, The Netherlands: Tilburg University Press. Critique of the test=Strengths CPI focuses on measuring and understanding common interpersonal behaviors (e.g., self-control, dominance etc.) in the general population.Groth-Marnat, G. (2009). Handbook of Psychological Assessment (5th edition). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and sons, Inc. Extreme scores on some of the scales provide important information on specific maladjustments an individual may be experiencing. Thus, it provides good coverage of information for the general population as compared to tests that are more pathologically oriented. CPI has generally straightforward and easily understood scale names, which makes it more user friendly for untrained professionals and test takers, for example. Besides that, the interpretation of the results may have more immediacy and relevancy to the test takers because the results relate to ongoing aspects of behaviors. In addition, CPI has been shown to be a useful tool in predicting long- and short-term behaviors (e.g., college attendance). The ‚Äúfolk concepts‚Äù used in CPI are found in many cultures and societies which makes CPI more adaptable to various cultures. Weaknesses CPI was not designed to predict unidimensional traits. Instead, the focus was on predicting interpersonal behaviors. Some Folk Concepts scales are substantially correlated with one another as they may be associated to the same underlying traits.Hattrup, K. (2003). Review of the California Psychological Inventory, Third edition. In the fifteenth mental measurements yearbook. Retrieved from OVID Mental Measurements Yearbook database. Gough argued that if the Folk Concepts are correlated in the minds of the general population, the CPI scales should be similarly correlated. As a result, CPI fails to provide a parsimonious and theory-oriented description of the normal personality, which is one of its major criticisms. There is also a lack of theoretical justification of the criteria used in developing the Folk Concepts and Special Purpose scales. It is unclear as to why some scales (e.g., dominance) are more basic and receive the status as ‚Äúfolk concepts‚Äù whereas others are labeled as ‚Äúspecial purpose‚Äù (e.g., anxiety). In addition, CPI was designed to be an open system,Megargee, E. I. (2009). The California Psychological Inventory. In J. N. Butcher (Ed.), Oxford Handbook of Personality Assessment (323 ‚Äì 335). New York, NY: Oxford University Press, Inc. which means that new scales can be added into the existing set of scales if a new criterion is to be predicted. With the lack of theoretical basis, there could be an infinite number of criteria to be predicted and these scales may be empirically redundant and lack clear psychological meanings. Another criticism of the CPI is that its norm samples are not representative of the general population, particularly because adults working in professional occupations are underrepresented in the norm samples.Atkinson, M. J. (2003). Review of the California Psychological Inventory, Third edition. In the fifteenth mental measurements yearbook. Retrieved from OVID Mental Measurements Yearbook database. Approximately 50% of the sample is composed of high school students and 16.7% of the sample are undergraduate students. Thus, the profiles forms used are more suited for evaluations of younger respondents. As a rule, clinicians also need to consider various factors such as life situation, reason for assessment, and overall pattern of scale elevation during result interpretation. This is because biased response from an individual may cause single a scale elevation which may not be meaningful if interpreted in isolation.

They received international recognition for their attacks on Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, and Francisco Franco. During the Second World War they established the TASS Windows for political cartoons and posters. After the end of the Second World War they continued to depict politics in their series ¬´Cold War¬ª (1945‚Äî1980s). They also illustrated a number of books, including Ilf and Petrov's, Nikolay Gogol, Mikhail Saltykov- Shchedrin, Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, Miguel de Cervantes. The Kukrynuksy are also authors of Socialist Realism-style paintings concerned with historical, political and propaganda topics. As individuals, they are also known as landscape and portrait artists. All three were awarded the honorary title of People's Artist of the USSR (1958). They were also recipients of other awards. There are more than a thousand works of the Kukryniksy in the collection of Alexandre Garese, which are now being restored and are supposed to be exhibited in Russia and France later.

Since 2002, the main tunnel of the mine has been converted into a tourist attraction. Some websites claim 35000-40000 visitors come here every year. In 2003 a major restoration work was carried out at the mines to make it a tourist destination. Decorative light-work was done and some of the salt crystal found here is translucent, meaning it absorbs some light and reflects some. Depending upon the thickness (among other properties), the salt rock glows when lit in many different shades. The tourist attractions inside the mine include Assembly Hall, Pul-saraat, indoor brine ponds, Badshahi Mosque, Sheesh Mahal, Crystal Valley, Minar-E-Pakistan, Narrow Gauge Electric Railway, Pakistan Post Office, salt crystal formations and old mining machinery.

As Copenore, it was one of the three villages listed as being on Portsea Island in the Domesday book. In the late 19th, early 20th century the rapid expansion of Portsmouth saw the original village engulfed. The west of the district is now a predominantly residential area of 1930s housing. The east of the district is an industrial and commercial area. It was originally intended to have a railway station; an intermediate station between and Portsmouth Town stations when the railway line opened. However, this never materialised, in spite of the large gap between stations, and the existence of a signalled level crossing for many years, replaced by a bridge in 1908.http://johnclintongrant.com/Starzina%20Z%20Railways%20Portsmouth.htm A road, \\"Station Road\\" was laid out, and still exists, however construction on the station never began. Copnor's unbuilt railway station was also to have been the interchange station for the short-lived Southsea Railway (1885-1914), but the station was ultimately opened in 1885 at Fratton instead.http://johnclintongrant.com/Starzina%20Z%20Railways%20Portsmouth.htm Portsmouth Airport was located in the north east of the district. After a number of accidents, the airport was closed in 1972. The land has subsequently been used for further commercial development and a housing development called Anchorage Park. Not to be mistaken as a part of Hilsea, another Portsmouth district, Copnor Road passes through Hilsea as well as through Copnor itself. Copnor is one of the smaller districts of Portsmouth. James Callaghan, who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1976 until 1979 and was in parliament from 1945 until 1987, was born at 38 Funtington Road in Copnor on 27 March 1912.

Postcard bought in London antique market in 2002 History No. 123 was designed by the Caledonian Railway's chief locomotive engineer Dugald Drummond in partnership with Neilson and Company which built the locomotive. The engine was a one-off design intended to represent both the railway and the builder at the International Exhibition of Industry, Science and Art held in Edinburgh rather than to fulfill any specific need for such a locomotive by the Caledonian. At the time single-driver locomotives were out of favour with railway companies due to their limited grip, poor acceleration, limited hill- climbing ability and low tractive effort with increasingly-heavy trains. The few that remained in service were restricted to long runs on flat terrain with lightweight carriages. Drummond adapted No. 123's design from his recently- introduced 66 Class 4-4-0 design (new examples of which were still being introduced to service when No. 123 was constructed). As locomotive superintendent of the Caledonian and designer of the 66 Class, protocol of the time dictated that Drummond was credited with the design of No. 123. However it is believed that William Weir (Drummond's chief draughtsman at the St. Rollox railway works) and Edward Snowball (Weir's counterpart at Neilson's) carried out the actual adaptation and design of the new Single. Drummond and the Caledonian also co-operated with another major Scottish locomotive builder, D√ºbs and Company, to produce a second engine for the same Exhibition. This resulted in Caledonian No. 124, a 4-4-0 which was, in essence, a more powerful 66 Class. Both engines were awarded gold medals for the Caledonian and their respective builders. The 'Exhibition Engine' used the same boiler, cylinders and front bogie as the 66 Class but an enlarged single driving wheel of seven feet (2.13 metres) diameter and a single trailing axle. Drummond had already designed a sanding system for the 66 Class. Sand was stored in sandboxes incorporated into the splasher for each front driving wheel and sprayed onto the track ahead of the driving wheels by compressed air supplied from the main air reservoir for the locomotive's Westinghouse air brake system. This was more efficient and reliable than the previous sanding systems which relied purely on gravity; it allowed the driver to apply sand to the rails to greatly improve adhesion in difficult conditions. Such a system would overcome the primary drawback of the traditional 'single' locomotive - its poor adhesion, especially when starting away from rest with heavier trains - while retaining its ability to cover long distances at high speeds. The same system was therefore incorporated into No. 123. The year of the Caledonian Single's construction saw the invention of the steam sander by Francis Holt of the Midland Railway which in turn led to the introduction of the Midland's own 'Spinner' singles. The effectiveness of the sanding gear fitted to No. 123 and the Caledonian engine's strong performance coupled to the invention of Holt's steam sanding gear (which was more useful to the majority of British railway companies that used vacuum brakes rather than the Westinghouse system) led to a revival in the use of the 'single' for express passenger work in the late 19th century. No. 123 became nationally famous during the Race to the North of August 1888 when the companies on the east- and west-coast main lines between London and Edinburgh competed to have the fastest times. During the month of the 'races', No. 123 was employed to work West Coast expresses on the Caledonian's section of the route between Carlisle and Edinburgh - a distance of 100 miles (160km) including the climbs to Beattock Summit and Shotts Summit. With special trains consisting of only two or three carriages and with signalling paths cleared in advance No. 123 frequently averaged more than over the route and on one occasion completed the journey non-stop in 101 minutes - an average speed of which confirmed the locomotive's performance abilities. As the only Caledonian engine capable of maintaining such speeds and the only one of her type, No. 123 was also used consistently throughout the month of the Races, being used on the fast northbound express every day for four weeks, which also proved the locomotive's reliability. Following its appearance at the 1886 exhibition the locomotive was retained for special duties by the Caledonian, being used for double heading express trains over Beattock Summit and working inspectors' and directors' trains with only one or two saloon carriages. She was also the Caledonian's favoured engine to act as pilot to the Royal Train which frequently used the Caledonian Main Line when transporting the royal family to and from Balmoral Castle. The Royal Train pilot ran light-engine 15 minutes ahead of the Royal Train itself, to warn of the train's approach and as a safety measure to ensure the line was clear and safe. Requiring high speeds and with no load, the Single was ideal for these duties. In 1914 it was placed on the Caledonian Railway duplicate list, and renumbered 1123. It entered London, Midland and Scottish Railway service in 1923 and the LMS renumbered it 14010 and gave it the power classification 1P. During the 1920s it painted LMS Maroon, and allocated to working the directors' saloon, but it was returned to regular service on the Dundee to Perth mainline in 1930, painted LMS black. The locomotive was withdrawn in 1935, by which time it was the last single-wheeled express engine running in Britain, and set aside for preservation.The observer's book of railway locomotives of Britain, revised and edited by H.

The engine is currently a static exhibit in the Riverside Museum in Pointhouse Place, Kelvinhaugh, Glasgow, to which it was moved when the former transport museum at Kelvinhall was closed. Modelling Tri-Ang released a model of No.123 in the 1960s, in Caledonian livery and labelling. This model shared its chassis with the model of the Dean Single released at the same time, and was powered by its single driving wheel. Following the other styles of modelling at the time, the model was produced up until the 1970s. Later it was revived in the 1980s in LMS Crimson livery, and was subsequently released in a limited-edition pack in its Caledonian colors. In 2007, the locomotive was released in LMS Black livery, with DCC capability being added to allow the locomotive to fit the then current range. A train pack entitled 'The Last Single Wheeler' was introduced in 2010 featuring the locomotive in LMS Crimson livery again, with three LMS carriages of the time. London Road Models supply an etched kit for a 4mm model, which creates a model of 123 in its pre 1924 condition, when it was re-boilered by the LMS.

Life He was born in Chadderton, Lancashire, England, and proceeded MA at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1588. In the 1590s Covell took part in the controversy about how far the newly reformed Church of England should abandon the liturgy and hierarchy of the past, to which debate he contributed several broadly anti-puritan works. In his later career he allied himself with Archbishop John Whitgift and afterwards with his successor, Richard Bancroft, who, like Covell, was Lancashire-born. William Covell died in 1613 at Mersham, Kent, where he was rector. Works Covell's interest to modern scholars now largely depends on one polemical work published in 1595, Polimanteia.Polimanteia, or, The meanes lawfull and unlawfull, to judge of the fall of a common-wealth, against the frivolous and foolish conjectures of this age, whereunto is added, a letter from England to her three daughters, Cambridge, Oxford, innes of court, and to all the rest of her inhabitants: perswading them to a constant unitie of what religion soever they are, for the defence of our dread soveraigne, and native cuntry: most requisite for this time wherein wee now live.

Population: History In the 13th century, the territory on which Kirillov now stands was a part of the Principality of Beloozero, which was taken over by the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 14th century. In 1397, St. Cyril of White Lake, a monk and a disciple of St. Sergius of Radonezh, founded the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery on the shore of Lake Siverskoye. A monastic sloboda, from which the town later grew, developed around the monastery. The monastery was subordinate to Archbishops of Rostov. In the 15th‚Äì17th centuries, the monastery developed into one of the most influential monasteries in Russia. It also helped that the Sheksna River was one of the most heavily used waterways connecting central and northern Russia. At some point, the monastery was the second biggest landowner after the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius. Vasili III of Russia, the Grand Prince of Moscow, and Ivan the Terrible, the Tsar, visited the monastery on several occasions. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the territory was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. The territory became a part of Charondsky Uyezd of Belozersk Province of Novgorod Governorate. In 1776, the territory was transferred to Novgorod Viceroyalty. At the same time, Kirillov was chartered and became the seat of Kirillovsky Uyezd. In 1796, the viceroyalty was abolished and the territory was transferred to Novgorod Governorate. Kirillovsky Uyezd was abolished as well; however, it was reestablished in 1802. In June 1918, five uyezds of Novgorod Governorate, including Kirillovsky Uyezd, were split off to form Cherepovets Governorate, with the administrative center in Cherepovets. On August 1, 1927 Cherepovets Governorate was abolished and its territory became Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. At the same time, uyezds were abolished and Kirillovsky District was established. On September 23, 1937, Kirillovsky District was transferred to newly established Vologda Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kirillov serves as the administrative center of Kirillovsky District.Resolution #178 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kirillovsky District as the town of district significance of Kirillov.Law #371-OZ As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Kirillov, together with two rural localities in Sukhoverkhovsky Selsoviet of Kirillovsky District, is incorporated within Kirillovsky Municipal District as Kirillov Urban Settlement.Law #1116-OD Economy=Industry There are enterprises of timber industry and food industry. Transportation Kirillov is connected by all-seasonal roads with Vologda, Cherepovets, Belozersk, and Vytegra. There are also local roads. The Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway (formerly known as the Mariinsk Canal System), connecting the Rybinsk Reservoir in the basin of the Volga with Lake Onega in the basin of the Neva, runs several kilometers from Kirillov, following the course of the Sheksna River. In the southern part of the town, one of the locks of the Northern Dvina Canal is located. The canal connects Lake Kubenskoye in the basin of the Northern Dvina with the Sheksna River, thus connecting the basins of the White Sea and the Volga. In the 19th century, the canal was the main waterway connecting the Volga with the White Sea. However, in the 1930s the White Sea ‚Äì Baltic Canal was built and the Northern Dvina Canal lost its significance. The canal is still in operation, serving cargo traffic and occasional cruise ships moving from the Sheksna to Lake Kubenskoye. Tourism The economy of Kirillov is mainly tourist- oriented. Kirillov has been a tourist attraction since the Soviet times.

Both sides of the piece of cardboard have the same image. The cardboard is hung vertically from a wire so it can rotate around continuously, or is attached to a vertical mechanically rotating axis for continuous rotation. When the rotation of the window is observed, the window appears to rotate through less than 180 degrees, though the exact amount of travel that is perceived varies with the dimensions of the trapezoid. It seems that the rotation stops momentarily and reverses its direction. It is therefore not perceived to be rotating continuously in one direction but instead is mis- perceived to be oscillating. This phenomenon was discovered by Adelbert Ames, Jr. During the 1960s, the concept of \\"transactional ambiguity\\" was studied and promulgated by some psychologists based on the use of the Ames Window. This hypothesis held that a viewer's mental expectation or \\"set\\" could affect the actual perception of ambiguous stimuli, extending the long-held belief that mental set could affect one's feelings and conclusions about stimuli to the actual visual perception of the stimuli itself. The Ames Window was used in experiments to test this hypothesis by having subjects look through a pinhole to view the rotating window with a grey wooden rod placed through one pane at an oblique angle. Subjects were divided into two experimental groups; one told that the rod was rubber and the other that it was steel. The hypothesis held that there should be a statistically significant difference between these two groups; the steel group more often seeing the rod cutting through the pane while the rubber group more often saw it as wrapping around it. These experiments were popular in university experimental psychology courses, with results sometimes supporting the hypothesis while other times not. Although literature describing \\"transactional ambiguity\\" and the hypothesis of the perceptual effect of mental set has largely disappeared from the scene, it remains an interesting and provocative use of the visually ambiguous demonstrations for which Ames was well known, and if true provides additional scientific foundation for the \\"eye witness\\" phenomenon well known in law enforcement and research circles.

Like similar fast, light aircraft of the period it was used by the RNAS and the RFC as a \\"scout\\", or fast reconnaissance type. It was one of the first single-seaters to be used as a fighter aircraft, although it was not possible to fit it with an effective forward-firing armament until the first British-designed gun synchronizers became available later in 1916, by which time the Scout was obsolescent. Single-seat fighters continued to be called \\"scouts\\" in British usage into the early 1920s. Design and development The Bristol Scout was designed in the second half of 1913 by Frank Barnwell and Harry Busteed, Bristol's chief test pilot, who thought of building a small high-performance biplane while testing the Bristol X.3 seaplane, a project which had been designed by a separate secret design department headed by Barnwell. The design was initially given the works number SN.183, inherited from a cancelled design for the Italian government undertaken by Henri Coanda, the half-finished fuselage of which remained in the workshops and the drawings for the aircraft bore this number.Barnes 1970, p.91 Bristol Scout prototype at the 1914 Olympia Aero Show The design was an equal-span single-bay biplane with staggered parallel-chord wings with raked wingtips and ailerons fitted to the upper and lower wings, which were rigged with about half a degree of dihedral, making them look almost straight when viewed from the front. The wing section was one designed by Coanda which had been used for the wings of the Bristol Coanda Biplanes. The rectangular- section fuselage was an orthodox wire-braced wooden structure constructed from ash and spruce, with the forward section covered with aluminium sheeting and the rear section fabric covered.The 80 h.p. Bristol \\"Scout\\", Flight, 25 April 1914, pp.434‚Äì6 It was powered by an 80 hp (60 kW) Gnome Lambda rotary engine enclosed in a cowling that had no open frontal area, although the bottom was cut away to allow cooling air to get to the engine. It had a rectangular balanced rudder with no fixed fin and split elevators attached to a non- lifting horizontal stabiliser. The fixed horizontal tail surfaces were outlined in steel tube with wooden ribs and the elevators constructed entirely of steel tube.Rebuilding Grandad's Scout 18 Dec 1913. Wednesday access date 28 March 2015 The revised Bristol Scout A in the late spring of 1914 The first flight was made at Larkhill on 23 February 1914 by Busteed and it was then exhibited at the March 1914 Aero Show at Olympia in London. After more flying at Larkhill the prototype, later referred to as the Scout A, was returned to the factory at Filton and fitted with larger wings, increasing the chord by six inches (15 cm) and the span from 22 ft (6.71 m) to 24 ft 7 in (7.49 m). These were rigged with an increased dihedral of ¬∞. Other changes included a larger rudder, a new open-fronted cowling with six external stiffening ribs distributed in symmetrically uneven angles around the cowl's sides (especially when seen from \\"nose-on\\") and fabric panel-covered wheels. It was evaluated by the British military on 14 May 1914 at Farnborough, when, flown by Busteed, the aircraft achieved an airspeed of 97.5 mph (157 km/h), with a stalling speed of 40 mph (64 km/h)Bruce, J. M.The Bristol Scout Part 1, Flight International, 26 September 1958, pp. 525‚Äì8 The aircraft was then entered for the 1914 Aerial Derby but did not take part because the weather on the day of the race was so poor that Bristol did not wish to risk the aircraft. By this time two more examples (works nos. 229 and 230) were under construction and the prototype was sold to Lord Carbery for ¬£400 without its engine. Carbery fitted it with an 80 hp Le Rh√¥ne 9C nine-cylinder rotary and entered it in the London‚ÄìManchester race held on 20 June but damaged the aircraft when landing at Castle Bromwich and had to withdraw. After repairs, including a modification of the undercarriage to widen the track, Carbury entered it in the London‚ÄìParis‚ÄìLondon race held on 11 July but had to ditch the aircraft in the English Channel on the return leg; while in France, only one of the two fuel tanks had been filled by mistake. Carbury managed to land alongside a ship and escaped but the aircraft was lost.Barnes 1970, pp92‚Äì3 The second Scout B produced (s/n 648) Numbers 229 and 230, later designated the Scout B when Frank Barnwell retrospectively gave type numbers to early Bristol aircraft, were identical to the modified Scout A, except for having half-hoop- style underwing skids, what appear to be six stiffening ribs positioned around the engine cowl's exterior circumferential surface (also made with a larger circular front opening for engine cooling when compared to the Scout A) and an enlarged rudder. Completed shortly after the outbreak of war in August 1914, they were requisitioned by the War Office. Given Royal Flying Corps serial numbers 644 and 648, one was allocated to No. 3 Squadron and the other to No. 5 Squadron for evaluation. Number 644 was damaged beyond repair on 12 November 1914 in a crash landing. Impressed by the performance of the aircraft, the War Office ordered twelve examples on 5 November and the Admiralty ordered a further 24 on 7 November.Barnes 1970, p. 94 The production aircraft, later called the Scout C, differed from their predecessors mainly in constructional detail, although the cowling was replaced by one with a small frontal opening and no stiffening ribs, the top decking in front of the cockpit had a deeper curve and the aluminium covering of the fuselage sides extended only as far as the forward centre-section struts, aft of which the decking was plywood. Operational history The actual Scout C, RFC serial no. 1611, flown by Lanoe Hawker on 25 July 1915 in his Victoria Cross-earning engagement. This aircraft also had the rear-location engine oil tank of the earliest Scout Cs. The period of service of the Bristol Scout (1914‚Äì1916) marked the genesis of the fighter aircraft as a distinct type and many of the earliest attempts to arm British tractor configuration aircraft with forward-firing guns were tested in action using Bristol Scouts. These began with the arming of the second Scout B, RFC number 648, with two rifles, one each side, aimed outwards and forwards to clear the propeller arc. Two of the Royal Flying Corps' early Bristol Scout C aircraft, numbers 1609 and 1611, flown by Captain Lanoe Hawker with No. 6 Squadron RFC, were each, in their turn ‚Äì as 1609 was written off from combat damage, 1611 received its gun mount hardware as its replacement‚Äîarmed with a Lewis machine gun on the left side of the fuselage, almost identical to the manner of the rifles tried on the second Scout B, using a mount that Hawker had designed. When Hawker downed two German aircraft and forced off a third on 25 July 1915 over Passchendaele and Zillebeke he was awarded the first-ever Victoria Cross for the actions of a British single-seat military scout/fighter pilot in aerial combat against an enemy's heavier-than- air aircraft, following the earlier VC awards to William Rhodes-Moorhouse (flying a B.E.2 two-seat observation biplane) and Reginald Warneford (flying against an enemy Zeppelin) in April and June 1915Sturtivant, Ray, British Naval Aviation: The Fleet Air Arm, 1917‚Äì1990, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1990, , p. 215.Whitehouse, Arch, The Zeppelin Fighters, New York: Ace Books, 1966, no ISBN, pp. 84‚Äì92. respectively. RNAS Bristol Scout D with twin unsynchronized Lewis guns fitted to mounts, similar to RFC Captain Hawker's Scout Cs, enabling them to be fired obliquely outside the arc of the propeller Some of the 24 initial production Scout Cs for the RNAS, were armed with one (or occasionally two) Lewis machine guns, sometimes with the Lewis gun mounted on top of the upper wing centre section in the manner of the Nieuport 11; more common was a very dubious choice of placement by some RNAS pilots, in mounting the Lewis gun on the forward fuselage of their Scout Cs, just as if it were a synchronized weapon, firing directly forward and through the propeller arc, an action likely to result in serious damage to the propeller. The type of bullet-deflecting wedges that Roland Garros had tried on his Morane-Saulnier Type N monoplane were also tried on one of the RFC's last Scout Cs, No. 5303 but since this seemed to have also required the use of the Morane Type N's immense \\"casserole\\" spinner, which almost totally blocked cooling air from reaching the engine, the deflecting-wedge method was not pursued further with Bristol Scouts.Shores and Rolfe 2001, pp. 10‚Äì11. An RNAS Scout was the first landplane to be flown from a ship, when Flt. Lt. H. F. Towler flew No. 1255 from the flying deck of the seaplane carrier HMS Vindex on 3 November 1915.Bruce, J. M.The Bristol Scout Pt II Flight International 3 October 1958, pp. 544‚Äì6 As an attempted defence against German airships, some RNAS Scout Ds were equipped with Ranken Darts, a flechette with 1 lb (0.45 kg) of explosive per projectile, released from a pair of vertical cylindrical containers under the pilot's seat, each containing 24 darts.Bruce, J. M. The Bristol Scout Part V Flight International, 31 October 1958, pp.701‚Äì11 On 2 August 1916, Flt. Lt. C. T. Freeman flew a Scout from the deck of Vindex and attacked Zeppelin L 17 with Ranken Darts. None of the darts did any damage to the Zeppelin, and since Freeman's aircraft could not land on the Vindex and was too far from land for a safe return, he had to ditch his Scout D after the attack. Vickers-Challenger synchroniser fitted to Bristol Scout ‚Äì showing the linkage between the engine and the gun In March 1916, RFC Scout C No.5313 was fitted with a Vickers machine gun, synchronised to fire through the propeller by the awkward Vickers-Challenger synchronising gear, the only gear available to the RFC at that time. Six other Scouts, late Scout Cs and early Scout Ds, were also fitted with the same combination. Types using this gear (including the B.E.12, the R.E.8 and the Vickers F.B.19) all had the gun mounted on the port side of the fuselage. The attempt to use the gear for synchronising a centrally mounted gun on the Bristol Scout failed and tests, which continued at least until May 1916, resulted in the abandonment of the idea and no Vickers-armed Bristol Scouts were used in operations. None of the RFC or RNAS squadrons operating the Bristol Scout were exclusively equipped with this aircraft and by the end of the summer of 1916, no new Bristol Scout aircraft were being supplied to the British squadrons of either service, the early fighter squadrons in RFC service being equipped instead with the Airco DH.2 single-seat Pusher configuration fighter. A small number of Bristol Scouts were sent to the Middle East (in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Palestine) in 1916. Others served in Macedonia and with the RNAS in the Eastern Mediterranean. The last known Bristol Scout in military service was the former RNAS Scout D No. 8978 in Australia, which was based at Point Cook, near Melbourne, as late as October 1926. Once the Bristol Scouts were no longer required for frontline service they were reallocated to training units, although many were retained by senior officers as personal \\"runabouts\\". Variants=Scout A The single prototype aircraft. Scout B Two manufactured, identical to the modified Scout A except for having half-hoop-style underwing skids and an enlarged rudder. Type 1 Scout C A Bristol Scout C (No.1255) in RNAS service, with added accommodation for the engine oil tank behind the cockpit Similar to the previous Scout B. These early Scout Cs, in a total run of 36 aircraft ‚Äî twelve for the Royal Flying Corps, and 24 for the RNAS ‚Äî also had their main oil tank moved to a position directly behind the pilot's shoulders, requiring a raised rear dorsal fairing immediately behind the pilot's seat to accommodate it. These aircraft used a small-central opening, \\"dome-fronted\\" cowl that were only intended for use with the 80 hp Gnome Lambda seven cylinder rotary engine, curiously the rotary engine choice the Royal Naval Air Service favored. Following the initial run of 36 Scout C airframes, later Scout C production batches, consisting of 50 aircraft built for the RNAS and 75 for the RFC, changed the cowl to a flat-fronted shorter-depth version able to house either the Gnome Lambda rotary, or the alternate choice of a nine- cylinder 80 hp Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary engine when the Gnome Lambda was not used, and moved the oil tank forward to a position in front of the pilot for better weight distribution and more reliable engine operation. The later, relatively \\"flat\\"-fronted cowl for the remaining Scout C aircraft still had the small opening of the domed unit, with both cowl designs having a circumferential slot-style cutaway made at mid-cowl depth of about one-sixth the circumference, to the lowest perimeter of the cowl to increase the cooling effect, and to allow any unburned fuel/oil mix to drain away. A total of some 161 Scout C airframes were produced for the British military as a whole, with the transition to the Scout D standard taking place in a gradual progression of feature changes. Types 2, 3, 4 and 5 Scout D The last, and most numerous production version, the Scout D, gradually came about as the result of a series of further improvements to the Scout C design. One of the earliest changes appeared on seventeen of the 75 naval Scout Cs with an increase in the wing dihedral angle from ¬∞ to 3¬∞ and other aircraft in the 75 aircraft naval production run introduced a larger-span set of horizontal tail surfaces and a broadened-chord rudder, shorter-span ailerons and a large front opening for the cowl, much like that of Scout B but made without the external stiffening ribs instead. The newer cowl was sometimes modified with a blister on the starboard lower side for more efficient exhaust-gas scavenging, as it was meant to house the eventual choice of the more powerful, nine-cylinder 100 hp Gn√¥me Monosoupape B2 rotary engine in later production batches, to improve the Scout D's performance. Some 210 examples of the Scout D version were produced, with 80 of these being ordered by the RNAS and the other 130 being ordered by the Royal Flying Corps.\\"Bristol Scout D.\\" Fleet Air Arm Museum.

The aircraft slowly took form at his home, then in Poughkeepsie, New York, through the early 1980s, when it was completed, then brought to the nearby Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome and flown once there successfully, ending in a slight mishap without injury. The uncovered complete airframe, with engine, is today on display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton, UK. The other is a reproduction Bristol Scout C, a reproduction of No. 1264, one of the first 24 Scout Cs built for the RNAS, but using the preserved joystick, rudder bar and still-functional Bosch starting magneto from the original No. 1264 aircraft. David and Richard Bremner of the UK, grandchildren of the original pilot of No. 1264, wanted to create an airworthy tribute to their grandfather, RNAS pilot Francis Donald Holden Bremner, in 2002 using the artifacts of their grandfather's original. Research started in 2002, with construction of the airframe starting in 2008. The first flight of the reproduction, powered likewise to Opdycke's earlier reproduction project with a Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary, occurred on 9 July 2015, with a visit to the area around Gallipoli where their grandfather's aircraft was based from December 1915 to August 1916 to fly the reproduction where their grandfather's original Scout C flew against the Central Powers.

Originally called Shodfriars Lane, football was first played on the site since the late 19th century by a variety of Boston teams, but it was only used by Boston United since 1933. In the late 1970s the ground was rebuilt. Although the ground currently had a maximum capacity of 6,643, the record crowd was 11,000 against Derby County. 10 further attendances of more than 8,000 are on record. Boston United left the York Street ground at the end of the 2019/20 season. The ground will be redeveloped and Boston United will move into the new Quadrant development at Wyberton http://www.thequadrantboston.co.uk/the-project/football-stadium/ History The ground has stood in the centre of the town of Boston since the 19th century, and has been given a variety of names since its construction. For 40 years before York Street's current tenants, Boston United were founded it was known as 'Main Ridge'. In the mid-1950s the York Street Stand was built, and the ground's first floodlights were installed. These were first played under in 1955, when over 9,000 fans watched Boston's first floodlit game against Corby Town. The new floodlights, erected in each of the four corners of the ground, allowed the Pilgrims to play in various floodlit competitions. In 1977 York Street failed an inspection for league grading, leading to local fundraising in 1978 which resulted in new terracing, stands, floodlights, toilets, turnstiles and snack bars.

It also holds the Directors' seating and dugouts. Benton Brothers York Street Stand The Benton Brothers York Street Stand is situated to the east of the pitch. The right-hand side of this stand is reserved for away supporters, who are accommodated by flat terracing as well as the benches above. Entry for this section is through turnstiles 3 and 4. Home supporters access the stand through turnstiles 5 and 6. It is an unusual stand with both terracing near the pitch and seating above and behind. Its capacity is 1,435 with 503 seated. The players' changing rooms, tunnel, boardroom, medical centre and pressbox are housed here. Spayne Road Terrace The Spayne Road Terrace is situated to the south of the pitch.

Formerly reserved for away fans, it is now allocated as a home stand. Supporters enter through turnstiles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. It has a maximum capacity of 1,821. Ground grading The ground has a Grade A certificate, meaning that it fulfils the Football League ground requirements. For this, the club had to install temporary seats in the centre of the Benton Brothers York Street End during their spell in the Football League, according to former Chairman Jon Sotnick. The ground's Grade A status means that all matches held there must be segregated. Lease Boston United F.C. has 9 years left on the ground's land lease. The ground is rented from the Malkinson family. The land cannot be developed before the lease ends, unless Boston United no longer exist or have found an alternative home. The land is owned by the Malkinson family, however the stands are owned by Boston United. Other uses The ground has been used for a variety of other purposes besides football matches. It is also currently used as the club's offices, and the Supporters' Trust hold meetings in its Boardroom. Public meetings have been held inside the ground, as have Community Days and fireworks displays. 'The Boston United Sports Bar' is located in the ground's car park. In March 2009 the club took over the running of the bar, which has provision for drinks, pool, and television. York Street held its most recent international match on 5 March 2009. England Under-18 Schoolboys beat Wales Under-18 Schoolboys 3-0, with a pre-match Japanese drum display and half-time cheer-leading routine taking place on the pitch. Greyhound racing Independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place around the pitch at Shodfriars Lane from 1932 until 1939. The company responsible for bringing greyhounds to the stadium were called the Boston Greyhound Racing Club. The first meeting was held on Wednesday 25 May 1932 and was attended by over 1,000. Due to the outbreak of war the track was forced to close and never re-opened. Transport Boston is the nearest railway station to the ground; it is less than away and sign posted throughout the town. Road travel to the ground from outside the area is by the A1 and the A17 Sleaford to Boston road. From the town access to York Street is along John Adams Way and Main Ridge.

Christian Brothers' school The locality is most notable for the extensive campus of the Christian Brothers boarding school, known as Bindoon. The school is now called Edmund Rice College. It was previously Catholic Agricultural College at Bindoon. Before that it was called Keaney College, named in honour of its former principal Br. Paul Francis Keaney, who used young child migrants as forced labour to construct the college's huge stone building.

A series of inquiries, as well as the research of Margaret Humphreys, found that systemic sexual, physical and emotional abuse was perpetrated at the school. In one instance, a priest used a bullet attached to a stick to penetrate students as a form of punishment. In 1989, Senator Jean Jenkins, the Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia, raised the issue in the nation's Senate on behalf of the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia and a number of individual former child migrants who had asked for her support.Senate Adjournment debate, 17 August 1989 at Parliament of Australia In 1994, the Parliament of Western Australia was presented a petition with 30,000 signatures which demanded an inquiry into the sexual and physical assaults that took place in Bindoon.

Retrieved 14 June 2012 In Game 4 of the 1997 American League Championship Series, on a wild pitch with runners dashing around the bases, when Merrill gestured to where the ball was, Fox color commentator Tim McCarver sarcastically commented that \\"maybe he was trying to tell himself where the ball is!\\" Merrill heard about that, took offense to it, and fired back in his autobiography that he was letting the other umpires know that the situation was under control. Merrill wore number 33 starting in 1980 when the AL adopted uniform numbers. He came into the AL in 1977, the year that the league made all new umpires on staff wear the inside chest protector, which had been standard in the NL for over 60 years. Merrill had one of the largest strike zones in baseball, and was easily recognizable when calling balls and strikes, as he crouched directly behind the catcher and often extended his arms far in front of him. Most home plate umpires work in the \\"slot\\", which is to the inside shoulder of the catcher (the left shoulder for a right-handed batter and the right shoulder for a left-handed batter). Memorabilia collection Merrill amassed a large memorabilia collection consisting of signed baseballs, game used jerseys and bats from MLB players. He displayed his collection over the years for the benefit of his charitable efforts of various causes. The collection not only consisted of items he obtained, but he was also entrusted with many items from former umpire Shag Crawford. Death Merrill suffered a heart attack in early January 2003, and died a few days later in Texarkana, Texas, at age 64.

G. Sebald. It won the Berlin Literature Prize, the Literatur Nord Prize, and the Johannes Bobrowski Medal. The English translation by Michael Hulse was first published in 1996. Summary In The Emigrants, Sebald's narrator recounts his involvement with and the life stories of four different characters, all of whom are emigrants (to England and the United States). As with most of Sebald's work, the text includes many black and white, unlabeled photographs and strays sharply from general formats of plot and narrative. Dr. Henry Selwyn is the estranged husband of Sebald's landlady. Selwyn fought in the First World War and has an interest in gardening and tending to animals. He confides in Sebald about his Lithuanian Jewish family's immigration to England from Lithuania, and suspects that it is this secretive, alien past that contributed to the dissolution of his relationship with his wife. He commits suicide by inserting a gun in his mouth. Paul Bereyter was the narrator's childhood teacher in a town referenced in the text only as \\"S\\". A quarter Jewish, he found employment difficult in the period leading up to the Second World War, although he eventually served in the Wehrmacht. Teaching in the small school after the war, Bereyter found a passion for his students while living a lonely, quiet life. In later years, his eyesight began to fail and he moved to France, where he met and spent much time with Mme Landau, from whom the narrator obtains most of his information about Bereyter. Like Selwyn, Bereyter commits suicide, by lying down on railway tracks. The narrator's great uncle, Ambros Adelwarth, was the travelling companion of Cosmo Solomon, an affluent American aviator, gifted with much luck at gambling and a wayward attitude towards life. In his youth, he accompanied this man across Europe, and into Turkey and Asia Minor, before Cosmo fell ill and was sent to a mental institution. It is implied that there may have been some homosexual feelings between the two men. After Cosmo's death, Adelwarth was the butler of the young man's family, living on Long Island until first Cosmo's father, then second wife, died. In his later years, Ambros falls victim to an extreme depression which causes him to commit himself to the same institution that once held Cosmo. He allows and, in his own way, even encourages increasingly frequent and brutal electro-convulsive therapy to be performed on him by the institution's fanatical director. As a young man in Manchester the narrator befriends an expatriate German-Jewish painter, Max Ferber. Years later the artist gives the narrator his mother's history of her idyllic life as a girl in a Bavarian village. It was written as she and her husband awaited deportation to the East and death. This section is written as a gradual discovery on the narrator's part of the effects of the Holocaust on Ferber and his family. Themes The Emigrants is largely concerned with memory, trauma, and feelings of foreignness. For example, Dr. Selwyn dwells on the story of a man he met in Switzerland in the time immediately prior to World War I, and explains how he felt a deeper companionship with this man than he ever did his wife. He also divulges how his family emigrated from Lithuania as a young boy, and tries to get the narrator to reveal how he feels being an emigrant from Germany living in England. In acknowledgement of this motif, Lisa Cohen of the Boston Review points out that The Emigrants' section-title characters \\"suffer[ ] from memory and from the compulsion to obliterate it; from a mourning and melancholia so deep that it is almost unnamable; from the knowledge that he has survived while those he loved have not; from problems distinguishing dream and reality; from a profound sense of displacement.\\"Lisa Cohen. \\"Review, Prose: The Emigrants\\", Boston Review, February/March 1997. A concomitant theme is the impact of World War II and the Holocaust on German nationals, particularly on those of Jewish heritage. All the characters in the work are emigrants who have left Germany or a Germanised community, each specific case has its nuances. For example, Paul Bereyter remains in his homeland but becomes an outsider because of the persecution he experiences as a Jew; Ambros Adelwarth is a non-Jewish character, but has close affiliations with a family of German-Jewish emigrants as the family's major-domo, and the affiliation makes him feel the angst of the war more sharply from abroad. Generally speaking, the narratives explore the different senses in which the characters' homeland can remain with them‚Äîin the form of both memories and memorabilia‚Äîas they approach the end of their lives. Publication history The character Max Aurach's last name, which is close to the name of his real-world inspiration, Frank Auerbach, was changed to Ferber in English translations. Reception Upon publication, the English version of The Emigrants was well received by critics, and has since gained increasing recognition. Cynthia Ozick strongly praised both Sebald and Hulse, speculating that \\"we are indebted...to Sebald's translator (himself a poet), for allowing us to see, through the strained glass of his consummate Englishing, what must surely be the most delicately powerful German prose since Thomas Mann.\\" Ozick, Cynthia. ‚ÄúThe Posthumous Sublime‚Äù. The New Republic, Vol. 215, No. 25. Dec 16, 1996, pp. 33-38. Lisa Cohen offered similarly strong praise, hailing The Emigrants' ‚Äúuncanny vividness and specificity,‚Äù concluding that ‚Äúthe brilliance of this book lies in the fact that Sebald never loses sight of either the power of metaphor or the viciousness of history.‚Äù Daniel Medin noted in 2003 that \\"Hulse's 1996 translation of Die Ausgewanderten introduced Sebald to audiences beyond...German [readership], and [Sebald] was hailed immediately as a new and compelling voice in contemporary European fiction.\\" Medin, Daniel L. \\"Review: W.G.

He was best known as a member of the trio Lambert, Hendricks & Ross. Lambert spent a lifetime experimenting with the human voice, and expanding the possibilities of its use within jazz. Career Lambert's band debut was with Johnny Long's Orchestra in the early 1940s. Along with early partner Buddy Stewart, Lambert successfully brought singing into modern jazz (concurrently with Ella Fitzgerald). In the late 1950s he teamed with wordsmith and vocalese pioneer Jon Hendricks. The two were later joined by Annie Ross, and the lineup was a hit. After Ross left the group in 1962, Lambert and Hendricks went on without her by using various replacements, but the partnership ended in 1964. He then formed a quintet called \\"Lambert & Co.\\" which included the multiple voices of Mary Vonnie, Leslie Dorsey, David Lucas, and Sarah Boatner. The group auditioned for RCA in 1964, and the process was documented by filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker in a 15-minute documentary entitled Audition at RCA,. It was one of the last images recorded of Lambert, as two years later he was killed in a highway incident. Death Accounts of Lambert's death vary slightly in details. It is established that he was on the Connecticut Turnpike and that a flat tire was involved and that he was struck by a tractor-trailer truck driven by Floyd H. Demby in the early hours of October 3, 1966. The disabled vehicle was not fully off the roadway and its lights were turned off. In addition, an account on D. A. Pennebaker's website states that the accident was on the Merritt Parkway. Some accounts mention that Richard Hillman was killed in the same incident. Newspaper stories differ about whose vehicle was disabled. Jet magazine's account says it was a panel truck owned by Lambert. Jon Hendricks' telling of the story says that Lambert was a compulsive do-gooder and that he had stopped to assist another motorist. The newspaper follow-up stories say that Demby was not at fault and that Lambert and Hillman were in the roadway when they were struck.

This definition is closely associated with libraries in England before the Public Libraries Act 1850 was passed which allowed cities to use taxes to create and maintain libraries but did not require cities build them.Lerner, Fred (1998) The Story of Libraries. New York: Continuum, p. 143. This definition is also applicable in the United States before 1850 and widespread School District Library Acts which were passed in many states at the same time. It may also refer to a library or other institution that sends materials on request to another library, usually via interlibrary loan.

Types of lending libraries Wolfsburg Municipal Library by Alvar AaltoDas Alvar-Aalto-Kulturhaus auf der Website des Alvar Aalto Zentrums Deutschland e.V. Wolfsburg, retrieved Jan. 25, 2015 Professor Thomas Gram Bell Kelly was the first library historian to address the problem of classification and nomenclature of libraries in his book Early public libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850. Leeds Library (founded 1768) a private subscription or proprietary library, is also referred to as a public library and a circulating library, illustrating the need for a taxonomy that is not confusing. The major classifications, based on ownership are endowed libraries, institutional libraries (the most diverse), public libraries, and subscription libraries.Oll√©, James. Library History. London: Clive Bingley, 1979, p. 36. Without tax from the community a library may be created with a gift or endowment, by subscription, or by adding it on to an existing structure or institution which also serves other purposes. Cost is assumed by the donor or donors in an endowed library; it is assumed by the users in a subscription library, and could or could not be assumed by the users depending on the function of the institution, these variations could be combined in some cases.Kelly, Thomas. Early Public Libraries: a history of public libraries in Great Britain before 1850. London: Library Association, 1966, p. 68. Private libraries are not covered by Kelly due to individual or small group ownership and his focus on the 'public' aspect of these institutions. The University of Zambia Library is an academic Library, which was founded in 1966 and officially opened in August 1969 by the first Republican President, Dr Kenneth D. Kaunda. Endowment libraries The Christ Church Library Between the Reformation and the end of the eighteenth century, over two hundred endowed libraries are known to have been established in England alone, and existed due to the private library collections of individual benefactors or occasionally to multiple benefactors. Controlled by the local clergy, almost all endowed libraries were attached to parish churches in towns and cities, and were kept in the vestry, in the parvis over the south porch, in the parsonage, or in some nearby adjoining building. Frequently the books were chained, similar to those in the Francis Trigge Chained Library and at Christ Church Library. The two dozen or so libraries that did not match this template in England include a small but important group which were controlled from early on or the start by municipal corporations, founded in market towns before 1680. Parish church libraries Early parish church libraries were stated to be for the use of local layman and clergy, but the books were not in English, were largely in Latin, and exclusively theological in character. Thomas Bray an Anglican cleric who originally had the idea of the parish library, who wrote in 1697, \\"An Essay Towards Promoting all Necessary and Useful Knowledge, Both Divine and human, In all the Parts of His Majesty's Dominions, Both at Home and Abroad\\", wanted the church to acquire books and lend them to the general public as well as the parishioners and clergy. Though the collections were mainly religious, the collection extended to literature and the classics, due to an underlying desire of Bray to guide education in a proper fashion. He also lobbied for public financing, and promoted the circulation of books so that the inhabitants of the parish could take them home.Lowell, Martin. Enrichment: A History of the Public Library in the United States in the Twentieth Century. Lanham, M.D.: Scarecrow Press, 1998, p. 1-2. Some contemporary churches such as St James' Church, Sydney maintain lending libraries on theological and religious subjects for the use of their parishioners.  Parochial libraries  Parochial libraries were defined by Kelly to distinguish them from parish church libraries, whose books could be used by the locals and were often chained to desks. Parochial libraries instead were restricted to the use of parochial authorities, and often meant only for reference. The Church of England after the Restoration wished to reform the ministry of the church by investing in the learning and development of their pastoral care and teaching. Building libraries in poor benefices and isolated ones was part of that initiative, and an extension of a major philanthropic movement during that time. The movement included charity schools which would teach the children of the poor the Catechism and to read, establishing trust funds for the poor, and develop programs to repair existing parish churches and build new churches.Jacob, W. M.. \\"Libraries for the parish: individual donors and charitable societies.\\" The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 65-66  Municipal corporation libraries  Municipal corporation libraries were to be for the use of shopkeepers and aldermen, and to disseminate knowledge, but the one in Bristol, according to its catalog, revealed that all the early books were not in English but were in Greek or Latin, limiting their usefulness. Other libraries that were bequeathed or endowed by individual citizens to towns and cities, were managed by a non- religious group of trustees, such as in Manchester, where the library was managed by a self elected body of up to twenty-four members, who also had the duty to purchase new books, even though they employed a full-time librarian. In Leicester, the library was looked upon by townsfolk with civic pride, proclaiming that the library would bring fame, honor, and renown to the Corporation and place it was located. Bristol, Leicester and Manchester libraries all chained their books to the book press or desk for security purposes, at Leicester this was done right to the 1820s.Powell, Michael. \\"Endowed libraries for towns.\\" The Cambridge History Of Libraries In Britain And Ireland. 3 vols. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006, 88-99  Institutional libraries  Institutional libraries in England were originally almost non-existent in 1750; however, by 1850 there was an established network of these specialized libraries, which had been developed mostly through private enterprise, though some government involvement had started. The specialized libraries were mainly medical libraries which early on included chemistry and botany, and later developed to serve medical professionals. Since there were few professional scientists before 1850, people interested in science relied mainly on general circulating libraries, rather than institutional libraries to meet their needs.Symons, John. \\"Scientific and medical libraries: the rise of the institution.\\" The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain and Ireland. 3 vols. Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 388-389  Social libraries  Social libraries peaked in significance by the mid-nineteenth century, and all their many forms have been the object of intense research in North America and Europe. Davis and Tucker explain that: > \\"The term social library has come to signify the kind of library that > generally provided a circulating collection of materials and frequently a > reading room for the use of any persons meeting the established criteria, > which usually involved a fee or subscription, or a payment to become a joint > owner or stockholder, of the library\\".Davis, Donald G., Jr., Tucker, John > Mark. American Library History: a comprehensive guide to the literature. > Santa Barbara, California: Clio Press Ltd., 1989, p. 56. These libraries were often referred to as \\"public libraries\\" during the nineteenth century. This appellation over time came to describe tax-supported, publicly administered libraries open to all regardless of class, race or age for free on an equal basis, at least in theory. It is understandable that the nomenclature of libraries is varied among patrons, employees and historians, who have had the difficult task of defining and separating the various types of libraries into manageable classifications.  Hidden libraries  It is impossible to cover all types of libraries throughout all stages of history and classify or define them to the satisfaction of all, but the variety and evolution of libraries needs to be explored further. Hidden libraries is a widespread description of libraries in any place from prisoner-of-war camps, military installations, motels, hotels, inns, the home, alternative communities, pubs, restaurants, laundrettes, holiday camps, coffee houses, community centres, in accommodations and facilities for workers and servants, lighthouse and seamen's establishments, prisons and asylums and is not complete. Libraries connected to transportation also abound from airliners, railways, tramcars, buses, various ships, and way stations.Black, Alistair, & Hoare, Peter. \\"Libraries and the modern world.\\" The Cambridge History of Libraries in Britain and Ireland. 3 vols.

Le Lacheur is widely credited in Costa Rica with having transformed the economy of the country by establishing a direct regular trade route for Costa Rican coffee growers to the European market, thereby helping to establish the Costa Rican coffee trade. Biography=Early life William Le Lacheur was born on 15 October 1802 and was baptised Guillaume Le Lacheur (using the French version of the forename) in the parish church of the Forest, Guernsey, on 31 October by his parents Jean Le Lacheur and Marie Suzanne (n√©e Allez).

By 1836, he had formed a company Le Lacheur & Co, which owned two ships: Minerva and Dart. Over the following years, he continued to add to his fleet, and to seek out new markets. In 1841, Le Lacheur took delivery of the barque Monarch. The Monarch was a much larger vessel and capable of journeys further afield. During a stop at the port of Mazatl√°n, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, he learnt from the British Consul of the difficulty that the Costa Rican coffee growers were having in finding a market for their produce. Since its independence in 1821, Costa Rica had found no regular trade routes for its coffee in European markets. This was compounded by transportation problems. The coffee-growing areas were located in the central part of the country and it was impossible, because of the mountains and the rainy forest, to send the coffee to the Caribbean Sea and therefore to the Atlantic. It was much easier to ship the coffee to a Pacific port, Puntarenas, and to sail around Cape Horn to the Atlantic. The Caribbean railway from San Jos√© to the Caribbean port called Puerto Lim√≥n were not built until 1888. William saw a business opportunity, and agreed with Costa Rican coffee growers to establish a regular service to carry their coffee to London. In 1843, the Monarch arrived in Puntarenas and loaded the first cargo of nearly 5,000 bags of coffee. The venture was a success, and he began increasing the size of his fleet to accommodate the increasing demand for coffee in London. During the rest of the 1840s, he diverted his other ships from the fruit trade to the coffee trade. Then, starting in 1850, he commissioned the construction of five ships designed especially for the coffee trade. During the 1860s, a further seven ships were added to the fleet.  Contribution to Costa Rica  In addition to his contribution to the Costa Rican economy through establishing trade routes, Le Lacheur made a significant impact on the development of a number of other aspects of Costa Rica. = Religious life = Le Lacheur, a devout Christian, was appalled by what he described \\"the lowest form of the Roman faith\\" being practised, where superstition took precedence over true religion. Through the British and Foreign Bible Society, he obtained and distributed Spanish language Bibles, thereby introducing the Protestant faith into Costa Rica. He distributed 3,500 bibles in Costa Rica, and was presented with an inscribed Imperial Quarto Bible by the Bible Society in recognition of his achievements. In 1864, the year after Le Lacheur's death, it was resolved to build the first Protestant church in Costa Rica. It was made of pre-fabricated iron, was carried to Costa Rica by Le Lacheur's son John and was assembled in San Jos√© as the Church of the Good Shepherd, see of the Episcopal Church of Costa Rica (Anglican faith). It became unofficially known as the 'Iron Church'. When it was rebuilt in 1937 with more traditional materials, a memorial plaque was erected to Le Lacheur with an inscription which includes the phrase \\"by whose exertions public Protestant worship was established in this Republic\\". = Education = Once Le Lacheur had established a fleet of ships that were regularly making journeys between Costa Rica and London, he arranged with several Costa Rican families to take their sons to England for their education. This has been cited as a contributing factor to Costa Rica's economic success. In 1822, James Gerard (a scottish mining prospector) and Richard Trevithick took two costarican schoolboys Jos√© Mar√≠a Montealegre (a future president of Costa Rica 1859-1863) and his younger brother Mariano to a boarding school the UK; the elder studied medicine and became a surgeon at Aberdeen University. Le Lacheur \\"took young Costa Ricans to England and installed them in professional schools, fretting over them like a parent and taking them back to Costa Rica, prepared to fill important roles as professionals\\" (Wilton Nelson, 1985; cited by Julio Murray and John L. Kater Jrhttp://www.obturcaribe.ucr.ac.cr/documentos-publicaciones/articulos- cientificos/historia/289-the-episcopal-church-in-costa-rica-its-first- century/file). This arrangement was also responsible for the introduction of the game of football to Costa Rica. = Defence = When William Walker, an American filibuster, attempted to invade Costa Rica in 1856, the Costa Rican government declared war. However, the march from the Costa Rican military base in San Jos√© to the northern border was an arduous one. Le Lacheur put his ships at the disposal of the Costa Rican military commanders to transport the army up the coast to the border so that they would arrive fit and ready to fight. As a result, they successfully repelled the filibusters.The William Walker Episode Memorials He is buried in Highgate Cemetery in London.

The lamps traditionally burn clarified yak butter, but now often use vegetable oil or vanaspati ghee. The butter lamps help to focus the mind and aid meditation. According to the Root tantra of Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra, \\"If you wish for sublime realization, offer hundreds of lights\\".http://www.khandro.net/ritual_offering_light.htm Pilgrims also supply lamp oil to gain merit. The monks in the monastery manage the actual lamps, taking extreme care to avoid starting one of the devastating fires which have damaged many monasteries over the years. For safety, butter lamps are sometimes restricted to a separate courtyard enclosure with a stone floor. Externally, the lights are seen to banish darkness. Conceptually, they convert prosaic substance into illumination, a transformation akin to the search for enlightenment. Esoterically, they recall the heat of the tummo yoga energy of the Six Yogas of Naropa, an important text for Kagyu, Gelug, and Sakya schools of tantric Buddhism.

It serves the town of Wallan, and opened on 18 April 1872.Wallan Vicsig History The station opened as Wallan Wallan on 18 April 1872, the line having opened a few months earlier, as part of the North East line to Wodonga. The main town on the Hume Highway has since become known as Wallan, while the township beside the railway has become known as Wallan East. The first goods shed was provided in 1873, with a loading platform for timber erected the next year. In 1876, the goods shed was replaced, and the current wooden building on the Down platform provided. The first lever frame was provided in 1895, with a separate signal box on the Up platform provided in 1916. Wallan was provided with a number of sidings to marshal trains for the Heathcote line, which branched off the North East line at Heathcote Junction. A small locomotive depot was also provided, along with a long turntable in 1892. The yard was substantially expanded in 1913, for increasing timber traffic on the Heathcote line, including sidings worked by gravity. In 1933, an additional turntable was provided. Between 1961 and 1965, the locomotive servicing facilities were removed, while the late 1980s and early 1990s saw the removal of the remaining sidings. Further removal of a number of points and signals were undertaken in April 1991. It was also around this time that a crossover was provided at the Down end of the station. The signal box was removed in 1995, and replaced by a new lever frame in the station building. This frame was built from parts of the Craigieburn frame, and was the last new frame to be installed on mainline railways in Victoria. In 1962, the Melbourne‚ÄìAlbury standard gauge line behind Platform 1 opened, with a passing loop provided to the east of Wallan station. This loop was extended by 650 metres from 900m in 2000 making 1500m. In August 2018 plans for a station upgrade were announced, works including the provision of more car parking spaces and a lengthening of the Melbourne-bound platform so as to accommodate six carriage trains. This work is due to be completed by 2020. Demolished station Beveridge was located between Wallan and Donnybrook. Platforms & services Wallan has two side platforms.

The Monaro Highway and the former Bombala railway pass through the village. A railway station saw service until 1975. The postcode is 2620.  Structure  The Australian Bureau of Statistics included the ACT part of Williamsdale in an area called \\"Tuggeranong (SA2)\\". This statistical area also includes the ACT part of Royalla and all the rural territory between the Murrumbidgee River and the NSW border. It had a population of 21 at the . The part in NSW had a population of 63 at that census. The part of Williamsdale in NSW is itself split up by two Local Government Areas, in the north to Queanbeyan‚ÄìPalerang and in the south to Snowy Monaro. Geology To the east of Williamsdale is the Williamsdale Volcanics. These are made up from blue-green crystal tuff. The crystals are sized from 0.3 mm to 1 mm and are embedded in a fine matrix. Quartz crystals make up 25%, plagioclase 5%, alkali feldspar 10%, biotite 5-10% which is altered to chlorite, epidote and leucoxene. Middle Silurian Colinton Volcanics foliated dacite and tuff is under Williamsdale. A roughly north south band of these acid volcanics extends to the north along the Monaro Highway and then follows the Cooma road to Cottondale. South the volcanics also follow the Monaro Highway in a more complex band through Colinton past Michelago and at least as far south as Bredbo. To the west of Williamsdale is an outcrop of Upper Silurian Laidlaw Volcanics dark grey rhyodacitic and dacitic crystal tuff. This extends to the west as far as Angle Crossing. This band extends to the north north west as far as Mount Stromlo. The outcrop finishes a couple of kilometres south, but it is also found to the east, with outcrop from Fernleigh in the north, via Burra, and south to Michelago. On the west side of the Murrumbidgee River around Angle Crossing can be found the Bransby Beds or Goosoon Beds. These beds contain tuff and dacite with some sediments. They form a narrow band extending to the south as far as Cooma following on the east side of the Murrumbidgee River.  Airport proposal  In response to increasing operating costs for general aviation users of Canberra Airport, a proposal was made by the ACT Government in 2005 to develop a dedicated secondary airfield for the Territory. The site recommended was to the west of the Monaro Highway at Williamsdale, and would include aircraft hangars, maintenance and fuel facilities, and a 1000m grass runway. A feasibility study was undertaken by Deloitte Access Economics in 2010. Based on the results of this study, the project anticipated marginal returns on the capital investment required, despite significant demand for such a facility. As of 2012, the ACT government has declined to develop the facility, but has made the cost benefit analysis and feasibility study reports available should private enterprise wish to consider the project.  Solar farm  Willamsdale solar farm In September 2012, utilities provider ActewAGL was granted an exemption by the ACT Government from having to conduct a further Environmental impact assessment on a plan to construct a 45ha electricity generation facility consisting of 15 photovoltaic solar arrays with a total generating capacity of 20 megawatts and associated infrastructure adjacent to the Monaro Highway at Williamsdale. The land to be occupied by the proposed solar farm was acquired by ActewAGL in 2009, and was considered preferable to an alternative site in the West Belconnen district. The project was later reduced in scope to 11.8 megawatts. It was approved in January 2016 by the ACT Planning Minister, Mick Gentleman. Subsequently, Elementus Energy which had owned the project sold it to a subsidiary of Melbourne-based Impact Investment Group, and the German company ib vogt GmbH was contracted for the construction. The first solar panel was installed in October 2016. Construction was completed in October 2017. It uses a single axis sun-tracking system.

It is solely used by the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). Development of the C-1 commenced in 1966 in response to a requirement from the JASDF, which sought an indigenously jet-powered replacement for its aging Second World War‚Äìera Curtiss C-46 Commando transport fleet. First flown on 12 November 1970, quantity production of the type commenced during the following year. The C-1 has formed the backbone of the JASDF's transport capability throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, as well as the initial years of the twenty-first century as well. During the 2010s, Kawasaki developed a newer, larger and longer range airlifter, the Kawasaki C-2, which will eventually replace the JASDF's C-1 fleet entirely. Design and development By 1966, the transport fleet of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) was primarily composed of Curtiss C-46 Commandos, an American transport aircraft that had been manufactured primarily during the Second World War, and was considered to be quite capable aircraft for the era. By the mid-1960s, the capabilities of the decades-old C-46 had paled in comparison to numerous newer aircraft such as the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, motivating some officials within the JASDF to lobby for a domestically-designed and -manufactured transport aircraft with which to replace it. Such ambitions were successfully incorporated into the Third Defense Buildup Plan. With this purpose in mind, the JASDF approached the Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (NAMC), a consortium of several major Japanese corporations, which was by this time engaged in the production of the YS-11, an indigenously-developed airliner of the postwar era. During 1966, NAMC commenced design work on what would subsequently be designated as the C-1. Following a design review of the programme, NAMC decided that the Japanese conglomerate Kawasaki Heavy Industries would serve as the airlifter's prime contractor; it is for this reason that aircraft bears the Kawasaki name. In addition to Kawasaki's heavy contribution to the programme, significant portions of the airlifter were manufactured by other members of NAMC. Specifically, the tail section, as well as the middle and rear portions of the fuselage, were constructed by rival Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the majority of the wings were produced by Fuji Heavy Industries, the rudder was built by seaplane specialist Shin Meiwa, while the flaps were manufactured by NIPPI Corporation. At the time of its development, the C-1 was only the third indigenous aircraft programme to be undertaken in postwar Japan, coming after only the Fuji T-1 intermediate trainer aircraft and the YS-11 itself.Samuels 2018, p. 226. In terms of its basic configuration, the C-1 is a twin-engine medium-range airlifter, somewhat resembling the larger Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. It is powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-M-9 low-bypass turbofan engines, which were locally manufactured under license by Mitsubishi, each capable of generating up to 14,500lb of thrust. In terms of payload capacity, a single C-1 could carry up to 80 fully-equipped troops, 45 paratroopers, or 36 stretcher-bound personnel, in addition to bulky cargo, including a whole truck or a pair of jeeps, which would be loaded via a ramp deployed at the airlifter's rear. It was designed to be typically operated by a crew of five, comprising two pilots, a flight engineer, a navigator and a load master. The C-1 incorporates a high-lift system, which includes aerodynamic features such as a leading edge slat and a four-stage Fowler flap, facilitates a high level of short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance, while day-and-night all-weather operations is achieved via the application of numerous electronic navigation systems. Japanese policies at the time on military equipment were relatively strict, stipulating that they were not to have offensive capabilities. Accordingly, the maximum range of the airlifter was deliberately reduced so that the aircraft's operational range would practically limit its use to within Japan itself. This proved to be a problem after the island of Okinawa was returned to Japan from the United States; the airlifter was unable to fly directly to Okinawa from most parts of the Japanese home islands. This may have been a factor in the decision to reduce the planned procurement of the C-1 in favour of the American-built C-130H Hercules utility transport aircraft instead, which entered service with the JASDF's 401st Tactical Airlift Squadron in 1989.\\"Kawasaki C-1 Tactical Transport Aircraft.\\" Military Today, Retrieved 13 February 2017.\\"Kawasaki C-1 Medium-Lift Transport Aircraft.\\" Military Factory, Retrieved 13 February 2017.\\"C-1 Medium Transport.\\" Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Retrieved 13 February 2017.\\"Kawasaki C-1.\\" The Aviation Zone, Retrieved 13 February 2017. Another reason for the curtailment was the enactment of general cutbacks upon various military programmes and procurement initiatives during the 1970s. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) had a considerable interest in the C-1 programme.Samuels 2018, pp. 226, 338. Beyond its primary purpose as a military-orientated airlifter, at one stage, MITI had decided to adopt the C-1's design as the basis for a next-generation commercial transport project. While some work was undertaken on this initiative, it was subsequently decided to discard such efforts in order to concentrate upon international collaboration efforts, such as on the American aerospace company Boeing's new 767 airliner.Samuels 2018, p. 338. Efforts were made to incorporate the technologies and knowledge learnt from the C-1 programme into other sectors of Japanese commercial undertakings; according to author Richard J. Samuels, substantial benefits, such as a greater understanding of structural design and fatigue-prevention techniques, were transferred into the manufacture of automotive and rolling stock, along with smaller-scale items such as control panels and display systems. However, Samuels also notes that a high priority political goal of the programme, the transformation of Japan's aerospace companies to become global leaders in the field, was largely unfulfilled.Samuels 2018, pp. 226-227. Operational history The prototype, designated XC-1, performed its maiden flight on 12 November 1970. Following the successful completion of roughly one year of flight testing, the pair of prototypes were turned over to the JASDF for evaluation purposes. Since 1974, the Kawasaki C-1 has been in regular use as a military transport with the JASDF. Its introduction noticeably improved the tactical transport capabilities of the service. In addition to its military application, there was also a civil user of the C-1. At the urging of MITI, the National Aerospace Laboratory procured a single C-1, which was extensively modified into an experimental testbed. Commonly referred to as either Asuka or QSTOL (Quiet STOL), it flew for a number of years as a 150-seat short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft for one of the agency's research programmes. By 2010, a programme to develop a replacement for the C-1, known as the Kawasaki C-2, had reached the advanced stages of development. In comparison with the older C-1, the C-2 is a considerable larger airlifter, being able to lift three times more payload in terms of weight, as well as possessing greater endurance. On 30 June 2016, the production-standard C-2, \\"68-1203\\", was delivered to the Air Development and Test Wing at Gifu Air Field.\\"Kawasaki Delivers First Mass-produced C-2 Transport Aircraft to JASDF\\" Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

The district is mainly composed of 1930s housing. The population of the Portsmouth ward at the 2011 Census was 15,121. Before the area became developed for housing, it had been occupied by a farm of the same name. This farm had a history stretching back to the 12th century. The only surviving remnant of the rural past is Baffins Pond and the adjoining Tangier Field - a large open space between Baffins Pond and Portsmouth College at the eastern end of the field. Local attractions: Baffins Pond and Tangier Field Baffins Pond and Tangier Field is 182,000 square metres (18.2 hectares). The large natural pond is a habitat for ducks, geese, swans and other wild fowl. It is managed as a wildlife refuge and is popular with people of all ages. In 2014 Baffins Pond again received a Green Flag award. There is also a play area at Baffins Pond with equipment for children of all ages as well as a ball-court with basketball and 5-a-side goals. To the east of the pond area is Tangier Field, a large grassed open space that also serves as a valuable habitat for the brent goose or brant goose, an internationally important protected species, which visits the Solent area in the winter months.

He is especially remembered for his editions of Midrash and other medieval Jewish manuscripts, and for the pioneering research surrounding those texts.  Biographical data  Solomon Buber was born at Lemberg (then part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, Austria, now Lviv, Ukraine) on February 2, 1827. His father, Isaiah Abraham Buber, was versed in Talmudic literature and Jewish philosophy, and was Solomon's teacher in the latter subject; but for his son's Biblical and Talmudic studies he carefully selected competent professional teachers. Buber soon desired to conduct independent research and put the results in literary form‚Äîa disposition that proved valuable to Jewish literature. At twenty years of age, Buber married and entered commercial pursuits. He rose rapidly to become Handelskammerrath, and auditor of the Austro-Hungarian bank, the national bank, and the Galician savings-bank. Buber was also president of the Gesch√§ftshalle, vice-president of the free kitchen, and honorary member of a working men's union. For more than a quarter of a century he was one of the directors of the Lemberg congregation; he was on the committee of the Bernstein foundation, and took a leading part in various philanthropic associations. He died in 1906.  Midrash editions  While active in public life, Buber also devoted himself to learned research. The midrash literature had special attractions for him; and his activity in this field has been remarkable in extent. Its first result was an edition of the so-called Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, with an elaborate commentary and introduction that exhaustively discuss all questions pertaining to the history of this old Aggadah collection. The book appeared as a publication of the society known under the name of Mekitze Nirdamim (Lyck, 1868). Buber's method of dealing with the difficult undertaking was new to scientific literature; and both introduction and commentary received the unstinted praise of the scholarly world. The introduction was translated into German by August W√ºnsche, and published by him with his translation of the Midrash, Leipzig, 1884. Other midrashic works edited on a similar method and scale by Buber are: collectanea from Midrash Abkir, Vienna, 1883; Tobiah ben Eliezer's Midrash Lekhach Tob, Wilna, 1884; the original Midrash Tanchuma, Wilna, 1885; collectanea from Midrash Eleh ha- Debarim Zutta, Vienna, 1885; Sifre d'Agadta, short midrashim on the Book of Esther, Wilna, 1886; Midrash Tehillim, Wilna, 1891; Midrash Mishle, Wilna, 1893; Midrash Shmuel, Cracow, 1893; Midrash Agada, an anonymous haggadic commentary on the Pentateuch, Vienna, 1894; Midrash Zu·π≠·π≠a, on the Song of Solomon, the Book of Ruth, Lamentations, and Ecclesiastes, Berlin, 1894; Aggadat Esther, haggadic treatises on the Book of Esther, anonymous, Cracow, 1897; Midrash Ekah Rabbati, Wilna, 1899; Yalkut Makiri, on the Psalms, Berdychev, 1899; Menahem ben Solomon's Midrash Sekel Tob, on the books of Genesis and Exodus, ii. vol. 2, Berlin, 1900-02.  Method as editor  As this array of publications shows, Buber was a prolific writer; yet the scientific quality of his work does not suffer on this account, at least in the opinion of his contemporaries. (See below for current assessments.) At the outset he adopted a certain system to which he consistently adhered. For a determination of the reading of the text he availed himself of all accessible manuscripts and printed works‚Äîand everything was accessible to him, as he spared no expense in obtaining copies of manuscripts and the rarest printed editions; he conscientiously recorded the various readings in footnotes, and he bestowed special care, chiefly in the older midrashim, on the correction and explanation of words in the text borrowed from the Greek and the Latin. In the introductions, which almost assume the proportions of independent works (the introduction to the Tanchuma embraces 212 pages octavo), everything that bears upon the history of the work under consideration is discussed, and a compilation is given of the authors or works cited by the Midrash or serving as sources for it, and those that in turn have drawn upon the Midrash. His work is distinguished by thoroughness, and reveals his synthetic ability as well as the vast extent of his reading. The only serious opposition to the views encountered by Buber has been in regard to his theory concerning the Tanchuma. Buber distinguished himself in other departments of literature. His first work was a biography of the grammarian Elias Levita, published at Leipzig in 1856. After this he edited the following: De Lates' Gelehrtengeschichte Sha'are Zion, Jaros≈Çaw, 1885; Zedekiah ben Abraham's liturgic work, Shibbole ha-Leket, Wilna, 1886; Pesher Dabar, Saadia Gaon's treatise on the Hapax Legomena of the Bible, Przemy≈õl, 1888; Samuel ben Jacob Jam'a's Agur, introduction and additions to the Arukh, Breslau, 1888 (in Gr√§tz Jubelschrift); Samuel ben Nissim's commentary on the Book of Job, Ma'yan Gannim, Berlin, 1889; Biurim: Jedaiah Penini's explanations of Midrash Tehillim, Cracow, 1891, and a commentary on Lamentations by Joseph Caro, Breslau, 1901 (in the Kaufmann Gedenkbuch); Anshe Shem, biographies and epitaphs of the rabbis and heads of academies who lived and worked at Lemberg, covering a period of nearly four hundred years (1500-1890), Cracow, 1895. In these works Buber appears as a philologist and as a careful writer of biographies of scholars, especially of the Jewish scholars of Poland. Buber's extensive knowledge of Jewish history and literature is also displayed in additions to the works of others and in numerous contributions to Hebrew magazines, such as: Meged Yerachin, Kobak's Jeschurun, Ha-Lebanon, Ha-Maggid, Maggid Mishneh, Ha-'Ibri, Ha-Melitz, Ha Chabatzelet, Ha-Karmel, Joseph Kohn's Otzar Chokmah, Bet Talmud, Ha-Shachar, Ha-Asif, Keneset Yisrael, Zion, O·∫ìar ha-Sifrut, Ha-Eshkol. Among the works of his later years the following may be mentioned: Yeri'ot Shelomoh, a supplement to Abraham ben Elijah of Wilna's Rab Po'alim, Warsaw, 1894; a criticism of Yal·∏≥u·π≠ Makhiri, on Isaiah, ed. Schapira, Cracow, 1895; a criticism of the Pesi·∏≥ta, with an introduction by David Luria (ed. Warsaw, 1893), Cracow, 1895; ·∏≤iryah Nisgabah, on the rabbis in Z√≥≈Çkiew up to the letter ◊ö, published in Ha-Eshkol, i-iii, 1898‚Äì1900; and his contribution to the Steinschneider Festschrift, wherein he propounds a new theory concerning the Petichtot (Introductions) in Midrash Ekah Rabbati. Buber corresponded on learned subjects with many well-known Jewish scholars. He proved himself a veritable Maecenas of learning. The cost involved in the publication of his works was usually borne by him, and he presented free copies to libraries and indigent scholars.  Current assessment of Buber's scholarship  While there is no denying the positive and profound impact of Solomon Buber on the publication and study of the midrashic literature, there has been some reassessment of the quality of his work in light of more modern methodologies. states that Buber's texts \\"are now largely considered defective on two counts.\\" The first count is that Buber's methods are not consistent and rigorous by modern standards of scholarship, and the second count is that Buber's hired copyists often introduced their own copying errors into the works, thus partly negating Buber's efforts to establish a correct text. Many of the midrashic works that Buber first published now exist in (relatively) newer critical editions, which will generally be listed in modern reviews such as .

He worked a long time at the Institute of Economic Sciences, the former Planning Institute of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He was the editor of the journal Economic Analysis and Worker‚Äôs Self-Management, and collaborator of the journal Praxis, to which he contributed much from an economic viewpoint, though he was never a member of the group. He was also a member of the Economic Institute of Zagreb. Horvat tried to unite democratic forces on a common platform, but without much success. He was highly critical of the economic policy of the Franjo Tuƒëman government (as he was before of the communist). A democratic socialist, he advocated a model of market socialism, dubbed the Illyrian model, where firms were owned and self-managed by their workers and competed with each other in open and free markets. In 1992 he founded and became president of the Social Democratic Union. Horvat organized a Balkan Conference with the primary aim of restoring cooperation between Yugoslav forces. His most widely known study is The Political Economy of Socialism (published in 1982 in English, in 1984 in Croatian, and in 2001 in Chinese).

It was hosted by the APO Hiking Society (Danny Javier, Jim Paredes and Buboy Garovillo). Some of the original co-hosts included Kris Aquino, Bing Loyzaga, Michelle Van Eimeren, Agot Isidro, Lara Melissa de Leon, Amy Perez, John Estrada, Rannie Raymundo and Roderick Paulate. The show was a spin-off of ABS-CBN's popular Sunday noon-time show Sa Linggo nAPO Sila. It was one of the new shows launched by the network in 1995 as part of their \\"Primetime on Daytime\\" block after Eat Bulaga! moved from ABS-CBN to GMA Network. It aired live daily from ABS-CBN's studio at the Delta Theater until it moved to Studio 3 at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in their last days in 1998. First Year: The New Era of Noontime 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila started its first live broadcast from the ABS-CBN Delta Theater on February 4, 1995. The core hosts from the previous show Sa Linggo nAPO Sila (led by the APO Hiking Society) were initially joined by various ABS-CBN contract artists on a twice-weekly basis, until the show established its own core of regular hosts committed to appear on a daily basis. It garnered high ratings most especially in provinces and cities where ABS-CBN had superior signal. But the real challenge for \\"Sang Linggo\\" was the show's content itself as it tried to veer away from the usual noontime format of slapstick humor and various talent portions that its predecessor (and now competitor on GMA Network) Eat Bulaga!\\" (which added Allan K., Francis Magalona, Jose Manalo, Donna Cruz, and others to its roster of hosts as well) had presented to its viewers. Eventually, the show decided to compete for viewership by coming up with various game and talent portions as their answer to their rival show's own tried and tested segments. Among the portions that were a hit to its viewers on its initial year were \\"Conan the Beautician\\", \\"Hibangers\\", \\"Pop-Pinoyan\\", and \\"Princess Asia\\". Soon after, 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila became the avenue to showcase talent and introduce new stars. The likes of Rico Yan, Bojo Molina and Matthew Mendoza were introduced to the public as regular co-hosts. The show's rotating comedy sketch segments won loyal following out of new star combinations like the comic duos of John Estrada and Manilyn Reynes, Roderick Paulate and Jun Encarnacion, and Redford White and Norman Mitchell. Second Year: Top-rating status and downfall In the show's second year, it launched \\"Calendar Girl\\", a pageant segment for girls aged 15‚Äì21 years old. The segment injected a \\"sexy\\" element to the show but won over a new fanbase. The noontime show also introduced \\"Barangay APO\\", a segment where host Eagle Riggs goes on live remote telecast on a selected barangay and gives out many prizes in cash and kind. The said segment catapulted 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila to the number 1 spot in the noontime slot in Mega Manila. But the show's popularity declined when Eat Bulaga! introduced \\"Super SiReyna\\", a transgender pageant. Due to \\"Super SiReyna\\"'s phenomenal success in 1996, it catapulted Eat Bulaga! back to the top spot as well as other new segments that capture the attention of its viewers. Third and Final Year 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila barely celebrated its third year on Philippine TV when the show suddenly suffered in the ratings game. The show was moved to Studio 3 of ABS-CBN Broadcast Center at that time in 1997. With Eat Bulaga! continuing to thrill the noontime viewing public with \\"Super SiReyna\\", \\"Kaserola ng Kabayanan\\", and \\"Philippine Bulaga Association\\", the staff decided to give its still-popular segment \\"Calendar Girl\\" a more bolder, naughtier approach. The question and answer portion was now handled by the newly established trio of John Estrada, Randy Santiago and Willie Revillame. Their delivery of naughty jokes on national TV was met with mixed reactions. At the same time, the show unveiled its own game portion \\"APO Cash ng Bayan\\" which it gave out lots of cash prizes at stake. The ratings improved a bit with the changes but it reportedly did not sit well with some of the original hosts of the show. The show was in danger of cancellation and went its final airing on November 28, 1998, when co-hosts Randy Santiago, John Estrada and Willie Revillame went on to become the main hosts of the network's new noontime show Magandang Tanghali Bayan that aired Mondays to Fridays. The APO Hiking Society, on the other hand, kept the Saturday noontime slot via the musical variety show \\"Sabado Live\\". However with \\"MTB\\" posting higher ratings after adding the phenomenal segment \\"Pera o Bayong\\" later before the year ended, ABS-CBN management decided to cancel \\"Sabado Live\\" and extend \\"MTB\\"'s run to Saturday. \\"Sabado Live\\" had its final show on February 27, 1999. Legacy 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila garnered high ratings from the start of its airing on February 4, 1995 but it was not able to overtake Eat Bulaga! permanently, but it did gain popularity in regions where GMA's signals were weak and ABS-CBN's signals were stronger. The show also introduced many new talents to television. Some of the show's new talents would eventually make their mark in show business as box-office stars and acclaimed artists (recording, film and TV) despite \\"Eat Bulaga\\"'s reported clout and power in the showbiz industry. However, despite the show's initial advocacy to \\"clean up\\" the noontime slot and become the viewer's alternative choice, the management eventually decided that the show must go head-on with Eat Bulaga!. The all-out \\"noontime network war\\" escalated as the staff and fans of both warring noontime shows accused each other of copying segments. The downfall of the show was blamed on the humor being \\"too intelligent for the average Filipino\\" as the management tried to request the show's hosts to tone down on jokes (mostly political) that only a few would understand.

The first creation came in 1660 when the military commander Sir John King was made Baron Kingston, of Kingston in the County of Dublin. He was the elder brother of Sir Robert King, 1st Baronet, of Boyle Abbey (from whom the Earls of Kingston descend). Two of his sons, the second and third Barons, both succeeded in the title. The title became extinct in 1761 on the death of the latter's son, the fourth Baron, who had no surviving male issue. However, the title was revived three years later when his kinsman Sir Edward King, 5th Baronet, of Boyle Abbey, was made Baron Kingston, of Rockingham in the County of Roscommon. He was also created Viscount Kingston in 1766 and Earl of Kingston in 1768. In 1821, George King, 3rd Earl of Kingston, was made Baron Kingston, of Mitchelstown, in the county of Cork, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, enabling him to sit in the House of Lords.

It divides the original images into blocks and then uses a quantizer to reduce the number of grey levels in each block whilst maintaining the same mean and standard deviation. It is an early predecessor of the popular hardware DXTC technique, although BTC compression method was first adapted to color long before DXTC using a very similar approach called Color Cell Compression. BTC has also been adapted to video compression. BTC was first proposed by Professors Mitchell and Delp at Purdue University. Another variation of BTC is Absolute Moment Block Truncation Coding or AMBTC, in which instead of using the standard deviation the first absolute moment is preserved along with the mean. AMBTC is computationally simpler than BTC and also typically results in a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE). AMBTC was proposed by Maximo Lema and Robert Mitchell. Using sub-blocks of 4√ó4 pixels gives a compression ratio of 4:1 assuming 8-bit integer values are used during transmission or storage. Larger blocks allow greater compression (\\"a\\" and \\"b\\" values spread over more pixels) however quality also reduces with the increase in block size due to the nature of the algorithm. The BTC algorithm was used for compressing Mars Pathfinder's rover images.  Compression procedure  A pixel image is divided into blocks of typically 4√ó4 pixels. For each block the Mean and Standard Deviation of the pixel values are calculated; these statistics generally change from block to block. The pixel values selected for each reconstructed, or new, block are chosen so that each block of the BTC compressed image will have (approximately) the same mean and standard deviation as the corresponding block of the original image. A two level quantization on the block is where we gain the compression and is performed as follows: y(i,j) = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & x(i,j) > \\\\bar x \\\\ 0, & x(i,j) \\\\le \\\\bar x \\\\end{cases} Here x(i,j) are pixel elements of the original block and y(i,j) are elements of the compressed block. In words this can be explained as: If a pixel value is greater than the mean it is assigned the value \\"1\\", otherwise \\"0\\". Values equal to the mean can have either a \\"1\\" or a \\"0\\" depending on the preference of the person or organisation implementing the algorithm. This 16-bit block is stored or transmitted along with the values of Mean and Standard Deviation. Reconstruction is made with two values \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" which preserve the mean and the standard deviation. The values of \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" can be computed as follows: a=\\\\bar x - \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\cfrac {q}{m-q}} b=\\\\bar x + \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\cfrac {m-q}{q}} Where \\\\sigma is the standard deviation, m is the total number of pixels in the block and q is the number of pixels greater than the mean (\\\\bar x) To reconstruct the image, or create its approximation, elements assigned a 0 are replaced with the \\"a\\" value and elements assigned a 1 are replaced with the \\"b\\" value. x(i,j) = \\\\begin{cases} a, & y(i,j) = 0 \\\\ b, & y(i,j) = 1 \\\\end{cases} This demonstrates that the algorithm is asymmetric in that the encoder has much more work to do than the decoder. This is because the decoder is simply replacing 1's and 0's with the estimated value whereas the encoder is also required to calculate the mean, standard deviation and the two values to use.Leis, J 2008, ELE4607 Advance Digital Communications, Module 3: Image & Video Coding. Lecture Slides, University of Southern Queensland, 2008.  Example = Encoder  Take a 4√ó4 block from an image, in this case the mountain test image:Waterloo Fractal Coding and Analysis Group \\\\begin{matrix} 245 & 239 & 249 & 239 \\\\ 245 & 245 & 239 & 235 \\\\ 245 & 245 & 245 & 245 \\\\ 245 & 235 & 235 & 239 \\\\end{matrix} Like any small block from an image this appears rather boring to work with as the numbers are all quite similar, this is the nature of lossy compression and how it can work so well for images. Now we need to calculate two values from this data, that is the mean and standard deviation. The mean can be computed to 241.875, this is a simple calculation which should require no further explanation. The standard deviation is easily calculated at 4.36. From this the values of \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" can be calculated using the previous equations. They come out to be 236.935 and 245.718 respectively. The last calculation that needs to be done on the encoding side is to set the matrix to transmit to 1's and 0's so that each pixel can be transmitted as a single bit. \\\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{matrix}  Decoder  Now at the decoder side all we need to do is reassign the \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" values to the 1 and 0 pixels. This will give us the following block: \\\\begin{matrix} 245 & 236 & 245 & 236 \\\\ 245 & 245 & 236 & 236 \\\\ 245 & 245 & 245 & 245 \\\\ 245 & 236 & 236 & 236 \\\\end{matrix} As can be seen, the block has been reconstructed with the two values of \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" as integers (because images aren't defined to store floating point numbers). When working through the theory, this is a good point to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the reconstructed block. They should equal the original mean and standard deviation. Remember to use integers, otherwise much quantization error will become involved, as we previously quantized everything to integers in the encoder.

It is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution.Exploration Place - Give Now History During the 1980s, a plan to consolidate the city-owned Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center and the Children's Museum of Wichita was proposed. In 1992, a capital funds campaign was launched, and with an endowment from Velma Lunt Wallace, funds from the City of Wichita and Sedgwick County, and other donations, the museum opened in the spring of 2000. The museum is supported by admissions, membership dues, Sedgwick County government, and other public support and voluntary contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations. In 2017 the museum is expected to reach approximately 200,000 attendees. Building A view of the floor to ceiling windows on the island building.Construction began May 1997 and took 2 ¬Ω years. Internationally acclaimed architect Moshe Safdie of Boston designed the building. There are and on the property. The tallest point of the building is the peak of the roof of the traveling exhibits space and is above the floor (nearly 7 stories high). The combined distance around the interior perimeter of both buildings is approximately one mile. The \\"Island Building\\" is named because it is surrounded by water, with the Arkansas River on one side and the reflecting pond on the other. The reflecting pond is between the buildings to create the illusion that looks like the river runs between the buildings. The reflecting pond is one to three feet deep. Even though the building is so close to the river it is not prone to flooding because it is above the 100-year flood level. During the flood in October 1998, the worst in recent history, the water level was still more than below the finished floor level.

He was accused of several crimes, which made him famous by then, although recent studies suggest Remechido did not commit them. Life He was the son of Joaquim Jos√© dos Reis and wife Clara Maria do Carmo da Rocha, both born in Est√¥mbar, in the municipality of Lagoa,http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=122170 and died before a firing squad at the Campo da Trinidade (site of the present school hall of the Tom√°s Cabreira Secondary School) in Faro on 2 August 1838. He served as a supporter of Miguel of Portugal under General Tom√°s Cabreira at the Battle of Sant‚ÄôAna, during the Liberal Wars. After the defeat of Miguel in 1834, Remechido found himself savagely persecuted, and took refuge in the mountains of the Algarve where, supported by the mountain people and resorting to guerrilla tactics, he systematically thrashed the government forces. In order to discover his whereabouts, the government forces publicly interrogated his wife with physical punishments, and when she would not betray him, killed his 14-year- old son, two actions which made him resolve never to surrender and to punish those who had wronged him. He was, however, captured and brought for judgement before the Council of War.

Birth and family Kingsley was born in Annsville, Oneida County, New York, US, the first child and eldest son of Oren (Jr.) and Margaret (Buchanan) Kingsley . His family were of early Connecticut history. Calvin's parents were not members of any church. He was converted at the age of 18 in the Methodist Church of Ellington, New York. His parents later were converted because of his witness, ultimately sending two sons into the ministry (including Calvin's brother Alanson Kingsley, who is a great-great-great grandfather of singer-songwriter, Taylor Swift). In 1841 Calvin married Delia Deborah Scudder, the daughter of Captain Marvin and Deborah (Boughton) Scudder. They had five children: Frank, Eliza, Mary, Ellen and Martha. Education Kingsley attended Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania (1836‚Äì41), working as a janitor to pay his expenses, calling himself the \\"Professor of dust and ashes.\\" He was Licensed to Preach in 1838 and admitted on Trial by the Erie Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in 1841. Ordained and academic ministry Rev. Kingsley was appointed to Saegertown, Crawford County, Pennsylvania (1841‚Äì42), and Meadville, Pennsylvania (1842‚Äì43). He was ordained a Deacon in the M.E. Church and admitted into Full Connection in 1843. He was a Professor of Mathematics at Allegheny College (1843‚Äì44). He was then appointed Pastor at Erie, Pennsylvania (1844‚Äì46). In 1844 Rev. Kingsley successfully debated someone of the Universalist faith. He was ordained an Elder in the M.E. Church in 1845. He returned to teaching mathematics at Allegheny (1846‚Äì55), becoming Vice President of the college in 1855. Rev. Kingsley's final assignment before election to the Episcopacy was as Editor of the Western Christian Advocate (1856‚Äì64), an important periodical of his denomination. During this time he resided at Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio. Episcopal ministry Rev. Kingsley was elected a Bishop at the 1864 General Conference of the M.E. Church. He was elected the same year as Bishops Clark and Thomson, all three of whom died in their first quadrennium of episcopal leadership. Between 1869 and 1870, Kingsley embarked on a trip around the world in the cause of Missionary work. While abroad, Bishop Kingsley wrote home, describing Japan, Shaghi, Pekin, Foo Chow, Calcutta, Singapore, Madras, Benares, Lucknow, and Bareilly. After a detour to the Holy Land, he planned to visit Methodist missions in Bulgaria, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and to attend conferences in Switzerland, Ireland and England. The group with whom he visited the Holy Land included Frances Willard. Death and burial Bishop Kingsley's trip, and his life, were cut short, however. He was stricken by a heart attack while visiting the Holy Land, and died on 6 April 1870 in Beirut, Syria (now Lebanon), at the age of fifty-seven. He was buried in Beirut in the Prussian Protestant Cemetery, where the Methodist Church erected a monument in his memory.

It is the former capital of India and the current capital of the Indian state of West Bengal, and occasionally called the \\"Cultural capital of India\\". Bengalis tend to have a special appreciation for art and literature. Cited by: Arts The city has a long tradition of commercial theatres and group theatres. As opposed to commercial theatres, group theatres usually do not have any profit making agenda. Group theatre activists use the proscenium stage to portray some social message. The commercial theatres of the city, however, has been declining in popularity since the 1980s, and only a handful of commercial theatre productions are made, as of 2009. Notable group theatres include the Little Theatre Group, Gandharba, Calcutta Theatre, Nandikar, Bahurupee etc. and movements like the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Famous drama and theatrics personalities include Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay, Utpal Dutta, Rudraprasad Sengupta and Shambhu Mitra. Architecture An exhibition of painting and sculpture is going on at the Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata. Kolkata has many buildings adorned with Indo- Islamic and Indo-Saracenic architectural motifs. Several well-maintained major buildings from the colonial period have been declared \\"heritage structures\\"; however, others are in various stages of decay. Established in 1814 as the nation's oldest museum, the Indian Museum houses large collections that showcase Indian natural history and Indian art. Marble Palace is a classic example of a European mansion that was built in the city. The Victoria Memorial, a place of interest in Kolkata, has a museum documenting the city's history. Kalighat painting originated in the 19th century Kolkata, in the vicinity of Kalighat Kali Temple of Kalighat. Initially sold as items of souvenir taken by the visitors to the Kali temple, the paintings over a period of time developed as a distinct school of Indian painting. From the depiction of Hindu gods, goddesses, and other mythological characters, the Kalighat paintings developed to reflect a variety of themes including quotidian life. The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, and Nandalal Bose. The art college was the birthplace of Bengal school of art that arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles.  Sports  The people of Kolkata are famous for being sports lovers. Cricket and football can easily be called the life blood of the city. The home town of Eden Gardens (headquarters of CAB), the city can boast of an impartial crowd of cricket lovers who cheer for good cricket even when their side is losing. Eden Gardens is one of the biggest stadiums in the country in terms of capacity and witnessed its first test match from 5 to 8 January 1934. Exhibitions Kolkata is a city of exhibitions and fairs. The International History & Heritage Exhibition organised by Sabarna Sangrahashala annually in February is an important event where the rich cultural heritage of the land is reflected.http://kamdev.faithweb.com/photo2_2.html Apart from the history and heritage of India, the exhibition through displays of rarest artifacts and documents portrays the history, traditions and culture of other nations too.

It is currently home to 10 adults and 7 children who live in individual family flats around the farmyard. The land is farmed organically (although not certified, partly due to cost, mostly due to the belief that chemical farmers should pay for certification to show their food is safe rather than traditional, organic food growers incurring financial penalties) and the community is off-grid for supplies of water, electricity and wood for fuel - used for heating and cooking. People work both locally and on-site to manage the farm and earn a living. The aim of the community is to live an environmentally sustainable and ethical lifestyle. Their three \\"pillars\\" are community, sustainability and education. In 2017 they owned four horses, three goats, four geese, four ducks and three beehives. The property is currently at risk of being sold by their landlord, unless ¬£1/2 million is raised by 2020. They are currently looking for investors, income generating ideas and new members. History The community had been quietly set up by architectural historian Julian and wife Emma Orbach in 1993 in the foothills of Mynydd Carningli (Angel Mountain), near Newport, Pembrokeshire within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park without planning permission or publicity. The Orbachs initially renovated a rundown farmhouse and moved in with their three children. Other buildings including a roundhouse, later to become known as That Roundhouse with a turf roof, a wooden marquee, wood store and workshop had been built. The community in 1998 consisted of 12 adults and 10 children who were mainly vegetarian, grew their own crops and lived off the land. The settlement of five straw bale buildings and one wooden geodesic dome was spotted from the air in 1998 and was reported to the authorities. The authorities identified fourteen infringements of planning regulations, including the lake, the cycle shed, the Dome, and the roundhouse. All infringements, except those relating to the Roundhouse, were solved or resolved. The cycle shed is still without planning permission. In about 2001 the land was split in three parts, with ownership of the land around the disputed roundhouse being transferred to the Roundhouse Trust. Julian moved into town, but retained ownership of about including the old farmhouse and outbuildings, which was leased to the Brithdir Mawr Housing Co-op. Emma adopted the rest, which is known as Tir Ysbrydol (spirit land), which also became involved in planning negotiations in relation to new and existing strawbale round huts and structures. In 2015 Emma featured in an episode of Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild. In 2016 the community was notified by Julian Orbach, the current owner, of his intention not to renew the lease from 2020. The community members have been offered first refusal to purchase the site at a price of ¬£1 million. Members intend to raise the funds by selling shares worldwide.

Logging in post-production  If a video has a high shooting ratio, it can be impractical to remember exactly where each shot is on each source tape or source file. Finding a particular source shot by searching through hours of video during editing can be time consuming, as well as tie up expensive editing equipment and editors' time. A solution widely employed in the professional industry is to log the content prior to editing. Loggers go through the source video material, labeling it according to its contents within the metadata. This data is then available during editing, making the editing more efficient. Software based logging systems allow clip lists to be imported directly into computer based editing systems.  Broadcast and compliance logging  Free-to-Air and Subscription broadcasters often have a statutory requirement to keep a record of all programs that are emitted. This may be for legal or other compliance purposes‚Äîor simply good commercial sense to 'have proof' of events in event of a contrary claim. Traditionally compliance recordings were made to long-play video-cassette decks, using three 8-hour tapes per day per channel. The unreliability of moving tapes & heads, along with the move to centralcasting and distributed playback requirements, has made this method virtually impossible to maintain in the current operational climate. Larger multi-channel broadcasters with hundreds of feeds running simultaneously could potentially use several thousand VHS decks in rotation, along with the equipment racking, tape storage space and staff to manipulate those assets‚Äîand tens of thousands of tapes required to span the compliance retention period. Developments since the early 2000s have shifted to multi-channel server-based rich-media logging, with a few brave souls using domestic PVR software to achieve the basic functionality at a reduced cost. Most systems also provide data sync to broadcast automation systems, as well as checking basic signal status, and event logging for review of non program related events which may have been visible on air. In addition to logging to disk, some packages also provide live streaming for internal use, or to be repurposed to external web or news sites. A variety of disk- based compliance logging packages suitable for a range of customer applications are available‚Äîeach employing a number of proprietary methods and technologies.

Development Berlin S-Bahn train stop in its engaged (left) and disengaged (right) position Train stops The earliest systems were train stops, as still used by the New York City Subway, the Toronto subway, the London Underground, the Moscow Subway (only on the older lines) and the Berlin S-Bahn. Beside every signal is a moveable arm. If the signal is red, levers connected to valves on any passing train hit the arm, opening the brake line, applying the emergency brake, If the signal shows green, the arm is turned away from the levers and there is no contact. The Great Western Railway in the UK introduced its \\"automatic train control system\\" in the early years of the 20th century. Each distant signal had before it a ramp between the running rails. If the signal showed green, the ramp was energised with a low voltage current which was passed to the locomotive when a shoe came into contact with the ramp. A bell rang in the locomotive's cab to confirm the clear aspect, and the electric current kept the brakes from being applied. If the signal showed yellow (meaning the next signal would show red) the ramp was dead and a siren sounded in the cab. If the siren was not cancelled, the brakes would automatically be applied. After the nationalisation of the railways in the UK in 1948, this system was later replaced by the magnetic induction \\"automatic warning system\\". Trackside magnets for very simple data communication. Outside and middle of track: Integra-Signum, other two (yellow) magnets: ZUB Inductive systems In this system, data is transmitted magnetically between the track and locomotive by magnets mounted beside the rails and on the locomotive. In the Integra- Signum system the trains are influenced only at given locations, for instance whenever a train ignores a red signal, the emergency brakes are applied and the locomotive's motors are shut down. Additionally, they often require the driver to confirm distant signals (e.g. CAWS) that show stop or caution ‚Äì failure to do so results in the train stopping. This gives sufficient braking distance for trains following each other, however, it cannot always prevent accidents in stations where trains cross paths, because the distance from the red signal to the next obstacle may be too short for the train to brake to a halt. More advanced systems (e.g., PZB, and ZUB) calculate a braking curve that determines if the train can stop before the next red signal, and if not they brake the train. They require that the train driver enter the weight and the type of brakes into the onboard computer. One disadvantage of this kind of system is that the train cannot speed up before the signal if it has switched to green because the onboard computer's information can only be updated at the next magnet. To overcome that problem, some systems allow additional magnets to be placed between distant and home signals or data transfer from the signalling system to the onboard computer is continuous (e.g., LZB). Radio- based Prior to the development of a standard train protection system in Europe, there were several incompatible systems in use. Locomotives that crossed national borders had to be equipped with multiple systems. In cases where this wasn't possible or practical, the locomotives themselves had to be changed. To overcome these problems, the European Train Control System standard was developed. It offers different levels of functionality, ranging from simple to complex. This model allows adopters to meet the cost and performance requirements of disparate solutions, from the smallest to the largest. The European system has been in operation since 2002 and uses GSM digital radio with continuous connectivity. Cab signalling The newer systems use cab signalling, where the trains constantly receive information regarding their relative positions to other trains. The computer shows the driver how fast they may drive, instead of them relying on exterior signals. Systems of this kind are in common use in France, Germany and Japan, where the high speeds of the trains made it impossible for the train driver to read exterior signals, and distances between distant and home signals are too short for the train to brake. These systems are usually far more than automatic train protection systems; not only do they prevent accidents, but also actively support the train driver. This goes as far as some systems being nearly able to drive the train automatically.

Durga Puja is the largest festival of West Bengal, and it features colourful pandals, decorative idols of Hindu goddess Durga and her family, lighting decorations and fireworks. Other major festivals are Diwali, Kali Puja, Holi, Saraswati Puja, Poush Parbon, Poila Boishakh, etc.  Bengali New Year  The Bengali New Year or \\"Poila Baisakh\\" (the first day of the month of Baisakh) is celebrated around 15 April on the basis of the lunar calendar of Bangabda. Visitors to homes are greeted with sweets, and trade establishments are decorated with auspicious garlands of marigold and 'aam' leaves. Shop-owners and businessmen offer puja at Dakshineshwar Kali Temple and Kalighat Kali Temple in the morning with new ledgers(Halkhata). Businessmen also offer free sweets as a goodwill gesture on this day. It is celebrated by cultural programmes throughout Kolkata.  Religious festivals = Durga Puja  Traditional Durga (details in external link Durga Puja, the biggest festival) a Durga puja pandal Characteristic neon light images glow as late night revellers throng the streets of Kolkata during Durga Puja. Durga Puja, held in September‚ÄìOctober, is the biggest and most important festival of West Bengal as well as of Kolkata. It marks the victory of ten-armed goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasur and signifies the victory of good over evil. The festival commences on Mahalaya, a week before the actual Puja celebrations begin on Sashthi and continue through Saptami, Ashtami, Navami and Vijaya Dashami, when the festival comes to an end. Pandals are set up and idols of goddess Durga and her four children - Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik, Ganesh are worshipped and displayed for five days across the state, especially in Kolkata. Some 3000 pandals are erected throughout Kolkata and its suburbs. Pujas are also conducted in sizeable number of family households. Elaborate rituals are performed by priests amid sound of drums (dhaak), conch shell (shaankh) and bells, and many devotees join in the prayers. Although the root of Durga Puja is essentially religious, the festival has slowly changed into more of a social carnival than a religious festival, where people from other religious or ethnic backgrounds freely participate in the festivity. It has become Kolkata's biggest public spectacle, glamorous art event and consumerist carnival. The city is decked up with lighting decorations. Loudspeakers play popular songs as well as recitation of mantras by priests. Shops, restaurants and eateries stay open all night. Fairs are set up in numerous parks and public spaces. The roads become overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of devotees, revellers and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on Puja days. The number of crowd is estimated to be a few million on the festive days and nights, possibly the second largest annual human congregation after the Hajj. It creates a chaotic traffic condition and vehicular movement comes to a standstill in many places. Elaborate security arrangements are made by Kolkata Police and additional personnel are deployed to prevent any untoward incident as well as to maintain crowd movement. Trains, buses, taxis and other modes of transport operate for whole night as crowds pour into the city from nearby districts and towns. The festival is celebrated with shopping and gift-giving - usually new clothes, family and other social gatherings, communal feasting and different cultural performances. Modern day Puja celebrations also include reading special Pujabarshiki magazines, going out for a tour, watching movies and special programmes on TV, preparing special food items or dining out etc. during the Puja holidays. On Bijaya Dashami, the day of the festival, people bid adieu to goddess Durga offering her sweets and sindoor. Before bidding adieu to the goddess, the married women assemble near the idol, apply vermilion on her feet or forehead and then smear vermillion on each other. This is a part of the last celebration before the idols are taken out in grand processions of song, dance, music and then immersed in the waters. The idol immersion ceremony continues for the next few days. People distribute sweets and visit their friends, family members and relatives to exchange the Bijoya greetings. Kali Puja & Diwali Kali Puja. Kali Puja which coincides with the North Indian festival of Diwali is a major festival of West Bengal, and probably the second largest after Durga Puja. Goddess Kali is worshipped at night in thousands of pandals, homes and temples. Kali Puja is light-up night for Bengal as well as for Kolkata. People decorate their homes with diyas, candles and lights and draw colourful rangolis on the floors of their homes. Children and adults burst firecrackers and burn sparklers throughout the night. A large number of devotees visit the temples to offer prayers to the goddess and animals, especially goats are sacrificed in some places. Two days after it is Bhai Phonta or Bhatri Dwitiya which is virtually the brother‚Äôs day. On Bhai Phonta, the sisters fast in the morning till they put a mark of sandalwood paste on their brothers' foreheads and treat them with gifts and delicacies. While doing so, they pray to God for the sound health, safety and prosperity of their brothers. The brothers in return present gifts to the sisters. Saraswati Puja goddess Saraswati being worshipped Saraswati Puja, a festival honouring the goddess of learning and arts, is celebrated with domestic pujas, and familial gatherings in Kolkata on a date between the last week of January and the middle of February. The day is sacred to Saraswati, goddess of learning whose worship is celebrated with great splendor mainly by students and artists. Books are often worshipped in lieu of the clay image of the Goddess. Girl worshipers usually wear saffron and yellow-coloured cloths. The puja is especially celebrated in schools and other educational institutes. It gives an chance of free-mixing among school kids. This is the equivalent of Valentine's Day to them. The typical bhog which accompanies the Puja depends dramatically on whether the family is initially from West Bengal (or ghoti) or from East Bengal ‚Äî now Bangladesh ‚Äî(or bangal). Ghotis have vegetarian fare, while bangals offer paired Ilish fishes to the goddess and then consume it. Holi Colours for Holi on sale at a market in Kolkata. The North Indian festival of Holi, is celebrated, and is supposedly coincident with the advent of spring. Holi is locally known as the festival of colors. The celebrations start in the city with the burning of Holika bonfire on the night before Holi. The festival of colour involve throwing, sprinkling and smearing powdered colour (aabir), and water colour (jal rang) on others. Unknown passersby often get drenched by coloured water balloons, and celebrations often get rowdy and rambunctious with the men partaking the intoxicating drink of shiddhi (bhang), often laced with the stronger charas. Nowadays, Holi party usually means frolicking dance and various delicacies like sweets, biryani, beverages etc. Cultural festivals=Dover Lane Music Festival The Dover Lane Music Festival is a Hindustani classical music, with performances from established musicians from several countries as well as new musicians. It has been held for the past years in the January conglomerate holiday (23 ‚Äì 26 January) period and comprises three all-night recitals. Initially held open air at Dover Lane in Ballygunge area of South Kolkata, due to the large crowds, it is now held at the open-air theatre Nazrul Mancha on the Southern Avenue (Ballygunge area). It is held in conjunction with the Dover Lane Music Conference. Calcutta Book Fair The 'Kolkata International Book Fair or Kolkata Boi Mela is the world's largest non-trade annual book fair as well as the largest book fair in Asia. Held on the Milan Mela ground near Science City on E.M.Bypass, this fair has over 600 stalls, selling over Rs.23,000,000 worth of books and attracting more than 2.5 million visitors annually. It was started in 1970 by the Publishers' and Booksellers' Association. It has a Monmarte with new poets and artists, an annual theme country with authors like G√ºnter Grass and Richard Dawkins visiting the fair as chief guests and it offers a typical fairground experience with a literary theme with picknickers, singer-songwriters, artistes and candyfloss vendors.

Biography Huang Fu Huang studied at Zhejiang Military College and Qiushi Academy (current Zhejiang University), later was sent to Japan in 1904.√ñ¬™√É√ª√à√ã√é√Ø at www.zju.edu.cn Huang came in contact with the Tongmenghui while studying at the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko, a military academy in Tokyo in 1905 and met Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Qun in 1907 when they arrived to study in Japan as well. In 1908, he studied surveying under the Imperial Japanese Army, and returned to China in 1910. During the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, he and Chen Qimei declared Shanghai to be independent of the Empire of China, and became blood brothers with Chiang Kai-shek. He was forced to flee abroad after the failed Second Revolution of 1913 against Yuan Shikai, travelling via Japan to the United States, and returned in 1916 to participate in the final stages of the National Protection War, and to represent Zhejiang's military government in Beijing. When Sun Yat-sen ordered Kuomintang members to swear personal loyalty to him, Huang objected and left politics. Huang reappeared into public life by supporting China's entry into World War I hoping it would regain lost territories. He worked with President Xu Shichang as a diplomat, co-wrote books about economics and foreign affairs and would often guest lecturer at universities. He was part of China's delegation to the 1921 Washington Naval Conference which secured the Beiyang government's greatest diplomatic triumph, the return of Shandong. After the fall of Cao Kun in the 1924 Beijing Coup, he joined the Zhili clique and became acting president of the Republic of China on the request of Feng Yuxiang. He declared Cao Kun's term illegal because it was obtained through bribery and also repudiated the agreement which allowed former Emperor Puyi to continue to live in the Forbidden City. Huang was influential in winning over Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan to Chiang Kai-shek's faction of the Kuomintang (KMT) which was one of the major reasons why Wang Jingwei's Wuhan regime collapsed. He later served under several offices during the Nanjing decade including Shanghai mayor, foreign minister, and chairman of the North China Political Council. Despite his close ties to Chiang, he never rejoined the KMT as he did not want to be associated with the opportunists who joined during and after the Northern Expedition. In 1933, he signed the unpopular Tanggu Truce which ceded Chahar, Rehe, and part of Hebei to Manchukuo. Like Chiang, he viewed the Communists as a greater threat than the Japanese. Huang died of lung cancer in Shanghai in 1936.

It was produced as a co-production between American company Filmways and The Lupo- Anthony-Quintano Company, an independent company. Released in 1981, the film effectively started the 3D film boom of the early 1980s. The same filmmakers returned in 1983 with Treasure of the Four Crowns. Plot H.H. Hart, a bank robber, loses his wife to kidnappers on their wedding day. Subsequently, she is traded as a prostitute by villain Pike Thompson. H.H. Hart races against time to find his wife, with the help of a Scottish preacher. The film features many 3D effects, many of which are intended to \\"fly off the screen\\" at the audience. Cast * Tony Anthony as H.H. Hart * Gene Quintano as Pike Thompson * Victoria Abril as Abeline * Ricardo Palacios as Polk Thompson * Lewis Gordon as The Preacher Development Quintano and Lupo were Xerox salesmen who formed their own office supply firm who were interested in getting into filmmaking. They were partners in a publishing firm with Tony Anthony, a filmmaker who had made a number of spaghetti westerns. Looking for an angle they decided to make a film in 3-D, believing many younger film goers would not be familiar with it. 3-D had been a brief craze in the early 1950s with films such as Bwana Devil but quickly fell out of fashion. Comin' at Ya! was the first 3-D film in over twenty years. It was also a Western when those films were not very common. Quintano and his partners worked for four years on the film, experimenting and testing the technology. They decided to make a Western instead of a horror movie as they believed the market was over- saturated with horror. They managed to get a distribution deal but had to raise the funds themselves. It took them three months. (Some said the budget was $2.5 million other sources say $3.5 million.) Shooting Filming started in Spain in September 1980 and took three months. Post production was done in Rome. Anthony admitted the film was not Citizen Kane in terms of quality. \\"You wouldn't make Citizen Kane' in 3-D\\", he said. \\"This is escapism. This is The Perils of Pauline. It's a laugh. It's enjoyment. It's putting the audience in the theater in the picture. At one point in the picture, I'm running toward the camera with all kinds of things, tomahawks, arrows, being thrown at me. I go off to the right and you ‚Äì you in the audience ‚Äì think the tomahawk is going to hit you. They called it a gimmick 25 years ago. It may still be a gimmick, but today it's a gimmick for a new generation. Let's give it a try.\\" Stereoscopic 3-D Process Comin' at Ya was filmed in the over-and-under, single-strip 35 mm 3-D format. Two Techniscope-format frames, one for the left-eye image and one for the right-eye image, are stacked one above the other in the same area as one ordinary 'Scope-format frame. The resulting frames, though diminished in size, yielded a nominal aspect ratio of 2.39:1. The lens system used was Optimax III (Bill Bukowski of Optimax III served as 3D Technical Advisor), notorious for introducing vertical parallax error owing to its flawed design (i.e., the optical axes of its twin lenses are not at the same horizontal level). The film's posters by turns heralded the 3-D process as SuperVision and WonderVision. Projection required prismatic or \\"mirror box\\" converters in front of an ordinary spherical projection lens. These converters were meant to converge the stacked left and right pictures on the screen, at the same time cross-polarizing them to match the filters in the 3-D glasses worn by the audience. Gene Quintano was a producer. He says he appeared in the film \\"mostly as a matter of economics. Tony is the star and he's very good but this is not an actor's film. I mean, Robert Redford is not going to be sweating it out. The real star is supposed to be the 3-D.\\" Filmways The movie was acquired for US release at the American Film Market in early 1981 by Filmways. Filmways had just bought out American International Pictures and were in a state of flux at the time, having unloaded four major films, The Fan, Blade Runner, Halloween II and Ragtime. President Robert Meyers had once been in business with the film's sales representative and offered to buy the film for the US if it had no other offers. Although the film sold well internationally, getting the producers their money back, no other offers came through and so Meyers honored his promise. \\"We thought if we were lucky we might show the film in someone's basement every few years\\", said Quintano. Release The film was previewed in March 1981 in only two cities, Phoenix and Kansas City. Anthony and Quintano ordered only 90,000 pairs of the 3-D glasses needed to watch the film. The film did spectacular business, the film easily out grossing per cinema Filmways' other film at the time, Blow Out. By August the studio decided to expand the film to as many cinemas that could take 3-D. \\"They can't make the glasses fast enough\\", said Anthony. \\"They've been selling them at an average of 40,000-per-theater. At 1 in the morning the other day I got a call that we'll be opening in 200 theaters between now and the 21st. This isn't a film ‚Äì it's a military operation!\\" The order for glasses was increased to five million pairs. Arthur Silverstein, sales manager of the Hudson Printing Company in Manhattan, said he had to put his employees on overtime to turn out the disposable green-tinted glasses. \\"They give a remarkable special effect\\", he said, \\"and I don't even have anything to do with the movie. In fact, it's a dynamite effect. It literally puts you in the action, and you do see things coming at you.\\" The film did not sustain its original business however. Legacy The film kicked off a spate of movies in 3-D including Jaws 3-D, Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone and Friday the 13th Part 3-D. Follow Up Anthony said he wanted to make a sword and sorcery film as follow up Seeing is Believing. \\"I've got to be very careful about my decisions from here on in\\", he said. \\"If I make a mistake, it could take me 10 years to get back to this point.\\" However Quintano wanted to make a Topkapi type film about people stealing an item on an island. This became Treasure of the Four Crowns. DVD release This film was released on DVD in the Anaglyph 3D process. The conversion procedure involved separating the over and under images and digitally combining them as red and cyan images layered over each other. Reissue In May 2009, a new restoration of the film was announced. In late January 2011 it was announced by Fangoria magazine that they would be sponsoring the film's premiere screening. The premiere screening of this newly restored version was held at the Berlin Film Festival on February 12, 2011. In January 2016, for the movie's 35th anniversary, a remastered version was released for home video, which includes new 5.1 surround sound.

They were featured in plantations throughout the Americas and notably in the Cape Colony, present-day South Africa. The structures they were housed in, most often tall pillars and towers, became landmarks on the plantation and could be used to surveillance the enslaved workers. In some cases, these structures have become a symbolic feature of the architectural style of that region and the architecture of plantation slavery. In South Africa, the pillars of the slave bell is a distinctive feature of the Cape Dutch architectural style. In a 1937 interview for WPA Slave Narrative project Charley Williams (b. 1843), who had lived and worked on a cotton and tobacco plantation in Louisiana where he was enslaved from birth (circa 1845) until 1865 with over 100 men, women and children, described the use of the bells and horns to control the lives and labour of the enslaved people: \\"... you can hear a old bell donging way on some plantation a mile or two off, and den more bells at other places and maybe a horn...\\" \\"Bells and horns! Bells for dis and horns for dat! All we knowed was go and come by de bells and horns!\\" The slave bells were used by the enslaved to organise uprisings. In 1839 on Montalvo sugar plantation in the Matanzas Province, Cuba the plantation's slave bell at prayer time were used as a signal to attack the overseers and liberate themselves and others by feeing into the woods.  Bells used to torture and punish  Illustration from A narrative of the adventures and escape of Moses Roper from American slavery by leftBells were also used as a punishment and to prevent people from escaping. In his book A Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper, from American Slavery Moses Roper described the use of \\"iron horns, with bells, attached to the back of the slave's neck\\" several feet in height as an \\"instrument of torture\\".  Cape Colony  Slave bell and manor house at the Lanzerac estate in right In the Cape Colony the slave bell had a distinctive architectural-style. It was usually a large bell hung from free-standing tall white pillars or in a white arch. After the abolition of slavery in the Cape they were continuously used during the apartheid regime in South Africa as an element of the Cape Dutch architectural style without recognition that they were symbols of oppression and suffering.  Notable slave bells = La Demajagua bell, Cuba  Manzanillo, Cuba.200x200pxalt=left In Cuba, on 10 October 1868, the slave bell at the La Demajagua sugar mill, in Manzanillo, was rung by the mill's owner Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes to called assemble the people he enslaved to tell them that they are free and to invite them to join the fight for independence from Spain. This act is seen as the start of the Ten Years War. In 1947 the Demajagua bell was brought to the University of Havana by law student Fidel Castro and other anti-government demonstrators. When the bell was removed by the government, Castro protested against it on national radio, making his name widely known in Cuba for the first time. The bell was returned to Manzanillo in November 1947 and was re-installed at La Demajagua in 1968.  The Demerara Bell  A bell, known as the Demerara Bell, was donated to St. Catherine's College, Cambridge in 1960 or 1961 by a former student Edward Goodland, who worked at Bookers Sugar Estates in British Guiana. The bell was inscribed ‚ÄòDe Catherina 1772‚Äô was from the Anna Catharina plantation on the West Bank Demerara, was found in the Demerara River in the 1950s. The bell initially installed outside the porter's lodge at St. Catherine's before it was moved to an accommodation block in 1994 where it was in a prominent position overlooking the centre of the college. In May 2019 the governing body and students of St Catharine‚Äôs College unanimously agreed that the bell should be removed view and would eventually be donated to Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. In August 2019 it was reported that the Guyanese High Commissioner Frederick Hamley Case had persuaded the college to return the bell to Guyana.  Manaca Iznaga Tower, Cuba  right Iznaga Tower was the bell tower housing the slave bell of the Manaca sugar plantation in Valle de los Ingenios, in Trinidad, Cuba. It is an example of the bell towers that were common a common feature on sugar plantations in Cuba, other notable examples are at Angerona and El Padre plantations located in present-day Cafetal del Padre in the Havana Province. Large Cuban plantations often had several bells that were rung to control the activities of the enslaved people including regulating prayer time, meal times and to warn other plantations of slave rebellions. The 51m tower was built in 1848, it is constructed of stone and brick and has seven levels. In addition to housing the slave bells it was used as an observation tower from which the people enslaved on the plantation were surveilled. In 1988, Valle de los Ingenios and neighbouring city Trinidad were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Founded in 1942, the shipyard built 93 cargo ships and oil tankers, before ending operations 1945. Wartime demand for more ships In early 1942, the demands of World War II resulted in a requirement for greatly increased shipbuilding capacity. To meet this demand, the US shipbuilder W.A. Bechtel Co. decided to build a shipyard at a former Northwestern Pacific Railroad repair yard situated at Richardson's Bay in Marin County, at the north end of Sausalito, California and just three miles (5 km) north of the Golden Gate Bridge. The site was chosen because the shoreline in the vicinity of the proposed shipyard was relatively uncluttered, unlike much of the rest of San Francisco Bay or other major Pacific ports.. It had no official name while it was being built but was referred to as the \\"Marin Shipbuilding Division of W.A. Bechtel Company\\" and that lengthy title was shortened to Marin-Ship or what known today as \\"Marinship\\" with a street in Sausalito named Marinship Way. Six ship launching ways were planned, but the old repair yard, purchased from Southern Pacific Railroad, and located at the base of Spring Street, was found to have inadequate space to accommodate this need. The loss of some ships in the Pacific by the Navy triggered the emergency need for even more ships by their customer the Maritime Commission. Using this as their legal reason, the new company took government war powers condemnation actions against local property owners, in order to add the additional land they needed to expand the shipyard. With only two weeks notice, the many residents of Pine Point, a picturesque knoll located along the edge of the bay, were forcibly evicted by 28 March 1942. About 42 homes and buildings were removed. At least 12 homes avoided demolition by being rapidly moved elsewhere in Sausalito before the rest were razed and Pine Point was dynamited. Records show that an estimated of earth and rock were excavated from Pine Point, Waldo Point and nearby areas. The resulting fill was spread using heavy equipment across the shoreline and tidal mudflats to create new land on which the various buildings of the shipyard were rapidly constructed. Some of these buildings are still in use today, including the Industrial Center Building (ICB) at 480 Gate Five Road (originally the Yard Office and Mold Loft Building) and the Schoonmaker Building at 10 Libertyship Way (originally the General Shop). Building the shipyard Former Marinship Machine Shop in Sausalito. In 1950, the building was converted to a geotechnical testing laboratory. The lab closed in 1997 and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs acquired the 27,500-square-foot structure in 2006. It has been dormant since. To accomplish the rapid construction of the shipyard, 2,000 workers worked in shifts around the clock. Approximately 26,000 pilings were driven into the bay mud to create the shipways and to support the new warehouses and fabrication workshops. A wide by long deepwater ship channel was dredged in Richardson Bay to allow the newly launched vessels to reach the main portion of San Francisco Bay. Creating this channel required the removal of of bay mud. In a related effort, the creation of Marin City, adjacent to the north end of the shipyard and just across Highway 1, was brought about by the need for the rapid construction of guest worker housing. Housing for 6,000 was created in Marin City, along with supporting schools, stores and churches. Workers eager to take advantage of the well-paying wartime jobs, flocked to the West Coast from all over the United States to work at the various shipyards, including Marinship. Shipbuilding SS Tomahawk (AO-88) - a type T2-SE-A2 fleet oiler built at Marinship, Sausalito (1943-1944) After only three months from the onset of construction on the shipyard, the first ship keel was laid for the Liberty ship William A. Richardson on 27 June 1942. Five Liberty ships had been launched from Marinship by the first anniversary of the declaration of war. The Liberty ship, designed as an \\"emergency\\" type cargo ship, was long and abeam. President Roosevelt nicknamed them his \\"ugly ducklings.\\" After 15 Liberty ships were launched at Marinship, the shipyard was retooled to produce the larger T2-SE-A2 tankers, which were long, and abeam. On 16 June 1945, Marinship set a world record by constructing and delivering the tanker SS Huntington Hills in a mere 33 days, with 28 days on the way and 5 days of fitting out after launch. At its peak, 20,000 workers were employed at Marinship. In the 3¬Ω years that Marinship was active, it launched 15 Liberty ships, 16 fleet oilers, and 62 tankers ‚Äî a total of 93 ships. The Marinship Shipyards were the site of incidents that provided a key early milestone in the civil rights movement. In 1944 in the case of James v. Marinship the California Supreme Court held that African Americans could not be excluded from jobs based on their race, even if the employer took no discriminatory actions. In the case of Joseph James, on whose behalf the suit was brought, the local Boilermakers Union excluded Blacks from membership and had a \\"closed shop\\" contract, forbidding the shipbuilder from employing anyone who was not a member of the union. African American workers could join an auxiliary of the union, which offered access to fewer jobs at lower pay. Future US Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall successfully argued the case, winning a ruling that the union be required to offer equal membership to African Americans. The Court extended the ruling to apply explicitly to all unions and all workers in California. The end of the war After the end of World War II the shipyards were decommissioned almost as rapidly as they had been built, taking with them almost all of the jobs that so many had moved to the Bay Area to take during the war. The area subsequently became home to an enlarged Sausalito houseboat community.A Short History of Liveaboards on the Bay , Larry Clinton, Bay Crossings, August 2001.

Colonel Fulke-Greville Howard Levens Hall is a manor house in the Kent valley, near the village of Levens and south of Kendal in Cumbria, Northern England. History The first house on the site was a pele tower built by the Redman family in around 1350. Much of the present building dates from the Elizabethan era, when the Bellingham family extended the house. The Bellinghams, who were responsible for the fine panelling and plasterwork in the main rooms, sold the house and estate in 1689 to Colonel James Grahme, or Graham, Keeper of the Privy Purse to King James II, who made a number of additions to the house in the late 17th century. His son Henry Graham was a knight of the shire for Westmorland. Further additions were made in the early 19th century. Levens is now owned by the Bagot family and is open to the public. The small collection of steam road vehicles includes several traction engines which are usually steamed on Sundays and Bank Holidays.

The arena is used primarily for basketball, but also hosts concerts and other events. The arena has previously served as the home of the Birmingham Magicians and the Birmingham Blitz of the American Basketball Association and the Alabama Outlawz of X-League Indoor Football. It is named in honor of Bill Harris, longtime athletics director for Birmingham City Schools. In 2022, it will be the venue for the artistic roller skating and inline hockey competitions at the 2022 World Games. Professional teams In 1985, the Puerto Rico Coquis of the Continental Basketball Association considered moving to Birmingham, but discussions with the Alabama State Fair Authority did not progress quickly enough to secure a commitment. The CBA did come to the Bill Harris Arena in 1991 when the Pensacola Tornados relocated to Birmingham as the Birmingham Bandits. The Bandits played for a year before moving again to Rochester, Minnesota. The Birmingham Power of the National Women's Basketball League played home games at the arena and at Birmingham‚ÄìSouthern College's Bill Battle Coliseum during the 2001‚Äì02 season. In 2005 the Magic City Court Kings of the World Basketball Association played home games at Bill Harris Arena and Miles College. Other events A February 2001 basketball game between Stillman College and Miles College was interrupted by repeated brawls between fans of the opposing teams. The game was ended by order of the Birmingham Police Department and the 2,000 fans sent away. The Bill Harris Arena has hosted numerous basketball championships for the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and the Southwestern Athletic Conference.

The ship is now preserved in the Giza Solar boat museum. The ship was almost certainly built for Khufu (King Cheops), the second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Like other buried Ancient Egyptian ships, it was apparently part of the extensive grave goods intended for use in the afterlife, and contained no bodies, unlike northern European ship burials. Khufu's ship is one of the oldest, largest and best-preserved vessels from antiquity. It measures 43.6 m (143 ft) long and 5.9 m (19.5 ft) wide. It was thus identified as the world's oldest intact ship and has been described as \\"a masterpiece of woodcraft\\" that could sail today if put into a lake, or a river. However, the vessel may not have been designed for sailing, as there is no rigging, or for paddling, as there is no room.  History = Discovery  The ship was one of two rediscovered in 1954 by Kamal el- Mallakh ‚Äì undisturbed since it was sealed into a pit carved out of the Giza bedrock. It was built largely of Lebanon cedar planking in the \\"shell-first\\" construction technique, using unpegged tenons of Christ's thorn. The ship was built with a flat bottom composed of several planks, but no actual keel, with the planks and frames lashed together with Halfah grass, and has been reconstructed from 1,224 pieces which had been laid in a logical, disassembled order in the pit beside the pyramid. Reconstruction It took years for the boat to be reassembled, primarily by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities' chief restorer, Ahmed Youssef Moustafa. Before reconstructing the boat, Moustafa had to gain enough experience on Ancient Egyptian boat- building. He studied the reliefs carved on walls and tombs as well as many of the little wooden models of ships and boats found in tombs. Hag Ahmed visited the Nile boatyards of Old Cairo and Maadi and went to Alexandria, where wooden river boats were still being made. He hoped that modern Egyptian shipwrights had retained ship-building methods that would suggest how Ancient Egyptians built their ships. Then he investigated the work of shipwrights who built in a different tradition. Function The history and function of the ship are not precisely known. It is of the type known as a \\"solar barge\\", a ritual vessel to carry the resurrected king with the sun god Ra across the heavens. However, it bears some signs of having been used in water, and it is possible that the ship was either a funerary \\"barge\\" used to carry the king's embalmed body from Memphis to Giza, or even that Khufu himself used it as a \\"pilgrimage ship\\" to visit holy places and that it was then buried for him to use in the afterlife. The Khufu ship has been on display to the public in a specially built museum at the Giza pyramid complex since 1982. Its discovery was described as one of the greatest Ancient Egyptian discoveries in Zahi Hawass's documentary Egypt's Ten Greatest Discoveries. The ship is housed in The Khufu Boat Museum, a small modern facility resting alongside the Great Pyramid. The first floor of the museum takes the visitor through visuals, photographs and writings on the process of excavating and restoring the boat. The ditch where the main boat was found is incorporated into the museum ground floor design. To see the restored boat, the visitor must climb a staircase leading to the second floor. Floor to ceiling windows allow for much sunlight and the wooden walkway takes the visitor around the boat where the visitor can get a close view of its impressive size- 143 feet long (44m) and 19.5 feet wide (6m). Tribute On 26 May 2019, a Google Doodle was made to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Khufu ship discovery.

Notable events Auditorium in use as a temporary hospital during the 1918 flu pandemic Until 1941, Kaiser Arena hosted the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. In 1942, the Circus moved across the bay to the San Francisco Civic Auditorium and then in the mid-1960s to the Cow Palace. In the 1950s and 1960s the Roller Derby played there hundreds of times. The auditorium hosted the Oakland Symphony Orchestra until 1972, and the arena was home to the Oakland Skates roller hockey team in 1996. For almost 70 years, from 1919 until 1987, the arena was home to the annual Christmas Pageant (later the Oakland Children's Holiday Pageant) involving at least 1,700 youngsters from 70 city schools.

Biography Pierre Beauchamp was born at Versailles (Yvelines), into a family of French \\"dance masters\\" (ma√Ætres de danse). He d√©buted at the court of Louis XIV at age 12, in 1648, in the Ballet du d√©r√®glement des passions. He was made director of the Acad√©mie Royale de Danse in 1671 (although he was not a founding member of the Acad√©mie as is often claimed). Beauchamp was principal choreographer to Moli√®re's acting company (the Troupe du Roy) during 1664-1673, as well as ballet master at the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique and Compositeur des Ballets du Roi. He also gave dance lessons to Louis XIV for over twenty-two years.Rameau, Pierre; Le ma√Ætre a danser (Paris, 1725), Premi√®re partie, Chap. XXVI In these positions, he was highly influential in the development of French baroque dance. He continued to choreograph and dance at the Court of Versailles after the death of Jean- Baptiste Lully in 1687; however, choreography and composition of music and ballets for the Jesuit Colleges became his primary occupation from 1697. He died at Paris in 1705. Writing some years after the actual events, Pierre Rameau credits Beauchamp with the codification of the five positions of the feetRameau, Pierre; Le ma√Ætre a danser (Paris, 1725), Premi√®re partie, Chap. III in classical ballet, as well as a role in the development of the use of armsRameau, Pierre; Le ma√Ætre a danser (Paris, 1725), Seconde partie, Chap. I (note though that, unlike the positions of the feet, the use of arms in baroque dance differs significantly from their use in ballet). The codification method was printed in 1700 by Raoul-Auger Feuillet, who published notated dance scores, and became known as \\"Beauchamp‚ÄìFeuillet notation.\\" It was slightly modified by Pierre Rameau in 1725, but continued to be used to record dances for the stage and for domestic use throughout the eighteenth century. Two choreographies survive in manuscript copies with attributions to Beauchamp: the ballroom duet Rigaudons de Mr Bauchand, and the theatrical solo for a man Sarabande de Mr. de Beauchamp. The sarabande is unusual amongst the surviving male solos because, although it requires a virtuoso technique with its pirouettes and many ornamented steps, it contains no aerial beaten steps.

An example from the healthcare industry where Context Management is widely used, multiple applications operating \\"in context\\" through use of a context manager would allow a user to select a patient (i.e., the subject) in one application and when the user enters the other application, that patient's information is already pre-fetched and presented, obviating the need to re- select the patient in the second application. The further the user 'drills' into the application (e.g., test, result, diagnosis, etc.) all context aware applications continue to drill-down into the data, in context with the user's requests. Context management is gaining in prominence in healthcare due to the creation of the Clinical Context Object Workgroup standard committee (CCOW) which has created a standardized protocol enabling applications to function in a 'context aware' state. Context management is gaining in the Business Rule market as well. Knowing the context of any information exchange is critical. For example, a seller may need to know such things as: is this shipment urgent, is this a preferred customer, do they need English or Spanish, what model is the part for? Without context, mistakes and run-on costs rapidly ensue. In automating information integration, knowing and defining context of use is the single most pervasive and important factor. This context mechanism is at the heart of allowing users to quantify what their context factors are precisely, this removes the guesswork from business transaction exchanges between business transaction information management partners and allows them to formalize their collaboration agreements exactly.

Designed by Hans von Ohain while working at Heinkel, the engine first flew as the primary power of the Heinkel He 178, piloted by Erich Warsitz on 27 August 1939. Although successful, the engine had too little thrust to be really useful, and work started on the more powerful Heinkel HeS 8 as their first production design. Development The HeS 3 design was largely based on the HeS 1 but converted to burn liquid fuel instead of hydrogen gas used in the HeS 1. The first HeS 3 design was generally similar to the HeS 1, using an 8-blade inducer and 16-blade centrifugal compressor. The compressed air flowed into an annular combustion chamber between the compressor and turbine, which made the engine longer. The first example was bench tested around March 1938, but did not reach the design thrust because a small compressor and combustor had been used to reduce the frontal area.\\"Pioneering Turbojet Developments of Dr. Hans Von Ohain-From the HeS 1 to the HeS 011\\" Meher-Homji and Prisell, Transactions of the ASME, Vol. 122, April 2000. Max Hahn, from Heinkel, applied May 31, 1939, for an US patent, granted Sept 16, 1941: 'Aircraft Power Plant', US2256198, with the von Ohain design. An improved engine, the HeS 3b, had a 14-blade inducer and 16 blade centrifugal compressor. In order to minimise the diameter the widest part of the annular combustor was placed in line with the smaller diameter axial entry to the impeller. At exit from the impeller the air flowed forwards, then turned through 180 degrees to flow rearward through the combustor. The flow was then turned radially inwards to enter the turbine. Although not as compact as the original design, the 3b was much simpler. The fuel was used to cool rear roller bearing, which also preheated the fuel.\\"A Performance Diagnosis of the 1939 Heinkel HE S3B Turbojet\\" C. Rodgers, GT2004-53014 The engine was completed in early 1939, and was flight-tested under one of the remaining Heinkel He 118 dive bomber prototypes. The flight tests were carried out in extreme secrecy, taking off and landing under propeller power, and only flying in the early morning before other workers had arrived. Testing proceeded smoothly, but the engine eventually burned out its turbine. A second engine was completed just after completion of the He 178 airframe, so it was decided to move directly to full flight tests. A short hop was made on 24 August during high-speed taxi tests, followed by full flight on 27 August, the first aircraft to fly solely under jet power. Testing continued and in November the aircraft was demonstrated to RLM officials in hopes of receiving funding for the development of a larger engine, but nothing seemed forthcoming. Hans Mauch later told von Ohain the RLM was in fact extremely impressed, but he was concerned that Heinkel's airframe team did not have the knowledge to undertake engine development. Instead he and Helmut Schelp secretly visited a number of aircraft engine manufacturers to try to start programs there. Mauch left his position in 1939 leaving Schelp in command. Schelp was not as concerned about where development was taking place, and immediately started funding Heinkel to produce a more powerful engine. HeS 6 Work on a larger version, the HeS 6, started immediately, and was tested under a Heinkel He 111 late in 1939. While successful, raising thrust just above 590 kgf (1300 lbf), weight increased from 360 to 420 kg and specific fuel consumption remained unchanged at 1.6 kg/kgf (1.6 lb/lbf). The diameter of the engines remained too large to directly substitute the planned HeS 30 (109-006) engines on the He 280 fighter, therefore the design was abandoned in favour of the more compact Heinkel HeS 8 utilizing a straight-through flow combustion layout.

It is a combination of two campuses situated in Minneapolis and Duluth, Minnesota. The University of Minnesota Medical School is also part of one of the largest Academic Health Centers (AHC) in the United States. This center allows health professionals to train collaboratively during the course of their training programs. The AHC comprises the Medical School, School of Dentistry, School of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, School of Public Health, and the College of Veterinary Medicine. History The University of Minnesota Medical School began in the late nineteenth century when three of the private medical schools in the Twin Cities in Minnesota offered up their charters and merged their programs to form the University of Minnesota Medical School. A fourth school was absorbed in the early twentieth century. As a consequence of these mergers in 1888 and 1908, the School is the only medical school in the Twin Cities or Duluth and is one of only two in the state, the other being the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. The University of Minnesota Medical School has made use of many facilities over the years. Older buildings still prominently standing include the Mayo Memorial Building (1954) and Jackson Hall (1912). Jackson Hall was built as the home of the Institute of Anatomy and is still the site of anatomy instruction for medical students, undergraduates, and students of dentistry, nursing, physical therapy, and mortuary science. More visible today are the 1978 Phillips-Wangensteen and Moos Tower buildings. A new University Hospital overlooking the river was completed in 1986. The Duluth program began in late 1972. It is now a branch campus of the Medical School, specializing in the training of physicians for rural and small-town settings in rural Minnesota. Academics The University of Minnesota Medical School offers seven dual- degree programs for students interested in combining their medical education with a degree in medical research (MD/PhD), public health (MD/MPH), biomedical engineering (MD/MS), law (MD/JD), business (MD/MBA), or health informatics (MD/MHI). In addition to training medical students for their MD degrees the University of Minnesota Medical School also has numerous residencies as part of their graduate medical education programs. The larger of the two campuses is in the Twin Cities. This campus has approximately 170 students in each of the first two years of medical school with a mixture of traditional medical students and students pursuing combined advanced degrees such as a Ph.D. through a MSTP scholarship. As the larger of the two campuses, the Twin Cities campus provides increased opportunities for research and specialty care and also provides the main clinical education site for both campuses. Thus, at the end of the fourth year, the total graduating class at Minneapolis usually exceeds 220 students. The University of Minnesota Medical school makes use of many teaching hospitals in the Twin Cities area. The University of Minnesota Medical Center is just one of these; others include Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), Regions Hospital (St. Paul), North Memorial Hospital (Robbinsdale), Children Hospital of Minneapolis and St Paul, Abbott Northwestern Hospital, and the Minneapolis Veteran's Administration Hospital. The Duluth campus, formerly the University of Minnesota Duluth School of Medicine, has approximately 60 students enrolled for each of the first two years of medical school. After that point, they are automatically transferred to the Twin Cities campus for their clinical rotations. The mission of the Duluth Campus is to select and educate students who will likely select Family Medicine/Primary Care and practice in rural locations. Duluth is also a primary site for the Center for American Indian and Minority Health which aims to educate increased numbers of Native American students as medical professionals. In May 2018, the University of Minnesota Medical School announced to establish an independent high-profile anti-aging research department in the university. Rankings In 2019, US News & World Report ranked the University of Minnesota Medical School 46th (tie) in the United States for medical research and 12th (tie) for primary care. A 2010 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found the University of Minnesota Medical School to be one of only two of 141 medical schools in the United States to be in the top quartile for NIH funding, output of primary care physicians, and social mission score.

His works in this field have been partially published in the yearbook of the German Institutum Canarium,Almogaren as well as in the yearbook of University of C√°diz (Spain). He has published scientific articles in German official reviews like Zeitschrift f√ºr Ethnologie and Jahrbuch des Museums f√ºr Anthropologie M√ºnchen. His book on early metal age civilizations (horra) gives a new dimension to prehistoric research.The Beginning of the Metal Age, in: Migration and Diffusion vol. 4/no. 14 (Odyssee Editorial 2003) see also http://www.ilya.it/chrono/pages/metallzeiten.htm Topper has also written about the Book of Revelation (Das letzte Buch, 1993), about Reincarnation beliefs from a historical and ethnological perspective (Wiedergeburt, 1988), Sufism in North Africa (Sufis und Heilige im Maghreb, 1984/1991) and popular traditions in Morocco.M√§rchen der Berber (German, translated into Italian and Spanish) He lives in Berlin. In 1995, Topper, who by then had got in contact with a group of German researchers including Gunnar Heinsohn, Heribert Illig, Christoph Marx and others, who all question the established chronology, decided to take a closer look at the Middle Ages and published a series of books which try to show that History, as we know it, was created from the 16th century onwards - according to this idea, there are hardly well-dated facts before 1400 AD. Titles include Die Gro√üe Aktion [The Big Action](1998) Erfundene Geschichte [Invented History](1999), F√§lschungen der Geschichte [Faked History](2001), ZeitF√§lschung [Faking Time] (2003), several are translated into Russian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Corean. His focus on falsifications in the Middle Ages and modern times raised interest in German press.Die Lange Nacht der F√§lscher und F√§lschungen Deutschlandradio, 24 August 2002 His knowledge of Arabic and Berber makes him focus especially on North African subjects.

War Comics : A Graphic History. Lewes : Ilex, 2009. (pgs. 110-111) Publication history It was first published in 1974 by D.C. Thomson. The comic was dedicated to wartime adventures and was a popular success, leading IPC Magazines to create a competitor, Battle Picture Weekly, in 1975. Warlord included several stories per issue, initially centred on a character called Lord Peter Flint (Codename: Warlord), a World War II version of the popular spy James Bond. At the end of 1978 Warlord absorbed D. C. Thomson's action comic Bullet. In total, Warlord ran for twelve years (627 issues), from 1974 until 1986, at which point it was incorporated into the long-running Victor. For the next four years after the comic's demise the publishers produced summer specials, ending in 1991. Characters and stories included the popular Union Jack Jackson, Spider Wells, Bomber Braddock and Wingless Wonder. Features included True Life War Story and articles on weaponry called Weapons In Action. After Bullet was added to the comic, it featured that publication's main story Fireball -- a secret agent who was Lord Peter Flint's nephew. The comic would often include free gifts such as replica military badges and plastic model warplanes. By solving a cryptographic puzzle and paying a small fee, a reader could become a \\"Warlord Secret Agent\\" with an identity card and code book, allowing him to decipher secret messages printed in the comic each week (a gimmick originally employed in the 1950s radio series Captain Midnight). Before the addition of the more generally action-orientated Bullet, Warlord had been specifically geared towards stories and articles about World War II. Much of the language used in the stories was modern, and terms given used to describe the enemy reflected commonly used descriptions. The Allied forces always won in the end, and both Germans and Japanese were frequently negatively stereotyped. Sometimes the Germans were shown in a heroic light, usually with honourable Wehrmacht or Luftwaffe officers as the heroes, and committed Nazis or SS officers as the bad guys. These tales were usually set on the Eastern Front to ensure the Germans were not shown killing their British or US enemies, the Russians being useful bogeymen. Comic Strips that followed this model included Iron Annie, about a heroic Junkers Ju 52 'Iron Annie' crew, and Kampfgruppe Falken which followed the exploits of a German penal battalion on the Eastern Front. List of major characters Warlord included many stories and characters set mainly in World War II and later conflicts like Korea. Though most of them featured heroes from Allied nations such as the UK and the US, there were some series which took the German point of view. They included: *Union Jack Jackson: a British Royal Marine serving with the US Marine Corps in the Pacific campaign during World War II. To distinguish himself from his American comrades Sgt. Lonnegan and G.I O'Bannion (when using American equipment) he painted a Union Jack on his helmet, hence the character name. He was often referred to as U.J.J. by his American comrades, and served in the Pacific, Chinese, and European theatres of war. He actually originated in the pages of Hotspur in 1957, debuting as a text feature before becoming a comic strip star in the 'New' Hotspur in 1962. :Not to be confused with Union Jack, a Marvel comics character created by Roy Thomas and Frank Robbins. *Codename: Warlord: He was a British secret agent and can be considered a World War II James Bond. His real name/cover was Lord Peter Flint, a despised conscientious objector who refused to participate in the war. His usual opponents were the Gestapo, Abwehr and Japanese intelligence, who (despite his cover) seemed to know his true identity and referred to him as \\"Flint\\". :His boss in London was the Churchillian (in character and physique) and probably purposefully so, secret service head 'Kingpin' who was to Warlord as 'M' is to James Bond. Warlord's mannerisms and idiom were Edwardian English upper class with such phrases as 'old chap', 'then I'm a Dutchman' and the casual (having just thwarted the Germans single-handedly again) 'toodle pip' (meaning 'goodbye') as he made his usual breathtaking escape to retake the mantle of his alter ego, the stay at home English gentleman, Lord Peter Flint. :Recurring enemies were Karl Schaft, an honourable German Abwehr agent. He was the mirror image of Flint in that both were patriotic and top agents. Adolf Gruber was very much the stereotyped evil Gestapo agent and had met Flint before the war when he had been a servant for one of Flint's German friends. A stable accident left Gruber with a limp and he blamed Flint for the accident. :The storyline borrowed from The Scarlet Pimpernel the idea of a seemingly upper-class fop actually being a daring wartime agent. Flint's ability to live in the real world as a flawed human being but hold secret his knowledge of his other 'superhuman' traits (the British 'stiff upper lip') is analogous to the modern era's 'Superman'. :The character 'Fireball' in Warlords sister comic Bullet (who ended up being incorporated into Warlord after Bullet was cancelled) was later revealed to be the nephew of Lord Peter Flint, and an older Flint made occasional guest appearances in the Fireball strip. :An aged Flint later reappeared in the digital Dandy's Retro Active story, as the commander of a superhero team. *Killer Kane: Squadron Leader Kane of the RAF during and after the Battle of Britain. (Not to be confused with Buck Rogers' nemesis of the same name.) *Kampfgruppe Falken: Major Heinz Falken leads a Dirty Dozen-like group of German soldiers from military penal battalions. Heinz Falken was the commanding officer of the battalion. He was an ex-panzer commander who had been sent to the penal battalion for not carrying out war crimes to please his Nazi commander during the Blitzkrieg campaign of 1940. *Wolverine: French- Canadian Sergeant Revelle leads a mixed crew of Allied soldiers in a M10 Wolverine tank destroyer. *Iron Annie: the adventures of Kurt Stahlmann of the Luftwaffe and his Ju 52 transport plane during World War II. *Kelly's Choppers: Lieutenant Jack Kelly, a United States Air Force helicopter pilot in Korea. *The Best of Enemies: During the Korean War, British Sergeant Tom Wilson forms a tense alliance with Muller, a German with whom he has old scores to settle. *Harrier Squadron: The adventures of an international squadron of pilots flying the Harrier fighter-bomber during a future World War Three style conflict between the democratic Wesfed (Western Federation) and tyrannical Asbloc (Asian Block), thinly disguised versions of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The continuation of an earlier storyline called Holocaust Squadron. *Bligh of the Fastsure: Set in the same world as Harrier Squadron it centres on Royal Navy Captain Bligh, in charge of a flotilla of advanced hydrofoils fighting a guerilla war from the Orkney and Shetland Islands against Asbloc forces occupying Great Britain. *Cassidy: US Navy fighter squadron leader Cassidy fights the Japanese in the Pacific. *Rayker: Afro- American infantry Sergeant Rayker fights against both the Germans and racial discrimination in early 1945 Europe. *Ryker: British Dispatch Rider who remains on Crete following the evacuation and fights a one-man war against the Germans using Zundapp Motorcycle he captured and fitted with 2 PIAT's from the huge hidden supply dump in a mountain cave which acts as his base and hideout! He sometimes operates with the Cretan Resistance and finally left Crete and returned to England. He was later to return in a second run where he was sent to Norway to assist the Norwegian Resistance this time equipped with a British BSA M20 Motorcycle armed with American Bazookas. *Sgt Heavy: ex-SAS sergeant undertakes secret missions for clients in trouble after setting himself up as a private detective. *Goum: Arab soldier who helps the British fight the Nazis in North Africa. *The Bonzo Express: British Sergeant Pilot Jimmy Kells commands a joint UK-US group of pilots flying the titular aircraft, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.

It is a subsidiary of Stagecoach Group. A Stagecoach South East Volvo B10M/Plaxton Paladin wearing a special heritage livery celebrating 100 years of transport in Hastings, which this bus is from. History Stagecoach have been operating in the Hastings area since their takeover of Hastings & District Transport in 1989. Stagecoach have made a vast amount of improvements to the Hastings bus network. All the improvements are in partnership with Hastings Borough Council and East Sussex County Council. Stagecoach acquired the East Kent Road Car Company in 1993 and operates many routes with different route branding. In early November 2008, local press reported that Eastbourne Buses was to be sold by the end of the year to either the Go-Ahead Group or Stagecoach Group. The employees' trade union, Unite, wrote to Eastbourne Borough Council to ask the Council to sell to the Go-Ahead Group, because of work conditions and a superior fleet. On 25 November 2008, it was announced that Stagecoach was the preferred bidder to purchase. A few days later, it was announced in local press that the takeover had cost ¬£4 million. Stagecoach had run services in the town until late in 2000 before they were withdrawn, and at the time of the announcement operated services to Hastings and Bexhill from Eastbourne. The sale caused a lot of controversy, with MPs criticising the secrecy surrounding the sale and blaming each other's parties for the state the Eastbourne Buses got into, the Liberal Democrats claiming the Conservatives \\"failed to support Eastbourne Buses\\". There has also been criticism of the low price the company was sold at - revealed at ¬£3.7 million, lower than the original report of 4 - and criticism against Stagecoach, one MP saying that the company has effectively been \\"given away for nothing\\". However, it was revealed that Go-Ahead had bid much lower at ¬£2.85 million, so the council had to sell to Stagecoach to serve the taxpayer due to the ¬£1.2 million difference in bids, despite the union's calls. In January 2009, Cavendish Motor Services were bought by Stagecoach Group. Stagecoach announced redundancies for Cavendish staff. The company was then merged with Eastbourne Buses and rebranded as Stagecoach. On 13 May 2009, the Office of Fair Trading announced that it was referring the purchase of Eastbourne Buses and Cavendish Motor Services by Stagecoach to the Competition Commission. Although the provisional decision found that the acquisitions had substantially lessened competition, the Competition Commission cleared the purchase in October 2009 after deciding that Cavendish would have chosen either to reduce its services substantially or even to close its operations altogether following Stagecoach's acquisition of Eastbourne Buses. On 22 January 2012, 11 new Alexander Dennis Enviro400 bodied Scania N230UD's were introduced on The Wave 99 that runs between Hastings and Eastbourne via Bexhill and Pevensey Bay. On 19 April 2012, 23 new Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart's were introduced on the local Hastings Arrow routes. On 30 June 2013, Stagecoach in Eastbourne introduced a summer only service, Route 110, to celebrate 110 years of bus services in Eastbourne, using a 1967 Eastbourne Buses Leyland Titan PD2 or a 1950 AEC Regal on a circular service around the town. From 26 April 2015, Hastings saw a major reconstruction of its bus services. Route 2 was extended from Tenterden to Hastings Station to replace routes 340 and 341. The Wave 100 and 101 also changed, with buses serving Hastings every 30 minutes from Kent. The 101 was routed via Fairlight from Rye to replace route 344. Hastings Arrows' Sunday evening service was slightly reduced due to cut of funding from East Sussex County Council. Until July 2017, Stagecoach operated National Express coach routes 007, 021, and 022, which were then taken over by The Kings Ferry. East Kent had operated services from Kent to Victoria Coach Station since 1932.\\"NatEx ends East Kent's 90-year London connection\\" Buses Magazine issue 750 September 2017 page 16 Current Operations Stagecoach East has three divisions: *Stagecoach in East Kent *Stagecoach in Eastbourne *Stagecoach in Hastings Depots Stagecoach South East operate seven depots *Folkestone *Ashford *Dover *Herne Bay *St Leonards *Eastbourne *Westwood (Thanet) Routes Stagecoach South East operate a number of branded routes.

Little & Often routes The Little & Often routes were launched in early January 2017 in Ashford to upgrade the existing B1 and B2 (merged into B) and the C routes. As part of the initiative, the limited regular buses on these routes were replaced with 30 Mercedes Sprinter City 45 minibuses to run frequently and conveniently for passengers to reduce waiting times - hence the name 'Little & Often'. The fleet of Euro 6 spec minibuses belong to the Ashford depot and are among the first in the region to feature contactless payment. Routes E and G have since been converted to minibus operation, resulting in reduced daytime frequencies on routes B and C in order to improve reliability. Other services *251/252: Tunbridge Wells - Heathfield *51: Heathfield - Eastbourne *254: Tunbridge Wells - Hawkhurst *304/305: Hawkhurst - Hastings Stagecoach provides joint bus and rail tickets with the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway at Hythe, New Romney, and Romney Sands in the Romney Sands Holiday Park, where The Wave services meet the railway.

The route runs from U.S. Route 50 (US 50) in Mardela Springs, Wicomico County north to MD 213 and MD 290 in Galena, Kent County. It is predominantly a rural two-lane road that runs through agricultural areas a short distance west of the Delaware border, with the exception of a four-lane divided bypass of Denton that is concurrent with MD 404. MD 313 serves many communities, including Sharptown, Eldorado, Federalsburg, Denton, Greensboro, Goldsboro, Barclay, Sudlersville, Millington, and Massey. The route intersects many major roads, including MD 54 in Mardela Springs, MD 404 in the Denton area, MD 302 in Barclay, MD 300 in Sudlersville, and US 301 near Massey. The designation MD 313 was first used in 1927 for the road running from Eldorado to Galena, while the portion south to Mardela Springs was designated a part of US 213. By 1933, the route was extended to Mardela Springs following a realignment of US 213. MD 313 was rerouted to bypass Ingleside in 1949 and Greensboro in 1950. The route was moved to its current alignment between Federalsburg and Denton in 1954, replacing what had been briefly designated MD 322 between Federalsburg and Andersontown. The former alignment is now Auction Road and American Corner Road (formerly designated MD 630) and MD 16. The route bypassed Federalsburg in 1964. MD 313 was moved to a one-way pair in Denton along with MD 404 in 1972. In 1987, MD 313 and MD 404 were moved onto the four-lane divided bypass of the town. The original routing of MD 313 in Denton is designated MD 619. The divided highway in the Denton area was extended further south in the early 2000s. The remaining two-lane portions of MD 313 that are concurrent with MD 404 are slated to be upgraded to a four-lane divided highway to provide relief to beach traffic along MD 404, a part of the main route between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches. Route description MD 313 runs through rural areas of woods and farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, generally a short distance west of the Delaware border. The route heads through five counties in Maryland from south to north: Wicomico, Dorchester, Caroline, Queen Anne's, and Kent. It connects several towns including Mardela Springs and Sharptown in Wicomico County, Eldorado in Dorchester County, Federalsburg, Denton, Greensboro and Goldsboro in Caroline County, Barclay and Sudlersville in Queen Anne's County, and Millington and Galena in Kent County. MD 313 is a part of the National Highway System along its concurrency with MD 404 from Andersontown to Denton. Wicomico and Dorchester counties Shaprtown Bridge over the Nanticoke River MD 313 begins at an intersection with US 50 in Mardela Springs, Wicomico County, where the route heads east past residences along Delmar Road, a two-lane undivided road. A short distance past US 50, the route turns north onto Sharptown Road, with MD 54 continuing east on Delmar Road toward the Delaware-Maryland state border town of Delmar. The route passes west of Mardela Middle and High School and continues north past more residences before it leaves Mardela Springs and heads into farmland a short distance west of the Delaware border. It continues through a mix of woods and farms with some residences before reaching Sharptown. Here, the road intersects unsigned MD 813F (Twiford Road). MD 313 bypasses Sharptown to the south and intersects MD 348 (Laurel Road). Past this intersection, the route turns north and runs along the eastern edge of the town before crossing over the Nanticoke River on the Sharptown Bridge. Upon crossing the Nanticoke River, MD 313 enters Dorchester County and heads northwest through wooded areas before continuing into a mix of woodland and farmland. It turns west before heading northwest again and reaching the town of Eldorado. Here, the route intersects the eastern terminus of MD 14 (Rhodesdale Eldorado Road). At this intersection, MD 313 makes a right turn to head north on Eldorado Road. The route leaves Eldorado and it continues through farmland with some patches of woods. It intersects MD 392 (Finchville Reliance Road) in Finchville and passes more farming areas with intermittent residences before coming to an intersection with MD 577 (Reliance Road) on the Caroline County border in Allens Corner. Caroline County At the MD 577 intersection, MD 313 runs northwest along the border of Caroline and Dorchester counties as Reliance Road. The route heads toward the town of Federalsburg, passing through a mix of agricultural and residential areas. The route then leaves the border line and enters Caroline County, intersecting MD 318 (Federalsburg Highway) and making a left turn to form a concurrency with that route. The two routes bypass Federalsburg to the south, crossing over Marshyhope Creek. After crossing the creek, the road intersects MD 308 (South Main Street). The road passes an industrial park before turning north into wooded areas and crossing the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Seaford Line at-grade. After the railroad crossing, MD 313 and MD 318 intersect MD 307 (Williamsburg Road) at a roundabout located in the southwestern corner of Federalsburg. A short distance later, MD 318 splits from MD 313 by heading west on Preston Road while MD 315 continues east into Federalsburg on Bloomingdale Avenue. Past this intersection, MD 313 continues north on the Federalsburg Highway, leaving the Federalsburg area and heading into a mix of woodland and farmland. Shields for MD 16, MD 313, and MD 404 along a concurrency in AndersontownIn Andersontown, MD 313 intersects MD 16 and MD 404 (Shore Highway). Here, the route makes a northwest turn onto that road, forming a three-route concurrency. At this point, the Shore Highway heads northwest through a mix of woods and farms with some homes before widening to a four-lane divided highway. Upon widening into a divided highway, MD 16 splits from MD 313 and MD 404 at an intersection and heads west on Harmony Road. Past this intersection, MD 313 crosses over Watts Creek and heads north through farmland, passing east of Martinak State Park. The road heads into commercial areas in the southern part of Denton. The road turns northeast into woods and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 404 Bus. (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an at-grade intersection. Past this intersection, MD 313 and MD 404 become a freeway and head north, passing residential neighborhoods and woodland along the eastern side of Denton. The road turns to the west and comes to a diamond interchange where MD 313 splits from the MD 404 freeway by heading north on two-lane undivided Greensboro Road and MD 619 heads south into Denton on Sixth Street. The route heads through farmland before passing residences and intersecting the western terminus of MD 317 (Burrsville Road) in Oil City. Past MD 317, the road continues through mostly wooded areas with some residences and farmland. It reaches the town of Greensboro, where MD 313 intersects MD 314 (Whiteleysburg Road). The route crosses the Choptank River past MD 314 and continues to the intersection with the eastern terminus of MD 480 (Ridgely Road) just north of Greensboro. The road continues north through agricultural areas before entering Goldsboro, where the route becomes Old Town Road. In Goldsboro, MD 313 crosses an unused railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation and intersects MD 311 (Main Street), continuing through residential areas before coming to an intersection with MD 287 (Old Line Road). Here, the route makes a left turn to head west on Goldsboro Road. MD 313 leaves Goldsboro and heads into a mix of farmland and woodland. The road curves northwest and intersects unsigned MD 820 (Castle Hall Road), where it heads back to the west. MD 313 turns to the northwest and intersects the northern terminus of MD 312 (Oakland Road) in Baltimore Corner, where it heads north through farm fields past that intersection. Queen Anne's County View north along MD 313 at MD 300 in Sudlersville MD 313 crosses Long Marsh Ditch into Queen Anne's County and continues north through more farmland, before intersecting the eastern terminus of MD 19 (Roberts Station Road) in Ingleside. The route proceeds north, with a traffic count of 2,270 vehicles at the Merrick Corner Road intersection, before reaching the town of Barclay. Here, the road passes residences and intersects MD 302 (Church Street). Past this intersection, the road crosses the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at-grade before leaving Barclay and heading back into agricultural areas. The Maryland and Delaware Railroad line runs a short distance to the east of MD 313 before eventually running next to the road as it passes through a mix of farms, woods, and residences. The route enters Sudlersville, where it passes through residential areas in the town on Church Street, with the railroad line drawing farther to the east. In the center of town, the road intersects MD 300 (Main Street). Past the MD 300 intersection, MD 313 intersects MD 837 (Church Circle), an unsigned loop to westbound MD 300. Upon leaving Sudlersville, the route becomes Millington Road and heads north through farm fields with intermittent residences. MD 313 heads into forested areas as it runs a short distance to the east of US 301. It leaves the woodland as it intersects the eastern terminus of MD 544 (Mcginnis Road). The route heads northeast through a mix of agricultural and residential areas before turning east in a patch of woodland and passing more farm fields and residences. MD 313 turns northeast into wooded residential areas and enters Millington, where it becomes Sassafras Street. Kent County The northern terminus of MD 313 in Galena as viewed from MD 213 southboundMD 313 crosses the Chester River into Kent County, where it continues north through Millington and crosses MD 291 (Cypress Street). The road passes more residences before leaving Millington and becoming Galena Road, which passes by farmland and some residences. MD 313 reaches Massey, where it passes by residences before coming to an intersection at the center of town where it makes a left turn to remain along Galena Road. It is here that MD 299 heads north on Massey Road and MD 330 heads east on Maryland Line Road. The route leaves Massey and heads west through farm fields, crossing the Chestertown Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at-grade before heading northwest into forested areas. The route intersects the multi- lane, divided US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection in which traffic on MD 313 cannot continue directly across US 301 and must use a U-turn ramp in the median of that route. Past the US 301 intersection, the route officially becomes MD 313A, but is still signed as MD 313. It heads west through farmland before turning north and intersecting MD 290 (Chesterville Road). The two routes continue north together into Galena, where the road becomes Main Street. It passes residences before intersecting MD 213 (Main Street) in the center of town where MD 313 ends, MD 290 turns east on Cross Street, and MD 213 goes northbound on Main Street and southbound by going west on Cross Street. History In 1911, what is now MD 313 was built as a state highway between Mardela Springs and Riverton, to the north of Federalsburg, and between south of Denton and Greensboro, with the portions between Riverton and Sharptown and Williston and Denton under contract. At this time, the state highway was under proposal between Sharptown and Eldorado, north of Federalsburg and Williston, and Greensboro and Ingleside. By 1915, the state highway was completed between Riverton and Eldorado and south of Denton and Ingleside. The state road was finished to the north of Eldorado, between Federalsburg and Williston, to the north of Ingleside, to the south of Sudlersville, and from west of Massey to Galena by 1921. At this time, the remainder of the state highway was under proposal between Eldorado and Galena. By 1923, portions of the state highway were completed to the south of Federalsburg, between north of Ingleside and south of Sudlersville, and from north of Sudlersville to west of Massey. MD 313 was designated in 1927 to run from US 213 in Eldorado north to US 213 in Galena. The route headed north from Eldorado to Federalsburg, where it continued northwest to Williston, northeast to Denton, north to Goldsboro, northwest to Ingleside, north to Massey, and northwest to Galena. All of MD 313 was state-maintained except for two portions to the south of Federalsburg. At this time, the road between Mardela Springs and Eldorado was designated as part of US 213, which ran from Ocean City to Elkton. By 1933, the southern terminus of MD 313 was extended to US 213 in Mardela Springs when US 213 was rerouted to cross the Nanticoke River in Vienna. At this time, the missing state-maintained segments south of Federalsburg were completed. By 1949, the route was moved to a straight alignment bypassing Ingleside to the east, with the former routing becoming an extended MD 19 and St. Paul Road. In 1950, MD 313 was rerouted to bypass Greensboro to the east. The former alignment through Greensboro became an extended MD 314 along Sunset Avenue and an extended MD 480 along Main Street. Construction on the modern alignment of MD 313 between Federalsburg and Andersontown began by 1950; MD 322 was assigned to the new highway by 1952. In 1954, MD 313 replaced MD 322 on the new highway from Federalsburg to Andersontown and continued concurrent with MD 404 between Andersontown and Denton. The former alignment became MD 630 along Auction Road and American Corner Road between Federalsburg and Bureau and was removed from a concurrency with MD 16 between Bureau and Denton. In 1964, MD 313 was moved to a bypass to the south and west of Federalsburg along with MD 318, with the former alignment through the town becoming Reliance Avenue and MD 315. In 1972, MD 404 and MD 313 were relocated to a one-way pair, eastbound Franklin Street and westbound Gay Street, through Denton. The routes previously headed south out of Denton on Sixth Street and Fifth Avenue. The former alignment along Sixth Street became MD 619 by 1978. In the early 1980s, construction began to widen MD 313/MD 404 to a divided highway around Denton. By 1985, construction was underway for the four-lane divided bypass of Denton between MD 404 west of Denton and MD 313 north of Denton. In 1987, MD 313 and MD 404 were rerouted to bypass Denton along the newly completed four-lane divided bypass. The former alignment of MD 313 through Denton became MD 404 Bus. along Franklin and Gay streets and MD 619 along Sixth Street. In 1987, MD 313 was moved to a bypass to the north and east of Sharptown, having previously followed State Street through the town. A superstreet intersection was built at US 301 in 2000, resulting in the northern terminus of MD 313 being officially moved to US 301 and the portion of the route between US 301 and MD 213 being designated MD 313A. The divided highway portion of MD 313/MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. The remaining two- lane portions of MD 313 that are concurrent with MD 404 are slated to be widened into a four-lane divided highway in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts along MD 404. The Federalsburg Bypass bridge over Marshyhope Creek, which was originally built in 1962, was rehabilitated in 2012. During the project, which replaced the bridge's deck, alternating one-way traffic crossed the bridge directed by traffic lights at either end of the construction area.

Correspondent accounts are established through bilateral agreements between the two banks. Application Commonly, correspondent accounts are the accounts of foreign banks that require the ability to pay and receive the domestic currency. A bank will typically require correspondent accounts for holding currencies outside of jurisdictions where it has a branch or affiliate. This is because most central bank settlement systems do not register deposits or transfer funds to banks not doing business in their countries. With few exceptions, the actual funds held in any foreign currency account (whether for a bank or for its customer) are held in the bank's correspondent account in that currency's home country. Even where a bank has branches or affiliates in multiple jurisdictions, balances in a foreign currency account in one jurisdiction are held with a correspondent account at either that bank's branch or affiliate in the foreign country, or at another institution. For example, HSBC receives US dollars at its affiliate, HSBC Bank USA, while DBS Bank Singapore receives US dollars at JPMorgan Chase. Example An oil company is a customer of ING in Amsterdam, and sells a cargo of 500,000 barrels of oil for $40 million to a trading company who is a customer of Credit Suisse. ING Amsterdam holds its dollars at Bank of America and Credit Suisse holds its dollars at The Bank of New York Mellon. When the Swiss trader instructs its bank to pay the money, Credit Suisse debits the trader's account and transfers dollars from its account at BNY to ING's account at BofA. Then, ING credits the dollars to the oil company's dollar account in Amsterdam.

Early life Hedding was born near Pine Plains in Dutchess County, New York to parents of English origin. He was trained in prayer by his mother, who was brought into the church under circuit preacher Benjamin Abbot. It is said that when he was only three years old, his mother taught him the first principles of the Christian faith and he felt the fear of God. For several years he practiced secret prayer. When Abbott began preaching in the neighborhood, his ministry resulted in the conversion not only of Hedding's mother, but his grandmother and other relatives as well, all of whom joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. Hedding attended public worship with his mother and remained with her in class-meeting after the preaching. Bishop Matthew Simpson related one occasion in Hedding's young life of Christian faith: :after Mr. Abbott had spoken to the class, he went to little Elijah and said, \\"Well, my boy, do you think you are a sinner?\\" He replied, \\"Yes, sir.\\" Mr. Abbott then, with vehemence and loud voice, said, \\"There's many a boy in hell not as old as you are,\\" and most impressively exhorted him to seek religion. Bishop Hedding says of this event, \\"It not only frightened me but produced real religious concern, as I doubt not it was accompanied by the operation of God's Holy Spirit.\\" When he was about 10 years old, Hedding's parents moved to Vermont. When he was about 15 or 16, a Methodist family from Connecticut moved into the neighborhood and began holding meetings in their home. There was singing and praying, and Hedding, being a good reader, was appointed to read one of John Wesley's sermons or a portion of Baxter's Call. These meetings were kept up regularly until 1798, when this home became a Methodist preaching place on a regular circuit. The woman of the house, reportedly a Mrs. Bushnell, used to frequently talk with young Hedding privately on the subject of the Christian religion. He is reported to have said about those conversations (quoted by Bishop Simpson): :Her conversation, more than anything else, was the means of my seeking religion. After one of these conversations, on my way home I turned into a grove and kneeled by the side of a great tree and covenanted with God to part with all my idols and seek salvation with all my heart. About six weeks after this, Hedding remained in class-meeting after preaching, when the preacher and brethren, seeing his distress, kneeled in interceded for him. During the meeting he received spiritual comfort and gave his name as a probationer in the Methodist Episcopal Church on 27 December 1798. At the time of his awakening, Hedding received some comfort but he had not a clear consciousness of his acceptance and conversion. He says of this, quoted by Bishop Simpson: :About six weeks after this, while conversing with a brother about the Witness of the Spirit, the light of the Spirit broke in upon my mind as clear and perceptible as the sun when it comes from behind a cloud, testifying that I 'was' born of God, and that it was done at the time before named, when my guilt was removed and I found peace in believing. Circuit riding and ordained ministry Though only licensed as an exhorter, in 1799 Hedding supplied the place of Lorenzo Dow who had left his circuit. In 1801 Hedding was admitted on probation in the Newark Annual Conference. He was ordained, both deacon and elder, by Bishop Richard Whatcoat. Hedding served a variety of appointments, as a pioneer circuit preacher or a city pastor. In 1807 he was appointed the presiding elder of the New Hampshire district. In 1811 he was stationed in Boston. In 1817 he was again a presiding elder, this time in the Portland district. He was subsequently appointed to Lynn Common, to Boston, and then the Boston district. \\"Father Taylor\\", the noted sailor preacher, was converted under Hedding at the Bromfield Street M.E. Church in Boston. Episcopal ministry Hedding was elected and consecrated as a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church at the general conference which met in Baltimore in May 1824. For nearly 28 years he performed the duties of his office with great ability. Bishop Matthew Simpson offered this assessment of Hedding's episcopacy: :He was remarkable for promptness in duty, wisdom in council, strict integrity, and deep piety. Anxious days and sleepless nights and strong intercessions with God showed his deep solicitude for the prosperity of the churches. His pulpit power, his excellence as an officer, his administrative ability, gave him prominence in the affections and confidence of the M.E. Church. Faith in the face of death Hedding suffered in his early years from violent attacks of inflammatory rheumatism. He became seriously ill in 1848 but continued to work. He said, \\"I hope for, and expect to receive, salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.\\" Hedding's last illness was protracted and severe. Nevertheless, his mental powers were clear and vigorous to the last. About 10 days before his death he said, quoted by Bishop Simpson: :With the stroke God gave me wonderful grace, and it has been with me ever since. Not a day, not an hour, not a moment have I had any doubt or tormenting fear of death. I have been times so that it was doubtful whether I would live five minutes, but all was bright and glorious. But to-day I have been wonderfully blessed. :I was reflecting upon the wonder of God's mercy,--how a just and infinite and holy God could take such vile creatures to dwell with Him in so holy a place; so unworthy, so sinful, so polluted. I thought of His great mercy to me,--how much He had done for me,--and I had such glorious views of the atonement of Christ,--His sufferings and the glory that should follow,--that my soul was filled in a wonderful manner. :I have served God more than fifty years. I have generally had peace, but I never saw such glory before, such light, and such gloriousness, such beauty! Oh, I want to tell it to all the world! Oh, had I a trumpet voice, After a protracted illness, Hedding died on 9 April 1852 in Poughkeepsie, New York. He was buried in a rural cemetery on the east side of the Hudson, below Poughkeepsie. In 1862, a decade after his death, a Methodist campmeeting ground in Epping, New Hampshire, was named in his honor.

It was established to coordinate and represent the activities of Jewish political and religious groups, with headquarters in Berlin, and provide legal defence in the face of growing persecution of the Nazi era. The organization was constantly being reorganized and remained active in communities nationwide until after the Holocaust. It ceased to exist in June 1943. The Berlin Rabbi Leo Baeck was elected president of the Reichsvertretung with Otto Hirsch acting as its chairman. Mission The Reichsvertretung provided administrative know-how for Jewish Germans to organize self-help. It established central welfare organizations, occupational retraining for dismissed officials (fired in accordance with the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed 7 April 1933), preparation for emigration, built up schools and institution of elementary to higher education open for Jewish students and pupils. Thus the Reichsvertretung could develop - at least to some extent - a response to the Racial policy of Nazi Germany. With the passing of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, the Reichsvertretung was forced to rename itself as Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland (Reich's Deputation of the Jews in Germany). In the same year Israelitisches Familienblatt, newly relocated to Berlin, became the press organ of the Reichsvertretung. After the November Pogrom in 1938 the Reichsvertretung had to rename into Reichsverband der Juden in Deutschland (), now adopting also many administrative tasks, which especially many of the smaller and impoverished Jewish congregations, reduced in their personnel by the arrests and emigrations, could not maintain any more. In February 1939, this organisation assumed the name Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland (). This is to be distinguished from the new Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, which emerged in July 1939, when the Reichssicherheitshauptamt subjected the old Reichsvereinigung, representing Jewish interests at a Reich's level, into a subordinate branch - using the same name and more or less the same personnel - of the state administration. This was then in charge of announcing the ever-growing number of anti-Semitic discriminations to its members, and supervising their obedience. In June 1943, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt forcibly dissolved the new Reichsvereinigung. References * S. Adler-Rudel: J√ºdische Selbsthilfe unter dem Naziregime 1933-1939.

After gaining his Ticket of leave he worked as a chemist and later as an illicit abortionist. Nothing is known of William Chopin's early life, but in 1865 he was a widower with one child, and was working as a clerk. On 4 December 1865 both he and his brother Alfred were convicted in the Manchester courts and sentenced to be transported. William Chopin was convicted of uttering forged notes, and received a sentence of twenty years. His brother was convicted of receiving stolen goods, and was sentenced to ten years. The two brothers were transported to Western Australia on board the Norwood, which arrived at Fremantle in July 1867. For his first seven years in Western Australia, Chopin worked in the prison hospitals at Fremantle and later Albany, dispensing medicine. According to Stevenson (1983), these seven years would have been equivalent to an apprenticeship in pharmacy. Chopin received his ticket of leave on 7 December 1874, and the following month was appointed a dispenser of medicine at the Colonial Hospital. In March he was given a pay rise and extra clerical duties, but by the end of the year he had resigned the position. For a short time he worked in his brother's shop, but by 1876 he was advertising himself as a chemist in St Georges Terrace, Perth. In 1878, Chopin was appointed government school-teacher at Mourambine near Beverley. School teaching was one of the few reputable occupations that were open to convicts in Western Australia, as the low pay and poor conditions were not attractive to the very small number of well-educated settlers in the colony. In accepting the appointment, Chopin became one of only 39 ex-convict school teachers in Western Australia. He remained in the position until 1883. In 1884, Chopin started a business as a chemist at York. His business was reasonably successful, and he became a respectable member of the York community. He received his conditional pardon in April 1886, and the following month was elected treasurer of the York Mechanics' Institute. In July, however, he was arrested for \\"being in Avon Terrace when supposed to be of unsound mind without proper care and control\\". The charges were later dismissed. From 1887, Chopin's chemist business gradually declined due to increasing competition with general stores and other chemists. He offset this, however, by becoming an illicit abortionist. Between 1892 and 1894 he was arrested three times on charges of attempting to procure abortions. In the first two cases he was acquitted, but in the third case he was found guilty. Sentenced to ten years of penal servitude, he was employed as an orderly at the Invalid Depot. He received a ticket of leave in 1898, and died in Fremantle Prison Hospital on 30 October 1900.

He has hosted jazz shows on the Columbia University WKCR since 1970; he currently hosts two, Bird Flight and Traditions In Swing, both since 1981. He has won several Grammy Awards. Early years Schaap was raised by jazz-loving parents. His father was Walter Schaap, one of the first jazz historians and discographers. Through his father, Schaap was friendly with many jazz musicians from a young age, particularly the members of the original Count Basie Orchestra. Count Basie's drummer, Jo Jones, became his occasional babysitter when Schaap was six years old. Phil Schaap is a cousin of sports journalist Dick Schaap. Early in his career he managed the Basie alumni band, The Countsmen (featuring alto saxophonist Earle Warren and trombonist Dicky Wells) and doing sound for various Jazz events including George Wein's Newport Jazz Festival. For 17 years Schaap ran the Jazz at The West End jazz room on Broadway at 114th St in New York City, booking on a nightly basis such prominent swing-band alumni as Russell Procope's Ellingtonia, The Countsmen, Franc Williams, George Kelly, Eddie Barefield, Sonny Greer, Benny Waters, \\"Papa\\" Jo Jones, Buddy Tate, Vic Dickenson, Harold Ashby, Big Nick Nicholas, Ronnie Cole, Eddie Durham and \\"Doc\\" Cheatham, more modern jazz artists such as Lee Konitz and Joe Albany, and blues artists such as Percy France and Big Joe Turner. Disc jockey Schaap attended Columbia University. On February 2, 1970, his freshman year, he began broadcasting jazz on the Columbia University radio station, WKCR-FM, and he has been a radio broadcaster ever since. Schaap currently hosts two shows on WKCR, both of which began in 1981: the morning show Bird Flight, which is broadcast from 8:20 to 9:30 AM on weekdays and is devoted to the music of Charlie Parker, and Traditions In Swing, which is broadcast on Saturday evenings from 6 to 9 PM. Schaap, on his Bird Flight radio program, is noted for his long and detailed discussions (in his \\"pontifical baritone\\") of Charlie Parker minutiae. Schaap is also known for his marathon festivals on one artist, birthday broadcasts, and memorials. Jazz archivist and record producer From 1984 to 1991, Schaap was the archivist for the Savoy Jazz label. Schaap has been involved with the re-release of many archival recordings on CD, releases of artists including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Machito and the Afro-Cubans and Duke Ellington. For his efforts in engineering, production, and liner notes, Schaap has been nominated for eleven Grammy awards and has won seven, including three for producing, three for historical writing, and one for audio engineering. Educator As an educator Schaap has taught jazz at the graduate level at Columbia University and Rutgers University. Schaap continues his academic teaching career at Princeton University and The Juilliard School, while running an adult jazz education program for Jazz at Lincoln Center. Upon becoming Curator at Jazz at Lincoln Center he left a successful career producing, remastering, and writing for record companies such as Universal, Sony, and PolyGram. Writing In addition to his liner notes, Schaap contributed to the 2005 book by Wynton Marsalis, Jazz ABZ: An A to Z Collection of Jazz Portraits.

It was built by architect Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas as the main access gate for the 1888 Barcelona World Fair. The arch crosses over the wide central promenade of the Passeig de Llu√≠s Companys, leading to the Ciutadella Park that now occupies the site of the world fair. It is located at the northern end of the promenade, facing the Passeig de Sant Joan. Design The arch is built in reddish brickwork in the Neo-Mud√©jar style. The front frieze contains the stone sculpture Barcelona rep les nacions (Catalan for \\"Barcelona welcomes the nations\\") by Josep Reyn√©s. The opposite frieze contains a stone carving entitled Recompensa (\\"Recompense\\"), a work from Josep Llimona's earliest period, representing the granting of awards to the participants in the World Exposition. The friezes along the sides of the arch include allegories of agriculture and industry by Antoni Vilanova and of trade and art by Torquat Tass√≥. The two pillars of the arch feature bats carved in stone, which were the emblem of King Jaume I, who ruled over a period of prosperity in Barcelona. Other triumphal arches Similar structures can be found in many other cities, most notably including the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the Wellington Arch in London, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch in New York City, and the Arcul de Triumf in Bucharest, plus many from the Roman era. This arch, however, is non-military. It does not celebrate the country's military victories, but rather was built as the gateway to the 1888 World Fair and was thus intended to welcome people.

The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Pandanales. Relationships and evolution By contrast to other members of Pandanales the family demonstrates stricter flower morphology. Despite that, the flower structure is still quite variable and with a lot of specifics. Thus morphological analyses are not able to uncover realistic phylogenetical relationships neither appropriate taxonomy. Embryological development places the family among the amaryllids while the composition of the ovary puts it near the distinct Hypoxidaceae. However, a study regarding the pollen structure in two genera from Velloziaceae was found to be an important character and suggests some correlation but this is still a variable trait. Molecular analyseshttp://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/108/1/87.abstract recognize five distinct genera (by including Talbotia in Xerophyta and Nanuza in Vellozia thus forming two sister groups) and show that the monotypic genus Acanthochlamys is sister to the rest of the members. The family originated in Gondwana. The crown group is dated to be very young - 14 Mya (Mid Neogene) but the stem group was found to be much older - 108 Mya (Mid Cretaceous).http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/botanik/phanerogamen1/janssen_janssenbremer_2004_monocotages.pdf Velloziaceae has a total of 306 known species. Distribution and ecology Members of Velloziaceae are distributed both in the Old and the New world. Genera as Vellozia, Nanuza and Barbacenia are found in South America (Brazil, Cerrado). Xerophyta and Talbotia are growing across Africa. Plants from the family are also found in Madagascar and the southern part of the Arabian peninsula. One distinct species (Acanthochlamys bracteata) is restricted to China as the only member found in Asia. Velloziaceae includes different xerophytes inhabiting open and dry habitats.https://www3.hhu.de/biodidaktik/Exkursionen/Brasil_doku/downloads/vellozia.pdf These plants exhibit various adaptations against desiccation as for example less-densely distributed stomata, decreased surface area by the use of developed furrows (as in many cacti) and expansive leaf sheets that cover the stem or the aerial roots until they grow long enough to reach the ground level. In some members these sheaths are able to create a microclimate that sustains the roots by keeping a constant level of moisture. Flowers In the majority of Velloziaceae flowers are single or sometimes collected in bracts. There is no definite flowering period. Theyshttp://delta- intkey.com/angio/www/vellozia.htm are hypanthium-forming, sometimes papillate at their base or smooth, mostly white, creme or colored in different shades of purple although species with yellow, orange or red flowers also exist. Despite stricter, their structure is quite variable in some aspects (the number and structure of stamens varies at very high rate) as in other members of Pandanales. Tepals are six. The ovary is divided into three chambers with many ovules developed in them. Pistil and Stigma are also divided into three parts. Pollen and pollination Examination with scanning electron microscope uncovers that one of the distinctive characteristics of the family is the structurehttp://biostor.org/reference/73980 of the pollen. Its shape and composition are distinctive. For example, in Barbacenia pollen grains are singular and represent simple monads with ellipsoidal shape and one aperture. In Vellozia the grains are tetragonal (organized in tetrads) and non- apperturate. The size of pollen in Barbacenia is around half the size of that of Vellozia. However, the structure of the exine (pollen's envelopment) is a trait shared by the members of Velloziaceae. It is composed of many reticulations which in many cases may be described as vermiform. In some species, such as Vellozia abietina, the pollen wall does not fit this description, lacking any surface reticulations. Vellozia with a visiting pollinator Both cross and self pollination are observed inside the family, and the process is accomplished in various manners. Pollinators of Vellozia include the common honeybee (Apis melifera) and different species of solitary bees as Megachile curvipes, Psaenythia sp. and Augochlora metallica. The reward is pollen which is much more abundant than nectar. Nectar in the genus contains very low concentration of sugars. Bees use the three lobed stigma as a landing platform, and visually orient towards it. When the tepals are removed, bees will visit the flowers, but when the stigma is removed, no pollinators are recorded. It was found that hummingbirds visit these plants despite the diluted composition of nectar. Barbacenia differs in that its nectar is more abundant than its pollen. The pollen is probably taken by carpenter ants but whether ants are successful pollinators is not known. Pollen grains in Barbacenia are smaller, and these insects may be able to carry them and leave some on the stigma while they are searching for nectar. Fruits and seeds Fruits and seeds of these plants appear in large variety of shapes and sizes which demonstrate adaptations enhancing dispersal. Such adaptations include the development of bristles or hooks (Talbotia elegans) that cover the seed capsule. This allows attachment to animals, making the seeds able to travel long distances. Another characteristic is that the capsule is sticky, which also helps it to attach.

During his thirty years at Life, Morse covered assignments including science, theater, fads and spot news. When first hired by Life and sent to photograph World War II, he was the youngest war correspondent. His pictures documented the war's Pacific and European theatres and the post-war reconstruction of Europe. Morse was the civilian photographer at the signing of the surrender by the Germans to General Dwight Eisenhower. He was the senior staff photographer at the time when Life ceased weekly publication.Gallery M, Ralph Morse, May 2006. Retrieved February 11, 2008.

Hunt proclaimed of Morse, \\"If Life could afford only one photographer, it would have to be Ralph Morse.\\"The Editors of Life, John Loengard, and Gordon Parks (2004). The Great LIFE Photographers, p. 382. Bulfinch Press, NY. .  Early life  Ralph Morse had humble roots. Born in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx area of New York City, he lived with his mother and sister in an apartment where the income was $25 a week. At fifteen, he starting working in a drug store delivering orders every afternoon, and at a soda fountain every evening until 11:00 pm, making soda and sandwiches for the public. At DeWitt Clinton High School, he joined the school newspaper and was a dedicated student of journalism. Aspiring to become a newsreel cameraman but lacking the requisite $1,000 to join the union, Morse instead entered the City College of New York for free and took every class offered in photography. Subsequently, Morse looked up photography in the business directory called the Manhattan Redbook. Starting with \\"A\\", he went door-to-door visiting all the listings until finally being hired at \\"P\\" by Paul Parker Studio. Paul Parker was a social photographer with such customers as the United Fund and the Red Cross, a type of photography of great interest to Morse. Paul Parker had a most fascinating capability of moving lights. Morse stayed with Parker for most of a year until hearing of a job of hanging lights for George Karger, a German banker turned photographer who was freelancing through Pix Publishing, an agency in New York that sold pictures around the world. Earning $6 a week, Morse worked with Karger for six months, at which time Morse realized that he had learned all that Karger had to offer. Then a job opened at Harper's Bazaar. Morse only stayed at Harper's for a day, as he could not understand taking pictures that meant nothing to anyone outside the fashion industry. As one who delivered photos to Pix on a daily basis, Morse was readily hired by Pix to work in their darkroom. The first weekend as a printer, Morse spent a day with friends at Jones Beach on Long Island. Not owning a camera, Morse borrowed a 35mm Contax from his friend Cornell Capa, who was also a printer in the Pix publishing lab, as well as the brother of Life photographer Robert Capa.Serrano Esparza, Jos√© Manuel. \\"John G. Morris: An Interview with the Most Influential and Experienced Photo Editor in History\\", elrectanguloenlamano, September 12, 2009. Retrieved December 11, 2009. At the beach, Morse happened upon a father throwing his baby into the air and catching him. Capturing the father and son on film, Morse immediately brought the pictures to Leon Daniel, the editor of Pix. Daniel proclaimed that Pix could sell the picture that very afternoon. Indeed, within an hour, Daniel had sold the photo to the Houston Chronicle and then sold it to about twenty other publications in the world over the following week. Morse continued working in the darkroom and continued taking pictures every weekend. Morse credits Leon Daniel as being the person who definitively encouraged him to become a professional photographer, as it was Daniel who urged Morse to just take pictures and let Pix sell them, noting that such an arrangement would be more lucrative both experientially and financially. Morse bought himself his first camera equipment and began buying The New York Times every day in order to select events to photograph, creating pictures which Daniel then sold instantly. Of the three owners of Pix, one was a silent partner, Alfred Eisenstaedt, a photographer who had left the Associated Press in Germany to join the new Life magazine staff in New York City. Eisenstaedt closely observed Morse's photographing while encouraging Wilson Hicks, the picture editor of Life, to meet the young upstart at Pix. After weeks of Eisenstaedt's nagging, Hicks relented and asked to meet Morse.Chandler, Mary Voelz. \\"Gallery M: Fine Art, Gallery, Sculpture\\", December 13, 2002. Retrieved on December 5, 2009. At their initial encounter, Hicks gave Morse his first assignment. Not at all sure how he would actually meet the demands of the most important picture editor in the United States, Morse covered up his fear with gratitude. Between his own and Capa's equipment, Morse was able to cover the author Thornton Wilder's acting on Broadway in his own show Our Town. The success of this assignment earned him a second‚Äîcapturing on film women buying hats for their husbands in the basement of Gimbels department store‚Äîwhich turned out to be Morse's first photo story published by Life. As a result, Hicks offered Morse a contract to work for Life one day a week through Pix, which amounted to about ten days a month of working for Life until the start of World War II.  War correspondent  At 24, Morse was the youngest war correspondent when Life hired him full-time in 1942 and sent him to the Pacific Theatre of World War II. He immediately learned that not all of his photos would end up in print, as his first war assignment turned out to be a secret mission. War coverage was the ultimate on-the-job training, needing to learn on the spot such feats as descending rope ladders overloaded with both combat and photographic gear in order to accompany troops from ship to shore. Landing with the Marines on Guadalcanal, Morse's cameras recorded America's first amphibious attack in the Pacific. He arranged for the captain of the , the Navy ship on which Morse had arrived, to deliver his film to Washington, D.C., as such pictures needed to be screened before being printed. Unfortunately, the Vincennes was torpedoed that night in the Battle of Savo Island.Frank, Richard B. Guadalcanal, p. 306‚Äì307. Morse's film and equipment went down with the ship while he trod water all night amidst destroyers dropping depth charges on submarines, fortunately scaring away the sharks and barracuda. With neither cameras nor clothing, Morse made a secret pact with Naval command to return briefly to Life in New York to re- equip, but was mandated to tell no details of the sea battle, no explanation of how he lost his equipment. Unknown to him, he was being trailed by Naval intelligence to confirm that he had kept his word. Guadalcanal grew a jungle so thick that accompanying nocturnal troop movement was filled with the risk of abandonment if one ever lost sight of the soldier's foot he was following. During a daytime patrol, Morse came upon a burnt-out Japanese tank in a clearing with a skull and helmet on the fender. Life magazine and newspapers around the country ran Morse's photo; it proved to be the first horror picture released by the censors of World War II.\\"American mutilation of Japanese war dead\\". Retrieved on December 21, 2009. Morse left the Pacific with not just an accommodation for his photo coverage from the United States Secretary of the Navy, but also with a case of malaria. Upon being healed in a New York City hospital, he was reassigned to photograph General George Patton's Army's traversing France. He did a most comprehensive story of a wounded soldier by braving a request to the Surgeon General of the Army to certify him as wounded as well, so that he would become privy to all means of transportations, first aid stations, and hospitals as was his wounded man. Searching the battlefield between artillery shellings, he observed a corpsman as both arms were hit. Morse was witness to all the surgeries, fed him his meals, and, in time, poured penicillin into his wounds. The photos of this soldier in pain and his arms being placed in casts, considered a model of effective photojournalism, are the commonly used pictures of the wounded of World War II.\\"Whatever Happened to ‚ÄòGeorge Lott, Casualty'?

He was the civilian photojournalist present at the signing of the surrender by the Germans at Reims.  Eighth astronaut  A decade after photographing the post-war reconstruction of Europe, Morse received his next singular assignment: documenting American preparations to explore outer space. He spoke to the science and managing editors of Life, recommending that one reporter and one photographer go everywhere and do everything in which the astronauts were engaged. The editors chose Morse for the job, launching a thirty-year assignment and lifelong friendships between Morse and the astronauts and their families. After years of joining the astronauts as they trained‚Äîflying weightless, diving undersea, studying rocks, surviving deserts and jungles‚ÄîMorse was dubbed by Mercury astronaut John Glenn as the eighth astronaut.Life Magazine's Classic Photos, November 18, 2008. Retrieved December 21, 2009. Conventional photography was sufficient at the onset of Morse's coverage of the space program which began as an introduction to Life readers of the astronauts themselves and their families; however, as the program grew in complexity from Project Mercury to Gemini to Apollo, Morse needed to devise new ways to capture subject matter never before photographed. He illustrated subjects that no-one had ever seen. He did his homework, gathering the necessary knowledge to make the desired photograph. He invented his own techniques for images such as a rocket launch. He photographed double exposures, he shot with infrared cameras, he relied on motion detectors. Because he photographed with remote camera, the results were dramatic as the cameras were so close to the rockets. He positioned a six-foot man next to a thirty-seven-story missile to show its scale.  Sports historian  The equipment Morse used for showing the space program served him well on his other assignments, also. When he photographed the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1955 World Series, he brought a missile-tracking camera to the stadium. Forewarned that Jackie Robinson would try to steal home, Morse rigged the camera with a foot switch set to fire a hundred feet of film at ten frames a second. With his hand-held camera focused on the outfield, Morse triggered the foot button as soon as energy mounted between Robinson and the pitcher. When Robinson made the dash, Morse's camera was already running.Allen, Maury. \\"Jackie Robinson: An American Hero\\", 1999. Retrieved December 20, 2009.

In response to Morse's being assigned to produce a picture that would show in one image Hank Aaron's entire 715th home run, he and fellow Life photographer Henry Groskinsky planned a multiple exposure of the pitch along with Aaron's hitting the homer, touching each base, and being congratulated by his teammates in the dugout. To make this photograph, they used a 4 X 5 view camera with strips of black paper mounted on a glass in front of the lens. As Aaron approached each of the locations to be photographed, a section of the black covering was lifted from the glass, allowing an exposure to be made.Fimrite, Ron. \\"715: Hank Aaron's Glorious Ordeal\\", Sports Illustrated, April 5, 1999.

Technically similar, in covering the hundred yard dash in New York's Madison Square Garden, Morse wanted to put the start, middle, and finish of the race in the same picture. He was able to place wiring under the track, but no place existed for situating the cameras. Morse had a hanging box built under the balcony in which he mounted his equipment. His assistant tripped the lights at the required intervals, and Morse made the photograph.  Medical recorder  Morse also documented breakthroughs in the field of medicine.

Morse located a patient's recently removed heart floating in a jar of formaldehyde, and photographed Man's seeing his own heart for the first time. His previous experience with Dr. DeBakey occurred when the need for transplants outnumbered available cadaver hearts. When DeBakey was about to put a man-made left ventricle into a dying man's chest cavity for the first time, Morse requested to be present on the floor. DeBakey explained that the American Medical Association would not allow an outsider's presence in the operating room. The photograph was made when DeBakey hired Morse as a temporary hospital staff member for a dollar. In the deal, DeBakey gained ownership of the pictures, and Life had the right to publish them.  Family life  Morse and the late Ruth Zizmor Morse lived in Paris after World War II while he photographed the post-war reconstruction of Europe. Later, they settled in northern New Jersey, where they raised their three sons, Alan, Bob, and Don, as Morse's work was based out of the Time-Life Building in New York City. When schedules permitted, the family joined Morse on his photographic assignments, including journeys to Cape Canaveral, Florida to watch missiles being launched. Morse retired to south Florida where he enjoyed sailing and boating, spending time with his companion Barbara Ohlstein, his six grandchildren, and his four great-grandchildren.

He calls himself \\"kendhang tunggal\\", which means \\"solo drummer\\". His music is based on his handheld drum complemented by his vocal.  Biography  Sujud was born in 1953 into a family of artists. His father, Wirosuwito, was a cokekan (dance show) artist, and an expert in Karawitan from Klaten. Due to financial difficulties, Wirosuwito was forced to become street musician/busker, specialising in uyon- uyon (Javanese traditional songs and chants). Sujud learned Karawitan from Wirosuwito. Sujud realised that his favorite instrument was the kendang (drum), so he decided to specialise in drumming. Sujud became a street singer to pay his way through school. Though he did not complete junior high school, he was eager to learn. He has been making money singing and playing percussion since the 1960s. Sujud does not consider himself a street singer. Rather, he refers to himself as 'a door-to-door tax collector'. This is because, usually, he would go from one house to another, singing, hoping for the kindness of the residents. His great talent proves to be an enjoyable form of entertainment rather than annoyance, and hence the residents always respond positively to his music. When he goes busking from door to door, children from the neighbourhood would follow him everywhere he goes, and watch him. He is highly respected by other street musicians and artists. He said that the main difficulty in his musical career is the tropical rain, which prevents him to do his door-to-door work, as it is difficult to play the drum and hold an umbrella at the same time. Like a true Javanese, Sujud believes in the Javanese philosophy trimo ing pandum or accepting one's destiny. His fate, his says, is in God's hands. At the end of a performance, he never expects to be paid, but accepts what people want to give. Sujud took the name Sutrisno only in adulthood, as is the Javanese custom. Today, he lives alone in a rented house somewhere in Notoyudan, Yogyakarta. Since the death of his wife Swakidah, he has done all the housework himself but buys his meals from food stalls. He keeps to a \\"tight\\" schedule: singing 20 days a month and taking it easy the rest of the time.  Music characteristics  As a soloist, drumming is not all about money for him, but also a spiritual endeavor. His concept is to make his music as stress reliever. Sujud differs from other street singers in that he rearranges pop songs, mostly from the 1970s. He likes to make people laugh and often parodies popular songs. His unique and rich music is simply based on a combination of his vocal and hand drumming. His performance is characterised by a continuous medley of pop song parody in Javanese and Indonesian language. Although the medley is played as a continuum, a syncopated drum motif is always played to mark a beginning of a new song. His performance is always totally improvised, and he never sings the same song twice. The improvised lyrics of his songs come out spontaneously, consisting of parodies, jokes, satire, social criticism, and sometimes vulgarity. He said that he expresses the lamentation of the commoners. His voice has the characteristics of Javanese vocal technique. His drums beat in syncopated four-beat rhythms.

The family consists of four genera with ca 37 known species distributed in areas with seasonal climate across Southeast Asia and tropical Australia. One native species is found in the United States. In earlier systems the family was called Roxburghiaceae, after Roxburghia, now Stemona.  Description  The stems are sometimes erect or trailing with green or yellow-green color or in some cases with reddish appearance. Leaves are dark green and also alternate in the majority of the members. Flowers are born in short cymes produced from the lower parts of the plant. Seeds are ellipsoidal or globular. As in other members of the Pandanales, the flower morphology in the Stemonaceae is distinctively developed and rather atypical for other monocots.https://independent.academia.edu/RichardBateman/Papers/1141756/Morphological_phylogenetic_analysis_of_Pandanales_testing_contrasting_hypotheses_of_floral_evolution In the majority of the species, flowers are tetramerous (composed of four identical parts) or sometimes dimerous.http://delta- intkey.com/angio/www/stemonac.htm Stamens are distinguishable and four in number. In most of the members, tepals are four. They are smooth or sometimes papillate which is probably because they function as odour-producing components (osmophores). However, in Pentastemona, the flowers are pentamerous and the number of stamens is five. Microsporogenesis is successive. Reproductive structures are colored in shades of purple, maroon, green, or yellow. They imitate carrion and sometimes release such smell - flies visiting the flowers function as pollinators.  Taxonomy  The Stemonaceae, also referred to as the Roxburghiaceae, were once placed in a separate order, the Stemonales, or the Dioscoreales, sister order to the Pandanales. Also Croomia had been treated within its own family, Croomiaceae. The family Stemonaceae is sister to other two families in the Pandanales that together form a clade - these are Cyclanthaceae and Pandanaceae. Pentastemona diverged first from the family, so is a sister clade to the rest of it. Actually, the genus demonstrates characteristics rather more different from other members of the Stemonaceae.https://independent.academia.edu/RichardBateman/Papers/1141756/Morphological_phylogenetic_analysis_of_Pandanales_testing_contrasting_hypotheses_of_floral_evolution In earlier classifications, it was placed in its own family. However, Stemona is sister to the other two genera that together form a clade. The family appears in Late Cretaceous - around 84 Mya, although the stem group diverged earlier in the same period - 108 Mya.http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/botanik/phanerogamen1/janssen_janssenbremer_2004_monocotages.pdf  Ecology  The Stemonaceae contain various herbeceous plants, many of which are crawling or climbing species preferring moist or dry tropical habitats. They form underground organs as spindle-shaped rhizomes used for reservation of nutrients.  Uses  The family contains plants with various therapeutical and other uses in places such as China, Laos, Japan, Thailand, and others. Some members are used for making an insecticide. In Laos, people use them against fleas and lice by making an infusion which they drink to make their blood poisonous. Plants from the family are used for the preparation of a fish poison.

Some common terms are dustbin, garbage can, and trash can. The words \\"rubbish\\", \\"basket\\" and \\"bin\\" are more common in British English usage; \\"trash\\" and \\"can\\" are more common in American English usage. \\"Garbage\\" may refer to food waste specifically (when distinguished from \\"trash\\") or to municipal solid waste in general. In 1875, the first household rubbish bins were introduced in Britain to create a regulated system of collection.  Public waste collection  In many cities and towns, there is a public waste collection service which regularly collects household waste from outside buildings etc. This will be loaded into a garbage truck and driven to a landfill, incinerator or crush facility to be disposed of. Household waste containers are usually either: * trash cans, receptacles made of metal or plastic * wheelie bins, light, mobile plastic bins In some areas, each household has multiple bins for different categories of rubbish (usually represented by colours) depending on its suitability for recycling, which will instead be routed to a recycling center.\\"Rubbish and recycling\\" , ccc.govt.nz Commercial roadside waste containers are often larger dumpsters or skips.  Public litter bins  National Theater in Taipei, Taiwan Art on waste containers Waste container in Tarifa, Spain Public areas, such as parks, often have litter bins placed to improve the social environment by encouraging people not to litter. Such bins in outdoor locations or other busy public areas are usually mounted to the ground or wall to discourage theft, and reduce vandalism, and to improve their appearance are sometimes deliberately artistic or cute. In dense urban areas, trash is stored underground below the receptacle. Many are lined with a plastic or paper bin bag to help contain liquids.  Designs  A pedal bin of 1972 A pedal bin is a container with a lid operated by a foot pedal. Lillian Moller Gilbreth (an industrial engineer and efficiency expert as well as mother of twelve) invented the pedal bin in the 1920s for the disposal of kitchen waste. The foot pedal enables the user to open the lid without touching it with their hands. In the 2010s, some bins have begun to include automated mechanisms such as a lid with infrared detection on the top of the can powered by batteries to open it rather than a foot pedal, freeing the user from touching the bin in any way. Some bin models also include a small receptable for an air freshener.  Metaphors  International symbol \\"Tidyman\\" used on packaging to remind people to dispose of it in a bin instead of littering The term \\"garbage can\\" is also used for a model of decision making, the \\"Garbage Can Model\\" of decision making. It is concerned with cases of decision making in great aggregate uncertainty which can cause decisions to arise that from a distant point of view might seem irrational. A \\"trash can\\" metaphor is often used in computer operating system desktop environments as a place files can be moved for deletion. In a workplace setting, a bin may be euphemistically called \\"the circular file\\", \\"the round file\\" or \\"the janitor's file\\". Whereas useful documents are filed in a filing cabinet, which is rectangular, junk mail and other worthless items are \\"filed\\" in the bin, which is often round. The term \\"waste basket\\" is occasionally used in taxonomy to refer to groupings that are based on some non-genetic criterion (e.g., the proposed order Insectivora is considered a \\"wastebasket taxon\\", as it groups small mammals whose chief link is that they eat insects), and the Nilo-Saharan language family is sometimes called \\"Greenberg's wastebasket\\", as it was a grouping made by him to fit the languages of Africa that did not fall into the other groups, Afroasiatic, Niger‚ÄìCongo, and Khoisan.

They are used in materials science and geology for the synthesis and study the different phases of materials under extreme pressure, as well as for the industrial production of valuable minerals, especially synthetic diamonds, as they mimic the pressures and temperatures that exist deep in the Earth. These instruments allow the simultaneous compression and heating of millimeter size solid phase samples such as rocks, minerals, ceramics, glasses, composite materials, or metals and are capable of reaching pressures above 25 GPa and temperatures exceeding 2,500 ¬∞C. This allows mineral physicists and petrologists studying the Earth's interior to experimentally reproduce the conditions found throughout the lithosphere and upper mantle, a region that spans the near surface to a depth of 700 km. In addition to pressing on the sample, the experiment passes an electric current through a furnace within the assembly to generate temperatures up to 2,200 ¬∞C.Studying the Earth's Formation: The Multi-Anvil Press at Work // LLNL Although Diamond anvil cells and light-gas guns can access even higher pressures, the multi-anvil apparatus can accommodate much larger samples, which simplifies sample preparation and improves the precision of measurements and the stability of the experimental parameters. The multi-anvil press is a relatively rare research tool. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's two presses have been used for a variety of material property studies, including diffusion and deformation of ceramics and metals, deep-focus earthquake, and the high-pressure stability of mineral phases. History The 6-8 multi-anvil apparatus was introduced by Kawai and Endo using a split steel sphere suspended in pressurized oil, later modified to use the hydraulic ram. In 1990, Walker et al. simplified the first compression stage by introducing the removable hatbox design, allowing ordinary machine presses to be converted into multi-anvil systems. A variety of assembly designs have been introduced and standardized including the Walker castable, and the COMPRES assemblies. Recent advances have focused on in-situ measurements, and standardizing materials and calibrations. Basic design A typical Kawai cell 8‚Äì6 multi-anvil apparatus uses air pumps to pressurize oil, which drives a vertical hydraulic ram to compress a cylindrical cavity known as a hatbox. This cavity is filled with six steel anvils, three facing up and three facing down, that converge on a set of eight tungsten carbide cubes. The interior corners of these cubes truncated to fit an octahedral assembly. These octahedra range from 8 mm to 25 mm on edge and are typically composed of MgO or another material that deforms ductilely over the range of experimental conditions, to make sure the experiment is under hydrostatic stress. As this assembly is compressed, it extrudes out between the cubes, forming a gasket. A cylinder is drilled out between two opposite faces to accommodate the experiment. Experiments that require heating are surrounded by a cylindrical graphite or LaCrO3 cylinder furnace, which can produce considerable heat by electrical resistance. However, the graphite furnace can be troublesome at higher pressures due to its tendency to transform into diamond. The DIA multi- anvil is the main alternative to the Kawai cell: it uses six anvils to compress a cubic sample. Theory In principle, the multi-anvil press is similar in design to a machine press except that it uses force magnification to amplify pressure by reducing the area over which force is applied: :P=\\\\frac{F}{A} This is analogous to the mechanical advantage utilized by a lever, except the force is applied linearly, instead of angularly. For example, a typical multi-anvil could apply 9,806,650 N (equivalent to a load of 1000 t) onto a 10 mm octahedral assembly, which has a surface area of 346.41 mm2, to produce a pressure of 28.31 GPa inside the sample, while the pressure in the hydraulic ram is a mere 0.3 GPa. Therefore, using smaller assemblies can increase the pressure in the sample. The load that can be applied is limited by the compressive yield strength of the tungsten carbide cubes, especially for heated experiments. Even higher pressures, up to 90 GPa, have been achieved by using 14 mm sintered diamond cubes instead of tungsten carbide. Measurements in the Multi-Anvil Most sample analysis is conducted after the experiment is quenched and removed from the multi-anvil. However, it is also possible to perform measurements in-situ. Circuits, including thermocouples or pressure variable resistors, can be built into the assembly to accurately measure temperature and pressure. Acoustic interferometry can be used to measure seismic velocities through a material or to infer density of materials. Resistivity can be measured by complex impedance spectroscopy. Magnetic properties can be measured using amplified nuclear magnetic resonance in specially configured multi-anvils. The DIA multi-anvil design often includes diamond or sapphire windows built into the tungsten anvils to allow x-rays or neutrons to penetrate into the sample. This type of device gives researchers at synchrotron and neutron spallation sources the capacity to perform diffraction experiments to measure the structure of samples under extreme conditions. This is essential for observing unquenchable phases of matter because they are kinetically and thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures and pressure. Viscosity and density of high-pressure melts can be measured in-situ using the sink float method and neutron tomography. In this method a sample is implanted with objects, such platinum spheres, that have different density and neutron scattering properties compared to the material surrounding them, and the path of the object is tracked as it sinks, or floats, through the melt. Two objects with contrasting buoyancy can be used simultaneously to calculate the density. Applications Pressure, like temperature, is a basic thermodynamic parameter that influences the molecular structure, and thus the electrical, magnetic, thermal, optical and mechanical properties of materials. Devices like the multi-anvil apparatus allow us to observe the effect of high pressure on material structure and properties. Multi-anvil presses are occasionally used in industry to produce minerals of exceptional purity, size and quality, especially high-pressure high- temperature (HPHT) synthetic diamonds and c-Boron-Nitride. However, multi- anvils are high cost devices, and are very adaptable, so they are more often used as scientific instruments. Multi-anvils have three main scientific uses: 1) to synthesize novel high-pressure material; 2) to change the phases of a material; 3) to examine the properties of materials at high pressures. In materials science this includes the synthesis of novel or useful materials with potential mechanical or electronic applications, such as high-pressure super conductors or ultra-hard substances. Geologists are primarily concerned with reproducing the conditions and materials found in the deep earth, to study geological processes that cannot be directly observed. Minerals or rocks are synthesized to find what conditions are responsible for different mineral phases and textures citation needed). Geoscientists also use multi-anvils to measure the kinetics of reactions, density, viscosity, compressibility, diffusivity and thermal conductivity of rock under extreme conditions.

Nadackal Kavu Churches St. George Forane Church, popularly known as Aruvithura palli, is a syro- malabar Catholic Church in Erattupetta. This Church is believed to be the oldest Church in eastern Kerala, and is considered to be the mother church of the ancient Syrian Christian community of both the Meenachil and the Kanjirapally Taluks. The church is believed to be founded in A.D 52 by Saint Thomas and later it was named martha mariyam church. It is commonly believed that in the 13th century, a group of Christians, who had to flee from Nilackal to save themselves from the hands of enemies, brought the statue of St. George from Nilackal and placed it in Aruvithura Church for veneration. From that time onwards, Aruvithura Church came to be known on behalf of St George. There is also a popular belief that the St. George's Church was established by Saint Thomas the apostle himself. The annual festival of St George of Aruvithura is celebrated during April 15 ‚Äì May 1 every year.'' Aruvithura Church is one of the two oldest churches in Pala Diocese. Traditionally it is believed that the Catholic Church at Aruvithura was established in AD 151. It is assumed that a group of Christians who were baptised by St. Thomas lived here. All the major churches in Pala Diocese have their cultural and spiritual inheritance from Aruvithura Church. Pala, Bharananganam, Plassanal, Poonjar, Thidanad , Kanjirapally etc came under Aruvithura Church. Going through history it is clear that the oldest churches were in the name of Martha Mariam. Aruvithura Church also was in the name of Martha Mariam until the 13th century. The statue of St Mary placed at the centre of the main altar is a clear proof of this fact. During the 13th century, a group of Christians , who had to elope from Nilackal to save themselves from the hands of enemies, brought the statue of St George from Nilackal and placed it in Aruvithura Church for veneration. From that time onwards Aruvithura Church came to be known on behalf of St George. People in and around Aruvithura were blessed with a lot of blessings from God as they sought the help from St George. Slowly St George at Aruvithura came to be known as \\"Aruvithura Valliachen\\". The statue that was brought from Nilackal is still preserved in the Aruvithura Church. No repainting ormodifications were made on the statue until now. That is the statue is maintained as such painted in the 13th century. During the festival season the statue is brought forward from the altar and placed for public veneration. A rare custom that is followed in this church alone is that the statue is brought forward from the altar and replaced on the altar by Rev. Fathers alone. The present church is the fourth church built in this location. Details about the first church is unavailable. The second church was built in the form of a temple. The third church was built in Portuguese model. The altar of the third Church is still preserved in the present church. The present church was built in 1951. It is 170 feet long and 50 feet broad. An aerial view of the church has the shape a Cross. The \\" Manimalika' in front of the church is 120 feet high. the statue of Christ at the top of the Church is 15 Feet high. St George of Aruvithura is the patron saint of the people of Aruvithura and all those who seek assistance from St George. A lot of miracles take place here and the Festival of St George of Aruvithura (Aruvithura vallyachan ) celebrated during April 15 ‚Äì May 1 is a symbol of thanks giving for all the blessings received through St George. St George pray for us is a prayer of all wounded and bereaved souls who come for consolation from the hand of Aruvithura Vallyachan.

Dodds on the phenolics of Solanum species, extending his knowledge of anthocyanins. This work grew to encompass a wide range of mostly garden plants. In addition to discovering novel anthocyanidins, he made in- depth studies of their glycosylation and began work on their acylation. During this time he forged links with E. C. Bate-Smith and Tony Swain at Cambridge, Swain arranging for him to edit his first book, The biochemistry of phenolic compounds. His time at the John Innes ended when the Potato Genetics group was wound up, and the institution itself moved to Norwich. Between 1965 and 1968 Harborne worked as a research assistant at the University of Liverpool. After this, he worked with Vernon Heywood at the University of Reading. Harborne was associate professor and research assistant in the Department of Botany. In 1976 he became professor. Between 1987 and 1993 he was head of the Department of Botany. In 1993 he retired. He had in his tenure at the University of Reading also positions as visiting professor at the University Federal do Rio de Janeiro (1973), the University of Texas at Austin (1976), the University of California at Santa Barbara (1977) and the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign (1981). Harborne investigated the role of flavonoids in interactions between plants and insects. He also investigated the relationship between anthocyanins and the ecology of pollination. He also studied the role of phytoalexins in members of the bean family (Fabaceae), the rose family (Rosaceae) and the carrot family (Apiaceae). He published on chemotaxonomy as in his research articles on the genetic control of expression of anthocyanins, flavones and aurones in the primrose family (Primulaceae) in snapdragons (Antirrhinum) and a number of other plants. He also published on isoflavones and chemical ecology. In his book, Phytochemicals Methods: A Guide to Modern Techniques of Plant Analysis Prof. Harborne described a number of analytical methods in plant chemistry that he developed for the system of distribution of anthocyanins in major plant groups. In Comparative Biochemistry of the Flavonoids he described the biochemistry of flavonoids in various plant groups. In the scientific journal Natural Product Reports he wrote a series of review articles about the discovery of anthocyanins and other flavonoids. In his book Introduction to Ecological Biochemistry he described the ecological role of natural substances. The publication of this book is seen as the starting point of the study of environmental chemistry. Developments in the chemical ecology he described in a series of review articles in Natural Product Reports. He was (co) author of about 270 research and review articles. He was also author or editor of some forty books. From 1972 Prof. Harborne was the Executive Editor of the journal Phytochemistry. Between 1986 and 1999 he was chief editor of this prestigious journal. He was the founder of the magazine Analysis Phytochemicals and he was editor of Methods in Plant Biochemistry. Harborne had a number of awards during his lifetime. In 1985 he received the Linnean Society of London, the Linnean Medal for his services to botany. He also received medals from the Phytochemical Society of Europe (PSE Medal) (1986) and the International Society of Chemical Ecology (1993). In 1993 he was awarded the Pergamon Phytochemistry Prize. In 1995 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2010 the University of Reading's Plant Science Laboratories, where he was Professor, were named the Harborne Building in his honour.

It is approximately 5,000 times more soluble than tetracycline base and is unique amongst tetracyclines in that it is absorbed by an active transport process across the intestinal wall, making use of the same fast and efficient mechanism by which carbohydrates are absorbed.New Zealand Datasheet August 2003 The greater absorption of lymecycline allows for lower dosages to be used; the standard dose of 408 mg is equivalent to 300 mg tetracycline base and, in its action, to 500 mg tetracycline hydrochloride. Lymecycline, unlike tetracycline hydrochloride, is soluble at all physiological pH values. History Lymecycline was released into the pharmaceutical market in 1963. Indications Lymecycline, like other tetracyclines, is used to treat a range of infections. Its better absorption profile makes it preferable to tetracycline for moderately severe acne and typically prescribed for 8 weeks at a time, but alternatives should be sought if no improvement occurs by 3 months.British National Formulary 45 March 2003 Lymecycline capsules  Side effects  Lymecycline's side effects can include rash, headache, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, dermatitis, inflammation of the liver, hypersensitive reactions, and visual disturbances.

She was the daughter of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden and Frederica of Baden.  Biography  After birth, she was raised under the supervision of the royal governess Charlotte Stierneld. The youngest of four children, Cecilia left Sweden in 1810 with her family after her father was deposed as king of Sweden by the Coup of 1809. She was raised in her mother's home country, the Grand Duchy of Baden (Germany). After her parents were divorced in 1812, she was raised mainly by her grandmother Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt in Bruchsal. She met Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg in 1830, and after an hour's conversation, the marriage was decided. She went to her brother in Vienna, where her wedding took place in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Francis I. She relocated to the city of Oldenburg in June 1831. Cecilia had an interest in culture. As Grand Duchess of Oldenburg she composed the melody of a hymn for Oldenburg. The hymn was later added with lyrics by Theodor von Kobbe and named ‚ÄòHeil dir, o Oldenburg‚Äô. In 1833, Cecila supported the founding of the city's first theatre, which today is the Oldenburgisches Staatstheater. She was, however, never known to be close to the population in Oldenburg, where she lived a life confined to the circles of the court. A bridge, a square and a road are named after her, as well as a school. In honour of the late Cecilia, the locality C√§ciliengroden at the Jade Bight near Wilhelmshaven (later incorporated into Sande in Frisia) was named after her. Cecilia died at the age of 36 from puerperal fever, a few days after giving birth to her third child Elimar. She was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in the Churchyard of St. Gertrude (St. Gertrudenkirchhof / Gertrudenfriedhof) in the city of Oldenburg. Her sister, Amalia Maria Charlotta, was buried there, too. Cecilia as Grand Duchess of Oldenburg. Marriage She married Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg (1783‚Äì1853) on 5 May 1831 in Vienna. Both being members of the House of Holstein-Gottorp and descendants of Christian August of Holstein-Gottorp, Prince of Eutin, they were distant cousins. It was Augustus' third marriage. They had three sons together: * Alexander Friedrich Gustav (16 June 1834 ‚Äì 6 June 1835) * Nikolaus Friedrich August (15 February 1836 ‚Äì 30 April 1837) * Anton G√ºnther Friedrich Elimar (23 January 1844 ‚Äì 17 October 1895) Titles and styles *22 June 1807 - 5 May 1831: Her Royal Highness Princess Cecilia of Sweden *5 May 1831 - 27 January 1844: Her Royal Highness The Grand Duchess of Oldenburg Ancestry References  * This article is partially based on its equivalent on Spanish Wikipedia * Gisela Niem√∂ller: Die Engelinnen im Schlo√ü.

He was born at Tiaret in modern day Algeria and flourished in the 9th century. While his grammatical works advanced little beyond his predecessors, he was the first in studying comparative philology in Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic. He recognized that the various Semitic languages are derived from one source and that although they are different in their development, they are subject to the same linguistic laws. Judah's grammatical researches were original, and he maintained his views regardless of the Mishnah and the Talmud so he has been erroneously considered a Karaite. Risalah His Risalah, a letter in Arabic but written in the Hebrew script,Introduction of Risalat Yehuda Ibn Quraysh - ŸÖŸÇÿØŸÖÿ© ÿ±ÿ≥ÿßŸÑÿ© ŸäŸáŸàÿ∞ÿß ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ¥ to the community at Fes (ed. Barg√®s and Goldberg, Paris, 1857), is the earliest known contribution to the critical study of the Semitic languages. The work is divided into three sections, with an introduction. He warns the community not to neglect the study of the Targumim since they are important for a correct knowledge of the Bible, which contains many Aramaisms. In the first section, he compares biblical words to similar Aramaic words. In the second section, he focuses on comparing biblical words to later Rabbinic Hebrew words. He makes the comparison for 17 words even if they do not have a direct comparison. The third section is structured differently from the other two in that he does not deal with individual words. Instead, he deals with the larger relationship between the three Semitic languages. He explores ideas such as the interchange of letters or pronunciation, the presence or loss of certain weaker letters in roots like the Nun, the changes of letters used in tenses, changes in gender in names and number and additional vowels or the lack thereof. An additional section is attached to the third section in which he examines the relationship between Arabic and Hebrew, specifically. In particular, he notes the exchanges of Aleph with Ayin, Ayin with Ghain, Zayin with Dalet, Tsade with Teth, Shin with Taw, etc. He is also said to have written, in addition to the Risalah, a dictionary, and a book on the Commandments. However, little is known about them. Although he mentions his dictionary in the Risalah, nothing remains of it or his other book.

Founded in London in 1786 by butcher Richard Wall,http://www.wallsproperfood.co.uk/about-us.aspx it was acquired in 1922 by Lever Brothers, which became a part of Unilever in 1930. Unilever sold off the meat products business and a licence to use the Wall's brand on such within the United Kingdom in 1994 to Kerry Group. History In 1786, Richard Wall opened a butcher's stall in St James's Market, London. Selling meat and meat products, he gained a reputation for being a fine pork butcher. In 1812, Wall received the first Royal Appointment to George, Prince of Wales as \\"Purveyor of Pork,\\" continuing to serve him through his later reign as King George IV. In 1817 his son, Thomas Wall, was born, followed in 1824 by a daughter, Eleanor. Wall's business boomed, and in 1834 he moved to new premises at 113 Jermyn Street. However, he died the same year, leaving his widow, Ann, and the 17-year-old Thomas to run the business, now trading as Ann Wall and Son. Two years later, in 1836, Ann also died, and Thomas Wall took sole charge of the business, as well as the care of his 14-year-old sister. However, the business continued to prosper. In 1846 his first son, Thomas Wall II, was born, followed shortly afterwards by a second son, Frederick. They joined the company board in 1870 and 1878 respectively, after which the business became known as Thomas Wall and Sons Ltd. Throughout this period, the business maintained its high-level standards and resultant recognition, receiving a series of Royal Appointments from Queen Victoria, King Edward VII and King George V. The business had always faced problems in the summer, when sales of meat, meat pies and sausages fell, and staff had to be laid off as a consequence. Thus, in 1913, Thomas Wall II proposed developing a line of ice cream to avoid these problems. This proposal, however, was put on hold due to shortages arising as a result of the outbreak of World War I, and was not implemented until 1922. Before that, Thomas Wall II decided to retire, and in 1920 sold the business to Mac Fisheries, which itself was acquired by Lever Brothers in 1922. In 1920 Thomas Wall II created his Trust for the ‚Äúencouragement and assistance of educational work and social service‚Äù. Today the Trust continues to assist in these areas by providing grants to individuals and organisations. Products After the purchase of sausage and pate producer Mattessons in 1965, Unilever ran both companies as part of Unilever Meat Group UK under the chairmanship of Werner Mattes, eventually merging the two companies to form Mattessons Wall's following his retirement in 1986. Following a review, in 1994 Unilever sold off Mattessons Wall's, the ownership to the Mattessons brand, and a licence to sell meat products within the UK under the Wall's brand to Kerry Foods.

Born in Pe√±afiel in Old Castile, Navarrete received the habit around 1630 and after completing his studies was offered the chair of Thomistic theology by several Spanish universities. He declined all the offers, preferring to go into the missionary field. In 1646, he and twenty-seven brethren left Spain for the Philippines via Mexico. They arrived at their destination on 23 June 1648. Navarrete taught theology at the Dominican University of St. Thomas, Manila, before he left with a group to go on a mission to China in 1657. After learning the language, he labored chiefly in Fujian province. When persecution broke out in 1665, the effect on missions was disastrous. Forbidden to preach, Navarrate occupied himself with writing, hoping in this way to spread and confirm the faith. However, he was hampered too much and left for Rome in 1673 as prefect of the Dominican mission to discuss the question of Chinese Rites. This problem had reached an acute stage in China, with the Jesuits on one side and the Dominicans and Franciscans on the other. Navarrate was highly respected by Pope Innocent XI, who wanted to make him bishop of the Chinese missions; however, Navarrete refused. It was at this time (1676) that Navarrete's book, Tratados historicos, politicos, ethicos, y religiosos de la monarchia de China was published in Madrid. A strongly anti-Jesuit work (which, e.g. denied the authenticity of the Nestorian Stele), it was translated into most major European languages. It became particularly popular in England, and admired by the French Jansenists and Voltaire. Jesuits, on the other hand, tried to have this book suppressed. On his return to Spain in 1677, the Pope, at the suggestion of Charles II, forced him to accept the Archdiocese of Santo Domingo, where he laboured until his death. While on the question of Chinese Rites he was opposed to the Jesuits; in his diocese he had the highest regard for them.

It is south of St. Augustine, in the southern part of St. Johns County. The inlet is not stabilized by jetties, and thus is subject to shifting. Historic maps made by Spanish military engineers in the 18th century show that the inlet today has moved many hundreds of yards south of its location during the time of the Spanish Empire. In 1740, a British invasion force from Fort Frederica, Georgia blockaded this inlet, the southernmost access for boat travel between St. Augustine and Havana, Cuba. Shortly thereafter, in 1742, a coquina stone tower square by high, now called Fort Matanzas, was built by the Spanish authorities in Florida to safeguard this strategic inlet. Origin of name Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re founded Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, in 1564, as a haven for Huguenot settlers. In response to the French encroachment on what Spain regarded as its territory, Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s founded St. Augustine in 1565. Men√©ndez de Avil√©s quickly set out to attack Fort Caroline, traveling overland from St. Augustine. At the same time, the French sailed from Fort Caroline, intending to attack St. Augustine from the sea. The Spanish overwhelmed the lightly defended Fort Caroline, sparing only the women and children, although some 25 men were able to escape. The French fleet was driven off course by a storm, and many of the ships wrecked on the coast south of St. Augustine. When the Spanish found the main group of the French shipwreck survivors, Men√©ndez de Avil√©s ordered all of the Huguenots executed. The location became known as Matanzas (Spanish for \\"slaughters\\").

The town is the at the highlands of √áukurova, and is the major gateway to the Mediterranean coasts. Pozantƒ± stands in the foothills, at the bottom of a rare pass through these high mountains. The mayor is Mustafa √áay (MHP). History Pozantƒ± has had a number of names. In antiquity it was Pendonsis or Pendosis. To the Arabs El Bedendum and finally Bozantƒ± and Pozantƒ± in Turkish. Standing at the entrance to a pass across the Taurus Mountains, Pendonsis was a city of strategic importance, the gateway between the high plain of Anatolia and the low plain of Cilicia or √áukurova and thus the Middle East. Pozantƒ± has successively passed through the hands of Hittites, Persians, Alexander the Great, Rome and Byzantium. In the period of the Abbasids the armies of Islam moved through. And then following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 the Turks made took over. During the Crusades, control of the pass was returned to the Byzantines, then the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, the Mamluks and was finally brought under Ottoman control by Selim I in his campaign of 1517. Pozantƒ± is windy and bleak and for most of this history was a fort and a road-house, but when the railway was put through in 1917 more people began to live here permanently. But still the place really lives from the passing trade on the road. Pozantƒ± was briefly occupied by French forces at the end of World War I. Pozantƒ± today For many, Pozantƒ± is a place to have a break after the hard journey across the Taurus. At the spring of ≈ûekerpƒ±nar, where there is a plant for bottling the spring water, there are motels and well-known roadside restaurants specializing in barbecued meats. For many stopping here to relax on a carpeted bench grilling large quantities of lamb chops or shish kebab is an essential part of the journey to Adana. Especially if you've come all the way over the mountains dodging around slow-moving trucks. (Oh and the river trout is delicious too). As the road from the city is a modern motorway Pozantƒ± is the easiest retreat from the city of Adana, residents drive up here to picnic and escape from the summer heat.

Completed in 1906 as an office and apartment building, it is today the Four Seasons Hotel Budapest Gresham Palace, a luxury hotel managed by Four Seasons Hotels. It is located along the River Danube, adjacent to Sz√©chenyi Square and the eastern terminus of the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge. History The site was once occupied by N√°k√≥ House, a neo-classical palace built in 1827. In 1880, the London-based Gresham Life Assurance Company bought the property, at a time when it was illegal for insurance companies in Great Britain to invest money in stocks, but rental income was an acceptable and legal investment. The company later decided to build its foreign headquarters on the site, and decided that they needed a grander setting for them. They commissioned local architects Zsigmond Quittner and Jozsef Vago to design the new structure, and in 1904, they began construction of the Gresham Palace, which was completed in 1906 and opened in 1907. It was named after the 16th-century English financier Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange in London. Originally, the palace served as an office building as well as a residence for senior staff of the Gresham company. During the occupation after World War II, the Red Army used the building as a barracks. Eventually, it became decrepit and was used as an apartment building during the People's Republic of Hungary. In 1990, following the end of the communist regime, the national government presented the palace to the city of Budapest. Oberoi Hotels entered into an agreement to manage a hotel in the building in 1991, but ensuing legal battles with residents of the building caused Oberoi to drop out in 1995. In 1998, Gresco Investments Ltd acquired the building and received approval from the Budapest Heritage Board to reconstruct it as a luxury hotel while retaining its original Art Nouveau architecture. Gresco raised $85 million for renovations and in 1999 Four Seasons agreed to oversee the reconstruction and manage the new property. In 2001, the building was bought by the Irish investment company Quinlan Private. They extensively rebuilt the structure as a luxury hotel, restoring such original details as a large staircase, stained glass, mosaics, ironwork, and winter gardens. The hotel reopened in June 2004. In November 2011, the hotel was bought by the State General Reserve Fund of Oman, though Four Seasons continues to manage it. It currently has 179 guest rooms, including 17 suites.

The city of Saimbeyli is located in the Taurus mountains, 157 km north of the city of Adana, via an adequate road. The city had a population of 4,010 in 2012. The city of Saimbeyli is on the G√∂ksu river (one of the sources of the Seyhan, in a valley between the forested mountains of Dibek and Bakƒ±r. There is a pass through the mountains from here to Kayseri and the valley is watered by many mountain streams. History and Monuments The area probably has the foundations of Hittite settlements. There is no evidence at present that it was occupied in the Roman period, but it seems likely. The fortress of Saimbeyli may be the medieval Badimon or perhaps the castle of Berdus, which appears on the Coronation List of King Levon I of Cilician Armenia in A.D. 1198/99. This fortress, which guards the strategic road between Kayseri to the north and the Rubenid castle of Vahka to the south, stands on an outcrop at the junction of two valleys and two tributaries of the Seyhan River. The plan and masonry of Saimbeyli‚Äôs castle are identical to the military architecture in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and undoubtedly date from the mid-12th century to the 13th century. Two large round towers with embrasured loopholes (shooting ports) guard the entrance at the northwest, while the remainder of the circuit is protected by steep cliffs below and three rounded salients. In the lower level of the salient in the east wall is the apse for a chapel. A well-preserved vaulted cistern is located near the southwest side of the ward. The exterior masonry consists of ashlar blocks with a rusticated facing. There is evidence of repair, perhaps into early modern times. Opposite and below the fortress are the substantial remains of ecclesiastical and civilian architecture, which date from the 14th through the 19th century.Robert W. Edwards, \\"Ecclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Second Report,\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers 37, 1983, pp.125‚Äì28, 130‚Äì31, pls. 10‚Äì17, 30‚Äì34. The monastic complex dedicated to St. James is perched on the side of a tall hill at the northwest end of the village. The monastery may have a 12th century foundation, but it was rebuilt in 1554 by Bishop Khatchadour. In 1981 the foundation of an orphanage school was visible and only the east end of the large Church of St. James was standing. There was evidence of an underground crypt below the central apse of the church. Population The city known as Ha√ßin had a great Armenian population by the beginning of the 20th century of around 30,000. The Armenians had six churches, including the main Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) denomination, but also an Armenian Catholic and two Evangelical Armenian churches. The population worked in agriculture and various trades. They were subject to deportations and massacres during the Armenian Genocide. After the end of World War I, in 1919, part of the Armenian population returned under French Protectorate, but the French abandoned the city to Turkish rule resulting in the Armenian rebellion and the eventual emptying of the city with the advent of the Kemali forces. The remaining Armenian population of Hajin settled in various countries, notably Lebanon, Syria, France, United States and Latin American countries. They established unions highlighting their city and achievements of its populations. The Turkish authorities renamed the city Saimbeyli in the name of the Turkish military commander that retook the city under Turkish control. In 1953, a city of Nor Hachn (New Hajin) was founded in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Republic of Armenia) in memory of the city of Hajin in Turkey. According to a census of 2015, Nor Hachn has a population of 9,400, The city also includes in its population some survivors and descendants of the genocide and a memorial built in memory of the Armenian victims of Hajin and the Ha√ßin resistance. The memorial itself was inaugurated in 1974.

This station is on the Oban branch of the West Highland Line, originally part of the Callander and Oban Railway.  Services  All services at Falls of Cruachan are operated by Abellio ScotRail. However, unlike other stations on the line, the station is only open in the summer months from March to October every year. This is because the station is mainly used by hikers in the summer months, who walk past the falls to climb Ben Cruachan. When the station is operational, four eastbound trains to and five westbound trains to stop on weekdays and Saturdays along with three each way on Sundays.  History  The shelter at the Falls of Cruachan station. The station (on the lower slopes of Ben Cruachan, above Loch Awe) opened on 1 October 1893 with a single platform on the south side of the line. It was closed on 1 November 1965. Reopening The station was reopened on 20 June 1988 by BR's West Highland Area Business Group, at a cost of just ¬£10,000 ‚Äì achieved by collecting \\"dumped\\" concrete sleepers from the lineside all over the Highlands and having them stacked at the site of the old station here. They were topped by slabs, and BR's Business Manager Highland, Callum MacLeod persuaded the then Strathclyde Regional Council to rebuild the footpath down to the A85 and to install a pavement from there to the Cruachan Power Station Visitors Centre about 300 yards away. There is no station lighting, so trains call during daylight hours only. Col. Dalziel, retiring as Chairman of the Scottish TUCC, performed the opening ceremony. Some years later, a shelter and better signing were added to the halt.  Signalling  Although Falls of Cruachan station has never had any signalling directly associated with it, its platform falls within the four mile stretch of railway that is protected by the Pass of Brander stone signals.  Accidents  On 6 June 2010, a two carriage train from Glasgow to derailed near Falls of Cruachan station. The train derailed shortly before 8.53 p.m. and was left balanced precariously on a embankment. There was also a minor fire. Sixty passengers had been on board the train, but all were safely evacuated down the line to the station with no major injuries. Nine people were injured. The train hit a boulder that had fallen onto the track. The train crew later received a commendation for the actions they took to protect their passengers.

During the Second World War Glaise-Horstenau became a general in the German Wehrmacht and served as Plenipotentiary General to the Independent State of Croatia. Dismayed by the atrocities committed by the Usta≈°e, he was involved in the Lorkoviƒá-Vokiƒá plot, with the purpose of overthrowing Ante Paveliƒá's regime and replacing it with a pro-Allied government.Nada Kisiƒá-Kolanoviƒá. NDH i Italija: politiƒçke veze i diplomatski odnosi. Hrvatski institut za povijest. Zagreb, 2001. (pg. 112) Life Born in Braunau am Inn, the son of an officer, Glaise-Horstenau attended the Theresian Military Academy and served in World War I on the Austro-Hungarian General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army, where he from 1915 headed the press department of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces. After the war he studied history at the University of Vienna, beside his employment at the Austrian War Archives (as director from 1925 to 1938). He also achieved the rank of a colonel at the Austrian Heeresnachrichtenamt in 1934. Originally a monarchist, Glaise-Horstenau became the number-two man in the hierarchy of the banned Austrian Nazi Party in the middle and late 1930s behind its leader Josef Leopold. To improve relations with Nazi Germany, he was appointed a member of the Staatsrat of the Federal State of Austria from 1934 in the rank of a Minister Without Portfolio, and from 1936 to 1938 served as Federal Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, after being appointed under pressure from Adolf Hitler. At the meeting at the Berghof in Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938 between Hitler and Schuschnigg, Germany demanded among other things that Glaise-Horstenau be made Minister of War in a new, pro-Nazi government, and that he would thereafter establish close operational relations between the German and Austrian Armies, leading ultimately to the assimilation of the Austrian into the German system.Documents on German Foreign Policy, I, pp. 513-515 After Schuschnigg had to resign on March 11, Glaise-Horstenau served as Vice-Chancellor of Austria under Arthur Seyss-Inquart for two days. Croatia Siegfried Kasche, von Horstenau and Ante Paveliƒá in Zagreb. After the Anschluss he entered the Wehrmacht and was appointed as Plenipotentiary General in the Independent State of Croatia on 14 April 1941. There, he was shocked by the atrocities of the Usta≈°e (Croatian Fascist para-militaries), which he repeatedly denounced and opposed.Jonathan Gumz, German Counterinsurgency Policy in Independent Croatia, 1941-1944, The Historian, Vol. 61, 1998. As early as 28 June 1941, he reported the following to the German High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW): On 10 July, he added: The lack of response from the OKW at Glaise-Horstenau's criticism of the Usta≈°e's methods increasingly frustrated him, and caused deep tension with Ante Paveliƒá, the poglavnik or head of the Independent State of Croatia. By 1944, he had grown so dismayed at the atrocities he had witnessed that he became deeply implicated in the Lorkoviƒá-Vokiƒá plot, with the purpose of overthrowing Paveliƒá's regime and replacing it with a pro-Allied government.Nada Kisiƒá-Kolanoviƒá. NDH i Italija: politiƒçke veze i diplomatski odnosi. Hrvatski institut za povijest. Zagreb, 2001. (pg. 112) The subsequent failure of this attempt turned Glaise-Horstenau into persona non grata both for the Croatian establishment and the Nazis. Consequently, during the first week of September, Paveliƒá and German ambassador Siegfried Kasche conspired together and effected his removal on 25 September. Glaise-Horstenau's withdrawal from the scene opened the door for the total politicalization of the Croatian armed forces, which occurred over the next several months. Glaise-Horstenau was then passed into F√ºhrer-Reserve and entrusted with the obscure task of Military Historian of the South East until his capture by the US Army on 5 May 1945. Fearing extradition to Yugoslavia, he committed suicide at Langwasser military camp near Nuremberg, Germany, on 20 July 1946.

Employing over 6,000 volunteers, with a salaried staff of 150, Yad Sarah serves over 350,000 clients each year. It is best known for its free loans of over 244,000 pieces of medical and rehabilitative home-care equipment annually, enabling sick, disabled, elderly and recuperating patients to live at home. This saves the country's economy an estimated $320 million in hospital fees and long-term care costs each year. According to an independent survey, one out of every two Israeli families has been helped by Yad Sarah. The organization serves Jews, Christians, Muslims and Druze, as well as tourists with disabilities. Its menu of free or nominal-fee services include lending of medical and rehabilitative equipment, oxygen service, wheelchair transportation, national emergency alarm system, services for the homebound, legal aid for the elderly, geriatric dentistry, day rehabilitation centers, a play center for special needs children, and an education and recreation club for retirees. Yad Sarah receives no government funding, but relies on donations to meet its $23 million operating budget. It exports its expertise to developing countries and has established similar models in various countries. Yad Sarah is a recipient of the Israel Prize and has been awarded advisory status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. History Rehov Hanevi'im, Jerusalem Beit Hakerem, Jerusalem Yad Sarah started in the 1970s as a gemach (free-loan service) in the home of Rabbi Uri Lupolianski, who later served as mayor of Jerusalem from 2003 to 2008. At that time, Lupolianski was a high school teacher with a young family and one of his children needed a vaporizer during the winter, so his wife borrowed one from a neighbor. Upon hearing that such short-term-use items were hard to obtain, Lupolianski decided to start his own gemach by buying a few vaporizers to lend to others. People who heard about his gemach began dropping off other items which are also used for a short time, such as crutches, walkers and wheelchairs. With seed money from his father, Yaakov Lupolianski, and guidance from Kalman Mann, director general of Hadassah Medical Center, Lupolianski incorporated his gemach into a nationwide non-profit in 1976. Lupolianski named the organization Yad Sarah (Hebrew for \\"Memorial to Sarah\\") in memory of his grandmother, Sarah, who had died in the Holocaust. Yad Sarah raises 92% of its operating budget from donations. The organization does not receive any government assistance. Yad Sarah has helped establish equipment-lending centers and repair workshops in Angola, Cameroon, El Salvador, Russia, South Africa, and Jordan. Operation As of 2011, Yad Sarah operates 103 equipment-lending branches throughout Israel. These are located in cities, development towns, and Arab villages, hospitals and private homes. Altogether, the branches stock approximately 300,000 items and 300 types of medical and rehabilitative equipment, including wheelchairs, crutches, beds and oxygen tanks. Yad Sarah's six-story Jerusalem headquarters and central warehouse on Herzl Blvd. occupies a full city block. Services Medical equipment lending center at Yad Sarah House, Jerusalem Ra'anana branch of Yad Sarah Rambam Hospital in Haifa Equipment lending Yad Sarah lends out wheelchairs, crutches, oxygen concentrators, apnea monitors, infant scales, hospital beds, shower chairs and commodes, high-tech and assistive devices, and many other home-care items. At any given time, 18,000 wheelchairs are in circulation. Equipment loans are free of charge; borrowers leave a refundable security deposit and can use the equipment for up to three months. Worn or damaged items are repaired and refurbished at four regional warehouses staffed by volunteers. Yad Sarah receives donations of new and used equipment from local and foreign donors, and some communities have organized used equipment drives on the organization's behalf. In recent years, Yad Sarah began importing components and assembling its own orthopedic and high-tech equipment. It offers a six-month training course in parts assembly to unemployed new immigrants over the age of 50 from the Former Soviet Union and Ethiopia, with certification recognized by the Ministry of Labor. In conjunction with its equipment-lending operation, Yad Sarah has established five resource and exhibition centers where clients can see and try out home-care equipment, and receive guidance on their use. Oxygen service Yad Sarah lends oxygen purifying machines and oxygen cylinders for home use. The organization is reimbursed for this service by Israel's National Insurance Institute (Bituah Leumi) and the patient's health insurer. Wheelchair transportation Specially equipped vans are available to transport persons in wheelchairs to doctor's appointments, Yad Sarah center activities, social occasions, or errands. These vans also bring disabled individuals to and from polling places on election day. Yad Sarah provides airport pick-up and return for disabled tourists as well. National emergency alarm system Yad Sarah introduced the first social alarm service in Israel. Thousands of Israelis have been supplied with alarm transmitters which they can mount on their wall or wear on their wrist, connecting them with Yad Sarah's 24-hour emergency response center. Following payment of a token fee, the transmitters are lent for an unlimited period of time and are installed, repaired and serviced by volunteers free of charge. Yad Sarah has installed its alarm transmitters in kindergartens and nursery schools free of charge, to provide contact in the event of a terrorist attack. Services for the homebound *Meals on wheels: Yad Sarah provides cooked, frozen meals through a catering company and delivers them to the home for a nominal fee. *Laundry service: Volunteers pick up soiled linens and bedclothes from the homes of incontinent individuals, wash and iron them, and return them. This service is available in Israel's three major cities for a nominal fee. *Home repairs: Volunteers with mobile workshops perform home repairs for the elderly and housebound, collecting a token fee for parts. *Home visits: Yad Sarah volunteers visit elderly and homebound individuals on a weekly basis to engage them in handicrafts, computer instruction, taping and typing of life stories, and wheelchair outings. Legal aid for the elderly Lawyers, social workers, and legal and social-work students volunteer their expertise to draft wills, mediate property and landlord issues, mediate family disputes, advise on insurance rights and pensions, and advocate in cases of elder abuse, all at low cost. This service, overseen by Yad Riva within the auspices of Yad Sarah, also makes house calls. Geriatric dentistry Yad Sarah's dental clinic is one of the few in the world specializing in geriatric dentistry. Volunteer dental surgeons, certified hygienists, and dental students provide treatment at the Jerusalem headquarters as well as in a mobile clinic that visits the elderly at home or in old age homes. On average, patients pay 70% of the cost price of dental treatment, and Yad Sarah subsidizes the remainder. Day rehabilitation centers Yad Sarah operates Day Rehabilitation Centers in Jerusalem, Rishon LeZion, Ra'anana and Netanya. These centers, designed to help adults and children recover and restore independent functioning, offer activities such as art therapy, music, horticulture, and holiday parties. Participants arrive in wheelchairs, with crutches or walkers, or in Yad Sarah vans. Yad Sarah also operates a fitness center and a computer center for individuals with disabilities. Children's services The Yad Sarah Play Center in Jerusalem supplements the therapeutic process for children with mild to moderate developmental delays. Professionally trained volunteers guide children aged 3 to 12 in five play rooms, including a \\"noisy\\" activity room for children with coordination difficulties, a \\"quiet\\" activity room for youth with attention deficit disorders, a game room, an imagination room with costumes and props, a creativity room with arts-and-crafts supplies, and a computer room with interactive games and puzzles. Parents attend orientation workshops and accompany their child each week so they can learn new ways to play with the child at home. A morning program provides information and skills to parents of infants and toddlers with mild to severe developmental disabilities.Hall, Y. \\"Playtime With A Twist: Yad Sarah, a family play center, teaches parents how to help their special-needs child\\". Hamodia, 9 August 2006, pp. 10‚Äì11. Yad Sarah dispatches a mobile lending library throughout the country which lends special toys, games and books to disabled children. Retirement club The Golden Age Club is an education and recreation program for retirees. Volunteers lead classes in language studies, arts and crafts, folk dancing, and Tai Chai, as well as offer podiatry, manicure, pedicure and reflexology. Participants can purchase discount tickets to theaters, concerts, and exhibitions. The club maintains a cafeteria which sells light meals, snacks and coffee, plus pre-cooked, frozen meals, at nominal cost. Volunteers Signpost for Yad Sarah branch in Ramot Polin, Jerusalem Volunteers are of all ages and backgrounds, including different socioeconomic sectors and cultural and religious backgrounds. They include retirees and moderately disabled persons. While women usually dominate the volunteer field, fully 35% of the volunteer staff is male. Lupolianski, the founder and president of Yad Sarah, is also a volunteer. He still runs one of the equipment-lending branches in his home. In addition to Yad Sarah's regular volunteers, students, bar and bat mitzvah groups, and other visitors to Israel often lend a hand at the wheelchair-repair center in Jerusalem. Awards and recognition Yad Sarah received the Kaplan Prize for Efficiency in 1990 and the 1994 Israel Prize for its special contribution to society and the State of Israel. In 1982 Lupolianski was the recipient of the President's Award for Volunteering. In 2004 the United Nations recognized Yad Sarah as a Non- Governmental Organization, according it UN observer status. In 2005 the UN Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations upgraded Yad Sarah's status to an advisory body to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. This status allows Yad Sarah to participate in General Assembly meetings and UN international conferences, as well as serve as consultants for UN and government bodies. Madoff investment scandal In 2008 the American Friends of Yad Sarah was named as one of the victims of the Madoff investment scandal. The group had invested $1.5 million with J. Ezra Merkin's Ascot Partners, a Madoff promoter, in 2006, and lost its entire investment when the fraud was discovered. See also *List of Israel Prize recipients *List of investors in Bernard L.

Sarayk√∂y is at a high altitude inland from the Mediterranean and thus has hot dry summers and very cold winters. The mountain sides are mostly bare but there are ongoing forestry projects. History The town was previously a village named Sarƒ±bey after the Turkmen lord that settled his tribe here in the 14th century. Sarayk√∂y was an important point of resistance to the Greek army in the Turkish War of Independence. Volunteers assembled here were able to defend the bridge across the River Menderes and thus prevent the Greeks from occupying the city of Denizli.

Its members are primarily those who create images for publications, though many cross over into wedding and portrait photography. ASMP advocates for photographers' legal rights, supports information-sharing among members, and provides business and technical information. Much of the material is freely available to the public. For instance, it offers a web tutorial on registering copyrights, and on model releases and property releases. It also helps users of images find qualified photographers for project assignments (\\"Find a Photographer\\") and helps photographers find qualified assistants (\\"Find an Assistant.\\") The ASMP has nearly than 7,000 members in over 30 countries. History In the fall of 1944, some two dozen New York photographers formed the Society of Magazine Photographers or SMP. Within a few months, though, they had to change the name to American Society of Magazine Photographers because the acronym SMP was already being used by another organization. (In 1992, recognizing that it had grown far beyond the borders of the magazine industry, the Society adopted its current name.) Their goal was to address their common problems: lack of credit lines, unauthorized reproduction of images, and uncredited copying of photographs by illustrators and artists. They also hoped to raise their rates of pay. In the early years, a majority within the Society held the opinion that ASMP should be a labor union and bargain collectively for wages and working conditions. However, this was far from unanimous. A substantial minority wanted nothing to do with unions and saw ASMP as a professional guild along the lines of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association. During the 1950s, the issue was the cause of frequent schisms and mass resignations. The issue was laid to rest by a 1976 ruling of the National Labor Relations Board, which determined that ASMP was a group of independent contractors and, thus, ineligible to be a union. Thereafter, ASMP focused its efforts on areas that are traditional activities of professional associations: networking, advocacy and business practices. Activities=Networking and special-interest groups From just a couple dozen photojournalists in New York City, the Society soon expanded. Local chapters were formed, first in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and then in other cities. Today there are 39 chapters, covering the major U.S. metropolitan areas. Although the group does distribute videos of its major events, outreach to smaller cities remains a continuing challenge. During the 1950s and '60s, ASMP also grew to encompass a wider range of photographic applications, including such specialties as advertising, catalog, architectural and industrial imagery. After the Internet came of age, The Society's specialty groups took advantage of the free and easy interchange of ideas that bulletin boards, listservs and social networks could provide. Advocating for photographers' interests Though then 88 years old and unable to attend in person, in 1967 Edward Steichen, as a still active member of the copyright committee of ASMP, and David Linton as the committee chairman, wrote submissions to the U.S. Senate hearings to support Copyright law revisions. Steichen requested that \\"this young giant among the visual arts be given equal rights by having its peculiar problems taken into account.\\" Linton wrote; \\"We join with other creators of 'Original Works of Authorship' in supporting the proposed copyright term of the creator's life plus fifty years after.\\"United States. (1967). Copyright law revision: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Ninetieth Congress, first session pursuant to S. Res. 37 on S. 597. , U.S. Government Printing Office During the 1970s, Congress debated a major revision to the copyright laws, culminating in passage of the Copyright Act of 1976. ASMP lobbied for the provision of the Act that automatically grants copyright to the creator of a work. (Under previous U.S. law, copyright was dependent on registering the work with the Copyright Office.) Likewise, in the late '90s ASMP lobbied in favor of the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act, which brought U.S. law into conformity with the international Berne Convention treaty by extending the term of copyright to the life of the creator plus 70 years. Several recent Congresses have considered a change in the treatment of \\"orphan works\\", which are copyrighted works whose owner cannot be identified or located. ASMP has testified about the impact on photographers of the proposed changes, and has worked with Congressional committees to mitigate the harm that might be done. ASMP has also supported photographers in the courts, filing amicus curiae briefs and providing financial support in a number of precedent-setting cases. Major cases of recent years include New York Times Co. v. Tasini (U.S. Supreme Court) and Jarvis v. K2 (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals). ASMP (with the Graphic Artists Guild, the Picture Archive Council of America, the North American Nature Photography Association, Professional Photographers of America, and several individual photographers) filed class-action litigation against Google, claiming that Google's Library Project, which is scanning millions of books and publications, infringes the copyrights of photographers, illustrators and visual artists. Some chapters offer lectures or small meetings to facilitate business related questions known as Brain Trusts. Professional education In 1973, at the instigation of then-president Lawrence Fried, ASMP published Professional Business Practices in Photography, a compilation of recommended procedures, industry terminology, and standard forms and contracts. Initially issued in looseleaf format (and informally referred to as the \\"Business Bible\\"), the publication has regularly been revised over the years; the seventh edition was released as a trade paperback in 2008. In addition to the Professional Business Practices book, which is aimed at photographers, ASMP has published pamphlets for photo users that explain how the business works. The Society has also regularly produced business seminars and conferences on topics of interest to professional photographers. ASMP was among the founding members of the UPDIG Coalition, which in 2006-07 published a set of technical recommendations for accurate reproduction of digital images. In 2008-2011, ASMP sponsored the dpBestflow project that, with financial support from the Library of Congress, published best practices and tutorials for preserving digital images.

Upper Sarikamish in March 1916 History For most of the 19th century, Sarikamish was an insignificant settlement that was divided into two parts: upper Sarikamish and lower Sarikamish. Nothing is known of its earlier history, but nearby archaeological sites date from Urartian times: there is a Urartian fortress on a hill beside upper Sarikamish, another, 12 km away, beside Chatak village, and a third, 15 km away, at a site known as Yedikilise.Sinclair, Thomas Allen, \\"Eastern Turkey, an Architectural and Archeological Survey\\", volume one p417-418, London, 1987. To the east and south of the town, in the forests of Soƒüanlƒ±, there were many medieval Armenian monasteries, but most were in ruins by 1878.Parsegian, V. L. (project director), \\"Armenian Architecture: A Documented Photo-Archival Collection on Microfiche\\", volumes 1. Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan invaded the Sarikamish area including Allah√ºekber Daƒülarƒ± and Soƒüanlƒ± mountains in 1064, only a few years prior to the battle of Manzikert between the armies of Alp Arslan and Byzantines. The area was then taken by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1534 and became a liva of Kars sancak of the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century the region around Sarikamish became a conflict zone between the Ottoman and Russian empires. Battles took place at nearby Zivin in 1829, 1855 and 1877. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, Sarikamish became part of the Russian empire, incorporated within the militarily administered Kars Oblast, which was renowned for the extreme ethnic diversity of its population. Lower Sarikamish developed into a small, modern town. Being close to the Ottoman border, it was also a military station with barracks for two regiments. It had a railway station that was the railhead for the line running from Kars and Alexandropol.W.E.D. Allen & P. Muratoff, \\"Caucasian Battlefields\\", p263, Cambridge, 1953. Sarikamish market in March 1916 An important battle took place between the armies of the Ottoman and Russian empires in and around the city in late December 1914-January 1915 as part of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I. Enver Pasha, the leader of the Ittihat ve Terakki party in Istanbul, personally led the army along with Hafiz Hakki Pasha, who was his brother in-law, to scale the Mount Allahu Ekber and afterwards attack the Russian army in Sarikamish. Enver Pasha intended to occupy the town in order to halt logistic support to the city of Kars, which the Turks lost to the Russians in 1878, and which he was planning to reoccupy. In mid December, Enver Pasha entered the Caucasus region through Armenia. Enver ordered his forces to attack along many routes with the goal of arriving suddenly at Sarikamis at the same time. The chief German military advisor, Liman von Sanders strongly argued against this plan but was ignored. Governor General Vorontsov planned to withdraw his forces to the city of Kars. But General Yudenich, in charge of the defense of the area, ignored Vorontsov's wishes to withdraw and instead stayed to defend Sarikamis.T.N. Dupuy's Encyclopedia of Military History (many editions) Enver's forces lost touch with one another and arrived at Sarakamis at different times from December 29 through the 3rd of January. The first divisions to arrive briefly took control of the barracks in the western part of the city but were driven off. In the following days, as more Ottoman forces arrived at the battle, they attacked without coordination and the Russians under the skillful command of Yudenich fought off the attacks one by one. The battle finally ended on January 4 and the Ottoman army retreated in complete disorganization back through the mountains in the middle of winter. The number of Turkish losses is estimated to be 60,000-80,000 dead out of an army of 90,000. It is very likely that the majority of Turkish soldiers died because of inadequate winter clothing and field shelters during the attack and retreat. In any event, this was an extraordinarily costly defeat for the Turks; in losses this was the worst single defeat they suffered in the entire war. Turkish soldiers reached their targets but they were too weak to win. The Russian casualties were estimated at 35,000.Tucker, Spencer. The Great War: 1914-18 (1998) As one German officer attached to the army wrote later, the Ottoman 3rd army had \\"suffered a disaster which for rapidity and completeness is without parallel in military history.\\"A Peace to End all Peace, David Fromkin, 1989 page 121 In 2005 the Turkish Army's 9th Infantry Division, located here, was reduced to a brigade, still part of Third Army.

It was based on the mechanical layout of the HeS 30, but replaced the conventional flame cans with oversized ones including large poppet valves that sealed off the chambers during firing. Constant-volume combustion, similar to the Otto cycle used in most piston engines, is considerably more fuel efficient than the constant-pressure combustion used in a typical jet engine.Kay 2007, p. Design The design was based on the HeS 30 not only to make parts more readily available as well as to make direct comparisons between the two easier. The main changes were to reduce the compression ratio of the compressor to about 2:1 (from 2.8:1), and add the new combustion chambers. The new chambers were considerably larger than the originals, forcing a reduction in the number from ten to six burners. The valve stems projected forward into streamlined fairings in the intake area behind the compressor. The operational cycle of the engine is somewhat similar to a conventional six-cylinder engine, except the compressor did all the compressing instead of a piston stroke, and the chamber only served as a combustion chamber, rather than a compression, combustion and expansion chamber as in a piston engine. Compressed air, similar to an automobile equipped with a turbocharger, but at a hgiher pressure ratio, was channeled into the cylinders in turn, closed off with the poppet valves, and then burned. By the time the combustion was complete the pressure in the flame cans would be much higher, although the actual expansion ratio is not specified. The hot gas was then released, and flowed through a turbine to extract power, instead of forcing a piston to move (although most of the output in the expected turbojet engine format - as opposed to a turboshaft - would be extracted as thrust, and the turbine only acted to power the compressor to continue the cycle). Although there would be some loss of charge during the burning period, and thus the design would be less efficient than the true Otto cycle, it would nevertheless be somewhat more efficient than a traditional jet engine, at the cost of some complexity. History It appears the HeS 40 was never built, and remained a paper design. Nevertheless, work on the design was ended by 1942, by which point the HeS 30 was making good progress.

It thus played an integral role in the lives of ancient Greeks. There are significant fragments of actual Greek musical notationHenderson, p. 327.Ulrich and Pisk, p. 16. as well as many literary references to ancient Greek music, such that some things can be known‚Äîor reasonably surmised‚Äîabout what the music sounded like, the general role of music in society, the economics of music, the importance of a professional caste of musicians, etc. Even archaeological remains reveal an abundance of depictions on ceramics, for example, of music being performed. The word music comes from the Muses, the daughters of Zeus and patron goddesses of creative and intellectual endeavours. Concerning the origin of music and musical instruments: the history of music in ancient Greece is so closely interwoven with Greek mythology and legend that it is often difficult to surmise what is historically true and what is myth. The music and music theory of ancient Greece laid the foundation for western music and western music theory, as it would go on to influence the ancient Romans, the early Christian church and the medieval composers. Specifically the teachings of the Pythagoreans, Ptolemy, Philodemus, Aristoxenus, Aristides, and Plato compile most of our understanding of ancient Greek music theory, musical systems, and musical ethos. The study of music in ancient Greece was included in the curriculum of great philosophers, Pythagoras in particular believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres. The Pythagoreans focused on the mathematics and the acoustical science of sound and music. They developed tuning systems and harmonic principles that focused on simple integers and ratios, laying a foundation for acoustic science; however, this was not the only school of thought in ancient Greece. Aristoxenus, who wrote a number of musicological treatises, for example, studied music with a more empirical tendency. Aristoxenus believed that intervals should be judged by ear instead of mathematical ratios, though Aristoxenus was influenced by Pythagoras and used mathematic terminology and measurements in his research. Music in society and religion Music played an integral role in ancient Greek society. Pericles' teacher Damon said, according to Plato in the Republic, \\"when fundamental modes of music change, the fundamental modes of the state change with them.\\" Music and gymnastics comprised the main divisions in one's schooling. \\"The word 'music' expressed the entire education\\". Instrumental music served a religious and entertaining role in ancient Greece as it would often accompany religious events, rituals, and festivals. Music was also used for entertainment when it accompanied drinking-parties or symposia. A popular type of piece to be played while drinking at these drinking parties was the skolion, a piece composed to be heard while drinking. Before and after the Greek drinking parties, religious libations, or the religious the act of partaking and pouring out drink, would be made to deities, usually the Olympic gods, the heroes, and Zeus. The offering of libations were often accompanied by a special libation melody called the spondeion, which was often accompanied by an aulos player. Music occupied an important role in the Greek sacrificial ceremonies. The sarcophagus of Hagia Triada shows that the aulos was present during sacrifices as early as 1300 BC. Music was also present during times of initiation, worship, and religious celebration, playing very integral parts of the sacrificial cults of Apollo and Dionysus. Music (along with intoxication of potions, fasting, and honey) was also integral in preparation and catalyzing divination, as music would often induce prophets into religious ecstasy and revelation, so much so that the expression for \\"making music\\" and \\"prophesying\\" were identical in ancient Greek. Instruments were also present in war time, though it may not have been considered music entirely. Specific notes of the trumpet were played to dictate commands to soldiers on the battlefield. The aulos and percussion instruments also accompanied the verbal commands given to oarsmen by the boatswain. The instruments were used mainly to help keep the oarsmen in time with one another. Popular song types ;Hymn: A metric composition whose text addresses a god, either directly or indirectly. They are the earliest formal type in Greek music, and survive in relatively large numbers. ;Paean: Most commonly sung in honor or worship of Apollo as well as Athena, they usually solemnly expressed the hope for deliverance from a peril, or were sung in thanksgiving after a victory or escape. ;Prosodion: A type of hymn or processional that invoked or praised a god. Prosodions were usually sung on the road to an altar or shrine, before or after a paean. ;Hyporchema: A dance- song with a marked rhythmic movement, commonly associated with the paean, and often difficult to distinguish from it. For example, the First Delphic Hymn is titled \\"Paean or Hyporchema\\". ;Dithyrambs: Usually merrily sung in celebration at festivals, performed especially in dedication to Dionysus the god of wine. Dithyrambs featured choirs (choros) of men and boys who were accompanied by an aulos player. Poetry and drama Whether or not long narrative poetry, or epic poetry like those of Homer, were sung is not entirely known. As in Plato's dialogue Ion, Socrates uses both the words \\"sing\\" and \\"speak\\" in connection with the Homeric epics, however there are heavy implications that they maybe have been at least recited unaccompanied by instruments, in a sing- song chant. Music was also present in ancient Greek lyric poetry, which by definition is poetry or a song accompanied by a lyre. Lyric poetry eventually branched into two paths, monodic lyric which were performed by a singular person, and choral lyric which were sung and sometimes danced by a group of people choros. Famous lyric poets include Alkaios and Sappho from the Island of Lesbos, Sappho being one of the few woman whose poetry has been preserved. Music was also heavily prevalent in ancient Greek Drama. In his Poetics, Aristotle links the origins of tragic drama to dithyrambs. The leaders of dithyrambs were the ones who led the song and dance moves, which would then be responded to by the group. Aristotle implies that this relationship between a single person and a group began the tragic drama, which in its earliest stages had a single actor who played all the parts through either song or speech. The single actor engaged in dialogue with the choros. The choros narrated most of the story through song and dance. In ancient Greece, the playwright was expected to not only write the script but also expected to compose the music and dance moves. Mythology The ancient Greek myths were never codified or documented into one form; what exists are several different versions from several different authors, across multiple centuries, which can lead to variations and even contradictions among authors and even the same author. According to Greek mythology: music, instruments, and the aural arts are attributed to divine origin, and the art of music was gift of the gods to men. Clio, Thalia, and Euterpe playing a transverse flute, presumably the Greek photinx. Although Apollo was prominently considered the god of music and harmony, several legendary gods and demigods were purported to have created some aspect of music as well as contributed to its development. Some gods, and especially the Muses, represented specific aspects or elements of music. The 'inventions' or 'findings' of all ancient Greek instruments were accredited to the gods as well. The performance of music was integrated into many different modes of Greek story-telling and art related to mythology, including drama, and poetry, and there are a large number of ancient Greek myths related to music and musicians. In Greek mythology: Amphion learned music from Hermes and then with a golden lyre built Thebes by moving the stones into place with the sound of his playing; Orpheus, the master-musician and lyre-player, played so magically that he could soothe wild beasts; the Orphic creation myths have Rhea \\"playing on a brazen drum, and compelling man's attention to the oracles of the goddess\\"; or Hermes [showing to Apollo] \\"... his newly-invented tortoise-shell lyre and [playing] such a ravishing tune on it with the plectrum he had also invented, at the same time singing to praise Apollo's nobility that he was forgiven at once ...\\"; or Apollo's musical victories over Marsyas and Pan. Pan instructing Daphnis on the syrinx. There are many such references that indicate that music was an integral part of the Greek perception of how their race had even come into existence and how their destinies continued to be watched over and controlled by the Gods. It is no wonder, then, that music was omnipresent at the Pythian Games, the Olympic Games, religious ceremonies, leisure activities, and even the beginnings of drama as an outgrowth of the dithyrambs performed in honor of Dionysus.Ulrich and Pisk, p. 15. It may be that the actual sounds of the music heard at rituals, games, dramas, etc. underwent a change after the traumatic fall of Athens in 404 BC at the end of the first Peloponnesian War. Indeed, one reads of the \\"revolution\\" in Greek culture, and Plato's lament that the new music \\"... used high musical talent, showmanship and virtuosity ... consciously rejecting educated standards of judgement.\\" Henderson p. 395. Although instrumental virtuosity was prized, this complaint included excessive attention to instrumental music such as to interfere with accompanying the human voice, and the falling away from the traditional ethos in music. =Mythical origins= ;Lyre: According to the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, after stealing his brother Apollo's sacred cattle, Hermes was inspired to build an instrument out of a tortoise shell; he attached horns, and gut-string, to the shell and invented the first lyre. Afterward Hermes gave his lyre to Apollo, who took interest in the instrument, in repayment for the stolen cattle. In other accounts, Hermes gave his newly invented lyre to Amphion, a son of Zeus and a skilled musician. the Pan pipes, or syrinx. ;Syrinx / Pan-pipe: According to Ovid's Metamorpheses, the original Syrinx was a Naiad, a water nymph, who ran away from Pan after he tried to woo her. While she fled, she came upon an uncrossable river and prayed to her sisters to transform her so that she may escape Pan. Her Nymph sisters transformed Syrinx into a bundle of reeds which Pan found and fashioned an instrument out of, the pan pipe or syrinx. ;Aulos: According to Pindar's Twelfth Pythian Ode, after Perseus beheaded Medusa, Athena 'found' or 'invented' the aulos in order to reproduce the lamentation of Medusa's sisters. Since the same Greek word is used for 'find' and 'invent', it is unclear; however, the writer Telestes in the 5th century states that Athena found the instrument in a thicket. In Plutarch's essay On the Restraint of Anger, he writes that Athena, after seeing her reflection while playing the aulos, threw the instrument away because it distorted her facial features when played. After which Marsyas a satyr, picked up her aulos and took it up as his own. =Orpheus myth= Orpheus is a significant figure in the ancient Greek mythology of music. Orpheus was a legendary poet and musician, his lineage is unclear as some sources note him as the son of Apollo, the son of the Muse Calliope, or the son of mortal parents. Orpheus was the pupil and brother of Linus. Linus by some accounts is the son of Apollo and the Muse Urania; Linus was the first to be gifted the ability to sing by the Muses, which he passed to Orpheus. Other accounts state that Apollo gave Orpheus a golden lyre and taught him to play, while the muses taught Orpheus to sing. Orpheus was said to be such a skilled musician that he could charm inanimate objects. According to the Argonautica, Orpheus in his adventures with Jason and the Argonauts, was able to play music more beautiful and louder than the bewitching sirens, allowing the Argonauts to travel safely without being charmed by the sirens.When Orpheus' wife, Eurydice, died, he played a song so mournful that it caused the gods and all the nymphs to weep. Orpheus was then able to travel to the underworld, and with music, softened the heart of Hades enough that he was allowed to return with his wife; however, under the condition that he must not set eyes upon his wife until they finished their travel out of the underworld. Orpheus was unable to fulfill this condition and tragically, his wife vanished forever. =Marsyas myth= According to Apollodorus in Bibliotheca, Marsyas the Phrygian satyr once boasted of his skills in the aulos, a musical contest between Marsyas and Apollo was then conducted, where the victor could do \\"whatever they wanted\\" to the loser. Marsyas played his aulos so wildly that everyone burst into dance, while Apollo played his lyre so beautifully that everyone cried. The muses judged the first round to be a draw. According to one account, Apollo then played his lyre upside down, which Marsyas could not do with the aulos. In another account Apollo sang beautifully, which Marsyas could not do. In another account, Marsyas played out of tune and accepted defeat. In all accounts, Apollo then flayed Marsyas alive for losing. Pindar recounts a similar myth but instead of Marsyas, it was Pan who contests Apollo and the judge was Midas. This myth can be considered a testament of Apollo's skill but also a myth of caution towards pride. Greek musical instruments The following were among the instruments used in the music of ancient Greece. The lyre, kithara, aulos, hydraulis, and salpinx all found their way into the music of ancient Rome. String A later vivid Roman representation of a woman playing the kithara ;The lyre: a strummed and occasionally plucked string instrument, essentially a hand-held zither built on a tortoise-shell (chelys) frame, generally with seven or more strings tuned to the notes of one of the modes. The lyre was a folk-instrument, associated with the cult of Apollo. It was used to accompany others or even oneself for recitation and song, and was the conventional training-instrument for an aristocratic education. ;Kithara: A professional version of the lyre used by paid musicians. ;Barbitos: A larger, bass-version of the kithara, considered to be east-Ionian, an exotic and somewhat foreign instrument. It was the primary instrument of the highly regarded ancient lyricist Sappho, as well as often associated with satyrs. ;Kanonaki: A trapezoidal psaltery, invented by the Pythagoreans in the 6th century BC, however, may have had Mycenaean origins. It was held on the thighs of the player, and plucked with both hands with bone pickings. ;Harp: Harps are among the oldest known string instruments, and were in use by Sumerians and Egyptians long before they were present in Greece. The ancient version of the harp resembles a bow, with the strings connecting to the top and bottom of the arch. The strings are perpendicular to the soundbox, while the strings on a lyre are parallel. The hydraulis. Note the presence of the curved trumpet, called the bukanƒì by the Greeks and, later, cornu by the Romans. Warrior playing a salpinx, 6th‚Äì5th century BC. Attic lekythos. Wind ;Aulos: Usually double, consisting of two double-reed (like an oboe) pipes, not joined but generally played with a mouth-band to hold both pipes steadily between the player's lips. Modern reconstructions indicate that they produced a low, clarinet-like sound. There is some confusion about the exact nature of the instrument; alternate descriptions indicate single-reeds instead of double reeds. It was associated with the cult of Dionysus. ;Syrinx or Pan pipes: (Greek œÉœÖœÅŒπŒ≥Œæ, syrinx) is also known as pan-flute is an ancient musical instrument based on the principle of the stopped pipe, consisting of a series of such pipes of gradually increasing length, tuned (by cutting) to a desired scale. Sound is produced by blowing across the top of the open pipe (like blowing across a bottle top). ;Hydraulis: A keyboard instrument, the forerunner of the modern pipe organ. As the name indicates, the instrument used water to supply a constant flow of pressure to the pipes. Two detailed descriptions have survived: that of VitruviusVitruvius, De Architectura, x, 8. and Heron of Alexandria.Heron of Alexandria, Pneumatica, I, 42. These descriptions deal primarily with the keyboard mechanism and with the apparatus that supplied the instrument with air. ;Salpinx: A brass trumpet used for military calls, and even contested in the Olympics. A number of sources mention this metal instrument with a bone mouthpiece. tympanum with her right hand. red-figure oinochoe, 320 BC, from Magna Graecia. Percussion ;Tympanum: Also called a tympanon; a type of frame drum or tambourine. It was circular, shallow, and beaten with the palm of the hand or a stick. ;Crotala: A kind of clapper or castanet used in religious dances by groups. ;Koudounia: Bell-like instruments made of copper. Music and philosophy=Pythagoras The enigmatic ancient Greek figure of Pythagoras with mathematical devotion laid the foundations of our knowledge of the study of harmonics‚Äîhow strings and columns of air vibrate, how they produce overtones, how the overtones are related arithmetically to one another, etc.Calter (1998). It was common to hear of the \\"music of the spheres\\" from the Pythagoreans. After studying the sound hammers made in a blacksmith's forge, Pythagoras invented the monochord, which has a movable bridge along with a string stretched over a sounding board. Using the monochord, he found the association between the vibrations and the lengths of the strings. Plato At a certain point, Plato complained about the new music: > Our music was once divided into its proper forms ... It was not permitted to > exchange the melodic styles of these established forms and others. Knowledge > and informed judgment penalized disobedience. There were no whistles, > unmusical mob-noises, or clapping for applause. The rule was to listen > silently and learn; boys, teachers, and the crowd were kept in order by > threat of the stick. ... But later, an unmusical anarchy was led by poets > who had natural talent, but were ignorant of the laws of music ... Through > foolishness they deceived themselves into thinking that there was no right > or wrong way in music, that it was to be judged good or bad by the pleasure > it gave. By their works and their theories they infected the masses with the > presumption to think themselves adequate judges. So our theatres, once > silent, grew vocal, and aristocracy of music gave way to a pernicious > theatrocracy ... the criterion was not music, but a reputation for > promiscuous cleverness and a spirit of law-breaking.Plato, Laws 700-701a. > cited in Wellesz, p. 395. second of the two hymns to Apollo. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols above the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering. From his references to \\"established forms\\" and \\"laws of music\\" we can assume that at least some of the formality of the Pythagorean system of harmonics and consonance had taken hold of Greek music, at least as it was performed by professional musicians in public, and that Plato was complaining about the falling away from such principles into a \\"spirit of law-breaking\\". Detail from Piero di Cosimo's 16th-century version of Perseus rescuing Andromeda. The instrument in the hands of the musician is an anachronism and appears to be an imaginary combination of a plucked string instrument and bassoon. Playing what \\"sounded good\\" violated the established ethos of modes that the Greeks had developed by the time of Plato: a complex system of relating certain emotional and spiritual characteristics to certain modes (scales). The names for the various modes derived from the names of Greek tribes and peoples, the temperament and emotions of which were said to be characterized by the unique sound of each mode. Thus, Dorian modes were \\"harsh\\", Phrygian modes \\"sensual\\", and so forth. In his Republic,Plato, Republic, cited in Strunk, pp. 4‚Äì12. Plato talks about the proper use of various modes, the Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, etc. It is difficult for the modern listener to relate to that concept of ethos in music except by comparing our own perceptions that a minor scale is used for melancholy and a major scale for virtually everything else, from happy to heroic music. The sounds of scales vary depending on the placement of tones. Modern Western scales use the placement of whole tones, such as C to D on a modern piano keyboard, and half tones, such as C to C-sharp, but not quarter-tones (\\"in the cracks\\" on a modern keyboard) at all. This limit on tone types creates relatively few kinds of scales in modern Western music compared to that of the Greeks, who used the placement of whole-tones, half- tones, and even quarter-tones (or still smaller intervals) to develop a large repertoire of scales, each with a unique ethos. The Greek concepts of scales (including the names) found its way into later Roman music and then the European Middle Ages to the extent that one can find references to, for example, a \\"Lydian church mode\\", although name is simply a historical reference with no relationship to the original Greek sound or ethos. A representation from the 1500s of the Muses dancing From the descriptions that have come down to us through the writings of those such as Plato, AristoxenusAristoxenus. and, later, Boethius,Boethius. we can say with some caution that the ancient Greeks, at least before Plato, heard music that was primarily monophonic; that is, music built on single melodies based on a system of modes / scales, themselves built on the concept that notes should be placed between consonant intervals. It is a commonplace of musicology to say that harmony, in the sense of a developed system of composition, in which many tones at once contribute to the listener's expectation of resolution, was invented in the European Middle Ages and that ancient cultures had no developed system of harmony‚Äîthat is, for example, playing the third and seventh above the dominant, in order to create the expectation for the listener that the tritone will resolve to the third. Plato's Republic notes that Greek musicians sometimes played more than one note at a time, although this was apparently considered an advanced technique. The Orestes fragment of Euripides seems to clearly call for more than one note to be sounded at once.West, pp. 206‚Äì207. ResearchKilmer and Crocker. in the field of music from the ancient Mediterranean‚Äîdecipherings of cuneiform music script‚Äîargue for the sounding of different pitches simultaneously and for the theoretical recognition of a \\"scale\\" many centuries before the Greeks learned to write, which they would have done before they developed their system for notating music and recorded the written evidence for simultaneous tones. All we can say from the available evidence is that, while Greek musicians clearly employed the technique of sounding more than one note at the same time, the most basic, common texture of Greek music was monophonic. That much seems evident from another passage from Plato: > ... The lyre should be used together with the voices ... the player and the > pupil producing note for note in unison, Heterophony and embroidery by the > lyre‚Äîthe strings throwing out melodic lines different from the melodia which > the poet composed; crowded notes where his are sparse, quick time to his > slow ... and similarly all sorts of rhythmic complications against the > voices‚Äînone of this should be imposed upon pupils ...Plato, Laws 812d., > cited in Henderson, p. 338. Aristotle Aristotle had a strong belief that music should be a part of one's education, alongside reading and writing, and gymnastics. Just as men must work hard in their duties, they must also be able to relax well. According to Aristotle, all men could agree that music was one of the most pleasurable things, so to have this as a means of leisure was only logical. Amusing oneself was not considered a viable hobby, or else we would not want to help in society. Since music combined relaxing ourselves, along with others, Aristotle claimed that learning an instrument was essential to our development. Virtues is a topic that Aristotle is widely known for, and he also used them to justify why music should be involved in education. Since virtues consist of loving and rejoicing in something, then music could be pursued without issue. Music forms our character, so it should also be a part of our education. Aristotle also comments on how getting children involved in music would be a way to keep them occupied and quiet. It is important to note that since music helps in forming the character, it could cause either adverse or pleasant effects. The way in which music is taught can have a large impact on development. Learning music should not interfere with the younger years, nor should it damage the body in a way that a person is unable to fulfill duties in the military. Those that have learned music in education should not be at the same level as a professional, but they should have a greater knowledge than the slaves and other commoners. Aristotle was specific in what instruments should be learned. The harp and flute should not be taught in school, as they are too complicated. Additionally, only certain melodies have benefits in an educational setting. Ethical melodies should be taught, but melodies of passion and melodies of action should be for performances.

He was a liegeman of the Archbishop of Cologne, who was among the prince electors of the Holy Roman Empire. Hermanus held a castle for his lord called F√ºrstenberg (\\"Prince's Hill\\") in Ense-H√∂ingen in Soest; this castle would give the family its name. His son was Wilhelm von Vorstenberg, the Justiciar and Castellan of Werl. History Already Imperial Knights, the family members were created Imperial Barons (Reichsfreiherren) on 26 April 1660. Matriculation to the baronial class in the Kingdom of Bavaria occurred on 22 August 1891 for Friedrich Freiherr von F√ºrstenberg, Rittmeister √† la suite in the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt and Freeholder of Egenburg by W√ºrzburg. The baronial F√ºrstenberg family of Westphalia should not be confused with the princely family of F√ºrstenberg from Swabia. Some members of the family were elevated to comital dignities during German Mediatization for their services to the Kingdom of Prussia, or given honorific titles for their twentieth-century achievements: *Herdringen Line: a Prussian graviate; the title was Graf von F√ºrstenberg-Herdringen, and an estate in tail, Besitz Herdringen, was given on 16 January 1843 to Franz Egon Freiherr von F√ºrstenberg of Herdringen (1818‚Äì1902), a member of the Prussian House of Lords and Seneschal in the Duchy of Westphalia. *Stammheim Line: a Prussian graviate; the title of Graf von F√ºrstenberg-Stammheim, in the Demesne of Stammheim, was given on 15 October 1840 to the Royal Prussian Chamberlain, Franz Egon Freiherr von F√ºrstenberg of Stammheim, and the heirs of his body. This line died out in 1925. *Belgian naturalisation as Baron de Furstenberg was granted on 18 April 1887 to Clemens Freiherr von F√ºrstenberg. A Belgian comt√© was created with the title of Comte de Furstenberg on 3 January 1964 for Wenemar Freiherr von Furstenberg, an agricultural scientist.

He was the son of John Boyle of Kelburn (d. 1685), a Shire Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland for Bute, and Marion Steuart, daughter of Sir Walter Steuart of Allanton. Career French illustration of an opening of the Scottish Parliament, ca. 18th Century From 1689‚Äì1699, Boyle was the Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland from the Bute constituency. In 1697, he was invested as Privy Counsellor. He was Rector of Glasgow University from 1690‚Äì1691, as well as the last Treasurer-depute before the Union with England. The Earl was a supporter of the Acts of Union, and after their passage, he sat as a Scottish representative peer from 1707 to 1710, serving alongside his first wife's nephew, John Lindsay, 19th Earl of Crawford (d. 1713). In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the Darien scheme through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the Alien Act of 1705 to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement. As many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien Scheme, they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses of which Article 15 granted ¬£398,085 10s sterling to Scotland, a sum known as The Equivalent, to offset future liability towards the English national debt, that was in essence used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien Scheme.Watt, Douglas.

In total, ¬£20,000 (¬£240,000 Scots) was dispatched to Scotland, of which ¬£12,325, more than 60% of the funding, was distributed to Boyle and The Duke of Queensbury, the Commissioner in Parliament.Some contend that all of this money was properly accounted for as compensation for loss of office, pensions and so forth not outwith the usual run of government. It is perhaps a debate that will never be set to rest. However, modern research has shown that payments were made to supporters of union that appear not to have been overdue salariesParliament.uk He was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1706, and in 1707 to 1710.

Seferihisar district area borders on other ƒ∞zmir districts of Urla to the west and Menderes (Cumaovasƒ±) to the east, and touches ƒ∞zmir's western-most metropolitan district of G√ºzelbah√ße in the north. Seferihisar town center is situated slightly inland at an altitude of 28 m and the urban area extends towards the sea as composed of eight quarters, with some distance among some, and one of which, the neighborhood called Sƒ±ƒüacƒ±k stands somewhat separately from the rest at a distance of 5 km, and has its own port and made a name as a tourism resort by its own right. The wide area of the district center partly accounts for the high number of the population and an urbanization rate of only 51%, and the general impression observed is rather rural in some of its sections. Both the center town and the district as a whole preserves an overall outlook of a pleasant resort area bearing typical Aegean characteristics and it is estimated the population reaches the level of 150,000 people during the touristic season. Nevertheless, the district's economy is still largely based on agriculture, with the production of tangerines and satsumas standing out, and only increasingly on tourism, with the presence of several housing projects or vacation villages, pensioners opting to settle in the region due to its quiet charm and under the impetus of a university campus that is in phase of being built. At a distance of from ƒ∞zmir center, (Konak), the connections with the metropolis are made easily, especially once reached the six-lane highway in Urla.

Settlement and geography Seferihisar district counts eight depending villages and two larger settlements which have their own municipal administrations (Doƒüanbey and √úrkmez). The district center of Seferihisar, spreading over eight officially delimited quarters, accounts for roughly half of the total district of population estimated as being slightly over forty thousand (34.761 in the last census of 2000). As such, it is one of the smaller districts of ƒ∞zmir Province and the inward immigration level is rather low at only 0.18% despite rising interest in recent years by pensioners, those seeking secondary summer residences and university academia. The real estate market thus remains underexploited in striking contrast with the districts of Urla and √áe≈üme neighboring Seferihisar to the west. Several projected housing projects and the move by Ya≈üar University to its campus in phase of being built in the town are expected to change the present trend of stagnation. rock climbers. √áakmaktepe is the highest point of the district with 680 m. Two streams, Koca√ßay Stream and Hereke Stream cross the district area to join the sea within its boundaries and these generally dry up in summer. Five small dams are built on these streams and their affluents for agricultural irrigation purposes and there are also two artificial lakes built for the same objective. Four small islands depend Seferihisar district and a fifth near Doƒüanbey locality, connected to the mainland by a small causeway but still called √áƒ±fƒ±tkalesi Islet (ancient \\"Myonnesos\\", still also often called as such locally) is a prized location for rock climbers. Economy Since citrus fruits occupy a considerable share in Seferihisar's agricultural production, the district's economy is relatively outward, including international, oriented, and Seferihisar realized exports nearing 10 million US Dollars in 2006. Other notable agricultural products include olives and vegetables, with viniculture and production of flowers grown under greenhouse conditions becoming increasingly important in recent years. Tourism's growing importance is attested by the increase to a total bed capacity of 4,539 for the district as a whole in recent years. Only ten of the district's 1381 enterprises are registered as pursuing industrial activities, with nearly a thousand active in small-scale crafts and trades. Nine companies are registered exporters. There are 12 companies with foreign capital operating in Seferihisar district and among these one, corresponding to a capital of about 5 million US Dollars, was constituted in the last decade. There are four banks providing services through four branches in Seferihisar. The total number of residences in Seferihisar district is 12,146, the part occupied by secondary residences owned by seasonal inhabitants starting to correspond to a significant share in this number. The literacy rate nears hundred per cent and the number of students per teacher is quite comfortable at 16. As a basic indicator of health services, there is one doctor for 1,495 patients. The yearly income level per inhabitant was calculated at 2,693 US Dollars in 2007, well below the national and provincial average. History Kƒ±sƒ±k Peninsula or Lebedos Peninsula to the south of Seferihisar at depending √úrkmez Apart from Teos, a major Ionian port and artistic and cult center, two other ancient settlements datable to the ancient Greek period and beyond are located along Seferihisar district's seashore, both to the south of Teos. Near the southern boundary of the district is Lebedos, the smallest of the twelve original Ionian settlements along the Anatolian coastline. Pausanias mentions that the town was initially inhabited by Carians, for whom the region is normally a very northern one, and that Ionian Greeks immigrated there under the guidance of Andr√¶mon, while Strabo gives the name the colonizing leader as Andropompus and that it previously bore the name of Artis of ancient Lydia. Although it is known to have engaged in maritime commerce, was famous for its mineral springs and a member of the Ionian League, the peninsular settlement of Lebedos suffered from the limited space of its hinterland and a comparatively unsuitable port. It has not been excavated and the visible ruins are scanty. The other settlement, at the edge of a promontory between Teos and Lebedos, referred to by Hecataeus of Miletus (500 BC) as a \\"city\\" and by Artemidorus of Ephesus (100 BC) as merely a \\"place\\" is Myonnesos. The best definition for ancient times must have corresponded to that of a small town, advantaged by a peninsula with a 60 m cliff which was very difficult to access and easy to defend. Traces of Cyclopeian walls attest to the presence of a very particular site and it remains a visitor's attraction due to the challenges of rock climbing it offers. Ottoman records refer to the present-day center town alternatively as \\"Seferihisar\\" or \\"Sivrihisar\\", sometimes leading to confusion with another town in Central Anatolia still named Sivrihisar, and which itself was nevertheless recorded from time to time as \\"Seferihisar\\". While the historic medrese in the depending village of Hereke (D√ºzce today) remained a regional center of learning throughout, on many occasions during the Ottoman period, the region of Seferihisar had made itself notorious as a pirate's lair, being a particularly appreciated hideout and at times a practically autonomous entity. The town is notably the birthplace of two of the best known Turkish corsairs of the very end of the 15th century, Kara Hasan and Kara Turmu≈ü The region was, as such, scarcely populated and development came gradually only in the course of the 19th century, due especially to cultivation of citrus fruits and cash crops. The municipal administration was instituted in 1884 and by the time of the fall of the Empire, the kaza of Seferihisar counted roughly twenty thousand people, in which about half or slightly less, according to varying sources, were Greeks, mostly recent immigrants from the islands or other areas of Asia Minor. Sights of interest The district's most popular sights of interest is its depending small port of Sƒ±ƒüacƒ±k with the Genoese - Ottomans. In 2008 that small port was redesigned by Turkish architect G√ºnay Erdem and Turkish landscape architect Sunay Erdem.] At 2010 construction of this new port ended and revealed its current state as Teos Marina. The ancient city of Teos is located between Seferihisar and Sƒ±ƒüacƒ±k. There is also the rock of Myonnesos and the ruins locally called \\"Karak√∂se\\", both near Doƒüanbey township. The other ancient city found within the district, Lebedos, is located further south, near √úrkmez township. A French vacation village is located near Sƒ±ƒüacƒ±k. Seferihisar district also has several beaches and bays along its 27 km coastline.

The council sponsors the National Jewish Book Awards, the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature, the JBC Network, JBC Book Clubs, the Visiting Scribe series, and Jewish Book Month. It publishes an annual literary journal called Paper Brigade. As of January 1, 1994 the Jewish Book Council broke off from the JCC Association and became an independent not- for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation chartered in the State of New York. Its primary support is from individuals, and from organizations and foundations in the Jewish community.  History  The Council's origins date back to 1925, when Fanny Goldstein, a librarian at the West End Branch of the Boston Public Library, set up an exhibit of Judaic books as a focus of what she called Jewish Book Week. In 1927, with the assistance of Rabbi S. Felix Mendelsohn of Chicago, Jewish communities around the country adopted the event. Jewish Book Week proved so successful that in 1940 the National Committee for Jewish Book Week was founded, with Fanny Goldstein as its chairperson. Dr. Mordecai Soltes succeeded her one-year later. Representatives of major American Jewish organizations served on this committee, as did groups interested in promulgating Yiddish and Hebrew literature. Jewish Book Week activities proliferated and were extended to a one-month period in 1943. At the same time, the National Committee for Jewish Book Week became the Jewish Book Council, reflecting its broader scope. In March of the following year, the National Jewish Welfare Board, which would ultimately become the Jewish Community Centers Association, entered into an agreement with the Book Council to become its official sponsor and coordinating organization, providing financial support and organizational assistance. This arrangement reflected the realization that local JCCs were the primary site of community book fairs. While under the auspices of JCC association, the Jewish Book Council maintained an executive board, composed of representatives from major American Jewish organizations and leading figures in the literary world. From 1942 through 1999, the council published an annual journal called the Jewish Book Annual. The journal reflected on \\"the year‚Äôs events, figures, works, and community interests impacting Jewish literature and literacy.\\" In 1999, the journal transformed into the Jewish Book World, a quarterly magazine that was published through 2015.  Today  On January 1, 1994, the Jewish Book Council became an autonomous organization. Convinced that the Jewish Book Council remained essential to the People of the Book, the Council's executive board voted to create an independent entity. The new organization is a not- for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation chartered in the State of New York. It is supported, to a large degree, by dedicated and interested individuals and foundations in the Jewish community.  Paper Brigade  Jewish Book Council's annual literary magazine, Paper Brigade, is named in honor of the group of writers and intellectuals in the Vilna Ghetto who rescued thousands of Jewish books and documents from Nazi destruction. Each issue provides a 200-page snapshot of the Jewish literary landscape in America and abroad, including essays, fiction, poetry, and visual arts.  JBC Book Clubs  JBC helps book clubs find reading material and discussion questions, whether the book club is formal or informal; social or educational; interested in reading only books of Jewish content, just a few Jewish books throughout the year, or good literature that happens to have Jewish themes.  Jewish Book World  Jewish Book World was a quarterly magazine published by the Jewish Book Council from 1982 to 2015. It was devoted to the promotion of books of Jewish interest. Jewish Book World reached over 5,000 readers with a specific interest in Jewish books, including library professionals, book festival coordinators, book group members, academicians, and lay leaders. The magazine was a tool to help them learn about new books of Jewish interest and make informed reading choices. Often called \\"the Publishers Weekly of Jewish literature\\", Jewish Book World brought the world of Jewish books to interested readers. Jewish Book World began as a twelve-page pamphlet that was circulated to Jewish Community Centers, featuring short blurbs on approximately 50 new books of Jewish interest. In 1994, Jewish Book World expanded from a pamphlet to a full-length magazine that was published three times a year. \\"Jewish Book World\\" appeared quarterly and included reviews of over 120 books per issue, updates on literary events and industry news, author profiles, and articles on the world of Jewish books. Since the discontinuance of Jewish Book World, Jewish Book Council has been publishing online content such as book reviews, author interviews, and excerpts from up-and-coming Jewish books on their website, where readers can found hundreds of new reviews each year.  The Prosenpeople  The Prosenpeople is the Jewish Book Council's blog. It posts book reviews, excerpts, and author interviews. The Prosenpeople also includes the Visiting Scribe series, a portion of the blog which features guest bloggers. These guest bloggers offer voices from the new Jewish literary scene and are most often Jewish Book Network authors.  National Jewish Book Awards  The National Jewish Book Awards is the longest-running North American awards program of its kind in the field of Jewish literature and is recognized as the most prestigious. The awards, presented by category, are designed to give recognition to outstanding books, to stimulate writers to further literary creativity and to encourage the reading of worthwhile titles. The National Jewish Book Awards program began in 1950 when the Jewish Book Council presented awards to authors of Jewish books at its annual meeting. The first book awarded the prize was Philo: Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism, Christianity and Islam by Harry Austryn Wolfson. Among the past notable literary winners are Sonia Levitin, Howard Fast, Chaim Grade, Samuel Heilman, John Hersey, Bernard Malamud, Cynthia Ozick, Chaim Potok, Arthur A. Cohen, Philip Roth, I.B. Singer, Michael Chabon, Lauren Belfer, and Elie Wiesel. In addition to the category awards, every year since 2002, one non- fiction book has been selected as the winner of the Everett Family Foundation Jewish Book of the Year Award. The last winner was Daniel Gordis. With such prominent, influential thinkers participating in the program, the awards have a significant impact on American Jewish cultural life.  JBC Network  The JBC Network is a membership organization of over 120 participating sites, JCCs, synagogues, Hillels, Jewish Federations and other related organizations that host Jewish book programs. Through the Network, the Jewish Book Council is able to provide extensive resources to the program coordinators, including introduction to authors interested in touring Jewish book festivals, advice from experts on topics that affect a book program, and a chance to learn from the experiences of others in the field. Jewish books are an essential part of Jewish culture. Programming for Jewish book events is a vital component. In recent years, the Jewish book festivals have grown into a $3 million industry. The Jewish Book Network goes a long way towards assisting in the preparation of successful events and connecting authors of Jewish interest books with the coordinators of these programs. The Jewish Book Council formed the JBC Network in 1999 to serve as a central address for book programming. It functions on a year-round basis, although the primary focus remains on the Fall Jewish Book Month season. The Jewish Book Council assists with program suggestions and coordinates the speaking tours of more than 260 authors who travel country- wide during the Fall season and throughout the year. The Jewish Book Council annually prepares a book providing information about the authors on tour. Each year the Jewish Book Council sponsors a conference for all JBC Network members and their lay leaders in conjunction with the annual BookExpo America. This conference begins the new season of book festival planning. In addition to workshops and networking among the Network members, the annual conference includes a program called Meet the Author. Through this event, authors are invited to speak to the members of the JBC Network in the hopes of touring and visiting with the Jewish book programs that are represented. Among the authors who were sponsored in the past are Warren Bass, Rich Cohen, Nathan Englander, Samuel G. Freedman, Jonathan Safran Foer, Myla Goldberg, Ari L. Goldman, Rabbi Irving Greenberg, Dara Horn, David Horowitz, Dr. Eric Kandel, Nicole Krauss, Rabbi Harold Kushner, Aaron Lansky, Daniel Libeskind, Tova Mirvis, Dr. Deborah Dash Moore, Judea Pearl, Naomi Ragen, Nessa Rapoport, Shulamit Reinharz, Steven V. Roberts, Jonathan Rosen, Ambassador Dennis Ross, and Dr. Jonathan Sarna.  Sami Rohr Prize  This is an annual $100,000 prize awarded to the finest works of Jewish interest. Established in 2006 by Sami Rohr's descendants on his 80th birthday, it is one of the richest literary prizes in the world. It alternates between fiction and non-fiction.

Geography Towards the coast the district is mainly flat farmland, used for growing vegetables, while the inland half of Serik is forested hills and the Taurus Mountains. The district has a typical Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters, and the natural vegetation is dry shrubs. Serik itself is a town of 129,418 people. The city of Antalya is nearby limiting the potential for retailing and commerce in Serik, but there is some light industry. There is a well-known k√∂fte and piyaz restaurant in the town centre; the piyaz is served with a sesame (tahini) sauce. Although wealthy and only 15 km from the wild amenities on the coast, the people of Serik are typically welcoming and traditional in outlook. The population includes many who still identify themselves as Y√∂r√ºk or Turkmen, descendants of the nomadic people that populated the area during the Ottoman Empire and before. These are close-knit communities shunning outside influence and new immigration, prompting some Turkish people to give it the nickname Capital of a Y√∂r√ºk Republic, an echo of the vivaciously preserved traditions and lifestyle. Although the district has seen a large influx of migrant workers in agriculture and tourism most business in the town is still very much in the hands of these original Turkmen people. They defend their interests fervently and Serik municipality is controlled by the Turkish nationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Tourism With of coastline including the busy resort town of Belek the district of Serik is a major centre of Turkey's tourism industry, attracting 30 million visitors each year. Belek has over fifty 5 star hotels and golf courses. Places of interest include the ruins of Sillion and Aspendos, the cave of Zeytinlita≈ü and U√ßansu waterfall. The 2015 G20 Antalya summit was held in Serik, Antalya. Villages and townsHistory Two important cities here in antiquity were Sillion, a colony of the Kingdom of Pergamon, and Aspendos, one of the most important Greek Pamphylian cities. Aspendos is situated on the point where the Kopru River meets the sea. Once an important port and a commercial centre, it had a reputation for raising the best horses on earth. The odeon, basilica, galleria and fountains are worth seeing. The area was named Serik after a Turkish tribe that settled here, one of many waves of Turkish settlers attracted to this coast throughout history.

Name Other names include Karia (in Latin) and Kƒ±zƒ±lhisar (literally \\"a red castle\\"). The latter is the name given by the Seljuk Turks as there were brick built fortifications here. The name was changed to Serinhisar (literally \\"a cool castle\\") in 1987, apparently because red castle was too symbolic of communism. History The area was first settled by the Hittites in 1500 BC, and later passed into the hands of the Lydians (800 BC), Persians (546 BC), Ancient Greeks (440 BC), Ancient Macedonians (334 BC) and Romans (133 BC). When the Roman Empire was divided in 395 the area remained within the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) and was then possessed by the Seljuk Turks in 1077, who ruled until 1308. Turkmens (from Oghuz Turks' Avsar and Kayi tribe) were settled in the district in this period. Seljuk rule was interrupted by the Crusades, Genghis Khan, and Timurlane, who left the area under the rule of the Germiyan dynasty, from whom it passed to the Ottoman Empire in 1429. The castle fell into ruin in the Ottoman period and was broken up for building materials, being finally demolished in 1954. The battle of Kazƒ±kbeli During the Second Crusade in 1148 the French king was proceeding eastwards having crossed the Menderes River but was stalled at the pass of Kazƒ±kbeli, near Kƒ±zƒ±lhisar, by the Seljuk armies. Serinhisar today Today Serinhisar is known for its leblebi (roasted chick peas), pottery, ropemaking and shoemaking. This is a rural area and its people are hospitable and warmblooded.

It allows for multiple instructions to be dispatched at once regardless of the data dependencies between those instructions. This allows for out-of-order execution to occur which increases the throughput of the microprocessor. Background A superscalar processor allows the execution of a number of instructions simultaneously in the core of the processor itself, although this behavior is not to be confused with a multi-processor system. Most modern processors are superscalar. In a superscalar processor multiple instructions are dispatched from the same thread. Multi-core processors contain multiple processors all executing separate threads. Problems with data dependencies Executing instructions in parallel (i.e. simultaneously) raises problems with data dependencies, meaning that some instructions may be dependent on the results of others, and hence care must be taken to execute in the correct order. Take for example these sequence of instructions: r1 = r2 + r3 r7 = r1 + r4 The update to r7 introduces a (Read After Write) data dependency. The first line of instructions must complete before the second begins execution, as r7 requires the correct value of r1 (register 1) to be known prior to execution. This type of instruction cannot be executed concurrently or simultaneously, the order-of-operations is implicitly serial. How it works With a superscalar processor, the instruction window of the processor fills up with a number of instructions (known as the issue rate). Depending on the scheme that the superscalar processor uses to dispatch these instruction from the window to the execution core of the CPU, there may be problems if there is a dependency not unlike the one shown above. Consider an instruction window 3 instructions wide, containing i1, i2, i3 (instructions 1,2 & 3). Suppose that i2 is dependent on an instruction that has not yet finished executing, and it cannot be executed yet. Without the use of a shelving buffer, the superscalar processor will execute i1, wait until i2 can be executed and then execute i2 and i3 simultaneously. However, with the use of a shelving buffer, the instruction window will be emptied into shelving buffers regardless of contents. The processor will then search for an appropriate number of instructions in the shelving buffers that can be executed in parallel (i.e. with no dependencies). Hence the processor has a greater chance of running the maximum number of instructions simultaneously, and maximising throughput.

L√∂hr served in the Luftwaffe during World War II, rising to commander of Army Group E and then to commander-in-chief in Southeast Europe (OB S√ºdost). L√∂hr was captured by Yugoslav Partisans at the end of the war in Europe. He was tried and convicted of war crimes by the Yugoslav government for anti-partisan reprisals committed under his command, and the bombing of Belgrade in 1941. He was executed by firing squad on 26 February 1947 In Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Early life and career L√∂hr was born on 20 May 1885 in Turnu-Severin in the Kingdom of Romania. He was the youngest child of Friedrich Johann L√∂hr and his wife Catherine, n√©e Heimann. His father had served as a 2nd captain on a hospital ship in the Black Sea during the Russo- Turkish War. Here his father had met his mother, a Jewish-Ukrainian nurse. She was the daughter of the Jewish military doctor Mihail Alexandrovich Heimann from Odessa. After the war, they married in 1879 and moved to Turnu-Severin in Romania. The marriage produced three sons. Due to his mother's faith, he belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church; he grew up speaking German, Russian, French and Romanian. L√∂hr attended a military secondary school in Kaschau, present-day Ko≈°ice in Slovakia until 1900. L√∂hr transferred to the infantry cadet school at Temeswar, present-day Timi»ôoara in Romania, in January 1900. In 1903 he was posted to Vienna, where he attended the Theresian Military Academy in Burg Wiener Neustadt until 1906. He graduated from the military academy on 18 August 1906, with an overall rating of \\"very good\\". On the same day L√∂hr was retired as a second lieutenant and immediately volunteered for active service. L√∂hr served as platoon commander of a pioneer battalion in the Imperial and Royal 85th Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army in World War I. By 1921 L√∂hr had reached the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Between 1921 and 1934 he held many staff positions in the military, including Director of the Air Force in the Federal Armies Ministry. In 1934, he was made Commander of the small Austrian Air Force, a position which he held until the annexation in 1938. World War II Warsaw burning, September 1939 L√∂hr, who had been promoted to Major on 1 July 1920, was accepted into the newly created Austrian Armed Forces on 1 September 1920. On 15 March 1938, L√∂hr was transferred to the Luftwaffe, where he became commander of Luftwaffe forces in Austria. By then he had been promoted to Generalleutnant. He was commander of Luftflotte 4 in the East from May 1939 until June 1942. Luftflotte 4 carried out the bombing of Warsaw, Poland in September 1939 and of Belgrade, Yugoslavia in April 1941. L√∂hr had developed a plan to bomb Belgrade with incendiary bombs first, so that the fires would help the second, nighttime, attack to find the targets. This cost thousands of people their lives. L√∂hr was promoted to colonel general effective 3 May 1941. He commanded the 12th Army from 12 July 1942 through to December 1942. Commander-in-Chief South East  L√∂hr succeeded General der Pioniere Walter Kuntze as Commander-in- Chief of the 12th Army on 3 July 1942. He was appointed the Wehrmacht Commander in southeast Europe on 1 August 1942, and from 28 December 1942 this position was re-designated as Commander-in-chief in southeast Europe. The forces under his command were also designated as Army Group E, and he was appointed as its commander. In this role, L√∂hr controlled all subordinate commands in southeast Europe, including the commanding general in Serbia (Paul Bader), the military commander in the Salonika-Aegean area, the military commander in southern Greece, the commander of Crete, the naval commander in the Aegean Sea, the German plenipotentiary general in the Independent State of Croatia, the commanding general of German troops in Croatia, and the military attach√© in Sofia, Bulgaria. L√∂hr organised the fourth and fifth offensives against Yugoslav Partisans in 1943, during which most of those taken prisoner, including the wounded, were murdered on the spot. As Commander-in-Chief of Army Group E, L√∂hr oversaw the Dodecanese campaign. On 26 August 1944, with the Allies driving on Germany on three fronts, Hitler ordered L√∂hr to begin evacuating Army Group E from Greece and move north to defend the Fatherland. At the end of the war in Europe, L√∂hr received orders for unconditional surrender, but instead directed his forces to break out towards Austria. According to the historian Jozo Tomasevich, L√∂hr was captured by the 14th Slovene Division in Slovenia on 9 May 1945, and attempted to negotiate passage for his troops to Austria. This was refused and L√∂hr was prevailed upon to issue orders to cease fighting, which the troops nonetheless disobeyed. He escaped, countermanded his order to surrender and continued with the breakout attempt. After an intense manhunt, L√∂hr was recaptured on 13 May. Conviction and execution L√∂hr was imprisoned by Yugoslavia from 15 May 1945 to 26 February 1947. He was tried and convicted for war crimes committed during the anti-partisan operations of 1943, including the killing of hostages and burning of villages, and disregarding Germany's unconditional surrender. He was executed by firing squad on 26 February 1947 in Belgrade. Also sentenced to death and executed by hanging were the SS commander August Schmidhuber and the high-ranking Wehrmacht officers Johann Fortner, , G√ºnther Tribukait, and others.

This initiality provides a general framework for induction and recursion.  Examples = Functor 1+X  Consider the endofunctor F: \\\\mathbf{Set} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Set} sending X to 1+X, where 1 is the one-point (singleton) set, the terminal object in the category. An algebra for this endofunctor is a set X (called the carrier of the algebra) together with a function f: (1+X) \\\\to X. Defining such a function amounts to defining a point x\\\\in X and a function X\\\\to X. Define : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{zero} \\\\colon 1 &\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{N} \\\\ * &\\\\longmapsto 0 \\\\end{align} and : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{succ}\\\\colon \\\\mathbf{N}&\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbf{N} \\\\ n &\\\\longmapsto n + 1. \\\\end{align} Then the set \\\\mathbf{N} of natural numbers together with the function [\\\\operatorname{zero},\\\\operatorname{succ}]\\\\colon 1+\\\\mathbf{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{N} is an initial F-algebra. The initiality (the universal property for this case) is not hard to establish; the unique homomorphism to an arbitrary F-algebra (A, [e,f]), for e\\\\colon 1 \\\\to A an element of A and f\\\\colon A \\\\to A a function on A, is the function sending the natural number n to f^n(e), that is, f(f(\\\\dots(f(e))\\\\dots)), the n-fold application of f to e. The set of natural numbers is the carrier of an initial algebra for this functor: the point is zero and the function is the successor function.  Functor 1+\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\times(-)  For a second example, consider the endofunctor 1+\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\times(-) on the category of sets, where \\\\mathbf{N} is the set of natural numbers. An algebra for this endofunctor is a set X together with a function (1+\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\times X) \\\\to X. To define such a function, we need a point x\\\\in X and a function \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\times X\\\\to X. The set of finite lists of natural numbers is an initial algebra for this functor. The point is the empty list, and the function is cons, taking a number and a finite list, and returning a new finite list with the number at the head. In categories with binary coproducts, the definitions just given are equivalent to the usual definitions of a natural number object and a list object, respectively. Final coalgebra Dually, a final coalgebra is a terminal object in the category of F-coalgebras. The finality provides a general framework for coinduction and corecursion. For example, using the same functor 1+(-) as before, a coalgebra is defined as a set X together with a function f: X \\\\to (1+X). Defining such a function amounts to defining a partial function whose domain is formed by those x \\\\in X for which f(x) belongs to 1. Such a structure can be viewed as a chain of sets, X_{0} on which f' is not defined, X_{1} which elements map into X_{0} by f', X_{2} which elements map into X_{1} by f', etc., and X_{\\\\omega} containing the remaining elements of X. With this in view, the set \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cup {\\\\omega} consisting of the set of natural numbers extended with a new element \\\\omega is the carrier of the final coalgebra in the category, where f' is the predecessor function (the inverse of the successor function) on the positive naturals, but acts like the identity on the new element \\\\omega: f(n+1) = n, f(\\\\omega) = \\\\omega. This set \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cup {\\\\omega} that is the carrier of the final coalgebra of 1+(-) is known as the set of conatural numbers. For a second example, consider the same functor 1 + \\\\mathbf{N}\\\\times(\\\\mathord{-}) as before. In this case the carrier of the final coalgebra consists of all lists of natural numbers, finite as well as infinite. The operations are a test function testing whether a list is empty, and a deconstruction function defined on non-empty lists returning a pair consisting of the head and the tail of the input list.  Theorems  * Initial algebras are minimal (i.e., have no proper subalgebra). * Final coalgebras are simple (i.e., have no proper quotients).  Use in computer science  Various finite data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors. While there may be several initial algebras for a given endofunctor, they are unique up to isomorphism, which informally means that the \\"observable\\" properties of a data structure can be adequately captured by defining it as an initial algebra. To obtain the type \\\\mathrm{List}(A) of lists whose elements are members of set A, consider that the list-forming operations are: *\\\\mathrm{nil}\\\\colon 1 \\\\to \\\\mathrm{List}(A) *\\\\mathrm{cons}\\\\colon A \\\\times \\\\mathrm{List}(A) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{List}(A) Combined into one function, they give: *[\\\\mathrm{nil},\\\\mathrm{cons}]\\\\colon (1 + A \\\\times \\\\mathrm{List}(A))\\\\to \\\\mathrm{List}(A), which makes this an F-algebra for the endofunctor F sending X to 1+(A\\\\times X). It is, in fact, the initial F-algebra. Initiality is established by the function known as foldr in functional programming languages such as Haskell and ML. Likewise, binary trees with elements at the leaves can be obtained as the initial algebra *[\\\\mathrm{tip},\\\\mathrm{join}]\\\\colon A + (\\\\mathrm{Tree}(A) \\\\times \\\\mathrm{Tree}(A)) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Tree}(A). Types obtained this way are known as algebraic data types. Types defined by using least fixed point construct with functor F can be regarded as an initial F-algebra, provided that parametricity holds for the type.Philip Wadler: Recursive types for free! University of Glasgow, July 1998. Draft. In a dual way, similar relationship exists between notions of greatest fixed point and terminal F-coalgebra, with applications to coinductive types. These can be used for allowing potentially infinite objects while maintaining strong normalization property. In the strongly normalizing (each program terminates) Charity programming language, coinductive data types can be used for achieving surprising results, e.g. defining lookup constructs to implement such ‚Äústrong‚Äù functions like the Ackermann function.Robin Cockett: Charitable Thoughts (ps.gz)  See also  * Algebraic data type * Catamorphism * Anamorphism  Notes  External links  * Categorical programming with inductive and coinductive types by Varmo Vene * Recursive types for free! by Philip Wadler, University of Glasgow, 1990-2014. * Initial Algebra and Final Coalgebra Semantics for Concurrency by J.J.M.M.

In the game, the player is guided by film director Steven Spielberg (appearing as himself) through the process of moviemaking, including scriptwriting, filming, and editing, using pre-generated film clips featuring Jennifer Aniston, Quentin Tarantino, Katherine Helmond, and Penn & Teller, among others. The game features advice from Hollywood professionals such as editor Michael Kahn, special effects supervisor Michael Lantieri, and cinematographer Dean Cundey. The game was produced by Roger Holzberg, who directed Spielberg in scenes in which Spielberg himself appeared.Joseph McBride, Steven Spielberg: A Biography Second Edition (2012), p. 431.  Plot  The player begins with a small budget and a personal assistant who provides guidance. Spielberg gives a pep talk to the player before the first feature can be made. Ted and Terry (or Terry and Ted) offer the player useful suggestions on changing the film's script. Delays can occur during the filmmaking process. Ultimately, the player works with actor Quentin Tarantino and actress Jennifer Aniston, as well as Penn & Teller. Cinematographer Dean Cundey also works on the player's film to keep it within budget. The film is then edited by the player, who can choose which angles to use, and can add sound effects and a soundtrack. Spielberg then presents the film at its premiere. The studio sometimes offers the player a chance to make the film again with a larger budget. Script and shot options increase as the player advances in experience. The short film within the game concerns a prisoner on death row (Tarantino) sentenced to death for the killing of an old lady (Katherine Helmond). His partner (Aniston) sets out to clear his name by investigating a pair of sinister magicians (Penn & Teller).  Reception  Computer Gaming World rated the game two and a half stars out of five.

It had 68,020 population in 2010. It neighbours are Germencik from north-east, Ko√ßarlƒ± from east, Milas from south-east, Didim from south- west, Aegean Sea from west and Ku≈üadasƒ± from northwest. Etymology Modern S√∂ke is identified with the ancient Greek city of Anaia () (also referred to as Anea, Anaea, Annaea or Annaia), which named after the Amazon Anaea (·ºàŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ±). Later, it was also called Sokia (). As of 1920, the British were calling it Sokia. Anaia is also the name of a titular see (Anaea) of the Catholic and Orthodox churches. From 1833 to 1922, it was the seat of the Diocese of Anea of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. After that date, the demographics of the population changed and Orthodox Christians declined in number in the area.  Geography  The district lies between the Aegean coast and the edge of the fertile alluvial plain of the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River. Lake Bafa is to the south of the district. The plain contains much rich agricultural land; it is one of Turkey's largest cotton-growing areas and also important for the commodities of wheat and flour. Other income comes from handicrafts, forestry and fishing. S√∂ke is Turkey's only exporter of culinary snails. S√∂ke is a large town in the centre of the Aegean region, and the market town is at the heart of an agricultural district. Although secondary to the nearby centres of tourism on the coast, Ku≈üadasƒ±, Didim and Bodrum, S√∂ke does catch passing trade from the tourist visitors to the area, including visitors to the nearby historical site of Priene. There are a number of amenities on the highway for tourists passing through from Izmir airport to the coast, including restaurants, service stations, and outlet stores. The local cuisine includes √ß√∂p ≈üi≈ü (a shish kebab of small pieces of lamb) and pide (a flat bread pizza). S√∂ke is a town of 62,000 people.  History  Settled for centuries before the Common Era, the region was called Aneon () and was inhabited by Greeks. Stephanus of Byzantium, quoting Ephorus, mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea was at the city. During the Peloponnesian War, some Samian exiles migrated there. In addition, Thucydides mentioned that there was a naval station, and it was near enough to annoy Samos.ANNAEA or ANAEA In 1426 the city was captured by the Ottoman Empire Turks as the remaining capital of the Sanjak of Mente≈üe. According to the 1914 Ottoman population statistics, the district of Karaburun had a total population of 36.976, consisting of 20.028 Muslims, 16.720 Greeks, 133 Armenians, and 95 Jews.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 174-175 In 18 May 1919, Italian troops landed at S√∂ke. The Allies were afraid that the Italian landing might provoke trouble with the Greek troops, who were near Smyrna. Although Italy and Greece were allies during WWI, their relations were not good. After the end of World War I, fighting continued in a power struggle after the break-up of the Ottoman Empire. In 1920, large Turkish and Arab forces were fighting against the Italian forces. In April 1922 Italian troops were withdrawn and Greek troops entered the area. After the defeat of the Greek army in the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922), Greek troops was withdrawn, and Turkish troops entered in September 1922. Greek inhabitants of the area evacuated to Greece together with the Greek army or they were killed by the advancing Turkish troops. The Turkish resistance in the area was led by one Cafer Efe; a statue was erected later here to commemorate him. During the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s, the Greek Christian population migrated to the Greek part of Crete and the Cretan Muslims moved here. Economy S√∂ke has a history of mining lignite. During World War I, it was producing large amounts of lignite.

During the Second World War, the airfield was used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force. It was assigned USAAF designation Station 112, station code \\"BV\\", later changed to \\"BZ\\".  Royal Air Force use Bovingdon was built in 1941‚Äì42 as a standard Class A RAF bomber airfield. The main NE/SW runway was long and the two secondary runways were each long. Over 30 dispersal hardstandings were built. On 15 June 1942, No. 7 Group, RAF Bomber Command took up residence at Bovingdon. Operational missions were flown in June and July by the RAF until the field was turned over to the USAAF in August.  United States Army Air Forces use USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Bovingdon were: * 1st Combat Crew Replacement Group : 11th Combat Crew Replacement Unit * 328th Service Group (VIII Air Force Service Command) : 347th Service Squadron; HHS 328th Service Group * 18th Weather Squadron * 26th Station Complement Squadron * Headquarters & Headquarters Squadron (VIII Fighter Command) Regular Army Station Units included: * 1054th Signal Company * 1071st Quartermaster Company * 1787th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 978th Military Police Company * 2128th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon American military journalists undergoing combat flight training for bombing missions in 1943. Left to right: Gladwin Hill, William Wade, Robert Post, Walter Cronkite, Homer Bigart, and Paul Manning. The primary mission of Bovingdon was to support Eighth Air Force Headquarters and the Air Technical Section, both equipped with a variety of aircraft types. General Eisenhower's personal B-17 was housed on the base. During World War II, several film stars were assigned at one time or another to the base, including Clark Gable, James Stewart and William Holden. Among famous wartime visitors were Bob Hope, Frances Langford, Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt, and Glenn Miller. A unique mission undertaken at Bovingdon was the training of United States journalists to cover the air war over Occupied Europe. A group of military journalists underwent training in February 1943 to fly high-altitude missions in bombers, to shoot the flexible machine guns (although they did not actually fire them in combat), as well as parachute and life support training as aircrew. The group of journalists flew on a combat mission over Wilhelmshaven, Germany on 26 February 1943 to attack the German Naval submarine pens there. The mission saw heavy losses for the USAAF, and the aircraft of Andy Rooney of the Stars and Stripes was damaged by flak and Robert Post of the New York Times was killed in action when his B-24 exploded. This ended the training of journalists to fly along with Eighth Air Force bomber crews. Other journalists who underwent this training included Walter Cronkite, James Denton Scott, Homer Bigart, William Wade and Gladwin Hill.  92nd Bombardment Group (Heavy)  Ground crew of the 92nd Bomb Group load bombs into a B-17 Flying Fortress (AAF Ser. No. 41-9148) nicknamed \\"Boomerang\\" at Bovingdon, 17 October 1942. The first USAAF tenant at Bovingdon was the 92nd Bombardment Group (Heavy), being deployed from Sarasota Army Air Field, Florida. The group was known as \\"Fame's Favorite Few\\", and it was assigned to the 40th Combat Bombardment Wing at RAF Thurleigh. The group tail code was a \\"Triangle B\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 325th Bombardment Squadron (NV) * 326th Bombardment Squadron (JW) * 327th Bombardment Squadron (UX) * 407th Bombardment Squadron (PY) The group flew a few two combat missions in September and October 1942, then was assigned the role of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Combat Crew Replacement Unit (CCRU). In January 1943, it was transferred to RAF Alconbury where it was became an operational combat group.  11th Combat Crew Replacement Unit  Although the 92nd Bomb Group departed for Alconbury, the 326th Bomb Squadron of the 92nd remained at Bovingdon to form the core of 11th Combat Crew Replacement Unit. The training was performed on the B-17E aircraft, and most combat crews of 8th Air Force bombing units for the balance of the war received their introduction before moving on to their operational bases. Although based at Bovingdon, the 326th remained under the operational control of the 92nd at Alconbury until May 1943. In September 1944 the 11th CCRU was disbanded and Bovingdon became the base for the European Air Transport Service (EATS). Many thousands of Americans returned to the States via the air terminal.  Postwar uses  After the war, Bovingdon was returned to RAF control on 15 April 1947. The British Ministry of Civil Aviation obtained the airfield for civilian airline use. On 15 September 1949, Bovingdon was the start point for a successful record air speed attempt by a de Havilland Hornet to and from Gibraltar. Because of its elevation of about 160 metres, Bovingdon was often clear when Heathrow Airport and RAF Northolt were fog-bound; during the winter months especially, Bovingdon was used by British European Airways (BEA). British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) used Bovingdon as a maintenance facility and numerous other independent aircraft operators used the former technical site during the postwar years. During the 1950s both civilian and military organizations used Bovingdon. The proximity of the USAF Third Air Force Headquarters at RAF South Ruislip and HQ RAF Fighter Command at Bentley Priory made Bovingdon the ideal location for service aircraft. The USAF returned to Bovingdon on 25 May 1951, with the establishment of the 7531st Air Base Squadron. Douglas C-47 Skytrains were assigned to the unit, however many transitory USAF planes used the airfield routinely. In addition, the RAF operated the Fighter Command Communication Squadron RAF on the base. In October 1962, the USAF departed from Bovingdon. During the 60s, RAF Transport Command (Southern Communication Squadron RAF) operated Anson, Devon, Pembroke and latterly Basset aircraft from Bovingdon. In the 1960s the base was home to the last flight of Anson Mk 21 aircraft, descended from a World War II design. The Air Training Corps 617 Gliding School operated from Bovingdon between 1968 and 1970; the last flight by a military aircraft was by Kirby Cadet Mk.3 glider XN246 on 25 Oct 1970. The school had moved from RAF Hendon in 1968, but moved on to RAF Manston in 1971. In 1968 the airfield was used to store and dispose of several aircraft used in the making of the film \\"Battle of Britain\\". Recently it has been used as the location for the Masked Singer reality show. Closure and civilian use In 1968, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced that Bovingdon would be closed for budgetary reasons, and in 1972 the airfield was shut down, although from World War II to present day, the runway, 650m long √ó 49m wide, on Berry Farm has continuously been used for light aircraft activities. Berry Farm is owned separately by the Webb family and is unconnected to the part of the original airfield where the land has been used for various other uses, including the market. In 2012 Dacorum Borough Council confirmed that the Berry Farm stretch of runway 08/26 remains a legally active airfield for light aircraft operation. In the early 1980s, flying returned to the airfield, first with hang-glider tow-launching (using a truck-mounted pay-out winch) and then microlight aircraft, mainly of the 'Trike/hang-glider' type. Some local residents complained on the grounds of noise and danger. After a local inquiry, the Ombudsman narrowly decided against allowing flying to continue. At that time the combined control tower and fire-tender garage were in 'reasonable structural condition' but deliberately damaged a few years later by earthmoving equipment, thereafter making restoration highly unlikely. The remains of the control tower were demolished in August 2010. An area of the former technical site was transferred to HM Prison Service for use as a prison, called 'The Mount' which opened in 1987. The airfield site still houses a VOR navigational beacon, code BNN. The airspace above the airfield and nearby Chesham is known as the Bovingdon stack and is a holding area for aircraft approaching Heathrow Airport, to the south. Aircraft are requested to join the hold, typically at an altitude of 7000‚Äì16000 feet, and then to fly a 'race-track' pattern around the Bovingdon VOR beacon, separated at vertical intervals of 1000 feet from other aircraft. Each aircraft is then instructed to descend to a lower available altitude as the lowest aircraft leaves the hold to make its final approach to Heathrow. At busy times there may be up to 10 aircraft holding at the available 1000 foot separations between 7000 feet and 16000 feet, and these may be seen circling overhead on a clear day. The remainder of the airfield site is used for a regular Saturday market and there was also a permanent circuit for banger racing which closed in September 2008. The main runway and taxiways are still intact though in a poor state of repair, but are also used for other events such as autojumbles and classic car shows. Alongside a runway is a Delta Force Paintballing facility. The ruins of the control tower also remain. Film and television appearances In the 1960s, Bovingdon was used in the production of four World War II films, The War Lover (1962); 633 Squadron (1964) Battle of Britain (1969) and Mosquito Squadron (1969). Although flying ceased at the airfield in 1969, it was also used to film parts of the flying car scenes in the James Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun starring Roger Moore, when the palm trees fold down as it takes off as well as some flying scenes for the film Hanover Street which were shot there in 1978. The site was also used in the 2016 Star Wars film Rogue One, representing the planet Scarif. On television it served as the location for at least one black and white episode of The Avengers \\"The Hour That Never Was\\", starring Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg featuring Gerald Harper and Roy Kinnear as well as the 1980 Blake's 7 episode The Harvest of Kairos as the surface of the planet Kairos. An airstrip at the airfield is also reputed to have been used in the opening credits of the 1967 television series The Prisoner in which Patrick McGoohan is seen driving a Lotus Super Seven car past the camera at speed. The control tower and airfield was the filming location for the 1981 movie Silver Dream Racer starring David Essex and Beau Bridges. In the movie, the montage scene before the final race shows Essex and Christina Raines training for the forthcoming grand prix. It has continued to be used in various TV shows up to the present day. Since January 2018, Bovingdon is the filming location of ITV's Dancing on Ice where a full-size studio has been built for the series. The airfield has also been used in the production of the film Bohemian Rhapsody, as the production crew were required to recreate the 1985 Live Aid set.https://investhemel.co.uk/2018/10/fine-tuning-bohemian- rhapsody-at-bovingdon/ Major units assigned ; Royal Air Force * No. 150 Staging Post RAF (9 Aug 1946 - 18 Feb 1947) * Flying Training Command Communication Squadron RAF (9 Jul 1947 - 30 Jun 1963) * Bomber Command Communication Squadron RAF (31 Mar - 30 Jun 1963) * Bomber/Fighter/Coastal Command Communication Squadron RAF (30 Jun - 1 Aug 1963) * Southern Communication Squadron RAF (1 Aug 1963 - 1 Jan 1969) * No. 617 Volunteer Gliding School RAF (1968 - Sep 1969) * Strike Command Communication Squadron RAF (1 - 27 Jan 1969) ; United States Army Air Forces * 92d Bombardment Group, ( 18 Aug 1942 - 6 Jan 1943) * 11th Combat Crew Replacement Unit, (Jan 1943 - Sep 1944) * 92d Bombardment Group, ( 18 Aug 1942 - 6 Jan 1943) * 1402nd Air Base Group (Oct 1944 - Apr 1946) ; United States Air Force * 7531st Air Base Squadron (25 May 1951 - 1962) * 2130 Communications Group (1961 to 1991) See also *List of former Royal Air Force stations References=CitationsBibliography * Maurer Maurer, Air Force Combat Units of World War II, Office of Air Force History, 1983 * Freeman, Roger A., Airfields of the Eighth, Then And Now, 1978 * Freeman, Roger A., The Mighty Eighth, The Colour Record, 1991 * Maurer Maurer, Air Force Combat Units of World War II, Office of Air Force History, 1983 * USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers-- 1908 to present External links * Control Towers - RAF Bovingdon Category:Royal Air Force stations in Hertfordshire Category:Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom Category:Installations of the United States Air Force in the United Kingdom Category:Military installations closed in 1972 Category:Dacorum Category:Airfields of the VIII Bomber Command in the United Kingdom Category:Hemel Hempstead ","title":"RAF Bovingdon"},{"id":"4116560","text":"Memi≈ü Agha Mansion in S√ºrmene S√ºrmene (Greek: Œ£ŒøœçœÅŒºŒµŒΩŒ±, Sourmena; Ottoman Turkish: Ô∫≥ÔªÆÿ±Ôª£Ôª®Ôª™, romanized as S√ºrmena[/e]) is a town and a district of Trabzon Province in the Black Sea region of Turkey. In ancient times nearby was the town of Hyssus or Hyssos () and Issiporto. The mayor is Rahmi √úst√ºn (AKP). The little town of S√ºrmene (Hamurgan) is situated some east of Trabzon. Known in antiquity also as Susarmia or Augustopolis, it lies on the River Kora (Manahoz Deresi) and is best known as the place where Xenophon and his Ten Thousand fell sick after eating wild honey, an event which was confirmed by the local people. In the village of S√ºrmene Kastil, to the west of S√ºrmene, stands a ruined medieval castle as well as the impressive 18th century Yakupoƒülu Konaƒüƒ± mansion (Derebeyli Kale). It was formerly the seat of the Yakupoƒülu family, who lived here as rulers (derebey) of the surrounding region relatively free of interference from the Sublime Porte in Istanbul. Economy Historically, S√ºrmene had produced small amounts of manganese. The area also had mineral springs, and shipped bottled water to Istanbul. Education Surmene county has had a lot educational institution since the first years of the Republic. As of today, S√ºrmene has a faculty (Surmene KTU Faculty of Marine Sciences), five vocational high schools, a high school and an Anatolian high school. In addition, there are many primary schools in the county. Also there is a student dormitory for university students' shelter in the county. Social life Surmene is one of the towns which have managed to become the leader of the Eastern Black Sea in terms of social life. In the years when the population number reached ten thousands there were 2 long-serving cinemas. Also before the construction of the Black Sea Coastal Road especially in summer months there had been a vivid social life. At that time the dynamism in the streets used to last to 02:00 a.m and the town used to present a vivid turism center. The extreme settlement which began in the year of 1955 caused the town to face with the same problem of the large cities: ‚Äò‚Äôunplanned urbanization‚Äô‚Äô. And the same problem exist today. And also in long terms of construction, people living away from home got disturbed by the construction sounds and they gave up coming back to their homelands and this led to a downfall in the tourism receipts. In this context, the population of the town which is 13.000 today, it can not grow a significant rise in the summer moths. There are several sports club operating in various branches and a folk association. And also S√ºrmene Beneficial Association and S√ºrmene Culture and Tourism Association named Istanbul centered local civil society organizations are active in S√ºrmene. Even though there are many elementary and middle schools there is no alumni association for these schools.

Background and education Goschen was born at Eltham, England, the twelfth child and sixth son of Wilhelm Heinrich G√∂schen, originally of Leipzig, Saxony, and Henrietta Ohmann, who was born in London. At the time of his birth his father was 54. The Liberal Unionist politician Lord Goschen was Goschen's elder brother. He was educated at Rugby and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He twice represented Oxford at real tennis, played five matches of first-class cricket as a right-handed batsman for the University of Oxford and throughout his life was a keen sportsman. Diplomatic service Goschen entered the Diplomatic Service in 1869 and after an initial few months at the Foreign Office he served in Madrid, as Third Secretary in Buenos Aires, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Constantinople, Peking, Copenhagen as secretary to the legation, (1888‚Äì1890), Lisbon as secretary to the legation, Washington (1893‚Äì1894) as secretary and Saint Petersburg (1895‚Äì1898). Ambassador to Belgrade Goschen was offered the Belgrade legation and took up post in Serbia in September 1899. He was later to recall that his only instructions from the Foreign Secretary Lord Salisbury was to \\"keep [an] eye [on] King Milan\\". He remained in Serbia until 1900. Ambassador to Copenhagen According to Goschen himself he was initially less than happy to be offered the Copenhagen Legation. \\"Oh dear, oh dear! I am not thrilled and later accepted but with misgivings\\". He served as Minister to Denmark from 1900 until 1905 and although recognising the posting as something of a diplomatic backwater he at least revelled in the social aspects of his position. Ambassador to Vienna Goschen's appointment as Ambassador to Austria-Hungary was seemingly made at the behest of King Edward VII. Goschen most probably expected the Vienna posting to be his last but the imminent retirement of Sir Frank Lascelles at the Berlin embassy posed problems for the Foreign Secretary. Ambassador to Berlin Finding a successor for Lascelles was not easy. Berlin made it clear that Sir Arthur Nicolson would be unacceptable as the successor and although the Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Charles Hardinge had initially favoured Fairfax Cartwright, the Minister at Munich, he was in his turn vetoed by the Germans who wanted a public figure. Eventually a reluctant Kaiser was persuaded to accept Goschen. In Goschen's last conversation with the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg before asking for his passports, on 4 August 1914, Bethmann famously expressed his astonishment that England would go to war for \\"a scrap of paper\\" (the 1839 treaty guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality). Sir Edward Goschen Fund During World War I, Goschen established a relief fund for British citizens still living in Germany who had lost their means of income and for British POWs being held prisoner in Germany. The fund was primarily administered through the United States Consular Service, now the United States Foreign Service.

They had two sons, Edward Henry Goschen born in 1877 and George Gerard Goschen born in 1887. Lady Goschen died in February 1912. In later life he became an enthusiastic if untalented violinist. He notes in his diary playing duets with the German Crown Prince in 1910. Goschen died in Chelsea, London, in May 1924, aged 76, and was succeeded in his title by his eldest son, Edward Henry Goschen.

It is 2121 meters high and on a 100,000-hectare area with 20,000 hectares of new planting parts. Paragliding and trekking are some of the activities you can do on Mt. ≈ûaphane. Kocaseyfullah Mosque is one of our historical spots with its age dating back to 700 years. It is inherited from Anatolian Seljuks. We also have Agha Mansions on which some investments can be directed. We have profitable thermal water sources in Karacaderbent ward of ≈ûaphane where some thermal villages, hotels and physical therapy clinic projects can be done. MEDICINAL HERB On Mount ≈ûaphane, There is a variety of medicinal herbs like thyme, sage, linden tree, ‚ÄúAyvadanasƒ±‚Äù, ‚ÄúFilistan‚Äù herb, nigella sativa, urtica dioica, daisy, papaverum rhoaes, sand rose etc. and many kinds of unexplored plant families. CHERRY AND SOUR CHERRY In the district, cherry and sour cherry are cultivated using waterless agricultural methods. There is a quality policy over world standards with 2000 tons of cherry and 7000 tons of sour cherry exported. The district is open for investments for both industry ( fruit juice ‚Äì concentrate ‚Äì marmalade ‚Äì jam) and export. Mines=ALUM There is alum mine in the district and the mine area is possessed by Dostel Inc. and it gives 50,000 tons of total production amount per year. ALUMINIUM SULPHATE 65000 tons of aluminium sulfate (Al2So4) has been produced by Dostel Inc. in the district. This product is sold mainly to ƒ∞SKƒ∞ and ASKƒ∞. It is also purchased by metropolitan municipalities and standard municipalities‚Äô water authority units and paper factories.

Bronze Age artefacts from 1200BC have been found in ƒ∞ƒüde Baƒülarƒ± (Araplƒ±), showing that mining took place here and also that there were trading links between Thrace and the Aegean coast.

The Greek villages of Heraklea (Eriklice) (), Ch√≥ra (Ho≈ük√∂y) (), G√°nos (Ganoz) (), Byzanthe-Panion (Barbaros) () later fell into the hands of the Romans. Then under Byzantine rule Thrace was subject to wave on wave of invaders coming via the Balkans; Huns, Slavs, Bulgars, the Crusaders.

Towards the beginning of 1913, the authorities exacted from the inhabitants payment for the upkeep of the Turkish fleet. Also, imposed further contribution from the Christians for the construction of Government buildings, a Turkish school, telephonic communications, national defence, etc. At the same time the most rigorous boycott was exercised, for the purpose to bring famine the dispersion to the Christian Communities. In addition, the importation of provisions into the town was prohibited under the penalty of death and no communication between the town and the other communities was allowed, and as another precaution the boats were rendered useless by the removal of the oars. The coast was occupied briefly by Bulgarian forces on December 22, 1912 during the Balkan Wars, and again in 1920-22 by Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War, this time with the support of the local Greek and Armenian people. ≈ûark√∂y was a district in Thrace province between 1922-1926 before returning to Tekirdaƒü province. The area today ≈ûark√∂yhttp://www.sarkoyweb.com and M√ºrefte are small country towns providing the surrounding villages with amenities such as medical care and high schools. 90% of the land is cultivated, vineyards and olive groves near the coast, with sunflowers, wheat, barley and tobacco inland. ≈ûark√∂y has the longest beach in Turkey, the 12th longest in the world, which was dirty but has been cleaned up now and in 2006 was awarded a blue flag. The district includes 60 km of coastline for tourism, fishing and prawn fishing. And it is possible to take a motorboat from here to Av≈üa or Marmara Island. With all this to offer ≈ûark√∂y is naturally popular with holidaymakers from Istanbul. There are hotels and guest houses in the town of ≈ûark√∂y, but not enough to fill the demand in summertime. There are also compounds of holiday flats for summer residents. The town has a little jetty and pretty narrow lanes. The night-life and cuisine of the towns are not top-class. ≈ûark√∂y attracts Istanbul's Population coming on family holidays, because it is not so far from ƒ∞stanbul away. There are bars and discos playing a variety of different musics, and places among the rocks for the young or young at heart to creep off and drink beer and Raki.

History  Shavshat was a part of a province of Greater Armenia - Gugark. After 387 this land was a part of Marzpan Iberia (vassal of Iran). After this, in IX century it was one of the Georgian princedoms in the constellation of several polities which is conventionally known as Tao-Klarjeti in Georgian. The princedom of Shavsheti included today's districts of ≈ûav≈üat, Bor√ßka, and Murgul in Turkey and Lower Machakheli in Adjara (Georgia). The fortress above the town is primarily of Georgian construction and probably dates from the 9th century A.D., when it was rebuilt by Adarnase I of Iberia. The site has an impressive circuit wall with strategically placed towers and rooms, including two small chapels. In 1983 the fortress was surveyed and three years later an accurate scaled plan and description were published.Robert W. Edwards, ‚ÄúThe Fortifications of Artvin: A Second Preliminary Report on the Marchlands of Northeast Turkey,‚Äù Dumbarton Oaks Papers 40, 1986, pp.174-76, pls.31-43. This lasted until it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1547. Following the Russo- Turkish War (1877-1878) ≈ûav≈üat was among the territories ceded to Russia, and was returned to the new Republic of Turkey in 1921. It was briefly bounded to Ardahan Province between 27 February 1921 and 7 July 1921. People living in Shavsheti and Imerkhevi are Muslim Georgians.  Geography  Like most districts of Artvin this is a beautiful hilly area surrounded by high mountains on all sides, including the Kar√ßkal mountains to the west, and watered by many mountain streams and pools. There are trout in the largest, ≈ûav≈üat Karag√∂l lake and a number of mineral water springs. The area has a cold inland climate, somewhat tempered by being above the Black Sea coast, but at these altitudes winter lasts a long time; it snows from November to April. The mountains are covered with pine forest, with some broadleaf forest at lower elevations. In this landscape there is little agricultural land, no industry and the only real potential income is from tourism (people on trekking holidays), herding animals on the mountainside and beekeeping. There are some fruit trees (mainly pears and apples) and some potatoes are grown in the √áoruh River valley floor. Of the land area 13% can be planted while 27% is used for grazing, 42% is forest and 17% is high mountain. The town of ≈ûav≈üat is small (population 7,325) and has few amenities.  Climate  The climate in ≈ûav≈üat is a mild/cool summer subtype (K√∂ppen: Dfb) of the humid continental climate.

PA 115 was designated in 1928 to run from Montoursville east to Swiftwater; the route was designated PA 15 for a year prior to that. In 1935, the east end was realigned from Swiftwater to Saylorsburg. By 1937, the termini were moved from Montoursville to Mausdale and from Saylorsburg to Easton. PA 115 was extended west to Milton by 1950. The northern terminus was realigned to Hughesville by 1960, the same time a portion of the route from Saylorsburg to Wind Gap was relocated to a freeway alignment. PA 115's northern terminus was cut back to the Wilkes-Barre area in 1961. The southern terminus was rolled back to Brodheadsville by 1972. PA 115 has had its northern terminus in various locations in the Wilkes-Barre area from 1962 to 1990; finally being moved to its current location in 1990. Route description PA 115 northbound past the northern terminus of PA 903 in Tunkhannock Township PA 115 begins at a Y intersection with US 209 in the community of Brodheadsville in Chestnuthill Township, Monroe County. From this intersection, the route heads northwest as a two-lane undivided road, running through business areas and passing north of Pleasant Valley High School before continuing into a mix of farmland and woodland with some development. The road passes through the community of Effort and curves to the north. PA 115 briefly gains a center left-turn lane before it becomes a three-lane road with a second northbound lane and continues into forested areas with residential neighborhoods, turning to the northwest and entering Tunkhannock Township. The route narrows back to two lanes and runs through more dense forests. The road passes to the southwest of Pocono Raceway before it curves more to the west and meets the northern terminus of PA 903\\\\. PA 115 heads northwest again through more forested areas with some development prior to crossing into Tobyhanna Township. Here, the route immediately reaches an interchange with I-80 at exit 284, at which point it widens into a four-lane divided highway. After the interchange, PA 115 narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and crosses Tobyhanna Creek. The route crosses PA 940 in the community of Blakeslee, at which point it passes a few businesses. Following this intersection, the road heads back through forests. PA 115 crosses the Lehigh River into Buck Township in Luzerne County, where the name of the road becomes Buck Boulevard. The route passes through more dense forest, curving more to the west and entering Bear Creek Township in the community of Shades Glen. The road becomes Bear Creek Boulevard and continues west, entering the borough of Bear Creek Village. Here, PA 115 gains a center left-turn lane and heads through wooded areas of homes, passing to the south of Bear Creek Lake. The route heads northwest and becomes the border between Bear Creek Village to the northeast and Bear Creek Township to the southwest, with the turn lane disappearing and the road gaining a second southbound lane. The route fully enters Bear Creek Township again, where it turns back into a three-lane road with a center left- turn lane and passes near some residential neighborhoods, turning to the north. PA 115 curves northwest and comes to a ramp that provides access to I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) at exit 105\\\\. The route becomes a wide two-lane road and runs parallel to I-476 to the west as it descends Wyoming Mountain. The road curves northeast before a turn to the northwest, where it passes under I-476. PA 115 continues north through forests with some homes, coming to a northbound runaway truck ramp and passing through Llewellyns Corners. The route enters Plains Township and passes over the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Lehigh Division line as it comes to another northbound runaway truck ramp and winds through more dense forests as a four-lane divided highway. PA 115 turns to the west and passes south of commercial development before it comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with I-81 and PA 309 at exit 170 outside of the city of Wilkes- Barre. Past this interchange, the roadway continues west as the limited-access North Cross Valley Expressway, which is part of PA 309. History= Old roads  Former PA 115 near Wind Gap The southern and northern portions of what became PA 115 from Easton to Wilkes-Barre was originally a pathway made by General John Sullivan and his forces in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War on their expedition from Easton to the Wyoming Valley. George Washington ordered Sullivan to march upstream the Susquehanna River to join General James Clinton's brigade at the Bradford County town of Tioga (now known as Athens). Soon after, Sullivan's army departed to Newtown, New York where they defeated the Iroquois and Cayuga Indians living in Western New York. His campaign was one of the most important military movements in the American Revolution.Bradsby, p. 127-129. The southernmost segment of General Sullivan's path which became part of PA 115 centuries later from Knox Avenue in Easton to PA 512 in Wind Gap is currently designated as Sullivan Trail. At the turn of the 19th century, the population and economy of Luzerne County continued to grow and there was a necessity for new roads to improve communication between distant settlements. Most of the early merchandise transportation in the area was done by Durham boats on the Lehigh and Susquehanna Rivers. This led Arnold Colt, a Luzerne County clerk, to construct a turnpike directly connecting the Wyoming and Lehigh Valleys on Sullivan's Trail.Bradsby, p. 534. Colt then obtained a charter to incorporate the Easton and Wilkes-Barre Turnpike on February 11, 1803.Bradsby, p. 254. The first of the turnpike from Wilkes-Barre to Wind Gap were finished by 1807. The road was completed by 1815 at a total expense of $75,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The turnpike was initially used as major thoroughfare for conveying grains and plaster during War of 1812. When Northampton County farmers could not afford shipped plaster from the Eastern seaboard they became interested in New York plaster. The plaster was transported from New York via the Susquehanna River then onto the turnpike on wagons and sleds. Transporting this product became the turnpike's legacy as it transformed the road into an important commercial line. By the 1850s, the transport industry heavily favored trains over wagons and sleds. In 1851, the Lackawanna and Western Railroad was completed, connecting Scranton to upstate New York. The new railroad shortened the time required to ship goods between the two endpoints from ten days (by way of roads) to just one. The amount of traffic on the turnpike declined as a result. By the 1850s, the turnpike company had folded and the highway was abandoned. From Bear Creek to Tobyhanna Township the name Easton and Wilkes- Barre Road is still marked on PA 115\\\\. The former southern extension of PA 115 from Brodheadsville to Wind Gap is marked as the Wilkes-Barre Turnpike.  Designation  When Pennsylvania began maintenance over roads by the way of the Sproul Road Bill in May 1911, the Luzerne County portion of present-day PA 115 was adopted as Legislative Route 169 (LR 169), the primary connector between Wilkes-Barre and the Poconos. The former southernmost segment of the route from Saylorsburg to Easton was adopted as LR 166. The first traffic routes were assigned in 1924 and by 1927, the state had assigned LR 169 as PA 15 only to be renumbered the following year as PA 115. When PA 115 was commissioned in 1928, the road was mostly aligned east‚Äìwest and stretched from US 220 in Montoursville to US 611 in Swiftwater near Mount Pocono. In April 1935, the southern terminus of PA 115 was moved from Mount Pocono to PA 12 in Saylorsburg, following the Effort Mountain road connecting Wilkes-Barre with Easton. The former alignment of PA 115 from Tobyhanna Township to Swiftwater was replaced by PA 940, which is now PA 940 between Tobyhanna Township and Pocono Summit and PA 314 between Pocono Summit and Swiftwater. By 1937, the southern terminus of PA 115 extended to US 611 in Easton. The new route followed the Sullivan Trail and replaced PA 102 between Easton and Stockertown. The same year, the northern terminus was moved from Montoursville to PA 54 in the Montour County community of Mausdale. The route replaced a part of PA 154 between Mausdale and Jerseytown, all of PA 439 between Jerseytown and Benton, and a part of PA 339 between Benton and Coles Creek. The former alignment of PA 115 between Montoursville and Coles Creek became PA 87 between Montoursville and Forksville and PA 154 between Forksville and Coles Creek. This alignment retains these designations today except that PA 154 has been removed between Laporte and Coles Creek. Former southernmost alignment of PA 115 in Monroe and Northampton Counties. By 1950, PA 115 was extended west to PA 14 (currently PA 405) in Milton, replacing a portion of PA 154 between Milton and Mooresburg and a portion of PA 45 between Mooresburg and Mausdale. Also, a new alignment of PA 115 between Lehman and PA 415 in Dallas was proposed. The northern terminus was moved from Milton to US 220 in Hughesville during the 1950s; this stretch replaced a portion of PA 642\\\\. The former alignment of PA 115 between Milton and Red Rock became PA 642 between Milton and Jerseytown and PA 254 between Jerseytown and Red Rock. This alignment is now PA 642, PA 254 between Jerseytown and Benton, and PA 487 between Benton and Red Rock. In addition, the route was moved to its new alignment between Lehman and Dallas, where it turned southeast and picked up a concurrency with US 309\\\\. By 1960, PA 115 was moved onto a freeway (now PA 33) from Saylorsburg to PA 512 in Wind Gap. In April 1961, the northern terminus of PA 115 was moved from Hughesville to US 309 (now PA 309 Business) in Wilkes-Barre Township, with the route replaced by PA 118 between Hughesville and Dallas. This change was made in order to eliminate the concurrency with US 309 between Dallas and Wilkes-Barre Township and to give the east-west portion between Hughesville and Dallas an even route number. In Wilkes-Barre, it used to follow Kidder Street, Butler Street, Main Street, Courtright Street, Carey Avenue, and crossed the Susquehanna River on Pierce Street. By 1972, the southern terminus was truncated from Easton to its current location. The portion of PA 115's former surface alignment in Northampton County between Center Square in Easton and PA 191 in Stockertown is now designated as State Route 2025, an unsigned quadrant route. PA 115 was extended back to its former alignments by 1980 via Kidder, Scott, Butler, and Pierce Streets through Wilkes-Barre and ended at US 11 in Kingston. The route was truncated to PA 309 at the intersection of Kidder and Spring Streets in Wilkes-Barre by 1989. A year later, the northern terminus was moved to its current location when the North Cross Valley Expressway (PA 309) was completed. On March 10, 2014, Governor Tom Corbett announced plans for a $5 million project to widen PA 115 between PA 903 and Pocono Raceway in order to improve traffic flow to and from the raceway on race weekends. In 2018, widening began, with the road being widened from two lanes to three lanes with a center left-turn lane that can be configured as a reversible lane on race weekends. There are plans to construct a roundabout at US 209 in Brodheadsville in order to alleviate traffic congestion. Construction on the roundabout is planned to begin in the middle of 2020.

It crosses the Thames on the reach above Bray Lock, about half a mile below Boulter's Lock. The Thames Path crosses the river here. History The first bridge was built of wood in 1280 in what was then the hamlet of South Ellington. The Great West Road to Reading, Gloucester and Bristol was diverted over the new bridge ‚Äì previously it kept to the north bank crossed the Thames by ford at Cookham ‚Äì and mediaeval Maidenhead grew up around it. Within a few years a wharf was constructed next to the bridge and the South Ellington name was dropped with the area becoming known as Maidenhythe (literally meaning \\"new wharf\\"). The earliest record of this name change is in the Bray Court manorial rolls of 1296. In 1297 a grant of pontage for the charge of tolls for repairs to the bridge was awarded and a replacement bridge was constructed. The event is recorded in the Patent Rolls of Edward I as a... > \\"grant at the instance of Will. de Berford in aid of the bridge of > Maidenhead which is almost broken down, of pontage (tolls) for three years, > to be taken at the hands of two good and lawful men appointed by him.\\" In 1335 another three years pontage was granted to the \\"baliffs and good men of Maidenhythe\\" on wares passing under or over the bridge. Only a century later the bridge had again fallen into disrepair and during the reign of Henry VI was so unsafe that most travellers preferred to cross using the ferry. Since it was first built, the bridge had a hermitage and chapel attached so that travellers could pray for safe passage over the bridge or to give thanks for a safe crossing. Another chapel in the town lent its name to The Guild of St Andrew and St Mary Magdelene which was formed in 1452 to repair the bridge and to maintain the chapel after which it was named. The guild levied tolls for use of the bridge and although it was dissolved by Edward VI during the Reformation in 1547 it was reinstated in 1581 when Queen Elizabeth I granted Maidenhead a Charter of Incorporation and the guild's bridge maintenance duties were transferred to the new Corporation who employed one warden, two bridgemasters and eight burgesses dedicated to the upkeep of the bridge and the collection of tolls. The corporation was specifically not permitted to rebuild the chapel but were allowed to levy toll and hold a weekly market and two annual fairs. The charter was renewed by James I who added a Whit Wednesday fair and the right to take three oaks per year from the Royal Forest of Bray. During the Civil War the bridge again fell into disrepair. Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, a commander of Parliamentary forces reported on 25 September 1644 that his army was \\"constrained to wait at Uxbridge as Maidenhead Bridge is broken\\". Colonel Whitcote the Parliamentary Commander at Maidenhead acquired seven oaks with which to make repairs but by 1660 it was again in a dangerous state. The bridge wardens petitioned the restored monarch ‚Äì Charles II ‚Äì in 1672 but had to wait until 1679 for a warrant for 20 oaks to be issued. On the accession of James II all of the benefits granted by James I were restored and the senior bridge warden was made Mayor. When William of Orange landed in 1688 the town, still loyal to James followed the order of the King and broke the bridge to prevent William crossing however their efforts were cosmetic and William's army was able to march across it a matter of days later. Although James' restoration of benefits included the annual quota of oaks, in 1714 the corporation complained to the Lord Treasurer about the poor quality of the trees. The corporation also claimed that bridge revenues were adversely affected by the opening of a toll-free bridge in Datchet but their request for compensation was refused. A further eighteen years passed before the treasury granted a warrant for 23 oaks. Present structure In 1750 the bridge was again in a state of disrepair and a contract for \\"great works\\" was awarded to Mr Stiff Leadbetter of Eaton. The estimated cost was ¬£600 and the actual cost on the final bill was ¬£794 9s 2d ‚Äì equivalent to ¬£ today. This prompted the corporation to consider the large ongoing cost of maintaining the old structure and decision was made to build an entirely new bridge. Two designs were submitted. Mr Fuller White proposed a timber structure and Robert Taylor a thirteen-arch Portland stone bridge. The corporation preferred Taylor's design but demanded that the original cost of ¬£25,000 (equivalent to ¬£ today) be reduced. Taylor therefore modified the design so that only the river arches were of Portland stone, the rest in brick. The rebuilding was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1771 and Taylor's design was built by John Townsend of Oxford (builder of Swinford Bridge) at a total cost of ¬£19,000 (equivalent to ¬£ today). Works were delayed until a temporary ferry had been constructed and the foundation stone was laid by the Mayor of Maidenhead on 19 October 1772. After delays caused by ice, frost and flooding the centre arch was completed in 1775. The new bridge was finished and finally opened for traffic in 1777. Flooding at Maidenhead Bridge, February 2014 In 1966 Nikolaus Pevsner recorded it in his Buildings of Berkshire as \\"a beautiful piece of 1772‚Äì7.... seven main water-arches with rock rustication on the voussoirs... fine balustrade\\". Tolls Throughout its history the tolls on Maidenhead Bridge had been considered high and were the subject of disquiet. In 1337 the toll for a loaded barge to pass under or a loaded cart to pass over was 1 old penny (equivalent to ¬£10 today). By the 1830s the bridge was recorded as raising ¬£1,245 per annum in tolls (equivalent to ¬£ today). It remained a toll bridge until 1903, after an Eton man named Joseph Taylor, who had already made a successful legal challenge against the tolls on Windsor Bridge petitioned the Charity Commissioners in 1902 that the toll was illegal as the funds raised had been used by the Maidenhead Corporation for purposes other than bridge maintenance ‚Äì a fact freely admitted by the town clerk. The Charity Commission agreed that the toll was illegal and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1903 which legislated for tolls to cease after 31 October 1903. A large crowd gathered at the bridge and in the first moments of 1 November 1903 they removed the toll gates and threw them into the Thames. The tolls in 1903 were 1 shilling (equivalent to ¬£ today) for a coach and horses, sixpence (equivalent to ¬£ today) for a car and 10 old pence (equivalent to ¬£ today) for twenty sheep. Exhibition In 2007, the bridge was the subject of a special exhibition to mark its 230th anniversary at Maidenhead Heritage Centre.Maidenhead Heritage Centre Celebrates Bridge To Prosperity, Culture24, 1 August 2007.

The SER's route included reversing at Ramsgate to take a branch line to ; this section closed in the 1920s as part of a rationalisation to merge duplicate routes built by the SER and its former competitor the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). The remainder of the line is double-track and electrified with 750 V DC third rail. At Ashford it links to High Speed 1 for fast services to .

Southeastern December 2019: London - Ashford, Folkestone, Dover and Margate History The line was proposed by the South Eastern Railway (SER) as a branch from its main line in April 1834. At the time, coastal towns on the Isle of Thanet such as Margate and Ramsgate were undergoing a rise in popularity as holiday resorts, and railways could be seen as faster and cheaper rivals to the steamboat traffic bringing holidaymakers from London. However, the SER suffered from having no direct access to Thanet on their network except via Ashford. By August 1836, the rival London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) made its own proposal to serve Thanet. Planning for the line stalled for a while, but by 1840 the SER realised that rival railways were making serious proposals for lines to Thanet. The SER were not convinced the railway would be a success, and so built it as single track, with space to add an additional track if necessary, and crossed roads at level in several places, including Wye, Chartham and Sturry. The line ran through Minster to Ramsgate, then doubled back on a branch line to , which required trains reversing. The overall planned cost was ¬£385,339. The line opened as far as Canterbury on 6 February 1846. Intermediate stations were not immediately provided, but opened soon afterwards; Wye railway station was open by April 1846. A station was planned at Godmersham but then cancelled. The extension to Ramsgate opened on 13 April, with stations at , Minster and Ramsgate. The SER hoped by building the line to Ramsgate, it would be able to run boat train services to Ostend. The Margate branch was delayed and finally opened on 1 December 1846. An intermediate station at Sturry opened on 22 April 1847. The goods and cattle facilities at Ramsgate made the line popular for transporting these, and they were extended in 1895. An additional siding was added at Wye in 1895 to serve racing traffic. After the LCDR's line reached Dover on 22 July 1861, there was serious competition between the two companies for continental port traffic. The rivalry between the SER and LDCR almost bankrupted both companies, and consequently they formed a joined management committee, known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), in 1899. This then became part of the Southern Railway (SR) as part of the grouping under the Railways Act 1921. In 1924, a extension began construction between the former SER line at Ramsgate and the former LCDR line at . This opened on 2 July 1926. At the same time, the former SER branch to Margate Sands closed to passengers, as did the stations at and . The Margate Sands branch line survived as a goods depot until November 1976, when it was closed completely. The line was electrified in 1961 under the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan. Grove Ferry station closed on 3 January 1966. Accidents and incidents On 11 August 1858, an excursion train was derailed near . Three people were killed. On 1 January 1877, a major storm hit Kent, causing damage along the line. The roof at Canterbury West was damaged, and a timber bridge across the line blew down. The bridge was replaced three months later by a subway. On 9 October 1894, an early morning goods train carrying hop pickers from Ashford to Canterbury West collided with a horse and cart on a level crossing close to Horton Chapel Farm. Five people were killed immediately, and two later died from their injuries. The SER denied responsibility and blamed the cart driver who did not check to see if a train was coming. On 15 July 1970, an electric multiple unit was in collision with a lorry on an occupation crossing between and Chilham due to an error by the crossing keeper. The driver of the lorry and the guard of the train were killed. On 26 July 2015, electric multiple unit 375 703 was in collision with a herd of cattle on the line at Chilham and was derailed. There were no injuries amongst the 70 passengers. The line was closed until 30 July.

Entertainment Weekly was somewhat less enthusiastic, finding some of the singer's lyrics clich√©d, the music overly fashionable, and her voice derivative of proto-rap performers such as Gil Scott-Heron, although the magazine said Ndeg√©Ocello \\"delivers her cool cocktail talk with a winning bluesy resignation\\". At the end of 1993, Plantation Lullabies appeared on numerous top-10 lists and was voted the year's 27th best album in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Although the album had been acclaimed by music journalists, others criticized Ndeg√©Ocello's unapologetic lyrics on songs dealing with race, gender relations, and her own sexuality. A few songs from the album led some to charge her with being racist, which Ndeg√©Ocello denied; the lyrics of \\"Shoot'n Up and Gett'n High\\" held a racist society responsible for the drug addiction and death of its subject while declaring \\"the white man shall forever sleep with one eye open\\". Some African-American critics were angered by the singer's depiction of Black men in \\"Soul on Ice\\", which accused them of embracing \\"white racist standards of beauty\\" while derisively asking if they date White woman because they \\"go better with the Brooks Brothers suit?\\". Ndegeocello was also criticized by some feminists for her boasts of sexual competition on \\"If That's Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)\\". In response to the criticism, she told the Los Angeles Times in 1994: According to Ndeg√©Ocello, she was reprimanded by the executives at Maverick for her \\"outspokenness\\". Buddy Seigal wrote at the time that \\"perhaps because of the controversial nature of her work, radio has been slow to add Plantation Lullabies to its playlists\\". The album charted at number 166 on the Billboard Top 200 in 1994, while the single \\"If That's Your Boyfriend (He Wasn't Last Night)\\" was a modest hit, reaching number 73 on the Hot 100. At the end of the year, Plantation Lullabies received a nomination for a 1995 Grammy Award in the category of Best R&B; Album; \\"If That's Your Boyfriend\\" was nominated for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance and Best R&B; Song. Plantation Lullabies has since been credited as the beginning of the neo soul genre; it was \\"arguably the first shot in the so-called 'neo-soul' movement\\", according to Renee Graham of The Boston Globe. In 2002, the album was named one of Vibes nine \\"essential black rock recordings\\". Geoff Himes reflected on the record in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004): \\"Virtually a Prince-like one-person production, it bristled with irresistible hooks -- rhythmic, melodic, and verbal ('I'm digging you like an old soul record'). [Ndeg√©Ocello] celebrated African-American culture, but she also criticized its self-betrayals in the form of addiction and misogyny.\\" \\"Ndeg√©Ocello injected hip-hop with the adrenaline of Alternative, organic soul humming with the politics of sex and 'black-on-black love'\\", Sal Cinquemani wrote in Slant Magazine, calling Plantation Lullabies \\"the quintessential hip-hop album, mixing the soul of Sly Stone and the funk of James Brown with the pop sensibilities of Prince and the grace of Lena Horne\\". AllMusic's Michael Gallucci said that in spite of Ndeg√©Ocello's occasionally derivative \\"funky soul\\" and identity politics, most of the album was \\"as boundary-busting and as affecting as '90s R&B; gets\\". Robert Christgau remained relatively unimpressed, citing \\"I'm Diggin' You\\" and \\"Picture Show\\" as highlights while writing, \\"deprived of womanist rap, we settle for strong-woman singsong\\".

His political activity started during the decolonization process of Chad from France, but after the country's independence he was forced to go in exile due to the increasing authoritarism of the country's first President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye. To overthrow Tombalbaye he founded in Sudan in 1966 the FROLINAT, of which he was the first leader and field commander. Two years later he was killed in a clash with the Chadian Army. Early career Originally from Borno (a province of the British colony of Nigeria), Abatcha was born into a family with a Muslim background in the French colony of Chad at Fort-Lamy (today N'Djamena) in 1938, and learned to speak French, English and Chadian Arabic, but not to write Classical Arabic, as he did not study in a Qur'anic school.R. Buijtenhuijs, Le Frolinat, 117 He found work as a clerk in the colonial administration and became a militant trade unionist.S. Decalo, Historical Dictionary of Chad, 21J. Chapelle, Le Peuple Tchadien, 257 He entered in politics in 1958, becoming a prominent figure in the new radical Chadian National Union (UNT), mainly a split from the African Socialist Movement (MSA) by promoters of the No-vote in the referendum on Chad's entry in the French Community. The party's followers were all Muslims, and advocated Pan-Africanism and socialism.C. Bouquet, Tchad, 122 Towards the end of the colonial rule Abatcha was jailed for a year either for his political activities or for mismanagement in the performance of his duties. He and his party staunchly opposed after independence in 1960 the rule of President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye, and the UNT was banned with all other opposition parties on January 19, 1962. After that Abatcha was briefly imprisoned by the new Chadian government. In exile After his release, the UNT cadres decided that if the political situation in Chad became too unbearable to allow the party to survive, it would be wise to send out of the country some party members so that the organization would in any case maintain its existence. Thus Abatcha, who held the position of second adjutant secretary-general of the UNT, was sent in 1963 to Accra, Ghana, where he was later joined by UNT members Aboubakar Djalabo and Mahamat Ali Taher. By going into exile the UNT members meant also to ensure their personal safety and organize abroad an armed revolt in Chad.V. Thompson & R. Adloff, Conflict in Chad, 51 As part of the means to preserve the unity of the movement, Abatcha wrote for the UNT a policy statement; this draft was to be the core of the official program of the FROLINAT.R. Brian Ferguson, The State, Identity and Violence, 275 Abatcha led the typical life of the Third World dissident in search of support in foreign capitals, first residing in Accra, Ghana, where he received his first military training and made friends among members of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon that had found asylum there. These Cameroonians helped him attend conferences organized by international Communist groups. After leaving Accra in 1965, Abatcha started wandering to other African capitals always searching support for his project of beginning an insurgency against Tombalbaye. The first capital he reached in 1965 was Algiers, where the UNT had already a representative, probably Djalabo. His attempts were unsuccessful, as were those made from there to persuade the Chadian students in France to join him in his fight. From there he traveled to Cairo, where a small secret committee of anti-government Chadian students of the Al-Azhar University had formed. The students in Cairo had developed a strong political sensitivity because they had come to resent that the degrees obtained by them in Arab countries were of no use in Chad, as French was the only official language.C. Bouquet, 128‚Äì129 Among these students Abatcha recruited his first supporters, and with the help of the UPC Cameroonian exiles contacted the North Korean embassy in Egypt, which offered him a military stage. Seven Cairo students volunteered, leaving Egypt in June 1965 and returning in October; these were to be with Abatcha the first military cadres of the rebels. Abatcha with his \\"Koreans\\" went then to Sudan in October 1965.R. Buijtenhuijs, Le Frolinat, 120 Once in Sudan Abatcha found fertile ground for further recruitment, as many Chadian refugees lived there. Abatcha was also able to enroll in his movement former Sudanese soldiers, including a few officers, of whom the most distinguished was to become Hadjaro Senoussi. He also contacted Mohamed Baghlani, who was in communication with the first Chadian insurgents already active in Chad, and with the insurgent group Liberation Front of Chad (FLT).R. Buijtenhuijs, Le Frolinat, 120-121 Creation of the FROLINAT This merger was negotiated during the congress at Nyala between June 19 and June 22, 1966, in which the UNT and another rebel force, the Liberation Front of Chad (FLT) combined, giving birth to the FROLINAT, whose first secretary-general was agreed to be Abatcha. The two groups were ideologically ill-fitted, as they combined the radicalism of the UNT and the Muslim beliefs of the FLT.S. Nolutshungu, Limits of Anarchy, 58 FLT's president, Ahmed Hassan Musa, missed the conference because he was imprisoned in Khartoum; Musa suspected with some reason that Abatcha had deliberately chosen the moment of his incarceration to organize the conference due to his fear of FLT's numerical superiority over the UNT. As a result, once freed Musa broke with the FROLINAT, the first of many splits that were to plague the history of the organization.V. Thompson & R. Adloff, 52 Thus Abatcha had to face from the beginning a level of considerable internal strife, with the opposition guided by the anti-communist Mohamed Baghlani.C. Bouquet, 131 The unity was stronger on the field, with Abatcha and his so- called Koreans passing to Eastern Chad in mid-1966 to fight the government, and El Hadj Issaka assuming the role of his chief-of-staff. While his maquis were badly trained and equipped, they were able to commit some hit-and-run attacks against the Chadian army, mainly in Ouaddai, but also in Guera and Salamat. The rebels also toured the villages, indoctrinating the people on the future revolution and exhorting youths to join the FROLINAT forces.C. Bouquet, 131‚Äì132V. Thompson & R. Adloff, 53 The following year Abatcha expanded his range and number of operations, officially claiming in his dispatches 32 actions, involving prefectures previously untouched by the rebellion, that is Moyen-Chari and Kanem.C. Bouquet, 132 Mainly due to Abatcha's qualities as both secretary-general and field-commander, what had started in 1965 as a peasant uprising was becoming a revolutionary movement.V. Thompson & R. Adloff, 54  Abatcha's death  On January 20, 1968, his men killed on the Goz Beida-Ab√©ch√© road a Spanish veterinary and a French doctor, while they took hostage a French nurse. Abatcha disavowed this action and ordered his men to free the nurse, but due to these actions, on February 11, he was tracked down by the Chadian army and killed in a clash. Abatcha's death was the end of an important phase in the history of the FROLINAT and more generally of the rebellion. Abatcha had been the one generally acceptable leader of the insurrection; after him the FROLINAT was more and more divided by inner rivalries, making it more difficult to provide the insurgents with a coherent organization.

History ≈ûirvan is attested in the 13th century by Yaqut al-Hamawi in Mu'jam al-Buldan. Under the Ottoman Empire, ≈ûirvan was a kaza (district) of the sanjak of Siirt in the Bitlis Vilayet, and the village of K√ºfre (\\"village\\" in Syriac, today called ≈ûirvan) served as its administrative centre. The district of ≈ûirvan was largely inhabited by Muslim Kurds, but was also home to a number of Christian Assyrians and Armenians, who constituted roughly 20% of the total population of the district. Of the total 200-odd settlements in the district, 28 were Christian, most of which were predominantly inhabited by Syriac Orthodox Assyrians, and some were populated by both Christians and Muslims. As a consequence of the removal of local Kurdish overlords as part of the Ottoman policy of centralisation in the 1830s and 1840s, rural areas in the district were made vulnerable to oppression and exploitation by Kurdish tribes. Christians were also the victim of religious persecution, and led many to emigrate, as well as a small number of Kurds due to economic hardship, and resulted in a gradual process of Kurdification of the district. By 1895, K√ºfre was populated by Assyrians and Kurds, with some Armenian families. In the same year, amidst the Hamidian massacres, the village was attacked by Kurdish nomads of the Mahometan and Strugan tribes, allegedly with the permission of the acting kaymakam (district governor), Fatha Bey. It was reported that all Christian houses were looted, and 25 Assyrians and Armenians were killed. As well as this, almost every Christian village in the district was attacked in October‚ÄìNovember 1895. James Henry Monahan, British vice-consul of Bitlis, reported that 179 Christians (151 men and 18 women) were killed, however it is suggested that this figure may under-represent the total figure. In order to avoid future attacks, almost all Assyrians and Armenians ostensibly converted to Islam on the suggestion of sedentary Kurds. The large majority of converts privately reconverted to Christianity within several years after the massacres of 1895, and only three converted villages in the district remained Muslim when visited by Monahan. Oppression of Christians worsened considerably in the aftermath of the massacres, thereby increasing Christian emigration; of 22 villages in the district, over half of the population left. Despite this, a number of crypto-Christian villages have endured into the 21st century.

Characters There are 12 major characters in the game, and each major character is accompanied by one or two minor characters. The character combinations are: Anakin Skywalker with Padm√© Amidala, Darth Maul with two Battle Droids, Obi-Wan Kenobi with two Clone Troopers, Yoda with two Clone Troopers, Luke Skywalker with Princess Leia, Mace Windu with two Clone Troopers, Darth Vader with two Stormtroopers, Count Dooku with two Super Battle Droids, Boba Fett with Greedo, Emperor Palpatine with two Royal Guards, Jango Fett with Zam Wesell, and Han Solo with Chewbacca. Game play Game play is based on a card-centered combat system. Each set of characters has its own deck of 31 cards. There are three types of cards in the deck, Basic Combat Cards, Power Combat Cards and Special cards. Basic Combat cards have two values, one for attacking and one for defending. Power Combat cards have combat values and additional effects that give the characters special abilities. There are also \\"Special\\" cards that allow the characters to do unique things such as extra movement, drawing/discarding cards, and additional damage. Each player maintains a hand of cards from their respective decks that are used during the game. Each character card displays how much damage the major and minor characters can take before they are destroyed. Each character uses a wound marker to track the damage on their character card. The object of the game is to destroy all of your opponent's major characters. During gameplay players alternate turns rolling the die, moving their characters, and then performing 2 \\"actions\\". An action is defined in the rulebook as \\"Drawing a Card, Playing a Card, and Healing a Character.\\" A character is healed by discarding a card of a destroyed major or minor character. There are several different ways to play the game from 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3, 3-6 player free- for-all, and even a special \\"masterplay\\" variant. Gameplay with 6-12 players is possible, however, it is more easily accomplished if two boards are used adjacent to each other. Epic Duels Community Despite the fact that the game was out of print by 2004, there is large internet following for the short-lived game. There are numerous fan-sites (\\"epic_duels_online_league\\"), forums and groups that still continue to discuss and analyze it. As Hasbro has not announced plans for an expansion to the game, many fans took it upon themselves to create custom decks to be used with the game. A similar Star Wars board game released by Wizards of the Coast called Star Wars Miniatures, has provided many fans with figurines of similar scale to use with the hundreds of custom decks that can be found on the internet. Several Facebook fan groups exist as well. There is also a devoted Yahoo! group to playing Epic Duels online through the VASSAL Engine.

Climate Ta≈üova has a hot- summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa). History The first of many cultures and civilisations to settle on the plain were the Hittites who by 1650 BC were spread throughout Anatolia. Then came the Phrygians (1200 - 700 BC), Cimmerians, Medes and Persians. The Ancient Macedonians of Alexander the Great came to Anatolia in 331 BC and upon their dispersal rule of the Amasya region including Ta≈üova passed to the Kings of Pontus (in 291 BC), who remained in control until the arrival of the Romans. The plain was part of the Roman Empire until 395 AD and for centuries more belonged to Byzantium. The Arab armies of early Islam came through in 712. Following the victory of the Seljuk Turks over Byzantium at Malazgirt in 1071, Turkish peoples spread into Anatolia taking the Byzantine cities one by one. The plain of Ta≈üova was conquered by Danishmend lords in 1075, who were based in nearby Amasya. The area was taken over by the Seljuk lord Kƒ±lƒ±√ßarslan II in 1174, and following much more invasion and warfare was finally brought within the Ottoman Empire in 1425. Under the Ottomans the plain Ta≈üova remained a rural village with a Turkish population. The village was attacked by Greek bandits at the beginning of the Turkish War of Independence but these were pushed out of the area by the newly formed Turkish army.

Many civilizations have settled here including the Hittites, Phrygians, Persians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. In antiquity this land south of the Menderes River was part of the region of Caria and was controlled from the nearby castle of Kale (known as Tabae in antiquity).

The Mayor of Tekkek√∂y Municipality is Hasan Togar. Agriculture and animal breeding are the main sources of income. Black Sea Copper Works Inc., Samsun Azot Factory, the Organized Industry Site, Industrial Site and Organized Food Industry Site, fertilizer and forging industry, along with a power plant, many surgical instrument manufacturing companies and other manufacturers have facilitated an economically dynamic area. It is on the coast of the Black Sea and located on the 13th km of the Samsun ‚Äì Trabzon highway, east of √áa≈üamba District. Tekkek√∂y is an easy ride from Samsun with plenty of transport options. There will soon be a railway system to and from Tekkek√∂y. The district has a population of nearly 50,000, half of which resides in the center and half in rural areas. A third of the district's land is within the Ye≈üilƒ±rmak delta plain which is convenient for irrigated farming. The daily population is between 100‚Äì150k due to the industry sites and many big showrooms on the Samsun ‚Äì Ordu highway. The constructions of the Ya≈üar Doƒüu Arena and the new city stadium, the international expo and congress center being located within the district and projects such as the Logistics Village, Science and Technology Center, Arts & Culture Center, and Olympic Swimming Pool has served to modernize the district. There are also many hotels of international brands within Tekkek√∂y. Samsun √áar≈üamba Airport is also within the district's limits and very close to the center, making Tekkek√∂y one of the most important districts of Turkey. A 7,500-seat multi-purpose indoor venue, the Tekkek√∂y Ya≈üar Doƒüu Arena, was opened end March 2013 in the town. Tekkek√∂y Municipality is a member of the Union Of Historical Towns since September 13, 2015.  History  In 1941, studies conducted in Tekkek√∂y and surrounding regions by archeologists Prof. Dr. Tahsin √ñzg√º√ß and Prof. Nimet √ñzg√º√ß, and led by Kƒ±lƒ±√ß K√∂kten, have found that the district has been used as a settlement since the Paleolithic era. Located south of the current district center, these settlements date back to c. 600,000 ‚Äì 100,000 BC. Archeological studies done in the district has also reviled remains from the Hittite and Phrygian eras. These lands were included in the Pontus Empire in the mid 3rd century BC and later were seized by the Roman, the Byzantine and the Anatolian Seljuk empires respectively. When the Seljuk Empire entered Anatolia, they sent the great Turkish Veli Sheikh Zeynuddin to this important area and established an Islamic lodge (tekke) in order to convert the locals to Islam. Sheikh Zeynuddin, who is thought to have lived c. 1250-1330, cared for the travelers, the poor, and ones in need. It is said that the name Tekkek√∂y is rooted in that very lodge, as the literal translation for tekke is \\"holyman's lodge\\". In 1399, the Ottomans gained reign over Tekkek√∂y but briefly lost the land to the Kubatoƒüullarƒ± clan in 1402 following the War of Ankara. However, the area became Ottoman territory once again in 1419 through Celebi Mehmet. Turks and local Greeks (Rum) peacefully co-existed here during the Ottoman era until the Lausanne Treaty, which required the Turks in Western Thrace and Balkans (especially Thessaloniki, Greece and surrounding regions) to swap places with Greeks in the area. As a result, the inhabitants of Tekkek√∂y today fall into three main categories: Locals, immigrants from the west, and the exchange population who managed to preserve their cultural heritage. Furthermore, the Arabian cemetery in Tekkek√∂y dated back to the 1800s is proof that other tribes had also been here. Romanians also contribute to the rich culture embedded in Tekkek√∂y. These different and rich cultures have composed the cultural and folkloric significance of Tekkek√∂y.  Local attractions = Archeology Valley and caves  Settlements of the Chalcolithic Period, these caves were naturally formed smaller caves, which were later hollowed out and expanded to become houses. The caves have a multi-leveled structure and therefore can be identified as apartment buildings. The inhabitants of these caves were the ones to establish the first symbiosis culture. In 1941, studies and excavations led by Prof. Dr. Tahsin √ñzg√º√ß, member of Ankara University's Language, History and Geography Department, founded many prehistoric caves, shelters, and settlements in the area. Hand axes, spearheads, and other sharp objects from the Paleolithic era were also found during these excavations. Studies and excavations have also revealed grave goods of more advance craftsmanship such as pottery, earrings, bracelets, knives, daggers, spearheads, and pins. Excavations done 14 km southeast of D√ºndartepe have revealed remains of Hittite and Early Bronze era. There are mostly potteries of camel and crimson color, which have been shaped on a potter's wheel. And many graves, handcrafted ceramics, vessels with black and white geometric features, and anthropomorphic vases have been found in the Hittite area. Archeology Valley and other surrounding valleys are fit for hiking, horseback riding, and cycling. They also have magnificent views. Fƒ±ndƒ±cak and √áƒ±narlƒ± streams trance the valley. The hollows and caves of different sizes on the valley cliffs are from the chalcolithic period. The mass rock structure, which is located at the intersection of the √áƒ±narcƒ±k and Fƒ±ndƒ±cak streams and overlooks both valleys, is called \\"Hollow Stone\\". The technical aspects and forms of the steps that lead up from the rock have been found to be of the Phrygian era. The remains in Tekkek√∂y are exhibited in the Samsun Archeology Museum and material that represent local eras are exhibited in Turkey's first imitation museum, Tekkek√∂y Archeology Museum House. There are also sculptures in its garden. Furthermore, the Archeology Valley will be expanded into an Archeopark.  Replica of Atat√ºrk's House  An exact replica of Atat√ºrk's birth home in Thessalonica can be seen on the way back from Altƒ±nkaya Church, at the main road intersection. Tekkek√∂y is one of the most important settlements for the Turks who relocated to the area after the population exchange in 1923. The area, which was previously home to Greek villages and neighborhoods, gained cultural and folkloric significance after the exchange population settled in. Turks who relocated from the Balkans and wanted a reminder of the lands of their ancestors, were the ones to suggest building an exact replica of Atat√ºrk's House in Thessaloniki, and so our municipality built Atat√ºrk's House Museum. The museum, which has many visitors, exhibits replica furniture of the original house in Thessaloniki, as well as Atat√ºrk's civil and military outfits. On the entrance floor there is a History Library, mostly composed of books about Atat√ºrk. There is also a gift shop on the same floor where visitors can buy souvenirs.  Ancient windmill in √áƒ±rakman  The one and only windmill of the Black Sea region is located in the √áƒ±rakman neighborhood in Tekkek√∂y. This district is an old Greek settlement, which later became home to the Turks who relocated to the area after the population exchange in 1923. √áƒ±rakman means \\"big fire\\". The Greeks that once lived here used to engage in agriculture and fishing. They set camp on the shore and lit great campfires. Their campfires were a way to attract fish to shallow waters. That big fire was called √áƒ±rakman and gave its name to the area. The ancient windmill, which was built in the late 1800s by Greeks, was restored to its original form thanks to the conservation commission and our municipality. Today this windmill is fully functional: It can grain wheat. It is also a main touristic site that attracts many local and foreign tourists. It can grain wheat and its roof can rotate to adjust to winds. Inside the windmill is a tiny museum, which was established by the Greeks from √áƒ±rakman who went to Georgia and Russia to work in 1830s. After landscaping the area surrounding the windmill, our municipality set up a picnic area for recreational use. Back in the day, newlyweds used to come up to the windmill and dip their hands in freshly ground flour, hoping for a fruitful and happy marriage. Today this tradition is still carried out by some of the locals.  Sheikh Yusuf Zeynuddin Mosque and Shrine  Sheikh Yusuf Zeynuddin is a great ƒ∞slamic Veli who lived in the time of the Anatolian Seljuk Empire. He is a descendant of Gavs-ƒ± Azam Sheikh Abdulkadir-i Geylani. Sheikh Yusuf Zeynuddin built a mosque in 1285 and there is a shrine in the mosque's garden bearing his name. Along with the mosque, he also established a lodge and soup kitchen to care for the ones in need. Now the municipality carries out this tradition.  Ancient buildings and sites  There are many ancient buildings and sites in Tekkek√∂y that have survived time. To look at them in chronological order: The first rock graves of the Bronze period are located between the Altƒ±nkaya and √ñkse neighborhoods. Although placed high in the cliffs of a deep valley, the graves were plundered by previous civilizations and therefore have no findings in them. There is also a grave at the entrance of the Asaraƒüa√ß picnic and recreation area dated back to the transitional period of the late archaic and Hellenistic eras, which is thought to be of a person of rank. The entrance hall in the front has collapsed over time, so the entrance is now on the grooved rock side of the structure. On this side, there are four other graves that are thought to belong to the relatives of that person of rank. There are also many ancient churches in Tekkek√∂y, most important of which being the Andoria Antyeri (originally Andreandon) Church located in the Antyeri neighborhood. The apse, interior pillars and bell tower are architectural aspects that draw attention. The church is planned to be restored to become a museum and office where tourists can receive information about the area. A similar church is the Altƒ±nkaya Church located in the Altƒ±nkaya neighborhood. The Altƒ±nkaya Church is known to be the oldest church of the Black Sea region, and its stone grid structure and cubic forms used to achieve acoustics are unique. Different from the two, is the remains of White (Ak) Church located in the Lower √áinik neighborhood. It stands out architecturally from other churches in Turkey with a rectangular shape and exterior, which has grooved and pillared characteristics. Finally, the Arched Fountain is located in the √áƒ±rakman neighborhood's Kobal area. With a double pillared entrance and dome, this fountain used to serve as a spring water source and with this characteristic, is unique in the Black Sea area. The historic fountain is currently in ruins.  Churches and fountains  * Andoria Antyeri Church (Andreanadon Church): Antyeri Church is one of the most well preserved churches in the area and is known for its bell tower. It is also registered and currently under restoration. * Altƒ±nkaya Church: This church is contemporary with the church at Cape Jason in neighboring Ordu's Per≈üembe District. Its stone grid structure and cubic forms used to achieve acoustics are unique. * Arched Fountain * White Church (Lower √áinik): Located in the Lower √áinik area, White Church has different architectural characteristics from other churches in the area. * √áƒ±naralan Church-Mosque: When you hike up towards the √áƒ±naralan Village from the Hollow Stone, a rough narrow road takes you to the √áƒ±naralan Church-Mosque. What used to be a church with only one remaining wall was revised by locals to become a mosque. However, the revisions were poorly executed. There are plans to restore this historic church in a professional manner. * Church Remains in Yazƒ±lar Village: Samsun Preservation Committee District Office had officially registered these remains. *  Costal Coast  With its long stretched beach and natural sands, Costal is where Tekkek√∂y district meets the sea. The B√ºlb√ºl stream, which flows along the main road to Costal, is home to the visiting wild ducks and kingfishers, and also is a nice area for recreational fishing. If you follow the signs to Samsun √áar≈üamba Airport off the Samsun ‚Äì Ordu highway, and take a turn following the signs to Yeni Mahalle and Kurtulu≈ü you reach the Costal Forest. Following the brook on your left will eventually lead you to the sea lined with a virgin beach and summer houses hidden among the pine trees. The long beach of Costal is where the Tekkek√∂y district meets the sea. The fact that other areas are mostly industrialized, makes Costal is an important location to swim. Genoese sailors have also used this location historically. They are the ones who first called it Costal (meaning sailor, one that comes from the sea). The Genoese also called Tekkek√∂y Maƒüda (place of metal) and set up workshops to craft the metals attained from the local mines. In fact, they say that the east door of the currently nonexistent Samsun Castle was called the Maƒüda Door. The Hacƒ± Osman grove, which stretches along the coast, Kapaklƒ± Pƒ±nar, Kƒ±rantepe, Azman, and Asaraƒüa√ß hills at 700 to 800 m altitudes are popular spots for picnicking and other recreational activities.  Kur≈üunlu Waterfalls in B√ºy√ºkl√º  The Kur≈üunlu Waterfalls are found near B√ºy√ºkl√º neighborhood.  The old railway station buildings  The old railway station buildings will be restored and the surrounding area will be prepared to be a nostalgic park with a city museum and tourism information office.  Local cuisine  The cultural richness of Tekkek√∂y, with the exchange population, locals, Circassians, Georgians, Romans etc., has also affected the local cuisine. Rice with goose meat, yufka (a very thin sheet of dough) with meat, mincemeat pastries (b√∂rek) and oven kebabs are popular dishes in the area. Moreover, the local delicacy, Black Sea anchovy (hamsi) is heavily featured on menus and fabricated into various dishes such as rice and bread. It is also widely served as pan-fried. The exchange population's cuisine also has cultural significance in the local dishes, the most important being the patented Gama B√∂reƒüi. In addition, Kocakarƒ± Gerdanƒ± (meaning old woman's neck), which is a sweet pasty roll, is advertised as a local delicacy. It was introduced in fairs and received wide recognition.  Festivals and carnivals  Every year the Tekkek√∂y Municipality organizes a Nature, Culture, and Tourism Festival. Traditional Oil Wrestling Championship attracts many visitors and is gradually becoming as important as the Kƒ±rkpƒ±nar Oil Wrestling Championship. Every year, second week of May, there is a Tree Planting and Calf Contest in Karaper√ßin Village. Locals also hold Highland Festivals in neighborhoods that are former villages.
