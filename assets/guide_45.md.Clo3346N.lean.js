Like other places in the Salamiyah area that the Ottoman authorities encouraged to be repopulated, the settlers of Taldara came from the Mawali, Nu'aym and Uqaydat tribes. However, just two years later, Taldara and all of the other villages of Salamiyah were reported to have been deserted. Tall ad Dirrah was re-established in the late 19th century by Ismaili migrants from other parts of northern Syria who chose to settle the place because of worsening economic conditions in the interior parts of Syria, the low taxes that living in the Syrian Desert fringes offered, and the place's proximity to Salamiyah, the center of Ismaili life in Syria.

It is a gas- operated firearm featuring a closed, rotating bolt. These design features, rare in submachine guns, were chosen to enhance the safety of the user and to have a more reliable firearm. It was designed in 2013 and was released to the general public in 2015. It features the SIG Sauer short stroke push-rod gas system to reduce the recoil and improves the reliability of the weapon. The MPX, in its second generation, features a system that would allow for conversion from 9mm to .357 SIG or .40 S&W.; However, since its inception, first party conversion kits have not been made available for either of the two production generations of the gun. SIG Sauer also used the same gas piston system to develop the SIG MCX carbine. Design details The standard variant of the MPX comes with an 8.0 inch (20.3 cm) barrel and is chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge. It comes with a collapsible stock and a free-floating rail. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 850 rounds per minute (RPM). The MPX is also available with different barrel lengths, ranging from 114 to 406mm (4.5- to 16-inch). The MPX submachine gun is only available for military and law enforcement use, while a semi-automatic only version is also available for the civilian market. The semi-automatic version of the weapon can be registered as a Short-Barreled Rifle in most states in the United States. =Features= The standard MPX submachine gun comes with a rear and front flip-up sights that is attached to the integrated rail system on the top of the weapon. One available modification is a SIG reflex sight mounted to the rail instead of the flip-up sights. The MPX has a short-stroke gas piston system in order to increase the accuracy of the weapon which operates in closed bolt. It is designed in this way to prevent water or dirt from entering the chamber and causing malfunctions as well as to use a suppressor with greater ease. It features an ambidextrous selector switch for fully automatic (law enforcement/military models) and semi-automatic. It also features an ambidextrous bolt catch, and the weapons exterior appears to be a cross between an AR-15 and a Heckler & Koch MP5A3. The barrel is free-floating and is surrounded by polymer/steel Picatinny rail (later M-LOK) mounts. The charging handle of the weapon is at the back of the weapon, based on the AR-15 design. This is to ensure that cocking the weapon does not interfere with any optics mounted onto the Picatinny rail. The weapon's rails are made out of cast steel and the standard weapon overall weighs .

MPX-K (Compact variant) A compact variant with a 114 mm (4.5 inch) barrel.

MPX PSB (Pistol variant)  A semi-automatic only pistol variant with a SIG SBX pistol stabilizing brace and an 203 mm (8.0 inch) barrel. In the US in 2015 the BATFE warned users of weapons using SIG stabilizing braces that shouldering a weapon fitted with a brace constituted the making of a Title II NFA weapon, reversing a prior ruling that it did not.The Rise And Fall Of The SB-15 ‚ÄòSig Brace‚Äô Grand View Outdoors. March 24, 2015. In early 2017, however, the BATFE withdrew this opinion, once again making stabilizing braces an attractive solution.

SIG contended that this device was a muzzle brake, but in 2013 the BATFE ruled that the component was a suppressor, and classified the MPX-C as possessing an integral suppressor and thus as a Title II NFA weapon. The BATFE rejected an appeal against this ruling in February 2014; SIG responded by filing a civil lawsuit against the BATFE,\\"ATF Rules Against SIG MPX\\", The Outdoor Wire, 14 April 2014 alleging they had acted in an \\"arbitrary and capricious manner\\". In September 2015, Federal Judge Paul Barbadora upheld the BATFE's ruling.\\"Judge favors ATF in Sig lawsuit: It's a silencer\\", Guns.com, 25 September 2015 As a result of this SIG has announced a carbine variant with a 406 mm (16 inch) barrel without the muzzle device, designated as the MPX Carbine.

The ability of this small vessel to reach remote locations on the river system was cited many years later as evidence in support of the important legal concept of navigability.State of Oregon, Dept. of State Lands, Report and Recommendations on the Navigable Waters of Oregon (Jan. 1983), at pages 38-53.. This steamboat should not be confused with a somewhat larger vessel, also named Myrtle, which was built in 1908 at Prosper, Oregon, but which was home-ported much further north, at Astoria. Construction Myrtle was built at Myrtle Point, Oregon, in 1909 for service on the Coquille River with the Myrtle Point Transportation Company.Newell, Gordon R., H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest, Superior (1966), at pages 162, 242, 327, and 484. The steamer was long, with a beam of and depth of hold of . U.S. Treasury Dept., Statistics Bureau, Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1911), at page 253. The overall size of the vessel was 36 gross and 29 registered tons. Myrtle engines generated 20 horsepower. Total crew specified in the U.S. steamship registry was two. The vessel was assigned U.S. registry no. 206743.  Placed into service On Monday, September 13, 1909, Myrtle was brought to Coquille for inspection.Coos Bay Times, September 17, 1909, page 2, col. 3. Some minor changes were anticipated, such as enlarging of the vessels wheel. Once these were effected, Myrtle owners, Captain Panter, and, from Myrtle Point, Engineer Kimes, planned to place the vessel on the run from Myrtle Point to Coquille, replacing the steamer Echo, which needed to be withdrawn from service for repairs.  Upper river navigation On account of its small size, Myrtle was able to reach the extreme reaches of navigable waters on the Coquille River system.Farnell, James E., \\"Coos and Coquille Rivers Navigability Studies\\", State of Oregon, Division of State Lands (Nov. 1979). In December 1911, Myrtle, which normally ran between Coquille City and Myrtle Point, was able to reach Gravelford on the north fork of the Coquille River, at river mile 10, meaning 10 miles up river from the confluence of the north and south forks just downriver from Myrtle Point. In February 1918, Myrtle reached Fox Bridge, at river mile 14.3. On the east fork of the Coquille River, which begins at river mile 10, that is, approximately Gravelford, Myrtle was able, in February 1918, to navigate to river mile 1.5 to carry a load of hay to the Weekly ranch. The south fork of the Coquille River begins just below Myrtle Point and then continues in a general direction east. In December 1912, on the south fork of the Coquille, Myrtle was able to travel to river mile 10 on the south fork to pick up a load of dairy products from a creamery at Broadbent, Oregon. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the operations of Myrtle were analyzed in terms of whether they, in conjunction with other evidence, rendered the tributaries of the Coquille River navigable and thus by law making them subject to the ownership of the State of Oregon. Myrtle single trip to the creamery at Broadbent was found, by the report submitted to the state legislature, not itself sufficient evidence that the south fork of the Coquille was navigable. Stranding and court case On the night of October 7, 1913, Myrtle and the sternwheeler Dora were pulled away from their mooring and severely damaged.Myrtle Point Trans. Co. vs. Port of Coquille, 86 Or. 311, 168 Pac. Rptr. 625 (1918). Myrtle Point Transportation Company, the owner of the two vessels, sued the Port of Coquille for damages, alleging that slashings left up river had backed up the flow of water, so with the first rain a surge had come downriver, washing away the boom to which the boats had been moored, and depositing them on a jetty far downriver.\\"Myrtle Point Transportation Gets $1,750 -- Port of Coquille Blamed for Putting Brush in River Which Resulted in Damage to Boats\\", Coos Bay Times, June 15, 1915, page 1, col. 4. In 1915 the case came to trial before the Coos County Circuit Court, with Judge John S. Coke presiding. Trial took over three days and 41 witnesses testified. One witness who had seen the boom torn away stated that \\"the brush came down the river with such force and so high that it brushed the county bridge, 35 feet above the water and shook it.\\" The transportation company claimed losses of $2,500, representing $1,000 in damage to the boats, $800 in repairs, and $700 in lost revenues from the boats when they were taken from their run. The Port of Coquille alleged that the milling company's boom was too far out in the stream and that the boat company had been negligent in mooring their boats to the boom. The port also claimed the boat company was negligent by not posting a night watchman on the boats, and that had steam been kept up, the boats could have avoided being stranded on the jetty. The port also claimed that the lumber company's boom was defective. The jury however on June 11, 1915, returned a verdict in favor of the boat company, and awarded damages against the Port of Coquille in the amount of $1,750. The port appealed, but the Supreme Court of Oregon ruled against them, finding that the evidence, evaluated in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, that is, the boat company, was sufficient to sustain the verdict. Fines for defective equipment In September 1915, as part of a widespread effort by the steamboat inspection service to crack down on safety violations in the Coos Bay area, the owners of the steamer Myrtle (W.R. Panter, T.W. Panter, W.A. Panter, S. Hufford, and Elmer Hufford) were fined $10 for not having an endorsement for change of master for the vessel, $100 for no fog horn, and $100 for having a defective fire extinguisher on board.Boatmen Heavily Fined -- Inspector McGrath Inflicts Punishment for Failures to Comply with the Law -- Aggregate $5350 -- Long List of Those Alleged to Have Violated Regulations Required on Bay\\", Coos Bay Times, September 20, 1915, page 1. The occasion for the fines was the then recent (July 24, 1915) disaster in Chicago to the steamship Eastland, The possible remission of fines following compliance was not ruled out by the inspectors. Competition Myrtle was opposed by the motor launch Charm, and had difficulty competing with the rival vessel. Sinking at the dock In February 1921, Myrtle sank at a dock at Myrtle Point.King, Chuck, Kirk, Linda, and Prola, Carolyn, Myrtle Creek and Vicinity: 1893-1950, Arcadia 2014, at page 27. On board was a cargo consisting of most of a rail car load of canned carrots. The sternwheeler Dora, then also owned by the Panter family doing business as the Myrtle Point Transportation Company, was sent to Myrtle Point to aid in the salvage of Myrtle and the cargo. Reconstruction Myrtle, small vessel on lett, abandoned, circa 1941. On right is Telegraph, also abandoned. In 1922, Myrtle reconstructed by being reduced in length by and converted to freight service. The conversion was done at the Herman Bros. yard at Prosper. For a time thereafter James W. Exon, of Portland, Oregon operated the vessel on the river. Disposition Myrtle was abandoned along the bank of the Coquille River on the ranch of Paris Ward, one of the shareholders in the Myrtle Point Transportation Company.Mills, Randall V., Sternwheelers Up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country, U. of Nebraska (1947), at page 198 Panter, William, \\"Early River Traffic on the Coquille,\\" Glancing Back (Pioneer Lore), at 16-19, Vol. I, No. 1, Coos- Curry Pioneer and Historical Association, 1971Marshall, Don, Oregon Shipwrecks, Binford and Mort Publishing, Portland, OR (1984), at page 220  See also  *Steamboats of the Coquille River  Notes   References * Historic Oregon Newspapers Category:1909 ships Category:Coos Bay Mosquito Fleet Category:Steamboats of Oregon Category:Ships built in Oregon ","title":"Myrtle (sternwheeler)"},{"id":"43368142","title":"Diving at the 2014 South American Games ‚Äì Women's 3 metre springboard"},{"id":"43368156","text":"Neoschoenobia caustodes is a moth in the family Crambidae.

In 1919 with the end of the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War, which resulted in the takeover of western Ukraine by the Second Polish Republic, many former leaders of the Ukrainian republic were exiled.Christopher Gilley (2006). A Simple Question of 'Pragmatism'? Sovietophilism in the West Ukrainian Emigration in the 1920s Working Paper: Koszalin Institute of Comparative European Studies pp.6-13 As Polish persecution of Ukrainians during the interwar period increased, many Ukrainians (particularly the youth, many of whom felt they had no future) lost faith in traditional legal approaches, in their elders, and in the western democracies who were seen as turning their backs on Ukraine. This period of disillusionment coincided with the increase in support for the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). By the beginning of the Second World War, the OUN was estimated to have 20,000 active members and many times that number in sympathizers.Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp.441-446. The song was written in 1929 during the midst of these political events and adopted by the organization's leadership 3 years later. The March of the Ukrainian Nationalists is written and performed as a military march and a call to arms. The first verse of the song refers to \\"the pain of losing Ukraine\\", referring to the short-lived independence of the Ukrainian National Republic from 1917-1921.

And here we walk in the battle of life - Solid, durable, unbreakable, like granite, For crying hasn't given freedom to anyone yet, But whoever is a fighter, he conquers the world. We don't want neither glory, nor payment. Payment for us - is the luxury of fighting! It is sweeter for us to die in battle, Than to live in bondage, as mute slaves. Enough of ruins and disagreements for us, A brother will not dare to go to war against a brother! Under the blue-yellow flag of freedom We will unite all of our great people. A united nation one for us all is that one truth This is our proud call to all people: Be faithful to your homeland until death, For us, Ukraine is above all else! The glory of fallen fighters leads us into battle, And the highest order we shall fulfill: For a \\"united Ukrainian nation - Free and strong, from the San to the Kavkaz\\"!

Early life and education  Hepp was born in Ulm in Bavaria, the son of military veterinarian Dr. Leo Hepp (1871‚Äì1950). He completed his secondary education at Karlsgymnasium in Stuttgart, taking his Abitur in the spring of 1925.  Career  = Pre-war = After taking his Abitur earlier in 1925, Hepp enlisted in the Reichswehr and was assigned to Signals Detachment 5 in Bad Cannstatt. After attending the Infantry School in Dresden and Artillery School in J√ºterbog, he was commissioned as a Leutnant in Signals Detachment 5 and a few years later he was promoted to Oberleutnant. From 1935 to 1937, Hepp was an intelligence instructor at the Munich Kriegsschule of the Wehrmacht. = World War II = During World War II, he initially served on the Western Front in France as a staff officer of the 12th Army, before being sent in December 1940 to the Balkans. On 2 March 1941 he arrived in Bucharest, and when the 12th Army participated in the occupation of Greece shortly thereafter he served as a logistics staff officer in Thessaloniki and Athens. From July 1942 to May 1943, he served as the personnel staff officer for the 9th Infantry Division, with the rank of Oberstleutnant. From February 1944 to the end of the war in May 1945, Hepp served as chief of staff for the Chief Signals Officer at the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, under General der Nachrichtentruppe Erich Fellgiebel and Generalleutnant Albert Praun. = Post- war = After the war, Hepp was kept as a prisoner of the United States military, and called as a witness at the Nuremberg Trials. He joined the Gehlen Organization, a German intelligence agency established in Allied- occupied Germany by the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, serving as the head of signals intelligence from 1946 to 1956. Under Hepp's leadership, West Germany's first electronic listening posts were set up to spy on East Germany, including the famous post at Tutzing disguised as the private firm \\"S√ºdlabor GmbH\\". His department of the Gehlen Organization was very helpful to the U.S. intelligence community's efforts to track the movements of Soviet fighter and attack aircraft units. His successor as head of signals intelligence was his old boss Albert Praun. = Bundeswehr = In September 1956, Hepp joined the newly formed armed forces of West Germany, the Bundeswehr. From December 1959 to October 1960, he was commander of the newly formed 10th Panzer Division headquartered in Sigmaringen. From October 1960 to September 1961, he was Deputy Inspector of the Army and Chief of the General Staff, based in Bonn. In October 1961, Hepp was appointed the commander of the II Corps headquartered in Ulm, and in February 1962, he was promoted to the rank of Generalleutant. While he was corps commander, he had to handle the controversy surrounding the \\"Nagold affair\\" in 1963. This ensued when a recruit collapsed from heat exhaustion during a march of the 6/9 Fallschirmj√§ger Training Company from Nagold on July 25, and died in hospital a week later. Hepp made the decision, without consulting the Federal Ministry of Defence, to disband the training company for not adhering to proper training methods. In May 1967, Hepp was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit with Star. In September 1967, Hepp retired from the Bundeswehr and passed command of II Corps on to Generalleutnant Karl Wilhlem Thilo. = Federal Intelligence Service = After his retirement from the military, Hepp returned briefly to intelligence, serving in the Federal Intelligence Service from 1970 to 1972 as the leader of the signals intelligence division at Pullach.

In 1938, Heywood joined the Society for Psychical Research. She is most well known for her book The Sixth Sense (1959) and her autobiography, The Infinite Hive (1964). Heywood would later become the Vice- President of the SPR. The psychical researcher Ren√©e Haynes wrote that her books have \\"illuminated the subject matter of parapsychology for thousands of readers inside the Society and beyond.\\"Haynes, Ren√©e. (1982). The Society for Psychical Research, 1882-1982: A History. Macdonald. p. 207. It was alleged that Heywood experienced cases of extrasensory perception (ESP). She also wrote on paranormal topics. In her book The Sixth Sense Heywood endorsed the cross-correspondences, ESP experiments, mediumship and psychic phenomena.Higgens, Humphrey. (1959).

Heywood described the case of Ossowiecki who had guessed the contents of a sealed envelope in 1933, Hansel wrote that the conditions of the experiment were reminiscent of a simple conjuring trick.Hansel, C.

He was initially a realist, but later turned to impressionism.  Life and work  He was born in Norway, where his father was employed by a Belgian company, but left there at an early age. When he was twelve, he began taking drawing lessons from Edouard Agneessens. Beginning in 1876, he enrolled at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux- Arts, where he studied under Jean-Fran√ßois Portaels. Later, he studied with Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts in Paris.The Strand Magazine, Vol.32 @ Google Books In 1883, he became one of the founding members of the secessionist group Les XX. At this time his painting style began to rely more on color and the use of light to express fleeting moods and he is considered to be one of the creators of a style that came to be called luminism. In 1884, he was awarded the Prix Godecharle. He was very fond of travelling. In 1886, he took a trip to Florida and lived in India from 1891 to 1896. On his return to Belgium, he settled in Weert, on the Schelde River, making the Belgian countryside his main theme. He was a lecturer at the Royal Academy from 1900 to 1931.

In rural populations around the world, approximately 15% of people do not have access to improved water systems, and between 30-50% have unimproved sanitation systems. Focusing on Latin American communities, WEFTA's mission is to ensure access to potable water and proper sanitation, reduce waterborne diseases, protect the environment, and lessen the burden of hauling and disinfecting water on families, especially the women and children. Structure WEFTA is an all-volunteer organization. The volunteer board of directors is made up of water engineers and community development professionals from several firms in the southwest United States, most notably Souder Miller & Associates (New Mexico) and Aqua Engineering (Utah). Engineers from these and other firms donate their expertise to help communities in Latin America build and maintain simple, inexpensive potable water and basic sanitation systems. Volunteers use vacation time or are on loan from their companies while on assignment. WEFTA works only when requested by the benefitting community, which covers the volunteer‚Äôs expenses on the ground. Transportation to projects is donated by individuals and through grants to cover overhead expenses through the Wallace Genetic Foundation. WEFTA also partners with UniversalGiving to raise fund for projects. 100% of any other donations received by WEFTA go directly to fund material costs for projects (such as PVC pipe, hand pumps, water purifiers, etc.). How it Works A community needing water or sanitation generally hears about WEFTA through word of mouth. A leader of that community fills out an application and submits it to WEFTA in Santa Fe or to a local WEFTA volunteer. Before committing to a project, a WEFTA member meets with the entire community to identify the community leader who will manage the role of the beneficiaries of the project. The local community must collect 30-40% of the material cost of the project or apply for these funds from their municipalities or regional governments. WEFTA often matches these funds, which are low due to the low- tech nature of the projects. The community performs all unskilled labor and also collects materials such as gravel or sand, depending on the project. One or more water engineers visit and live within the community and design the simplest, most easy to maintain system possible to provide potable water and/or basic sanitation. The volunteer stays until the project is completed and WEFTA returns approximately every two years to ensure that the system is still functioning and is well maintained. Once a community is engaged with WEFTA, WEFTA guarantees to maintain and repair the water system for life with the help of the community. Work to Date In 2011, WEFTA was invited by a group of municipalities in the Urubamba Valley of Peru‚Äîthe Sacred Valley of the Incas and site of a quickly developing tourism industry‚Äîto devise a simple solution for waste water treatment of the polluted Urubamba river. WEFTA representatives have made several trips there and submitted plans to use cheap, effective organic biodigesters to replace the costly and inefficient traditional chemical or filtration plants. In November 2013, WEFTA entered into a partnership with USAID-ACCESO to promote health and livelihoods of over 300,000 residents of western Honduras with WEFTA upgrading and building new water system worth approximately US$350,000 to achieve those ends. As of May 2014, WEFTA has completed 62 projects in seven countries (Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Peru). These projects have directly provided approximately 3,400 families (17,000 individuals) with potable water and/or basic sanitation or waste water treatment. WEFTA has worked with partners around the country and at the request of Save the Children in Honduras, Habitat for Humanity in Guatemala and Peru, Lutheran World Relief, and Homes from the Heart. In addition to designing and building water systems, WEFTA also provides training and education to partners in the countries it serves, seeking to empower local engineers and technicians to carry forward the work WEFTA has started with community-based, self-help projects. WEFTA has also held several WASH-in-Schools programs and built toilet, shower and drinking-water facilities for regional schools in Peru and Bolivia.

It controlled international trade of the Commonwealth via the Black Sea ports. Kompania Handlowa Polska was formally opened by Antoni Protazy Potocki on March 18, 1783 in Winnica, Poland (now: Vinnytsia, Ukraine). Following the First Partition of Poland (1772), the Commonwealth lost land connection with its major Baltic Sea port, Gda≈Ñsk. Polish goods, transported northwards along the Vistula, were subject to high Prussian duties, with tax offices located at Fordon and Kwidzyn. As a result, Polish merchants and magnates were forced to find another trade route. Main Polish export at that time was agricultural produce from fertile lands of Polish Ukraine (see chernozem). From 1768 Poland was a de facto Russian Empire protectorate. Furthermore, as a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74), the Russians seized Black Sea coast together with the Crimea, and gained free pass of their ships through the Turkish Straits. Polish magnates decided to take advantage of this, and approached Russian government, asking for permission to use their Black Sea ports. In early 1783, Empress Catherine the Great allowed Poles to use the port of Kherson, built in 1775. Soon afterwards, a Polish consulate was opened there, together with a department store. No Russian duties were imposed on Polish goods at Kherson. In 1785, Antoni Protazy Potocki purchased land in the town of Jampol, and built there the Dniester river port, together with warehouses. Potocki personally talked to a number of magnates and merchants, urging them to abandon the Vistula river trade, and move southwards, to Polish Ukraine. He was supported by Michal Ossowski, a merchant from Pomerelia, Potocki's friend and adviser. Ossowski was chief agent of Prot Potocki's bank, also operating company's office in Kherson. At first the company transported its goods only to Kherson, where they were loaded on Russian ships, and transported to Western European ports. Later on, the company bought several ships, with mostly international crews. First ship of Trade Company Poland was Sw. Michal; in 1784, Polska, Ukraina, Podole, Jampol and Sw. Prot were bought. As a result of these purchases, first regular Polish merchant fleet was created. Its ships sailed mostly from Kherson to Marseilles, but also to Barcelona, and Alexandria. Ships of the Company Fleet used a modified Russian Navy Ensign, with a blue St. Andrew's Cross and a Polish eagle on a red rectangle in upper left corner. This banner was a compromise: according to international treaties, only ships equipped with Habsburg and Russian banners were allowed to pass through the Turkish Straits. Polish historian Antoni Rolle argues however that ships of the Company Fleet used a traditional Polish banner (white eagle on red field), which was changed only for the passage through the straits. The development of Black Sea trade resulted in decrease in Polish exports through Baltic Sea ports of Gda≈Ñsk and K√∂nigsberg. Furthermore, prices of Ukrainian grains went up. The price of shares of the company was estimated at 1000 red zlotys, with maximum number of ten shares per a shareholder. Its statute allowed foreigners to purchase shares, and the company was personally supported by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, who himself negotiated with Catherine the Great the conditions of usage of the port of Kherson. Furthermore, it enjoyed the support of Primate Michal Poniatowski. The development of Black Sea trade was slow, due to several factors, such as: * underdevelopment of Ukrainian agriculture and infrastructure, * financial problems of Polish merchants, * long and hazardous route from Kherson to Western Europe, via the Mediterranean, * high costs of transport, * natural obstacles along the Dniestr river route, such as rocks and waterfalls near Jampol. The company began to decline after the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì92), when most ships were seized by the Russians to transport their troops. By 1793, it virtually ceased to exist, also because of financial problems of Potocki and loss of agricultural lands in the second partition of Poland. Furthermore, one of its major investors, Warsaw bank of Tepper-Ferguson declared bankruptcy.  Sources  * Ba≈Çtruszajtys Gra≈ºyna, \\"Kompanie akcyjne w Polsce w drugiej po≈Çowie XVIII wieku\\".

The icon, whose size was 70 x 51 centimeters, was crowned on July 16, 1756. At that time, it was kept at a Roman Catholic shrine at Berdyczow, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (now: Berdychiv, Ukraine). The shrine in Berdyczhow was the most important such location of the Kiev Voivodeship, and whole Polish Ukraine (see Shrines to the Virgin Mary). left The original painting of Our Lady of Berdyczow perished in a 1941 fire. Its copy (143 x 93 cm) was made in 1991 by a painter and restorer from Krakow, Bozena Mucha-Sowinska. The history of the shrine dates back to 1630, when Voivode of Kiev Janusz Tyszkiewicz built a Discalced Carmelites church and a monastery, as a votum for his release from Ottoman captivity. Tyszkiewicz presented to the church the icon of Virgin Mary, kept by his family. Due to numerous wars and conflicts of the 17th century, the icon was kept at Lwow (1648-1721) and Lublin (1722-1736). Since the Berdyczow icon was associated with several miracles, Pope Benedict XIV agreed to crown it with golden crowns. The coronation took place on July 16, 1756, and the ceremony was led by Bishop of Kiev Kajetan Soltyk. From May 28 until June 14, 1768, Polish rebels under Kazimierz Pulaski defended the monastery from Russian troops (see Bar Confederation). In 1820, when Berdyczow was part of the Russian Empire, the papal crowns were stolen. Pope Pius IX sent new ones, and the re-crowning ceremony took place on June 6, 1856, ordained by Bishop of Luck and Zytomierz, Kasper Borowski. In 1924, Soviet authorities seized the monastery together with the church, opening here a museum and a cinema. The icon was preserved as a piece of art. In 1941, the complex, together with the icon, burned in a great fire. Carmelite monks returned to Berdychiv in 1991. On July 19, 1997, Bishop of Kiev and Zhytomir, Jan Purwinski, blessed the copy of the original icon. Third crowning of Our Lady of Berdychiv took place on July 16, 1998. On October 27, 2001, the church at Berdychiv was named all-Ukrainian national sanctuary.  Sources  * Miejsca swiete Rzeczypospolitej. Leksykon, red.

A. longaeva was one of five insect species described by the paleoentomologist Samuel Hubbard Scudder in an 1877 paper. History and classification Aphaenogaster longaeva is known from a single insect which is a compression-impression fossil preserved in fine shale of the Quesnel beds, possibly Fraser Formation, near Quesnel, British Columbia. During the initial surveys of the area by George Mercer Dawson, clay silt and sand outcrops were identified along the banks of the Fraser River, and a small sampling was performed by Dawson. The fossils were mostly of plants such as beech, walnut, and poplar. Scudder in 1890 notes that the fossil insects collected represented twenty-five species, dominated by Hymenoptera and Diptera specimens, with a single Coleopteran fossil found. Dawson tentatively assigned the Quesnel fossils a Miocene age based on the floral similarity to fossil sites of Alaska. The age of the site has been changed at least twice since the original description, with the fossils being listed as Eocene in age in a 1978 paper by Laurie Burnham. Most recently the site has a suggested age of Oligocene in a 2000 paper on the fossils of nearby Quilchena, British Columbia. At the time of description the species was known from a single fragmentary fossil and its less detailed counterpart. The part side of the holotype was deposited in collections of the Canadian Geological Survey while the counterpart was placed in the Museum of Comparative Zoology paleontology collections at Harvard University. Along with a number of other insect type specimens, the A. longaeva holotype counterpart is part of the Samuel Hubbard Scudder insect collection donated to Harvard in 1902. The fossil was first studied by paleoentomologist Scudder with his 1877 type description of the new species being published in an addendum to Dawson's Report of Progress, Geological Survey of Canada, 1875-76\\\\. The etymology for the specific epithet longaeva was not given with the type description. A. longaeva was one of five Formicidae species which Scudder described in the paper. Placement of the species into Aphaenogaster was based on the very similar vein structure and shape of the discoidal cell between A. longaeva and \\"Aphaenogaster\\" berendti, described from Baltic amber. However the latter species was subsequently moved to the genus Stenamma as Stenamma berendti. Due to the incomplete nature of the type specimens used in Scudder's descriptions, four of the five species from Quesnel were considered to be of uncertain genus by Frank M. Carpenter in his review of North American ant fossils, with A. longaeva listed as \\"(Myrmicinae) longaeva\\".  Description  The Aphaenogaster longaeva fossil is a jumble of parts that obscure the total length of the adult, though the preserved wings and body segments possibly indicate it to be a male. Scudder in 1890 indicates the fossil to contain portions of the head, antennae, thorax, legs and wings. The wing overall would have had an approximate length, if complete, of , and is wide. It shows a darkened coloration from the pterostigma to the wing tip, with the pterostigma itself being the darkest portion of the wing. The wing also shows a scattered covering of small hairs that Scudder described as \\"excessively delicate\\".

Espinal was abducted in the vicinity of Santa Rita, in the department of Yoro, early on the morning of 20 July 2014. He was found dead, a victim of multiple gunshot wounds, in a nearby location on the morning of 21 July. He was the forty-third journalist killed in Honduras since 2013. Early life and education Espinal was born and raised in the Santa Rita district of Yoro. In a 2009 interview he said that from an early age he had aspirations of becoming a journalist. In his youth, Espinal was active in the La Fragua theater company in El Progreso, Yoro. Career His first job as a journalist was with a local television channel in Agua Blanca Sur, Yoro, as a reporter and a presenter. He did both his own field work and presented it later on camera. He told an interviewer that journalists should always be \\"objective, impartial, and honest\\", and that journalists who take bribes will ultimately be exposed, adding, \\"Truth is mighty and will prevail\\". He also worked as a correspondent for Radio Progreso. Both the La Frague theater company and Radio Progreso were founded by the Jesuit order in El Progreso, Yoro. As chief correspondent for Hoy Mismo, which aired in San Pedro Sula, Cort√©s, Honduras's second largest city, he coordinated all news reports from northern Honduras. On multiple occasions he ran as a Liberal Party candidate for city council, and at the time of his death was planning to run yet again. He said in 2009 that his \\"greatest personal ambition\\" was to pursue investigative journalism and to become mayor of Santa Rita and create new work opportunities for the town. The two people he admired most, he stated, were his grandmother, \\"a worthy example of perseverance and triumph\\", and his mother. At the time of his murder, he was living in an apartment in San Pedro Sula. Murder Espinal was found dead on 21 July 2014. He was 31 at the time of his murder. In the aftermath of his murder, contradictory information circulated regarding the last hours of his life and the circumstances of his death. Some sources claimed he was shot two times, others that he had been shot up to five times. One report of his death stated that the city in which he worked, San Pedro Sula, is \\"considered the most violent city in the most violent country on the planet\\". Espinal's mother stated that he had been at her home in Santa Rita watching television around 9 p.m. on July 19 when an unidentified man phoned and arranged a meeting, which Espinal agree to. Later that evening, according to multiple accounts, Espinal met with friends at a restaurant in Santa Rita, and also left with friends very early on the morning of July 20, 2014. He reportedly arrived back at his mother's home around 3 a.m., parked his car in front of the house, and then voluntarily entered a white panel truck in which three other persons were seated. Some sources added further details, some of which appeared to conflict with others for timeline reasons. It was stated, for example, that Espinal, after leaving Las Tejas at around 2 a.m., had soon after joined up with friends with whom he proceeded to socialize at various other places in Santa Rita. Another detail that was mentioned in some reports but not others had Espinal arriving that same night at the Paradise Motel shortly after 3:00 a.m. and leaving it shortly before 4:00 a.m. At least one source stated that he had entered the Paradise Motel with \\"a man of fair complexion, height about tall and burly\\", and had left the motel with that man, Espinal being at that point \\"semi-naked\\". Also at around 4 a.m., a source reported Espinal heading alone toward a bridge in Santa Rita, looking \\"distressed\\". At the same hour, residents of the neighbourhood of Echeverry were said to have \\"heard several explosions\\" near another bridge in Llano Campo in Santa Cruz de Yojoa. In addition, a guard interviewed by police reported that he had heard blasts of gunfire around 4:00 am. Authorities stated that Espinal had been murdered at 4:05 a.m. According to one source, his family was informed of his disappearance several hours later that morning and reported him missing soon after, with some reports placing this action shortly after noon that day. =Discovery= Espinal's body was reportedly discovered along a road between the towns of El Olivar and La Danta in an area called El Batey, in the department of Yoro. He was allegedly found face down and shirtless, his body already partially decomposed and his face disfigured by gunfire. Several reports variously described his body as having been found in a vacant lot, in bushes in a pasture, and in a ditch. One report indicated that according to forensics reports, he had been shot five times, sustaining wounds to his arm, torso, neck, and a fatal shot to the back of the head, and had been killed about 24 hours before his body was found, which was inconsistent with known facts. His body was reportedly identified at the scene by his stepfather, Jos√© Santos Ram√≠rez, and another relative, Jos√© Jim√©nez. On the same day that Espinal's body was found, a pool of blood and shell casings were purportedly found on a bridge over the Humuya River on the road between Santa Rita and La Barca. =Reactions= In a piece published on July 26, a local commentator summarized the multiple inconsistencies among the various accounts of Espinal's last hours and murder. The commentator further maintained that the investigation of Espinal's death was marred by corruption and incompetence, and accused the prosecution, which had claimed the case was solved, of being determined to convict innocent persons and protect the real murderers. In addition, the commentator opined that it was highly suspicious, given the confusion surrounding the basic facts of the case, and given the long investigations that had followed similar murders in Honduras, for authorities to claim that they had solved the crime within five days of its commission. Two major Honduran civil-society groups, La Asociaci√≥n para una Ciudadan√≠a Participativa (ACI PARTICIPA) and El Centro de Prevenci√≥n, Tratamiento y Rehabilitaci√≥n de Victimas de la Tortura y sus Familiares (CPTRT), expressed deep concern over the disappearance and murder of Espinal. Juan Mairena, head of the Honduran journalists' association, called his murder \\"a heavy blow for journalism\\". After the Honduran Minister of Security, Arturo Corrales, suggested that the killing may have been a crime of passion or the result of an inheritance dispute, rather than an act of retribution motivated by his work as a reporter, PEN, the international organization for writers, expressed concern that investigators had ruled out Espinal's activity as a journalist as a possible motive within 24 hours of his body being found. Investigation and arrests Just as there were inconsistencies in reports of Espinal's last hours and death, there were also apparent inconsistencies in reports about the subsequent investigation and arrests. On 23 July, Rigoberto Zambrano, who was purportedly in possession of the T-shirt Espinal had worn on the night of his disappearance and the gun used to shoot him, was taken into custody. Zambrano professed his innocence. It was reported that by 25 July, as a result of raids in Santa Rita, a total of four people had been arrested in connection with the murder. Corrales asserted that three people had been involved in the crime, and that the individual who had actually committed the murder was now outside the country. In mid-August Corrales said, \\"We know who did it, the reasons, and there is plenty of evidence\\". Jos√© Rafael Bueso Oseguera, alias Lito Lito Kasasa, who was said to be the last known person to be with Espinal, was arrested on 29 August, and reports stated that he was the second person to be arrested in connection with the murder. Like Zambrano, Bueso declared his innocence, although he admitted that on the night of Espinal's disappearance he, Bueso, had also been at Las Tejas, where both he and Espinal had attended a party. It was reported that Bueso, after his arrest, had spoken with police for six hours and that he maintained that authorities had singled him out only because he owned a white vehicle similar to the one that Espinal had last been seen entering. Authorities stated with \\"great fanfare\\" on 29 August that Bueso was \\"instrumental\\" in the case, but the next day they released him, citing lack of evidence of his involvement. On 31 August, the public prosecutor claimed that Bueso had never been detained, but had simply been interviewed as a witness because he was one of the last people to see Espinal alive. A local commentator, who criticized authorities on 31 August for their supposed sloppiness in the matter of Bueso, also charged them with failing to follow up leads properly and refusing to make information about the investigation publicly available. This same commentator also made sweeping accusations of official corruption and incompetence in the handling of the case, and noted that suspicion had now fallen upon a person named Juan Carlos Acosta Manzanares, although a similarity in names and appearance had caused someone named Juan Carlos Acostas Mel√©ndez to be dragged into the case. On 1 September, Espinal's mother issued a statement urging authorities to solve the crime. Hugo Maldonado, vice president of the Comit√© de Derechos Humanos (Codeh), said that it was lamentable that there was so much impunity in Honduras and that authorities might not want to make public the name of Espinal's real assassin. A September 22 report indicated that Espinal's family had issued another such statement, calling directly on the president of Honduras for action in solving Espinal's murder and bringing his killers to justice. It was noted that as of September 22, one individual had been detained in connection with the murder, but that person was not considered a perpetrator, and that there was also an arrest order out for another person in connection with the murder. In mid-September 2014, Hector Hernandez, coordinator of forensic medicine in San Pedro Sula, who had already been subjected to a 15-day suspension, was removed from his position because he had made public statements about the murder of Espinal. He had said that Espinal had died of multiple gunshot wounds, even though evidence had not yet been collected at the scene. While Hernandez would continue to operate as a forensic doctor on call, he would no longer be coordinator of the city morgue.

The first was DAP Racing, a horse racing partnership between Perry Martin from Yuba City, California, and Steve Coburn of Topaz Lake, Nevada, along with their spouses, Denise Martin and Carolyn Coburn. DAP stands for \\"Dumb Ass Partners\\"‚Äîa tongue-in-cheek response to a passerby who questioned their wisdom in purchasing the partnership's first racehorse, the mare Love the Chase, who became the dam of 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner California Chrome, her first foal. Coburn owned a 30% interest in the horse and in July 2015 sold his share to Taylor Made Farm. Following the sale, Martins and Taylor Made each sold \\"a few\\" shares in the stallion to \\"select breeders who would support the horse,\\" forming the ownership syndicate California Chrome, LLC. The DAP partnership had jointly owned other horses, including California Chrome's full siblings and his dam, Love the Chase. DAP Racing Perry Martin was the majority owner of California Chrome and Steve Coburn held a 30% interest. The Martins and the Coburns had in common a fondness for California Chrome, but otherwise very different personalities and backgrounds. As Carolyn Coburn explained, \\"We couldn't be more different. We met at the racetrack because of a horse. That's what's so great about this game. It brings people together.\\" The Martins seldom talked to the press, but Melissa Hoppert of The New York Times described them as the \\"quiet thinkers,\\" noting that Perry Martin planned the mating of Lucky Pulpit with Love the Chase, mapped out a \\"Road to the Derby\\" racing plan for the horse, and promoted use of a nasal strip for California Chrome's races. Hoppert characterized the outgoing Coburns as the \\"public relations arm\\" of the partnership. The Martins are from Chicago. They met over a mutual interest in the novel Foundation by Isaac Asimov, and went to the harness races on their first date; Perry Martin had been going to horse races at Arlington Park since he was a teenager. Today they own and operate Martin Testing Laboratories (MTL), a division of Materials Technology Laboratories, Inc. that is located within McClellan Business Park at the former McClellan Air Force Base. MTL tests items such as automobile airbags and medical equipment. The company provides product assurance and reliability testing of new technologies and materials. Perry Martin has an MBA, a degree in applied physics from Michigan Technological University, and an advanced degree in solid state physics from the University of Illinois-Chicago. Denise Martin is MTL's senior chemist, managing the company's fatigue testing and thermal analytics. They married in 1986 and celebrated their 28th anniversary on the weekend of the Preakness, thus missing seeing the race live. They moved to California in 1987, where Perry Martin was employed as a metallurgist by the Air Force and Denise briefly job shadowed a racehorse trainer in the Sacramento area. Perry Martin worked at the McClellan Air Force Base prior to its 2001 closure, performing testing and analysis work, briefing both Congress and the Air Force Chief of Staff on his work with Air Force weapons systems. He wrote the Electronic Failure Analysis Handbook, published by McGraw-Hill in 1999. Steve and Carolyn Coburn (center) at the trophy presentation for the 2014 Preakness Stakes Steve Coburn, characterized by the media as the more \\"loquacious\\" of the two men, describes himself and his wife as \\"just everyday people\\". He grew up in central California and was familiar with horses. He worked herding cattle at a feedlot, participated in rodeos, and worked at some ranching jobs. He now works as a press operator for a company that makes magnetic strips. Carolyn Coburn retired in March 2014 from a career working in payroll in the health care industry. Carolyn introduced Steve to horse racing, and when he was looking for a tax write-off, she encouraged him to buy into a racing syndicate instead of purchasing a small airplane. =Love the Chase= Love the Chase was purchased for $30,000 as a two-year-old by an agent for a horse ownership group called the Blinkers On Racing Stable. Perry Martin had been a member of the racing syndicate since 2007. Steve Coburn joined the group when he bought a share of the filly in 2008. Originally, the two couples each owned a five percent share in Love the Chase through their membership in Blinkers On Racing Stable. As a two- and three-year-old filly, Love the Chase had been very nervous and often panicked in the saddling paddock, in effect losing races before she ever got to the starting gate. She ran six times and won on her fourth try in a maiden claiming race at Golden Gate Fields. When Blinkers On Racing Stable decided to dissolve the Love the Chase syndicate, both the Coburns and the Martins wanted to buy the filly. Instead, they decided to go into partnership; Perry Martin with a 70% share and as managing owner. After Love the Chase won her only race in February 2009, Coburn and Martin became her official owners. A casual observer, knowing Love the Chase's modest race record, remarked that only a \\"dumb ass\\" would buy her, so Coburn and Martin, on a handshake, named their racing operation DAP Racing‚Äî \\"Dumb Ass Partners\\". They created a caricature of a buck-toothed donkey to adorn the back of their racing silks, chose purple and green, the favorite colors of Carolyn Coburn and Denise Martin, for their stable colors, and put the initials \\"DAP\\" on California Chrome's blinker hood and the left front of the jockey's silks. Martin and Coburn paid $8,000, then raced Love the Chase two more times and retired her in 2009. Wives Denise Martin and Carolyn Coburn became closely involved with the partnership, though they did not appear as owners on official records kept by Equibase. Martin and Coburn hoped Love the Chase would become a good broodmare, as she had a promising pedigree. When she retired, they discovered that she had raced with a breathing problem‚Äîan entrapped epiglottis that restricted her air intake, but was corrected with surgery. Martin researched pedigrees to determine the best stallion to match with Love the Chase. The mare failed to conceive in 2009 when bred to a stallion named Redattore, and did not go back to him for rebreeding because he had been sent to Brazil. For that reason, she was bred to Lucky Pulpit in 2010. CNN reported that the stud fee for the breeding was $2000. Prior to the beginning of the 2014 breeding season, Lucky Pulpit had a published stud fee of $2,500. After California Chrome became a Kentucky Derby contender, Martin and Coburn turned down an offer of $2.1 million for Love the Chase. Between 2013 and 2016, Love the Chase gave birth to four foals, all full siblings to California Chrome. In 2016, Love the Chase was sent to Kentucky to be bred to Tapit, a son of Pulpit who was standing at stud for $300,000, the highest stud fee in North America. In August 2016, Martin announced that Love the Chase, confirmed in foal to Tapit, would be sold at the November Fasig-Tipton sale, as he wished to buy mares who could be bred to California Chrome. She sold to an unidentified buyer for $1.95 million.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/217524/love-the-chase-sells-for-1-95-million =California Chrome= California Chrome, sired by Lucky Pulpit and out of Love the Chase, was foaled on February 18, 2011, at Harris Farms near Coalinga, California, the horse breeding division of the Harris Ranch. Steve Coburn said he had a dream not long before California Chrome's birth that the foal would be a colt with four white feet and a blaze. California Chrome was relatively large for a newborn foal, weighing , and active, described by Martin as \\"running circles around Momma\\" within two hours of birth. As a foal, he was given the nickname \\"Junior\\" by the Martins, because of his resemblance to his sire, Lucky Pulpit. California Chrome at the 2014 Belmont Stakes The Martins and Coburns chose California Chrome's official name in 2013 at Brewsters Bar & Grill in Galt, California, a town halfway between their two homes. Each of the four wrote a potential name on pieces of paper and asked a waitress to draw them out of Coburn's cowboy hat. They submitted the names to The Jockey Club ranked in the order drawn. California Chrome, Coburn's choice, was first drawn, and the registry accepted the name. The word \\"chrome\\" in his name comes from slang for a horse with flashy white markings. California Chrome begin race training as a two-year-old colt with Art Sherman and Alan Sherman of Sherman Training Stables. After his first six races, he was paired with jockey Victor Espinoza and the team went on to a six-race winning streak that included the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Prior to the Santa Anita Derby on April 8, 2014, DAP Racing turned down a $6 million offer for a 51% controlling interest in California Chrome that would have mandated putting the horse with a different trainer. Coburn later explained why: \\"This isn't about the money, this is about the dream.\\" Immediately following the Belmont Stakes, Coburn generated controversy when he described the current Triple Crown system as allowing \\"the coward's way out\\" because horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who had contested all three legs without a break. Trainer Art Sherman commented, \\"[Coburn] was at the heat of the moment...Sometimes the emotions get in front of you.\\" By the following Monday morning, Coburn had apologized, saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of winner Tonalist and adding, \\"I wanted so much for [California Chrome] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America, and I was pretty emotional, very emotional.\\" The 2015 season was a disappointment. California Chrome placed second in his first two races and then was sidelined by injuries. The relationship between Martin and Coburn also appeared to break down following Martin's decision to send the horse to England for training and a possible start at Royal Ascot. Both Coburn and Sherman had publicly opposed the move. Sherman expressed passing disappointment, but Coburn stopped talking to the press altogether, and Martin commented, \\"Steve is my compass, whatever he suggests, that means I go 180 degrees the other way.\\" When the horse returned to America in July 2015, Coburn sold his minority interest in the horse to Taylor Made Farms, a stud farm in Kentucky. The horse returned to train with Sherman following a rest period at Taylor Made Farms. =Related horses= When the DAP partnership dissolved in 2016, Cobern formed Silver State Racing, a partnership that owned one of the full sisters to 'Chrome, R Sunday Surprise. Martin Racing kept Chrome's full siblings Hope's Love and Faversham. California Chrome's full sister, Hope's Love, foaled in 2013, had placed second in her racing debut at Golden Gate Fields in June, 2015, trained by Art Sherman's son, Steve. In July 2015, she was sidelined for the year due to a hairline fracture in her shoulderblade. She returned to racing in 2016 at Golden Gate Fields and ran in four more races, placed 5th twice, 6th once, and finishing last in her final race. Her ownership transferred from DAP racing to Martin as sole owner by her final two races. A second full sister foaled in 2014, R Sunday Surprise, began racing under Silver State Racing in 2016, trained by Doug O'Neill. She hit the board twice with third-place finishes in five starts. A full brother foaled in 2015, Faversham, entered race training in 2017. Taylor Made Farm and California Chrome, LLC Taylor Made Farms, headed by Duncan Taylor, the president and CEO of the family-owned farm. His brother, Ben Taylor, is the vice president of the company's Taylor Made Stallions division. The brothers of the Taylor family have been the sole owners of the corporation since 1986. They were raised in the horse business, learning from their father and grandfather. They formed Taylor Made Sales Agency in 1976, when Duncan was 19, offering boarding for mares shipped into Kentucky. They expanded to sales consignments and then built their own facility on 120 acres owned by their father in Nicholasville, Kentucky. The farm is now 1,600 acres. By early 2016, the horse's ownership was officially listed as \\"California Chrome, LLC\\". Perry and Denise Martin remained the \\"majority owners\\" by the Daily Racing Form, and Frank Taylor of Taylor Made said that both the Martins and Taylor Made had each sold \\"a few\\" shares in the stallion to \\"select breeders who would support the horse.\\" Martin stated to the press in August 2016 that he ultimately would keep a 10% interest in the stallion and invest in mares suitable for crossing with California Chrome. JS Company The California Chrome reached an agreement to sell the stud to Japan's JS Company, and will stand at Arrow Stud in Hokkaido.

The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy. Other symptoms include postural instability and retching. Virtual reality sickness is different from motion sickness in that it can be caused by the visually-induced perception of self-motion; real self-motion is not needed. It is also different from simulator sickness; non-virtual reality simulator sickness tends to be characterized by oculomotor disturbances, whereas virtual reality sickness tends to be characterized by disorientation.  Consequences  Virtual reality sickness may have undesirable consequences beyond the sickness itself. For example, Crowley (1987) argued that flight simulator sickness could discourage pilots from using flight simulators, reduce the efficiency of training through distraction and the encouragement of adaptive behaviors that are unfavorable for performance, compromise ground safety or flight safety when sick and disoriented pilots leave the simulator. Similar consequences could be expected for virtual reality systems. Although the evidence for performance decrements due to virtual reality sickness is limited, research does suggest that virtual reality sickness is a major barrier to using virtual reality, indicating that virtual reality sickness may be a barrier to the effective use of training tools and rehabilitation tools in virtual reality. Estimates of the multi-study incidence and main symptoms of virtual reality sickness (also called cybersickness) have been made.  Theories  Currently, there are very few theories as to why virtual reality sickness in particular occurs; however, it is closely related to simulator and motion sickness. Sensory conflict theory provides a framework for understanding motion sickness; however, it can be applied to virtual reality sickness to better understand how it can occur, and is commonly used for that purpose. Sensory conflict theory posits that sickness will occur when a user's perception of self-motion is based on incongruent sensory inputs from the visual system, vestibular system, and non-vestibular proprioceptors, and particularly so when these inputs are at odds with the user's expectation based on prior experience. Applying this theory to virtual reality, sickness can be minimized when the sensory inputs inducing self-motion are in agreement with one another. The physiology behind VR sickness is not currently clearly understood. Fortunately, research has uncovered some clear indications of certain conditions that cause VR sickness. It seems that the images projected from virtual reality have a major impact on sickness. The refresh rate of on- screen images is often not high enough when VR sickness occurs. Because the refresh rate is slower than what the brain processes, it causes a discord between the processing rate and the refresh rate, which causes the user to perceive glitches on the screen. When these two components do not match up, it can cause the user to experience the same feelings as simulator and motion sickness which is mentioned below. The resolution on animation can also cause users to experience this phenomenon. When animations are poor, it causes another type of discord between what is expected and what is actually happening on the screen. When onscreen graphics do not keep the pace with the users' head movements, it can trigger a form of motion sickness. Another trigger of virtual reality sickness is when there is disparity in apparent motion between the visual and vestibular stimuli. This disparity occurs if there is a disagreement between what the stimuli from the eyes and inner ear are sending to the brain. This is a fundamental cause of both simulator and motion sickness as well. In virtual reality, the eyes transmit that the person is running and jumping through a dimension, however, the ears transmit that no movement is occurring and that the body is sitting still. Since there is this discord between the eyes and the ears, a form of motion sickness can occur. Not all scientists agree with sensory conflict theory. A second theory of motion sickness, which has also been used to explain virtual reality sickness, is the theory of postural instability. This theory holds that motion sickness and related sicknesses occur because of poor postural adaptations in response to unusual coupling between visual stimuli and motor coordination. Characteristic markers of postural instability occur prior to appearance of symptoms and predict the later development of symptoms. This theory can explain some otherwise surprising situations in which motion sickness did not occur in the presence of sensory conflict.  Technical aspects  There are various technical aspects of virtual reality that can induce sickness, such as mismatched motion, field of view, motion parallax, and viewing angle. Additionally, the amount of time spent in virtual reality can increase the presence of symptoms. Mismatched motion can be defined as a discrepancy between the motion of the simulation and the motion that the user expects. It is possible to induce motion sickness in virtual reality when the frequencies of mismatched motion are similar to those for motion sickness in reality, such as seasickness. These frequencies can be experimentally manipulated, but also have the propensity to arise from system errors. Generally, increasing the field of view increases incidence of simulator sickness symptoms. This relationship has been shown to be curvilinear, with symptoms approaching an asymptote for fields of view above 140¬∞. Altering motion parallax distances to those less than the distance between the human eyes in large multiple-screen simulation setups can induce oculomotor distress, such as headaches, eyestrain, and blurred vision. There are fewer reports of oculomotor distress on smaller screens; however, most simulation setups with motion parallax effects can still induce eyestrain, fatigue, and general discomfort over time. Viewing angle has been shown to increase a user's sickness symptoms, especially at extreme angles. One example of such an extreme angle would be when a user must look downwards a short distance in front of their virtual feet. As opposed to a forward viewing angle, an extreme downward angle such as this has been shown to markedly increase sickness in virtual environments. Time spent immersed in a virtual environment contributes to sickness symptom presence due to the increasing effects of fatigue on the user. Oculomotor symptoms are the most common to occur due to immersion time, but the nature of the user's movements (e.g., whole-body vs. head-only) is suggested to be the primary cause of nausea or physical sickness.  Techniques for reducing VR sickness  According to several studies, introducing a static frame of reference (independent visual background) may reduce simulation sickness. A technique called Nasum Virtualis shows a virtual nose as a fixed frame of reference for VR headsets.Whittinghill, D. M., Ziegler, B., Moore, J., & Case, T. (2015). Nasum Virtualis: A Simple Technique for Reducing Simulator Sickness in Head Mounted VR. In Game Developers Conference. San Francisco. Other techniques for reducing nausea involve simulating ways of displacement that don't create or reduce discrepancies between the visual aspects and body movement, such as reducing rotational motions during navigation, dynamically reducing the field of view, teleportation, and movement in zero gravity. In January 2020, the French start-up Boarding Ring, known for their glasses against motion sickness, released an add-on device against virtual reality sickness. Using two small screens in the user's peripheral field of view, the device displays visual information consistent with vestibular inputs, avoiding the sensory conflict. Galvanic vestibular stimulation, which creates the illusion of motion by electric stimulation of the vestibular system, is another technique being explored for its potential to mitigate or eliminate the visual-vestibular mismatch.  Newest technology  With the integration of virtual reality into the more commercial mainstream, issues have begun to arise in relation to VR sickness in head-mounted gaming devices. While research on head-mounted VR for gaming dates back to the early 1990s, the potential for mass usability has only become recently realized. While certain features are known to moderate VR sickness in head-mounted displays, such as playing from a seated position rather than standing, it has also been found that this merely puts off the onset of sickness, rather than completely preventing it. This inherently presents an issue, in that this type of interactive VR often involves standing or walking for a fully immersive experience. Gaming VR specialists argue that this unique brand of VR sickness is only a minor issue, claiming that it disappears with time spent (multiple days) using the head-mounted displays, relating it to \\"getting your sea legs\\". However, getting users interested in sickness for multiple days with the promise of \\"probably getting over it\\" is a struggle for developers of head- mounted gaming tech. Surveys have shown that a large percentage of people won't develop their \\"VR legs,\\" in particular women. These same developers also argue that it has more to do with the individual game being played, and that certain gaming aspects are more likely to create issues, such as change in speed, walking up stairs, and jumping, which are all, unfortunately, fairly normal game functions in predominant genres.  Individual differences in susceptibility  Individuals vary widely in their susceptibility to simulator and virtual reality sickness. Some of the factors in virtual reality sickness are listed below: * Age: Susceptibility to motion sickness is highest between the ages of 2 and 12. It then decreases rapidly until about age 21, and continues to decrease more slowly after that. It has been suggested that virtual reality sickness might follow a similar pattern, but more recent research has suggested that adults over the age of 50 are more susceptible than younger adults to virtual reality sickness. * Postural stability: Postural instability has been found to increase susceptibility to visually- induced motion sickness. It is also associated with increased susceptibility to nausea and disorientation symptoms of virtual reality sickness. * Flicker fusion frequency threshold: Because flicker in the display has been associated with increased risk of virtual reality sickness, people with a low threshold for detecting flicker may be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness. * Ethnicity: Asian people may be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness. Chinese women appear to be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness than European-American and African-American women; research suggests that they are more susceptible to vision-based motion sickness. Tibetans and Northeast Indians also appear to be more susceptible to motion sickness than Caucasian people, suggesting that they would also be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness, since susceptibility to motion sickness predicts susceptibility to a wide range of motion-sickness related disturbances. * Experience with the system: Users seem to become less likely to develop virtual reality sickness as they develop familiarity with a virtual reality system. Adaptation may occur as quickly as the second exposure to the virtual reality system. * Gender: Women are more susceptible than men to virtual reality sickness. This may be due to hormonal differences, it may be because women have a wider field of view than men, or gender differences in depth cue recognition. Women are most susceptible to virtual reality sickness during ovulation and a wider field of view is also associated with an increase in virtual reality sickness. In more recent research, there is some disagreement as to whether gender or sex is a clear factor in susceptibility to virtual reality sickness. * Health: Susceptibility to virtual reality sickness appears to increase in people who are not at their usual level of health, suggesting that virtual reality may not be appropriate for people who are in ill health. This includes people who are fatigued; have not had enough sleep; are nauseated; or have an upper respiratory illness, ear trouble, or influenza. * Mental rotation ability: Better mental rotation ability appears to reduce susceptibility to virtual reality sickness, suggesting that training users in mental rotation may reduce the incidence of virtual reality sickness. * Field dependence/independence: Field dependence/independence is a measure of perceptual style. Those with strong field dependence exhibit a strong influence of surrounding environment on their perception of an object, whereas people with strong field independence show a smaller influence of surrounding environment on their perception of the object. While the relationship between field dependence/independence and virtual reality sickness is complex, it appears that, in general, people without a strong tendency towards one extreme or the other are most susceptible to virtual reality sickness. * Motion sickness sensitivity: Those who are more sensitive to motion sickness in reality are also more sensitive to virtual reality sickness.

B. Nevill, was a chartered accountant, became Scoutmaster of the 5th Enfield Boy Scout troop in late 1909, after the beginning of Scouting and held many positions within The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom including as Headquarters Commissioners and as Vice-President of the Association. He contributed to Scouting in major projects, such as the founding of Gilwell Park and Roland House and donated Kingsdown Scout Camp to The Boy Scouts Association.John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 59 He contributed to Scouting publications and wrote two books on Scouting. Personal Nevill was born on 14 June 1887 at Stamford Hill, London, England. His parents were John (also known as Jack) Bantick and Alice Maria Neville. Nevill was trained as a financial accountant. In 1914 after the outbreak of war, he volunteered for the army, but was refused on health grounds. He married Joan Woodruffe in June 1926. Nevill died in England on 30 July 1975. Scouting Nevill started his involvement with Scouting after he was impressed by the September 1909 Crystal Palace Rally of Scouts in London. He established the 5th Enfield Boy Scout troop. In subsequent years, he held positions within The Boy Scouts Association as district and county commissioners. He first met Baden-Powell personally in 1911, and always remained on friendly terms with the Baden-Powell family. (Relevance?) He was The Boy Scouts Association Headquarters Commissioner for Kindred Societies, to liaise with other societies, from 1914 until 1949, at the same time as he held other commissionerships and roles. In 1926, he was awarded the Silver Wolf by The Boy Scouts Association for his Scouting contributions. In 1948 he donated 37 acres of cliff land adjoining the sea in Kingsdown, Kent to create the Kingsdown Scout Camp. In 1958 he funded the Troop Room at Gilwell Park. After ending his commissionerships in the early 1960s, he became a vice president of The Scout Association and, in 1966, upon ending nearly all of his official roles with The Scout Association, he was made Honorary Commissioner for Life. When Nevill died in 1975, he was remembered as the last of Baden-Powell's contemporaries in The Scout Association. =Rovers= Rovers held his attention and support from its early beginning in the 1920s and he became The Boy Scouts Association Headquarters Commissioner for Rovers. Nevill organised the first jamboree for Rovers (which Baden-Powell termed a \\"Moot\\"). Nevill organised several more Moots. He resigned as Headquarters Commissioner for Rovers in 1930, to focus on his other commissionerships. He remained involved with Rovers and attended further Moots. In 1966, The Boy Scouts Association discontinued Rovers following The Chief Scout's Advance Party Report and Nevill resigned all his active positions with the Association. =Roland House= In 1916, Nevill became The Boy Scouts Association Commissioner for East London. He moved into Roland House Scout Settlement in East London as its warden. Roland House was the legacy of Roland Philipps who was killed in action in the 1914-18 World War. Roland House and its Scout Shop were maintained by its wardens, Rovers and resident Scout leaders. William de Bois Maclaren was a guest of Nevill's at Roland House, which was decisive in De Boise Maclaren's donation of Gilwell Park to The Boy Scouts Association. In 1920, Nevill took over the full lease for Roland House and all financial responsibility. Upon his marriage in 1926, he moved out of Roland House to Reigate, Surrey. Nevill remained on the Roland House Committee until the 1960s. Roland House was closed by The Scout Association soon after Nevill's death. Bibliography * The Doctor and the Outlaw, Etc.

Career =Manly-Warringah= Nevin was born in Sydney, New South Wales and was a Manly Sea Eagles junior. A goal kicking fullback, Nevin was graded with the Sea Eagles but had to bide his time in Reserve Grade as Manly's first grade fullback at the time was New Zealand dual international custodian, the goal kicking Matthew Ridge. Manly coach Bob Fulton gave Nevin his first grade debut from the bench for Manly in their 48-18 win over South Sydney at the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) in the opening round of the 1995 ARL season. He then spent the next 11 weeks in reserve grade (during which the Sea Eagles first grade team did not lose a match), and was again on the bench for the Round 12 game against the North Sydney Bears at Brookvale Oval where he scored his first points in the top grade by kicking a goal. After spending the next three weeks in the reserves, he was called up for his first two games at fullback for the Sea Eagles when Ridge was unavailable due to representing New Zealand in a test series against France. Nevin played nine games for Manly in 1995 with his last game for the year in the clubs Qualifying final win over Cronulla. Manly, who had only lost two games for the entire season, would ultimately lose the Grand Final 17-4 to Sydney Bulldogs. Nevin would again play nine games for Manly in the 1996 ARL season as the Sea Eagles made amends for the previous years disappointment by defeating St George 20-8 in the Grand Final at the SFS. He scored his first try in the top grade in Manly's 44-6 demolition of Souths in the opening round of the season. Due to the Super League war, Ridge had signed with the Super League aligned Auckland Warriors and after his performances in 1995 and 1996, it was expected that Nevin would be an automatic selection at fullback for Manly in 1997. However, a poor pre-season and the signing of goal kicking Craig Field saw Fulton use experienced, former NSW Origin winger Craig Hancock as Manly's fullback for the first 11 rounds of the season. Nevin returned to first grade in Round 11 against Balmain when Danny Moore was unavailable after being selected to play State of Origin for Queensland and Fulton moved Hancock to his preferred wing spot. When Moore returned, so did Nevin to the bench where he spent the next two games as a fresh reserve before he once again found himself in the reserves. After Hancock broke his ankle in Round 17, Nevin was finally given the fullback spot and also took over the goal kicking duties from Field. The defending NRL premiers qualified for their third Grand Final in succession, this time facing the Newcastle Knights who were playing their first Grand Final since entering the competition in 1988. Nevin was a try scorer on the day for the Sea Eagles, but with the scores tied at 16-16 with seconds remaining, Knights halfback Andrew Johns passed on the blind side to flying winger Darren Albert who sped past the Manly defence to score under the posts to give Newcastle an upset 22-16 win. It would prove to be Nevin's last game with the Sea Eagles as he would sign to play with Balmain in the 1998 NRL season. In three seasons with Manly, Nevin played 29 games (including one Grand Final), scored 6 tries and kicked 52/83 goals (62.65%) for a total of 128 points. =Balmain= His first season at Liechhardt Oval saw Nevin cement his place as Balmain fullback and goal kicker. Nevin played 20 games for the struggling Tigers, kicking 51/79 goals as well as his first field goal. His second season with Balmain was far less successful. The arrival of goal kicking fullback Joel Caine again saw Nevin playing mostly in reserve grade. He would only play 11 games for the year and at the end of the season was released by the club. Nevin played 60 first grade games in his career for Manly and Balmain. He scored 6 tries, kicked 121/186 goals (65.05%) and kicked one field goal for a total of 267 points. Post career In 2014, Nevin revealed in an interview that he had suffered at least 15 concussions during his career.Shannon Nevin 2014 interview Nevin is currently the owner/operator of That Fitness Place, an independent, local gym and fitness centre committed to working with his clients to gain the great results they are looking for.

English: New West Street) is a street in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It runs from Frederiksholms Kanal to Vester Voldgade and together with Christiansborg's riding grounds, Marble Bridge and Dantes Plads forms an axis between Christiansborg's tower in the east and Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek's dome in the west. The National Museum's main entrance is located in the street. History Ny Vestergade is one of the streets that was created when the Frederiksholm neighbourhood was established in the 1660s. It is referred to as Den Nye Vestergade (\\"The New West Street\\") in 1665 but was long more commonly called Wigandts Gade after wine trader and ship owner Wigand Michelbecker (1636-1692), who owned a property where National Museum is now located. The name \\"New\\" refers to the old Vestergade, which extends westwards from Gammeltorv. Notable buildings and residents National Museum's main entrance No. 9: Oldest house in the street No. 13: Former home and workplace of August Krogh The National Museum occupies the entire north side of the street. The recessed main entrance was created by Mogens Clemmensen, Arne Nystr√∏m and Gehrdt Bornebusch in connection with their expansions of the museum between 1929 and 1938. No. 9, 11 and 13 are listed. Dating from some time before 1770, Ny Vestergade 9 is the oldest house in the street. The two-storey No. 11 was built as a combined storage house and stables for grocer I. Lund in 1831. University of Copenhagen acquired the building in 1857 and it was subsequently adapted by Johan Henrik Nebelong in the Neoclassical style (1858). Nebelong also added a perpendicular rear wing (1859), which housed the university's chemical laboratory. A memorial plaque commemorates that August Krogh lived and worked in the building from 1910 until 1827. No. 13 was built in 1793 for inn-keeper Christen Christensen Bording, probably by one of Caspar Frederik Harsdorff's pupils. A later owner, Christian Ludvig Maag, expanded the house with an extra floor in 1855-1857. Maag also commissioned Georg Hilker, P. C. Skovgaard and Constantin Hansen. Countess Danner had an apartment in the building. The building is now part of Dansk Arbejdersgiverforening's headquarters on Vester Voldgade. Public art and memorials The water feature at No. 1 In the courtyard of Ny Vestergade 1 is a water feature with an antique statue. Above the statue is a round relief. The tableaux is visible through the gateway from the street. The walls of the gateway feature four more reliefs. The building is from 1870.

The house was built in 1826 by James McCartney, who came to Madison County in 1810. McCartney held several public offices in the county, including Justice of the Peace, Tax Assessor and Collector, and County Commissioner. He was also a member of the Flint River Navigation Company, which sought to improve transportation along the Flint River to the Tennessee River, making it easier to get goods from northeastern Madison County to market. McCartney died in 1831, and his wife, Martha, remarried twice, the second time to Reverend Matthew H. Bone. After Martha's death in 1885, the house remained in the family until 1955. See also: The brickwork is laid in Flemish bond, and is of the same high quality on all sides of the house. The house is two stories, with a gable roof and a chimney in each gable end. A central entry portico, added in the 1960s, is supported by two square columns with matching pilasters against the house. The door is topped with an elliptical fanlight. A pair of two-over-two sash windows flank the portico on either side. Second floor windows are also two-over-two, but are slightly smaller. All windows on the fa√ßade have recessed lintels filled with stucco. A denticulated cornice with ogee modillions is repeated on the rear of the house, an unusual feature for an early 19th-century country house. The main portion of the house has two rooms on either side of a central hall on both floors. The house originally had a detached kitchen; it was rebuilt in 1873 to be closer to the house and later joined. A shed roofed veranda on the rear has been enclosed to form a sun porch. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Construction on the project began in February 2000 and the upper reservoir began to fill in May 2005. The four generators were commissioned between December 2005 and August 2007. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir, Dahe Reservoir, was originally built in 1960 but repaired extensively for the project. The Tai'an Upper Reservoir is located in a valley above the east side of the lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Tai'an Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. It is operated by State Grid Xinyuan Co. The lower reservoir is created by a tall and long earth-fill dam on the Pan Wen River, known as Dahe Reservoir which was first constructred in 1950s or 1960s. It can withhold up to of water. The upper reservoir is created by a tall and long concrete-face rock-fill dam. It can withhold up to of water, of which can be used for power production. Water from the upper reservoir is sent to the 1,000 MW underground power station down near the lower reservoir through two long headrace/penstock pipes.

She is a double world champion, with pilot Rachel James, and a double Commonwealth gold medallist, with pilot Helen Scott, in the tandem sprint and 1 km time trial events. In April 2014, she set world records in the tandem sprint and 1 km time trial, piloted by James. Biography Thornhill comes from Poynton near Stockport in Cheshire. She attended Poynton High School, also attended by para-cyclist Sarah Storey. She has only 7‚Äì9% vision owing to oculocutaneous albinism, which causes visual impairment. She met the para-cyclist Anthony Kappes, also visually impaired, via her uncle; he encouraged her to train as a track cyclist. Thornhill started racing as an adult in May 2013, aged 17. She races as the stoker on the back of a tandem, with the front position occupied by a pilot with normal vision. She was initially piloted by English cyclist Helen Scott, with whom she won three British events. In September 2013 she switched to the Welsh cyclist Rachel James as her pilot. Her international debut came with James in December at the International Paracycling Cup in Newport, Wales, where the pair won two gold medals; their time of 1:09.446 in the 1 km time trial missed the world record by 0.73 seconds. Her first major international competition was the UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Aguascalientes, Mexico, in April 2014. Thornhill and James won the gold medal in the tandem 1 km time trial; their time of 1:05.912 broke the world record by a little under 3 seconds. The pair won gold in the sprint, beating the New Zealand pair Emma Foy and Laura Fairweather 2‚Äì0 in the semi-final, and the Australian pair Brandie O'Connor and Breanna Hargrave 2‚Äì0 in the final. They also broke the world record in the qualifying round of the sprint with a flying start time over 200 metres of 10.854 seconds. Thornhill was selected for the English team at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland, where para-cycling appeared for the first time; at 18, she was the track cycling team's youngest member. As James was competing for the Welsh team, Thornhill returned to Scott as her pilot to compete in the tandem sprint and 1 km time trial events. The pair won the gold medal in the sprint, beating the Australian Paralympic champion Felicity Johnson and pilot Holly Takos 2‚Äì0 in the semi-final, and the Scottish pair Aileen McGlynn and Louise Haston 2‚Äì0 in the final. They set the Commonwealth record during qualification, with a time of 11.277 seconds. The pair also won gold in the 1 km time trial, with a time of 1:08.187, a Commonwealth Games record. They beat silver medallists McGlynn and Haston by more than 1.5 seconds. Sarah Storey commented: \\"They had a superbly executed start ‚Äì they have worked so hard on that aspect of their training ‚Äì and with the turbo intervals they have done they were able to bring it home strongly.\\" Thornhill reunited with James to compete in the 2014 British National Track Championships in September, where they won the mixed time trial and the 200-metre flying start time trial for blind and visually impaired riders.

Yuri Belousov authored or co- authored numerous books and publications, and earned more than 10 patents and inventions related to new glass-ceramic materials, colored glasses, foam glass and ceramic glazes with high thermal shock resistance for carbon containing materials. His main achievements, which were developed in the USSR, include a unique method of glass annealing and toughening (together with O.V. Mazurin; see toughened glass, annealing (glass)), obtaining the first USSR free-dust method of sealing of glass ampoules which prevented the ingress of glass dust into medicinal ampouled preparations (in collaboration with O.V. Mazurin and others). Yuri Belousov is also the main author and creator of a theoretical method of determining viscosity of silicate melts, allowing one to perform theoretical calculations of viscosity and thus predict commercial glass, cement and slag compositions.  Biography and early research work  Yuri Belousov was born in a Ural town of Troitsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast in Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. His father‚Äôs family began as Ukrainian peasants (original name was Bilous) from Poltava Governorate who arrived in Ural, Russia, in the early 20th century to receive a portion of land, promised by the Stolypin reform. His maternal grandfather Gennady Beketov, a descendant of Volga Tatars following the October Revolution, was the first director one a Soviet bank in Saratov Region (now Saratov Oblast). After his death in 1921, his family moved to Ural. In 1964, Yuri entered the Ural Polytechnic Institute (later Ural State Technical University (USTU)), Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in the department of Glass Technology. After graduation, continued his postgraduate studies there. In 1974, he defended his doctoral thesis in the field of glass ceramics made of industrial slags. In 1975, he started to work in one of the Research Institutes of Ural where successfully developed thermal shock resistance glazes for carbon refractory. In 1978, his research was documented in a film by Sverdlovsk Film Studio. In the end of 70s, he accepted an offer on work by Vilen Ivakhnyuk, an internationally recognized researcher, who made a scientific discovery, a founder and the first director of Belgorod Technological Institute of Constructional Materials (former BTISM), now Belgorod Shukhov University.  Main achievements and inventions  While working in the institute in collaboration with Leningrad‚Äôs researcher O.V. Mazurin, Yu. Belousov wrote the book The Annealing and Tempering of Glass, a popular and famous manual among engineers. This book, devoted to a new method of glass treatment, became a respected reference guide for specialists and researchers in other related industries. Based on this method, in 1988, Yu. Belousov, O.V. Mazurin and others developed USSR‚Äôs first technology of a glass dust-free method of sealing glass ampoules, which significantly decreased contamination in medicinal ampouled preparations. This invention was first introduced at one of the Soviet biopharmaceutical plants currently belonging to the Russian concern VEROPHARM. By the end of 80s, Yuri Belousov and his colleagues resolved an issue of exploding glass sparkling wine bottles which had caused serious lacerations to workers in wine bottling facilities in Ukraine. Yuri Belousov‚Äôs main achievement was development a method of calculating the viscosity of glassy melts based on known equations of viscosity. Before anyone else, Yu. Belousov gathered, described and compiled a data base of viscosity values of glasses and slags. Then, using Arrhenius equation, he developed the basic principles and a formulaic calculation algorithm of the viscosity of melts, which provided a fairly precise measurement. The method is based on the theoretical viscosity values of melts of binary, ternary, quaternary and more complex oxide phase diagrams of the silicate systems. It allowed to avoid the current, expensive processes for determining viscosity in practice. Under his guidance, his post-graduate students prepared several Ph.D. theses, three of which were defended after his death. Yuri Belousov died in 2000 in the age of 54 due to poor health. In recognition of his great contribution to the technology of Silicate materials field, in 1983, Yuri Belousov was awarded the Silver Medal of the main Soviet state exhibition VDNKh (Russia), the Exhibition of Achievements of the People's Economy. His daughter followed his steps: she became a professional engineer (P. Eng.) in the field of ceramics and refractories, she lives and works in Canada.

Applied focused on renovating the existing housing stock rather than clearance and rebuild; they also believed in careful maintenance and management thereafter to preserve the stock. During the 1970s, Applied built and renovated thousands of units of affordable housing throughout New Jersey with a concentration in Hoboken, North Bergen, and Bayonne. The firm was given a great deal of credit for Hoboken's rebirth. In 1979, his father retired and Joseph Barry became president.

This attraction is located in the Shipwreck Island themed area of the park, themed to a South Pacific island where many ships and their crews have been marooned. The four stranded ships are the Implausible, RMS Royal Star, Wholly Mackerel, and Dream Boat II.https://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/20/entertainment/ca-39261 The entrance to the Shipwreck Reef Cafe. The other main part of the area is a restaurant named the Shipwreck Reef Cafe. Every so often a ship's horn can be heard, followed by a SOS signal in Morse Code. The ride has guests board yellow and white circular rafts, with a max capacity of 9, via a rotating platform station. Attraction summary =Queue= Guests enter under a large \\"Shipwreck Rapids\\" sign, and proceed through a winding queue until they climb to an over-water platform with many switchbacks. After two platforms of switchbacks, guests cross over the water. On the bridge, there are three lines. The line on the right is for normal riders, the line in the middle is for Quick Queue and single riders, and the line on the left is the exit. Riders then descend into the rotating platform. Along the way, Caribbean-style music plays and television monitors play safety videos. Most of the queue is closed off, but in the summer most of the line is utilized, as lines can reach 90 minutes. =Main ride= After telling a ride operator how many people are in your group, you proceed to a blue circle until you are told to enter the ride vehicle. When you sit down, you buckle yourself in with a seat belt that crosses everyone in your seat. On the side opposite of the loading area is the storage space for excess rafts and the loading area for disabled people. As you disembark, the raft makes a small left turn down calm waters. The raft picks up speed as you make a u-turn and then reach the first set of rapids. After hitting two rapids, your raft drops slightly and goes under a net with cargo that constantly drips water. The raft than hits another set of rapids before turning left into flat water. As the ride gradually curves back right, water cannons are shot at the raft by non riders. These can be fired for $0.25 a shot. The raft then passes in between a sea turtle exhibit. A piano hanging on the side of a boat sometimes shoots water at riders and plays piano music. The boat with a piano is often open for guests to eat their meals from Shipwreck Reef Cafe on. Riders pass under buckets with holes in the bottom that sometimes pass over the rafts and drip water. Now rafts enter rougher waters and take a small drop between waterfalls and into more rapids. Riders then pass under the Shipwreck Reef Cafe and turn before colliding with another large ship. When on-ride cameras were operating, riders would then have had their photos taken, though the cameras have been disabled. The riders enter the end of the ride, passing under a waterfall and into an cave. In this mostly dark cave, riders hit the final rapid and then hit smooth water. After passing the propeller and glowing boilers of a ship, rafts wait in line to ride back up a chain lift. The chain lift emerges riders from a hole in the bow of a ship and into the station. On either side of the lift are large red screws which carry water up to the station. Once back, riders are instructed to unbuckle their seat belts and exit. A photo of the final lift hill while the ride was under maintenance. The large red screws on either side of the lift are used to carry water up to the station. =Exit= The former on-ride photo kiosk, now a pearl art shop. The old monitors are still visible. Riders walk over the same bridge as in the queue and into a surfing-style shop. The on-ride picture kiosk has since been converted into a pearl art shop. Walk in dryers are available at the exit.

Geography British Extracting Co. silo from Foster Street (2013) Wilmington is bounded by the River Hull to the west, with Wincolmlee and Sculcoates beyond; Stoneferry is to the north; and to the south is the area known as The Groves in Drypool; to the east is Summergangs and the Garden Village.Ordnance Survey. 1:25000. 2006 The area is primarily industrial, with activities including recycling, aggregates, manufacturing; as well as sales and service businesses, including those service industrial clients, and the building trade.See also historical descriptions of developments in the area. ¬ßHistory Larger businesses and activities include the 'Robin Concrete Waste Disposal Ltd.' plant, the Stagecoach Hull bus depot. Main roads are the A1033 (Stoneferry Road / Mount Pleasant) and A1165 (Cleveland Street) which run from the A63 Hull-Hedon main road in the south to Stoneferry in the north. The Hull Docks elevated railway also passes through the area. Crossings of the river are by the dock branch \\"Hull Bridge\\" swing railway bridge, and by the \\"Sculcoates Bridge\\" on Chapman Street at the northern and southern fringes of the area respectively. A former railway bridge, now a foot and cycle path \\"Wilmington Swing Bridge\\" crosses the river roughly halfway between the two. There is very little housing in the area, with the exception of a permanent caravan site, 'Wilmington Park'. The area has some pollution/nuisance smell/dust problems: contributors include road traffic, factories, and waste-management facilities, the former cocoa factory was also a contributor. History =19th century= In 1846 the Hull Glass Company was set up in Wilmington, on the north side of the street now known as \\"Glass House Row\\", the company rapidly went out of business, being inactive by 1850. The Victoria Dock Branch Line opened in 1853, passing east-west through Wilmington, crossing the River Hull at a new single track swing bridge Wilmington Bridge. By the mid 1850s development in Wilmington included the buildings of the glass works; a cement works and brick field; and in the southern part along the river a number of industrial buildings including the 'Phoenix Mill' (oil), and 'Wilmington' (oil and glue) and 'Greenland' yards.Ordnance Survey. Sheet 226, Town plans 1:1056. First series Much of the area was undeveloped; the area was outside, and on the edge of the growth of the town of Hull. The Hull and Hornsea Railway opened in 1864, initially terminating at Wilmington station, just before the junction with the dock line, in the same year the Victoria Dock Branch Line, excluding the River Hull bridge, was doubled. Sidings south of the junction between the Hull-Hornsea, and Victoria Dock Branch lines developed from a coal drops and a single siding in the mid 19th centuries, to a full goods station, Wilmington goods by the beginning of the 20th.Ordnance Survey. 1:1056 First edition, 1:2500 1893 & 1910 In 1866 Earle's Cement acquired the cement works on the near the river bank and land south of the Victoria Dock Branch Line; the works was connected by rail sidings to the dock branch. Production was around 3000t pa of Roman cement in 1870. From 1875 bottle kilns were constructed for the production of Portland cement, with a capacity of 38t per week by around 1882. From 1888 chamber kilns were installed, with 28 in total by 1898 with a total capacity of 980t per week. The first two Rotary kilns were installed in 1906, adding a capacity of 860t per week. Further rotary kilns were added in 1912 and 1920, by which time the location of the plant was seen a non-optimal, Earle's large plant in Hope, Derbyshire being preferred. Sculcoates (left) and Wilmington (right) from Sculcoates Bridge (F. S. Smith) At the southern edge of the area a swing bridge road crossing the River Hull, Sculcoates Bridge, was opened in 1875. The bridge consisted of a fixed span on the east bank of and a counterbalanced swing span made of girders, with a river span of . The design was by J. Fox district engineer, the bridge was constructed by the Bridge and Roofing Co. of Darlaston. Total cost was ¬£18,000. In 1885 the Hull and Barnsley Railway opened, with a branch to the new Alexandra Dock passing on an embankment through the northern extremity of the Wilmington area, crossing Cleveland Street at height; a swing bridge was built over the River Hull. An embanked chord was built to connect the line to the Victoria Dock Branch Line, adding a third railway bridge over Cleveland Street.See Hull and Barnsley Railway By the late 1880s urban growth in east Hull northwards from Drypool through the Groves had reached the edges of Wilmington;Ordnance Survey Sheets 240, 240NE, 226, 226SE. 1852‚Äì3, 1888‚Äì1890 a school, \\"Chapman Street school\\", was established on Chapman Street by the school board in 1888 for 866 children, it was expanded to a capacity of 1,163 students in 1902. In 1898 an iron church was opened; it was replaced in 1903 by a brick church, St Saviour, architects Brodrick, Lowther, and Walker. =20th century= The large Swan Flour Mill (Rishworth, Ingleby & Lofthouse Ltd.) was built in 1897, and expanded in 1898, with the silo added 1906. Also established by this time, north adjacent to the Swan Flour Mill were the Hull Varnish works; Wilmington Yard, later Cleveland Oil Refinery; Wilmington works; the Wilmington Oil Mills; and a flour mill, later expanded as Wilmington Flour Mill; further north on Glass House Row was the Anglo-American mill, also the 'Bon Accord Mill'.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1893, 1910 In the early 1900s a canister (metal tins) works was established by John Wilson (Shipley); Reckitt and Sons acquired the works in 1907.The works remained a feature, with some expansions up till the late 20th century when a new industrial estate was developed in the area. (Ordnance Survey. 1:10560/10000 1893‚Äì4, 1911, 1938‚Äì46, 1956‚Äì7, 1969, 1971‚Äì7, 1982, 1992‚Äì4) By 1910 urban growth north had reached the Victoria Dock Branch Line, mostly high density terraced and court housing, around Withernsea, Dalton, Cornwall and Chapman streets.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1910 Wilmington Bridge undergoing replacement, old bridge over river, new bridge behind on far bank. (1906) Between 1910 and 1912 the railway layout at Wilmington was altered: a new station was constructed west of the original on the Victoria Dock Branch Line, and the level crossing at Cleveland Street replaced with a bridge. A new double track swing bridge had also been constructed over the Hull, , slightly to the north of the original single track bridge. The bridge was designed by NER staff J. Triffit under W.J. Cudworth, and erected by R Woods (Westminster) with steelwork from John Butler & Co. (Stanningley): a 75¬∞33' skew, made of plate girders to a maximum depth hogback design, long total. The bridge turning mechanism was electrically powered, using Siemens Bros. equipment, and controlled by a cabin above the bridge; the designer was Wilson Worsdell, also of the NER, and the contractors Cowans and Sheldon. A cinema, the Cleveland on Cleveland Street was opened in 1914. In 1915 the British Extracting Co. (subsidiary of British Oil and Cake Mills) acquired the site of a former brickyards, and began oil processing operations; a large silo and river in-shipment facility was completed in 1919, to the design of architects Gelder and Kitchen. The plant was connected to the rail network by a branch line running off the Hull Docks Branch. The plant concentrated on the production of cooking fat and margarine. An extension factory for the production of New Pin Soap was opened in 1921. The British Soap Company entered into vigorous competition, affecting the soap business of Lever Brothers; in 1925 Lever Brothers acquired the parent company British Oil and Cake Mills, ending the cut-throat competition; the factory closed by 1934. In 1940 Gill & Duffus established a cocoa mill, British Cocoa Mills (Hull) Ltd., at Cleveland Street, on the site of the former Wilmington works. Sculcoates Bridge of 1875, and rebuilt Swan Mill, right, . (2005) The River Hull corridor was one of ten primary Luftwaffe targets during the Hull Blitz, and the focus of the attack on the nights of 13 and 18 March 1941. Spillers Mill was practically destroyed by the bombing, Also damaged were the Chapman Street school, and the Cleveland cinema. Spillers Mill was rebuilt in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including a reinforced concrete silo high with a capacity of 10,000 tons. In 1948 an explosion and fire destroyed the Hull cocoa factory resulting in several deaths; a tank containing petrol used in the cocoa manufacturing process ruptured, and was ignited. A mill was rebuilt by 1952. Wilmington station closed in 1964, the Victoria Dock Branch Line closed 1968. The Wilmington cement works closed in 1969. The Cleveland cinema was demolished in 1960. Also in the 1970s the pattern of housing established was removed; by the 1980s practically none of the Victorian housing remained, and the area became predominately industrial or undeveloped.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560/1:10000 1893‚Äì4, 1911, 1956‚Äì7, 1969, 1971‚Äì7, 1982‚Äì4 A caravan site opened in Wilmington in 1976.

In around the same time period a new bus depot for the Hull bus fleet (Stagecoach in Hull) was constructed to the south, the depot opened 1 September 1996. =21st century= In 1999/2000 planning applications were submitted for a waste handling facilities including composting and incinerating facilities at Foster Street, with an incinerator on the site of the former British Extracting Co. works. The plans were submitted in relation to a 25-year waste management contract made with Waste Recycling Group by Hull City Council. The works included a chimney, and buildings of around high. The proposed ¬£30 million works was to burn around 150,000 tonnes of waste per year, generating electricity plus 850 tonnes of ash re-usable for construction and 120 tonnes of ash requiring landfill disposal per year ‚Äì the plans generated significant opposition. The incinerator was recommended for approval but refused by the council in 2001, and refused on appeal in 2003. Remains of demolished Spillers mill, with 1950s concrete silo behind (2008) The Spillers' Swan Mill was demolished . In 2010 ADM Cocoa closed the cocoa mill, citing overcapacity and a move of confectionery production to eastern Europe. In June 2011 a planning application was submitted by Spencer Group for an waste to energy plant designed to generate 25.5 MW electrical and 3.4 MW gas energy via gasification and anaerobic digestion respectively. The plant was split over two sites, part on the site of the former cocoa and Spillers mills; and the second part to the north, west of Glass House Row. The plant was to use approximately 150,000 tonnes of waste wood, plus 37,000 tonnes of locally sourced commercial and industrial waste. The application was accepted in October 2011 and the project received a ¬£19.9 million grant from the UK government (via the European Regional Development Fund) which was authorised by European Union in 2012. In 2014 a joint venture of Spencer group and MWH Global subsidiary MWH Treatment was selected to build the first stage of the ¬£150 million project. The plant obtained via auction CFD funding in early 2015, with a ¬£119.89 per MWhr strike price. In late 2015 Spencer Group announced that funding for the scheme had been arranged, with construction to start early 2016, with the facility expected operational by early 2018.

The extramural church gained its name because the road leading up to this hill here passed a series of crosses. Presepe in church Vestibule. Interior. History The church was founded in 1581, but underwent reconstruction in 1638 by the architect Cosimo Fanzago. He avoided the prevalent polychrome marble decoration of churches, and adhered to the characteristic plainness of many Observant Franciscan Order churches. The columns from within the church were likely appropriated from another older church. The main altar has 17th century wooden statues by Fra' Diego da Careri. The statue of St Francis and putti on the facade are attributed by some to Fanzago, but some documents point to a little known Franciscan friar-sculptor. Fanzago also sculpted the statues of St Peter and St Paul for the holy water fonts. His son Carlo Fanzago sculpted a bas-relief for the main altar depicting the Deposed Christ. The Cloister has frescoes depicting Gospel stories by Belisario Corenzio. The church was associated with the Franciscan friar Giovanni da Napoli. This friar was a key intermediary in arranging the marriage of the Viceroy Duke of Medina with Anna Carafa. The friar became personal acquaintance of the Spanish king, Philip IV of Spain, and in 1638, through the intervention of cardinal Francesco Barberini, he was appointed general of Osservanza dei Francescani Riformati by Pope Urban VIII, and the next year elected general the Franciscan Order, and then in 1645 at Toledo, Minister General of the Order.

Hoveton Hall, Hoveton in Norfolk is an historic house of significance on the English Heritage Register. It is a well-preserved Regency house of gault brick with a slate roof and was built between 1809 and 1812 by Humphry Repton, the well-known architect and landscape designer. Today it is part of an estate of 120 acres of gardens and parkland and 450 acres of arable land as well as picturesque woodland. The gardens are open to the public during part of the year and there are facilities available for accommodation and special events particularly weddings. Early History of Hoveton Hall Estate Faden's Map of 1797. There was a manor house called Hoveton Hall on the property which was demolished when the new house was built in 1809. The site of this old manor is unclear as no part of the building remains. However Basil Cozens-Hardy analysed the existing maps and data and concluded. \\"It would seem that the original hall was near the kitchen garden in the park, as a map and schedule of about 1840 (see map below) calls the field to the south- west \\" the Old Hall Close‚Äù. Moreover in Faden‚Äôs map of 1797 (see map on right) the hall is shown at this point with an avenue running down to the road.\\"Coxens-Hardy, Bazil, ‚ÄúSome Norfolk Houses‚Äù, Norfolk Archaeology‚Äù, Vol 32, 1961, p. 187. Christabell Burroughes The originator of Hoveton Hall was Christabell Burroughes who commissioned Humphry Repton p. 39. to construct the mansion in 1809. Christabell was born in 1764. Her father was Henry Negus (1734-1807) a solicitor who worked in Bungay, Suffolk but who also owned Hoveton Hall.Norfolk Chronicle, 15 August 1807, p. 1. The Negus family had for a long time been wealthy landowners in the Hoveton area. In 1789 Christabell married James Burkin Burroughes who had inherited Burlingham Hall in Norfolk vol 3, p. 553. (now demolished). The couple lived at Burlingham Hall for some time but unfortunately in 1803 at the age of only 43 James died leaving Christabell to care for seven sons and one daughter.Volume 1, p. 427. Walled Garden at Hoveton Hall Map of Hoveton Hall in 1840 She remained at the Hall for several years. In 1807 her father Henry Negus died and as she was his sole heir she became owner of Hoveton Hall with its existing old manor house. Possibly because her eldest son Henry Negus Burroughes was to turn 21 in 1812 and therefore inherit Burlingham Hall, she decided to build her own house at Hoveton. By 1812 the new house was complete and she moved there with her younger children. She suffered a severe loss three years later when two of her sons James and Edward who had been sent to Cambridge University died there within a week of each other because of an outbreak of an infectious fever.The East Anglian: Or Notes and Queries on Subjects Connected with the Counties of Suffolk, Cambridge, Essex and Norfolk, Volume 1, p. 427. Christabell was a very good gardener and was mentioned frequently in the gardening magazines of the time. She had the walled garden constructed early as it is shown in the Enclosure Map of 1828. In 1841 James Grigor, a botanist visited Hoveton Hall and gave a very favourable account of the garden. Some of the extracts are as follows. \\"Though evening was darkening around us when we visited this place, we had sufficient time to perceive that it ranks deservedly high as a seat of general excellence‚Ä¶Whilst the flower-garden here is of such perfect character, the scenes of the shrubbery and pleasure-ground are of an equally interesting description. The shrubbery is a well-managed piece of work, successfully blended with the lawn of the pleasure-ground, and though modern, already contributing to the general beauty of the place. The most elegant part of the picture lies betwixt the hall and the kitchen-garden, a locality which art has rendered very ornamental, and where the shrubs are assuming a high degree of beauty. The whole place is so judiciously laid out, that we hazard the opinion that it has been done by someone who has become eminent in his profession. The trees here form a grand sight. They are chiefly of the oak tribe, and at the south-west side of the mansion they rise in the form of an avenue. The elegant manner in which this seat is kept, combined with the extensive and well- assorted collection of flowers and shrubs which it contains, merits our highest praise.\\"Grigor, James, 1841 ‚ÄúThe eastern, arboretum; or, Register of remarkable trees, seats, gardens, etc., in the county of Norfolk‚Äù, p. 162. In 1843 Christabell died and her eldest son Henry Negus Burroughes inherited Hoveton Hall. Henry Negus Burroughes After he inherited Hoveton Hall in 1843 Henry Negus Burroughes continued to live at his main residence Burlingham Hall. However his younger brother William lived at Hoveton Hall for some time.White‚Äôs 1945 Norfolk Directory.

His daughter Catherine was born there. John was part of the wealthy Gurney family who had established the Norwich Bank. His father Samuel Gurney (1786-1856) was known as a prominent banker and philanthropist. John moved to his ancestral home Earlham Court a few years later and died there in 1856 at the age of only 44 leaving Laura to care for the children. A century later John‚Äôs great grandson Desmond Gurney Buxton bought Hoveton Hall and lived there for many years (see below). After John Gurney moved from the Hall the Reverend Randall Burroughes (1829-1872) moved there with his family. Randall Burroughes was the son of Henry Negus Burroughes. In 1852 he married Emily Harbord who was the daughter of Edward Harbord 3rd Baron Suffield. The couple lived at Hoveton Hall until 1872 when Randall died.The Peerage website. In the same year Henry Negus Burroughes died and the Hall was sold. Sir Jacob Henry Preston bought the property in 1873.The National Archives, Agreement of sale 1873.

He was related to the Burroughes family by marriage as his sister Pleasance had married Jeremiah Burroughes a son of Christabell. After Sir Jacob Henry Preston died in 1891 his son and subsequently his grandson, Sir Jacob Preston (1887-1818) inherited the property and they all appear to have rented it to tenants.

After his death two years later in 1914 his wife Susan continued to live at the property but she decided to sell it in 1919. The new owner was Geoffrey Fowell Buxton (1852-1929) who was a Director of the Barclay Bank. He was also involved in the Volunteer movement and was the second in command of the 1st Battalion of the Norfolk Regiment. In 1903 he was the Mayor of the Norwich Town Council.The Times (London) Apr 12, 1929; pg. 16. When he died in 1929 his wife Mary put the property on the market. An advertisement for the sale of the house is shown. George Cradock bought the house but unfortunately his wife Eunice died in 1934 and he put the property up for sale the following year. Captain Henry Douglas Clark (1889-1952) who was the son of a very prominent shipbuilder purchased the house and made substantial renovations. In 1946 Desmond Buxton bought the Hall and it has remained in the Buxton family since then.

History The Winchester Model 1906 was designed as a more inexpensive companion to the popular Model 1890, the main differences being the 1906's flat shotgun-style butt plate and rounded barrel, as opposed to the 1890s crescent butt plate and octagon barrel. When the Model 1906 first became available, it was chambered exclusively for the .22 Short cartridge, however this was modified after serial number 113,000 (in the second year of production, 1908) when it was made to cycle .22 Long and .22 Long Rifle interchangeably in order to ensure the rifle's continued popularity.http://www.homesteadfirearms.com There were three different variants produced by Winchester; the .22 Short Model, the Standard Model, and the Expert Model.Weaponeer.net The .22 Short Model was made until 1908, when the caliber modification came about. It was distinguishable by its flat, plain slide grip. The Standard Model was introduced after the 1908 change, and featured a grooved slide grip, while the Expert Model, the deluxe version produced from 1918 to 1924, had a plain fluted slide grip and a pistol gripped stock. The Expert Model was a favorite of Theodore Roosevelt's children and cousins.Treasures of the NRA National Firearms Museum, page 66 Although production ended officially in 1932, a small number of Model 1906 rifles were built out of spare parts left in the factory until 1936. The last known serial number is 847,997, which does not match the number of rifles sold. This is attributed to the fact that large blocks of serial numbers were skipped during production.Weaponeer.net References See also * Winchester rifle * Pump-action Category:Pump-action rifles Category:Rifles of the United States Category:Winchester Repeating Arms Company firearms Category:.22 LR rifles Category:Takedown guns ","title":"Winchester Model 1906"},{"id":"43369798","text":"Urgleptes abstersus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Early life  Rosenthal grew up in Queens, New York with his parents and two brothers.  Mathematics career  Rosenthal graduated from Queens College, City University of New York with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1962. In 1963 he obtained an MA in Mathematics and in 1967 a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan; his Ph.D. thesis advisor was Paul Halmos. His thesis, \\"On lattices of invariant subspaces\\" concerns operators on Hilbert space, and most of his subsequent research has been in operator theory and related fields. Much of his work has been related to the invariant subspace problem, the still-unsolved problem of the existence of invariant subspaces for bounded linear operators on Hilbert space. Among many other topics, he has made substantial contributions to the development of reflexive and reductive operator algebras and to the study of lattices of invariant subspaces, composition operators on the Hardy-Hilbert space and linear operator equations. His publications include many with his long-time collaborator Heydar Radjavi, including the book \\"Invariant subspaces\\" (Springer-Verlag, 1973; second edition 2003). Rosenthal has supervised the Ph.D. theses of fifteen students and the research work of a number of post- doctoral fellows.  Legal career  In parallel with his career in mathematics, Rosenthal has pursued a career in law. He worked as a paralegal before obtaining an LL.B. from the University of Toronto in 1990. He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1992. He is a major figure in the Toronto legal community, and has been profiled by Toronto Life, The Globe and Mail, and the Toronto Star In 2006, Now Magazine named Rosenthal Toronto's \\"Best activist lawyer\\". In May 2016, he was awarded a Law Society Medal by the Law Society of Upper Canada. Rosenthal represented Miguel Figueroa, the leader of the Communist Party of Canada, in the case Figueroa v.

Its source is Costigan Lake located near the uranium producing areas around the Key Lake mine in the Athabasca Basin and flows in a north-easterly direction to drain in Wollaston Lake. As the primary inflow of Wollaston Lake (the largest natural bifurcation lake in the world) the Geikie River's most unusual feature is that it straddles a major drainage divide which separates waters flowing into Hudson Bay from those flowing into the Arctic Ocean. From Wollaston Lake, waters from the Geikie River can flow into either the Fond du Lac River which flows out of the lake to the north-west where it drains into Lake Athabasca which ultimately drains into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River system, or into the Cochrane River which flows out of the north-eastern side of the lake and into Reindeer Lake which drains via the Churchill River system into Hudson Bay. If Hudson Bay is defined as part of the Atlantic Ocean then the Geikie River is the largest river in the world that drains naturally into two oceans.

He was the Bishop of Eger between 1156 and 1158, and the Archbishop of Esztergom from 1158 until his death in 1181. Lucas is believed to have come from a wealthy and influential family, but sources are uncertain of his origin. He was one of the first students of the University of Paris. When he returned to Hungary, his ecclesiastical career ascended quickly into the highest dignities. As a confidant of G√©za II in his last years, Lucas had a significant impact on the country's foreign policy and diplomatic processes. Lucas was a staunch supporter of Stephen III during the struggles in the √Årp√°d dynasty following G√©za II's death, where Stephen III's reign was contested by his two uncles. The archbishop opposed both the intervention efforts of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. Lucas had an ambivalent relationship with Stephen's brother and successor B√©la III. The strict and uncompromising nature of his extremist Gregorianism challenged and weakened his partnership and alliance with the Holy See in the last decade of his archiepiscopal tenure, which coincided with the pontificate of Pope Alexander III. Ancestry Lucas is said to have been born to a wealthy and illustrious noble family in the early 1120s, but his origin is uncertain and undetermined. His brother was Apa (or Appa), a powerful lord in the royal court of G√©za II of Hungary. Apa came into prominence after the fall of Belo≈°, and served as the isp√°n of Bodrog County in 1156 and then as the Ban of Slavonia from around 1157 to 1158. According to an inauthentic charter he was also Judge royal in 1158. From the 18th century onwards, several historians and genealogists attempted to connect Lucas and his brother Apa to various notable genera (clans) in the Kingdom of Hungary. Andr√°s Lehotzky and Iv√°n Nagy proposed that Lucas was a member of the B√°nfi (B√°nffy; lit. \\"son of a ban\\") de Als√≥lendva family, originating from the Hah√≥t clan, while other historians proposed he descended from the B√°nfi (B√°nffy) branches of the Tomaj and Gutkeled clans. N√°ndor Knauz called him \\"Lucas B√°nffy de Als√≥ Lindva de genere Guthkeled\\" in his work, the Monumenta ecclesiae Strigoniensis (1874), whose proposal is faulty. Aside from surnames being anachronisms for the time, the Fels≈ëlendvais were the ones who originated from the Gutkeled clan (and there is no such \\"B√°nffy de Fels≈ëlendva\\" kinship) instead of the B√°nffys de Als√≥lendva. Both families adopted their surname in the 14th century after their distinguished members, Nicholas Gutkeled and Nicholas Hah√≥t respectively, bore the title of ban. Historian Ubul K√°llay rejected the aforementioned theories and argued Apa and Lucas were the sons of Alexius, a Ban of Slavonia during the reign of Stephen II of Hungary. Therefore, K√°llay referred to Lucas with the surname \\"B√°nfi\\" anachronistically and theorised he was a member of the Gutkeled clan and brother of Martin Gutkeled, who erected the Benedictine abbey of Csat√°r. Later academic works and historians ‚Äì including Gyula Pauler, B√°lint H√≥man, Gyula Krist√≥ and Ferenc Makk ‚Äì refer to him as simply \\"Archbishop Lucas\\". Education and early career From around 1150 to 1156, Lucas studied at the University of Paris, where he was a student of Gerard la Pucelle, a scholar of canon law and later the Bishop of Coventry. He was one of the first Hungarians who attended a foreign university and the first known Hungarian alumnus of the newly established University of Paris. He acquired a high degree in church law and earned the respect of the other students there. Lucas could be the first Hungarian cleric who became familiar with Decretum Gratiani, an early-mid 12th century collection of canon law compiled as a legal textbook. Among his fellow pupils was supposedly English chronicler Walter Map (Gualterius Mappus), who recalled Lucas in his only surviving work De nugis curialium. He described Lucas as a highly educated man and a gracious Christian; he stated that Lucas unselfishly shared his goods and meals with his fellow students. Map added that Lucas had his own accommodation and personnel within the university (supporting his upper-class origins) and gladly made donations. However, Map (born around 1140) was definitely younger than Lucas and attended the school a decade later in the 1160s, suggesting that he heard the anecdote secondhand. As a student, Lucas established productive relationships with English scholars and clerics like John of Salisbury. In the following decades, John of Salisbury and Walter Map became acquainted with Thomas Becket, a significant and powerful prelate in 12th-century England. Historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy compared their careers and found several similarities between the pro-papal activities of Lucas and Thomas Becket in the upcoming decades. According to Gy√∂rffy, they did not know each other personally (Thomas Becket was a secretary of Theobald of Bec by the time Lucas resided in Paris), but they knew about each other through mutual acquaintances and used similar ecclesiastical tools to defend their interests against the secular royal power. As Map narrated in his anecdote about Lucas, Hugh of le Mans, Bishop of Acre informed him about Lucas' later encounters with the warring √Årp√°d dynasty of Hungary, which Becket learned through Map. When he returned to Hungary, Lucas was elected Bishop of Eger in 1156. He was still referred to as bishop-elect throughout in 1156 until March 1157. When Gervasius, Bishop of Gy≈ër interceded with G√©za II to grant the right to collect salt to the Archdiocese of Esztergom at N√°na and Kakat (present-day ≈†t√∫rovo, Slovakia), he was addressed as bishop during his act as witness to the document. His election was confirmed by Pope Adrian IV in the previous weeks. Due to a lack of sources, there is no record of Lucas' activity or function as the Bishop of Eger; his name only appears in the list of dignitaries of the various royal charters issued by G√©za II. In 1157 political unrest occurred in Hungary; chronicler Rahewin records that King G√©za II's youngest brother, Stephen, began conspiring with their ambitious uncle, Belo≈°, and other lords against the monarch. G√©za II expelled his rebellious brother and sentenced him to death, while Belo≈° lost his influence over the royal court and fled Hungary in the latter half of the year. His departure resulted in Apa's political ascent to the position of Ban of Slavonia in late 1157. It is plausible Apa supported the growth of Lucas' ecclesiastical career and had a role in his brother's return to Hungary. After their failed rebellion, G√©za II's two brothers, Ladislaus and Stephen sought refuge in the Byzantine Empire by 1160, where they found shelter in the court of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos at Constantinople. Archbishop of Esztergom =Influence over G√©za II= G√©za II of Hungary (r. 1141‚Äì1162) Martyrius, Archbishop of Esztergom died in the spring of 1158 and was soon succeeded by Lucas. Apa and Lucas became the strongest proponents of G√©za II during his last regnal years and respectively held the most distinguished secular and ecclesiastical dignities. When the king made a donation in favor of the Cathedral of Saint Domnius and its archbishop Gaudius twice in 1158, the brothers only appeared in his accompaniment by name. Lucas' sympathized with the reformist wing in the Roman Curia, which also affected G√©za II's foreign policies in the following years. He was dubbed as the \\"representative of extreme Gregorianism\\" in Hungary by later scholars. As theologian J√≥zsef T√∂r√∂k expressed, Lucas \\"vigilantly guarded the interests of the legitimate Pope [Alexander III] and the Church\\" during his first years as archbishop. He was one of the first Hungarian prelates who thought on a whole European and Christian universalist scale and integrated into the contemporary mainstream school of clerical theology. Literary historian J√°nos Gy≈ëry suggested that Lucas sympathized with the heretic movements prevalent in the region ‚Äì Albigensians, Patarenes and Bogomils, but the majority of scholars do not share this fringe theory. Pope Alexander III meets his rival Frederick Barbarossa Initially, G√©za II supported the efforts of Frederick Barbarossa against the pro-papal Italian communes (that were later known collectively as the Lombard League), and even sent Hungarian auxiliary troops to accompany the Holy Roman Emperor to Italy between 1158 and 1160. Barbarossa forced the Italian towns to surrender in September 1158. However, Milan and Crema openly rebelled against the emperor's rule after the Diet of Roncaglia ordered the restoration of imperial rights. G√©za II sent his envoys to Barbarossa's camp and promised to dispatch further reinforcements against the rebellious towns. The death of Pope Adrian IV on 1 September 1159 divided the college of the cardinals: the majority of the cardinals opposed Barbarossa while a minority supported him. The first group elected Alexander III as pope, but Barbarossa's supporters chose Victor IV instead. Barbarossa convened a synod to Pavia to end the schism. G√©za II sent his envoys to the church council where Victor IV was declared the lawful pope in February 1160. However, Archbishop-elect Lucas remained loyal to Alexander III and persuaded G√©za II to start negotiations with Alexander III's representatives. G√©za II switched allegiances after most of the other European monarchs joined Alexander III. G√©za II's envoys announced his decision to Alexander III in early 1161, but he only informed the emperor of his recognition of Alexander III in the autumn of the same year. A letter from Lucas to his ally, Eberhard, Archbishop of Salzburg, who was the leading pro- Alexander figure in the Holy Roman Empire, revealed his influence carried significant weight with G√©za II when he changed the direction of his foreign policy. Lucas presented the case as if he alone had been responsible for G√©za II's recognition of Pope Alexander, as he wrote \\"I have managed through appeals to cause our Lord the King and our whole church to accept Alexander\\". Several historians ‚Äì including Gyula Pauler and J√≥zsef Gerics ‚Äì accepted the letter's contents and considered Lucas' significant role in negotiating with the pro-Barbarossa envoy, Bishop Daniel of Prague in 1161 at Easter before Daniel's official meeting with G√©za II. However, Ferenc Makk notes there is no other source which emphasises Lucas' role in the events beside his own letter. G√©za II and Pope Alexander III's envoy, papal legate Pietro di Miso signed a concordat in the summer of 1161 that Lucas mediated. It guaranteed that G√©za II would not depose or transfer prelates without the consent of the Holy See, the Holy See could not send papal legates to Hungary without the king's permission, and Hungarian prelates were only allowed to appeal to the Holy See with the king's consent. Pope Alexander, who was fully aware of Lucas' allegiance and foreign policy activities, showed his appreciation by sending Lucas the archiepiscopal pallium in July 1161, confirming that Lucas' election occurred three years earlier. According to a decretal of Pope Alexander III issued in 1167 or 1168, when the papal legate, cardinal Pietro di Miso was sent to Hungary to hand over the pallium to Lucas, the archbishop's brother \\"Alban\\" (most scholars identified him with Apa) provided a horse for the legate when Pietro and his escort entered the Hungarian border via Dalmatia across the Adriatic Sea. The letter stated that Archbishop Lucas worried this step could be seen as simony in the Roman Curia. Pope Alexander reassured the prelate with Biblical phrases and warned Lucas not to disturb him with trivial matters. The decretal, which later became part of Decretales Gregorii IX (or Liber extra), reflects Lucas' rigid individuality, excessive strictness, and extreme Gregorian views which characterized his reign as Archbishop of Esztergom. 18th-century historian Mikl√≥s Schmitth notes that Lucas successfully recovered the stolen gems of the late Martyrius from the thief Jordanus immediately after being elected as archbishop. According to a royal charter supposedly issued by Stephen III, G√©za II ordered Ded of V√°c and Chama of Eger to rededicate the Szentjobb Abbey (present-day S√¢niob in Romania) with Lucas' consent. It also stated that the Benedictine monastery of Szentjobb was attacked and plundered by the sons of a certain \\"Palatine Paul\\" thereafter; as a result, Archbishop Lucas excommunicated them. Historian Tam√°s K√∂rmendi questioned the validity of the issuance, which suffers from 18th-century misinterpretations, explanations, anachronisms, and factual errors. =Dynastic struggles= Ladislaus II, steals the crown (the throne) from his nephew, Stephen III (from the Illuminated Chronicle) G√©za II died unexpectedly on 31 May 1162. Archbishop Lucas crowned G√©za II's elder son, 15-year-old Stephen III king without delay in early June in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Immediately after the coronation, Byzantine Emperor Manuel, who attempted to extend his influence over the neighboring kingdom, dispatched an army to Hungary which advanced as far as Haram (now Ram, Serbia) and sent envoys to Hungary to promote the claim of the young monarch's namesake uncle to the Hungarian throne. Most of the lords opposed Stephen as their king because of his familial relationship with Manuel. The magnates decided to accept Stephen's uncle, Ladislaus II, as a \\"compromise candidate\\" between being bribed by the Byzantines and being afraid of a potential invasion by the Emperor. Stephen III's army was routed at Kapuv√°r and he fled from Hungary and sought refuge in Austria six weeks after his coronation. Archbishop Lucas stayed in Hungary after the Byzantine intervention and was one of the few who remained loyal to Stephen and refused to crown Ladislaus; as a result, Mik√≥, Archbishop of Kalocsa performed the ceremony in July 1162, despite the coronation of the Hungarian monarch being the Archbishop of Esztergom's responsibility for centuries. Lucas considered Ladislaus II to be an usurper and excommunicated him through his envoy, declaring that he had unlawfully seized the crown from his nephew. Lucas also excommunicated his fellow archbishop Mik√≥ for his participation in the process. As Makk noted, the legal basis for Lucas to impose ecclesiastical punishment against Ladislaus II was provided by Article 17 of St. Stephen's Second Code and Article 2 of the so- called Second Synod of Esztergom during the reign of Coloman. According to Map's De nugis curialium, the new monarch tried to intimidate and persuade the prelate to his side, but Lucas remained steadfast and strongly condemned his controversial accession to the Hungarian throne. In response the archbishop was arrested and imprisoned shortly thereafter. Stephen IV depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle Ladislaus II attempted to reconcile himself with his opponents and released Archbishop Lucas at Christmas at Pope Alexander III's request. Map preserved the circumstances of his release (see above). However, Lucas did not yield to him, continued to support Stephen III, and became a central figure of Ladislaus' domestic opposition. His obstinate resistance indicated that any possibility of a reconciliation between the partisans of Stephen III and Ladislaus II was lost. Lucas did not recognize the legitimacy of Ladislaus' rule and organised the possibility of an open rebellion against the pro-Byzantine regime. Lucas' political interests conflicted with Pope Alexander's, who maintained a moderately good relationship with the courts of Ladislaus II and Emperor Manuel on account of the constant threat of Barbarossa's anti-papal policy. Church historian J√≥zsef T√∂r√∂k argues Lucas saw the consistent and exclusive application of the ancient custom of primogeniture as the pledge of the stability of the kingdom, which was endangered by the ambitions of Ladislaus and Stephen. Lucas spoke of the negative example of the Byzantine Empire, which experienced civil wars, dynastic struggles, cognate murders and anarchy. Lucas' resistance led Ladislaus to imprison him again within days. Meanwhile, Stephen III returned to Hungary with an army and captured Pressburg (present-day Bratislava in Slovakia). Soon after, Ladislaus II died suddenly on 14 January 1163. Many of his contemporaries considered Lucas' curse as a contributing factor to his death. Stephen III could not take the crown after his uncle's death because his other uncle, Stephen IV (Ladislaus II's brother), acceded to the throne. Archbishop Lucas refused to crown him and remained in custody. The coronation was performed again by Archbishop Mik√≥ on 27 January. Lucas excommunicated Stephen IV and declared his rule illegal. Stephen IV's unveiled support for the interests of the Byzantine Empire caused discontent among the Hungarian barons. Stephen III mustered an army of barons who had deserted his uncle and supplemented it with German mercenaries. He defeated his uncle at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 19 June 1163. Stephen IV was captured, but his nephew released him, at Lucas's advice, on the condition that he never return to Hungary. According to Henry of M√ºgeln's chronicle, Lucas was freed from prison by then. =Stephen III's reign= The dethroned Stephen IV first fled to the Holy Roman Empire, but left shortly afterwards for the Byzantine Empire, where Emperor Manuel promised him support. The Byzantine Emperor sent an army to Hungary to help Stephen IV regain the throne from his nephew. Large-scale military campaigns characterized the following years; Lucas, along with the Dowager Queen Euphrosyne, advised Stephen III throughout his reign. After a peace treaty with Emperor Manuel, Stephen III agreed to send his younger brother, B√©la, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize B√©la's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. In an attempt to recapture these territories, Stephen III waged wars against the Byzantine Empire between 1164 and 1167, but could not defeat the Byzantines. Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos During the war with the Byzantine Empire, Stephen III sought assistance from Emperor Frederick, Pope Alexander's enemy. The alliance, despite its reasonable military considerations, was strongly opposed by Lucas and the pope, who requested Lucas via Archbishop Eberhard of Salzburg to prevent Stephen III from seeking military help from the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Alexander, additionally, complained that celibacy was not universal among the prelates in Hungary. There is also evidence that suggests that Stephen III seized Church revenues to finance his war with the Byzantine Empire. As a result, Lucas' relationship worsened with his monarch sometime after 1165 or 1166, and resulted in leaving the royal court for years. The royal chapel, which was responsible for drafting and issuing royal diplomas under the guidance of the Archbishop of Esztergom, ceased its operations during Lucas' voluntary withdrawal. His notary Becen remained loyal to him, and only three royal charters were preserved between 1166 and 1169; as only church employees were the only ones able to read and write, the lower number of charters drafted represented the temporary decline of literacy. Pope Alexander sent his legate Cardinal Manfred to Hungary in 1169, who discussed the debated issues with the king, the queen mother, and the prelates. Manfred and Lucas convened a synod to Esztergom (called Third Council of Esztergom). The negotiations ended in an agreement that prohibited the monarch from arbitrarily deposing or relocating the prelates or confiscating their property. Stephen III also acknowledged Alexander as the legitimate pope. Makk wrote Archbishop Lucas was one of the key drafters of the concordat. However the pope supported Stephen III against Lucas when the archbishop attempted to hinder the consecration of the king's prot√©g√©, Andrew, Bishop-elect of Gy≈ër, because of his allegedly non-canonical election. Although Manfred admonished Lucas to celebrate Andrew's consecration, he refused to do so, demonstrating that his relationship with the Holy See was no longer harmonious by the end of the 1160s. A letter issued by the pope around March 1179 stated that sometime after 1169, Archbishop Lucas excommunicated Stephen III and Queen Euphrosyne because of an \\"insignificant subterfuge\\". Archbishop Lucas reconciled with Stephen III around March 1171, according to Map. Stephen III died one year later on 4 March 1172. His funeral mass in Esztergom was celebrated by Lucas, according to Arnold of L√ºbeck's Chronica Slavorum. =Ambivalent relationship with B√©la III= Following the death of Stephen III, a Hungarian delegation visited Emperor Manuel and B√©la in Sardica (now Sophia in Bulgaria) and invited the prince to the Hungarian throne. B√©la, who lived in Constantinople since 1163 and was the former designated heir of the Byzantine Empire, arrived in Hungary with his wife Agnes of Antioch in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in late April or early May. It is uncertain if Archbishop Lucas initially supported B√©la's claim (as historian Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy and Andr√°s Kubinyi argued), or if he was against B√©la's invitation from the beginning. In a letter written by Pope Alexander III, B√©la was unanimously elected king by the \\"dignitaries of the Hungarian kingdom\\", including Lucas. However, B√©la's coronation was delayed because Lucas refused to perform the ceremony. The Archbishop accused the king of simony because B√©la had given a precious cloak (pallium) to his delegate. A theory suggests that Lucas also feared that the influence of \\"schismatics\\" would increase under B√©la's rule. Nevertheless, the majority of the barons and prelates remained loyal to B√©la, who sought the assistance of the Holy See against the archbishop. Pope Alexander III imposed a papal rebuke on Lucas for his inflexibility and ordered him to crown B√©la, but the archbishop continued to refuse to crown B√©la III. Upon B√©la's request, Pope Alexander III temporarily authorized the Archbishop of Kalocsa (presumably Chama) to anoint B√©la king and perform his coronation, which took place on 18 January 1173. Seal of B√©la III of Hungary Lucas became a member of the internal opposition which rejected B√©la's reign. The archbishop allied with his former opponent Queen Euphrosyne and supported the aspirations of the late G√©za II's youngest son, G√©za, who aimed to continue the anti-Byzantine and pro-papal (at least, since 1169) policies of Stephen III. Around the same time, Lucas lifted Euphrosyne from papal anathema unilaterally, which was imposed on her after she had allegedly confiscated the provostship of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r from its provost, Gregory. To avoid a possible civil war, B√©la III imprisoned G√©za (who had already contacted Emperor Frederick) soon after his coronation. Archbishop Lucas fell out of favour with B√©la and was ignored by him in the first years of his reign. Instead of Lucas, the Archbishop of Kalocsa baptised B√©la's first-born son, Emeric, in 1174. Lucas lost his political importance through total neglect after his long-time rival Andrew rose to become Archbishop of Kalocsa in 1176. Andrew, as a skilled diplomat, became the de facto head of the Catholic Church in Hungary and was acknowledged by Pope Alexander III. Lucas did not appear in witness lists of the subsequent royal charters for the next eight years until 1180. However, administering sacraments to members of the royal family had always been the Archbishops of Esztergom's responsibility. By 1176, B√©la overthrew G√©za's partisans' resistance and put Euphrosyne in confinement. Historian P√°l Engel observed Lucas' \\"anxiety proved to be wholly unjustified\\", as B√©la III governed Hungary as an independent monarch and excluded the neighboring empire's influence beyond its borders throughout his reign. Lucas' retirement from state affairs resulted in the issuance of written records and the termination of official literacy within the royal chapel. Several educated and skilled members of its staff left the royal court to follow Lucas, which can be traced by the drastic reduction in the number of royal decrees until 1181. The royal chapel never regained its former influence, even after B√©la III and Lucas reconciled after 1179. In the imperial court of Constantinople, B√©la learnt the importance of a well- organised administration and emphasised the importance of written records. In 1181 he ordered that a charter was to be issued for all transactions proceeding in his presence. This decision resulted in permanently establishing the Royal Chancery and the proliferation of governmental literacy independent from the ecclesiastical institutions. B√©la III aimed to separate the issuance of royal charters from the court clergy after his long-lasting jurisdictional conflicts with Lucas. B√©la III's long-time favorite, Andrew, Archbishop of Kalocsa, insulted his royal authority between 1178 and 1179. The king deprived him and his supporter, Gregory, Provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Chapter, of their offices and seized the Archbishop's revenues. B√©la also confiscated Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r's royal chapel, which belonged to the direct jurisdiction of the Holy See. Andrew fled Hungary and petitioned to the Roman Curia, requesting an investigation at the Third Council of the Lateran. Pope Alexander III threatened B√©la III with excommunication and punished him with ecclesiastic sanctions. B√©la had reconciled with Archbishop Lucas, who absolved him and excommunicated Andrew of Kalocsa and his clerical partisans. Lucas charged Andrew with the unlawful domination of priests and clergymen of the royal churches, which were traditionally placed under the territorial authority of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Beside personal conflicts, this case was also a chapter of the long-time rivalry between the Esztergom and Kalocsa sees for the leadership of the Hungarian church. In his harshly-worded letter sent to Hungary in March 1179, Pope Alexander listed Lucas' past \\"sins\\" in detail since the rule of Stephen III and threatened to excommunicate him if he maintained the punishment he imposed on Andrew. In another letter, Pope Alexander III urged the Hungary clergy not to obey Lucas' instructions. Despite the papal efforts Lucas retained his influence at the royal court until his death. Lucas' last mention of being alive was on 20 August 1181. He died shortly thereafter, roughly around the same time as Pope Alexander III's death. Lucas was succeeded as Archbishop of Esztergom by Nicholas in 1181. Legacy and canonization process Gy√∂rffy noted that Lucas was the first prelate in the continental Europe, who spread the cult of Thomas Becket (later sanctified as Saint Thomas of Canterbury), who was murdered in 1170 and was canonized by Pope Alexander III three years later. Upon B√©la's invitation, plausibly under the influence of Lucas, Cistercian monks came from Pontigny Abbey ‚Äì Becket's former place of exile ‚Äì and set up a new filial abbey at Egres in 1179. Lucas also founded a provostship at the outskirts of Esztergom, dedicated to Becket (present-day Szenttam√°s, a borough of Esztergom). Some of Becket's relics were transferred to Esztergom in the 16th century. Lucas was styled as \\"saintly\\" by the records of Henry of M√ºgeln and Cistercian friar Alberic of Trois-Fontaines. According to Italian historian Odorico Raynaldi, Lucas died as an \\"eminent moral priest\\", who cured sick people of their various illnesses, honouring him as a saint. His canonisation was first initiated by Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom in 1231, who had several conflicts with Andrew II of Hungary and the intervening secular authority. This influenced Lucas to promote the political goals of Robert, according to historian Gyula Krist√≥. Upon his request, Pope Gregory IX entrusted Bulcs√∫ L√°d, Bishop of Csan√°d and two other clergymen on 28 August 1231 to conduct an investigation and send their report to Rome. After receiving the report and the letter in support of Andrew, the pope ordered papal legate Giacomo Pecoraria on 17 February 1233 to deal with the canonisation issue among other matters. However the protocol was lost and the canonisation was postponed. Egyed Hermann and J√≥zsef F√©legyh√°zy stated that the initiative failed in silence due to the Mongol invasion of 1241. Other historians argue Lucas was not necessarily a suitable and exemplary person for the Holy See as he has repeatedly represented the interests of his church against even the pope. Andrew's son, B√©la IV unsuccessfully attempted to initiate canonisation. There were some semi official attempts by some prelates afterwards, including Ign√°c Batthy√°ny, J√°nos Scitovszky and J√≥zsef Mindszenty.

He was Archbishop of Kalocsa between around 1156 and 1165. He crowned two Hungarian monarchs, Ladislaus II and Stephen IV king, because Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom, who considered them as usurpers, had denied to perform the ceremony. Early career Mik√≥ is first mentioned by a contemporary record in 1148, when he already served as provost of the collegiate chapter of Buda. In that year, King G√©za II expanded the sources of revenues for the chapter by granting significant and lucrative surrounding customs and port duties ‚Äì for instance, G√©zav√°s√°ra (\\"G√©za's fair\\"), the ports of Pest and Kerepes, the fishing rights on the Danube from the port of Megyer to the royal land of Csepel Island ‚Äì in the territory of present-day Budapest. Archbishop of Kalocsa Mik√≥ elevated into the archbishopric of Kalocsa by 1156, when he first appeared in this capacity. Hist last known predecessor, Simon held the dignity more than two decades earlier, according to the surviving documents and charters. In that year, he appeared as a witness, when Archbishop Martyrius of Esztergom provided the tithe of 70 villages in the surrounding counties to the cathedral chapter of Esztergom. Mik√≥ was accompanied by Peter, provost of Titel (now in Serbia) during the act. He featured a similar function in the next year, March 1157, when Gervasius, Bishop of Gy≈ër interceded with G√©za II to grant the collection right of salt duties to the archdiocese of Esztergom at N√°na and Kakat (present-day ≈†t√∫rovo, Slovakia). A non-authentic charter from 1158, which all the same may have preserved the memory of real events, refers to a court case proceeding between Antimius, Bishop of P√©cs and the abbot of P√©csv√°rad, judged by the two archbishops, including Mik√≥, and their suffragan bishops. According to another non-authentic charter, Mik√≥ hosted G√©za II and several other prelates in his archiepiscopal see, B√°cs (present-day Baƒç, Serbia) on Easter 1158. The forgery claims that G√©za, amidst the feast, transliterated Saint Stephen's privilege donations to the P√©csv√°rad Abbey (as the original document have been destroyed during a fire in 1105). Stephen IV depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle G√©za II died on 31 May 1162. His 15-year-old son, Stephen III was crowned by Archbishop Lucas within days. Initially, Mik√≥ belonged to the partisans of the new monarch and resided in his royal court. On hearing of G√©za's death, Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos dispatched an army and hastened towards Hungary, because he attempted to extend his suzerainty over the kingdom. As a result, he supported the claim of the Hungarian king's namesake uncle, Duke Stephen, who had spent the previous years in exile at Constantinople. Fearful of an invasion by the Byzantines, the Hungarian magnates agreed to accept G√©za's another brother, Duke Ladislaus as a \\"compromise candidate\\". After his defeat at Kapuv√°r, Stephen III fled from Hungary and sought refuge in Austria. Archbishop Lucas was one of the few who remained loyal to the young monarch, refusing to crown his uncle. Therefore, the coronation ceremony of Ladislaus II was performed by Mik√≥ in July 1262, despite that the coronation of the Hungarian monarch was part of the privilege of the dignity Archbishop of Esztergom (as Walter Map's De nugis curialium noted, Mik√≥ \\"had no authority for such a coronation\\"). Historian Ferenc Makk considered that the rivalry between the metropolitan sees of Esztergom and Kalocsa, beside the latter's territorial proximity to the Byzantine frontier, also contributed to Mik√≥'s defection to the court of Ladislaus II. Shortly thereafter, Lucas was imprisoned, thus Mik√≥ became de facto head of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary. During the succession disputes, the two archbishops of Hungary, Lucas and Mik√≥ never failed to take opposition sides in the factional fights. Ladislaus II died within six months, on 14 January 1163. His younger brother, Stephen IV succeeded him. Archbishop Mik√≥ once again performed his coronation ceremony on 27 January, because Lucas of Esztergom refused to crown him. Stephen's only preserved charter from the same year mentions Mik√≥ as a faithful member of his royal court. His suffragans ‚Äì for instance, Nicholas of V√°rad ‚Äì also swore loyalty to the anti-king. Stephen IV remained unpopular among the Hungarian lords, enabling his nephew to muster an army. In the decisive battle, which was fought at Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 19 June 1163, the younger Stephen routed his uncle, forcing him once again to flee Hungary. Shortly thereafter, Archbishop Mik√≥ reconciled with Stephen III and swore fealty to the returning monarch, who applied no sanctions against Mik√≥. In response, Emperor Manuel invaded Hungary with his army, which also advanced into the prelate's see, B√°cs during one of the military operations. According to historian Gyula Pauler, Stephen III sent Archbishop Mik√≥, alongside others, to the Byzantine court to negotiate the peace with Emperor Manuel in 1165. Mik√≥ is last mentioned as a living person in that year. It is plausible that he died before 1169, when his successor Chama was first referred to as Archbishop of Kalocsa.
