It was released on October 20, 2017, by . Plot High school seniors McKayla Hooper and Sadie Cunningham live in the Midwestern town of Rosedale and run a true crime blog called Tragedy Girls. They are willing to do anything to get more followers. They use their friend Craig as bait to capture serial killer Lowell Orson Lehmann and ask him to aid them, but he refuses. The two decide to keep him captive, commit murders themselves and use Lehmann as a fall guy. The next day, Craig is missing, presumed to have run away. McKayla, Sadie, and their friend Jordan attempt to convince Rosedale that there is a serial killer running loose, but they only earn the ire of Jordan's father, Sheriff Welch. When McKayla's ex-boyfriend Toby amasses more followers on Twitter than the girls, McKayla and Sadie kill him. His death is ruled an accident, enraging the two girls. They next kill cheerleading captain Syl and cut her body into pieces in order to ensure that her death is ruled a homicide. At Syl's memorial service, a local firefighter, Big Al, vows to catch the killer. Meanwhile, Lehmann attempts to turn McKayla against Sadie by convincing her that Sadie will use her to do the dirty work and take all of the credit. The girls plot to kill Big Al while he works out at the gym. Big Al fights back, but the two narrowly manage to stab him and decapitate him with a bench press. Afterwards, Jordan arrives and reveals he has stolen the serial killer case files from his father. Mayor Campbell calls an emergency town meeting, and McKayla and Sadie rile the townspeople into turning against local law enforcement by showing them to be incompetent. They hold a march in defiance of the killer. However, Lehmann escapes and murders Mayor Campbell. Jordan has a falling out with McKayla and Sadie and leaves them, in support of his father. An enraged McKayla discovers Jordan has stolen a phone belonging to her that has videos of the murders, and goads Sadie into heading to Jordan's house to kill him. Jordan reveals that he broke into the school and stole McKayla's psychological profile; he suspects her of being the killer. They are interrupted when Lehmann breaks into the Welch residence and brutally stabs Jordan. McKayla awakens the sleeping Sheriff Welch by breaking his window; he drives Lehmann off and saves Jordan. Sadie takes the opportunity to destroy McKayla's stolen phone. Two weeks later, Sadie is publicly honored by Welch; she does not acknowledge McKayla in her speech. The two have a falling out. Prom arrives; Sadie goes with Jordan as her date, while McKayla teams up with Lehmann. After killing their teacher, McKayla confronts Sadie. Unaware that Jordan is listening, she recounts how they murdered Jordan's mother as children. Jordan attempts to flee with Sadie to safety, but they are cornered by Lehmann and McKayla. Lehmann attempts to attack Sadie, but is stopped by McKayla. He turns on her, and McKayla pulls out a gun and shoots Lehmann dead. The girls reconcile, hang Jordan, and ‚Äì after chain-locking the doors shut ‚Äì start a fire in the gymnasium that traps and kills 124 prom-goers. In the aftermath, Lehmann is shown to have been blamed for the murders. A grieving Welch resigns as sheriff to focus on charity work, while McKayla and Sadie head off to college to start a new chapter in their lives, as though nothing had happened.

Flowering plants also have up to five large translucent white flowers with olive green and brown lines and markings and a narrow, insect-like labellum.leaf rosettelabellum detail Description Pterostylis leptochila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a rosette of between six and ten leaves. The leaves are long and wide. Flowering plants have a rosette at the base of the flowering stem but the leaves are usually withered by flowering time. Up to five or more translucent white, olive green and brown flowers, long and wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column with the dorsal sepal having a narrow tip long. The lateral sepals turn downwards, slightly wider than the galea and suddenly taper to narrow tips long which turn forward and spread apart from each other. The labellum is fleshy, greenish-brown and insect-like, long, about wide and covered with short hairs. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis leptochila was first formally described in 1989 by Mark Clements and David Jones from a specimen collected near Ravensthorpe and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (leptochila) is derived from the Ancient Greek words leptos meaning \\"fine\\" or \\"small\\" and cheilos meaning \\"lip\\" or \\"rim\\" referring to the narrow labellum of this orchid.

He was made Chevalier of the Order of Saint Anna for his services (along with those of Alfred Lewis Jones) to the duma during the Russian imperial visit to Cowes in 1909.  Professional life  Barker in about 1900, walking behind Alfred Lewis Jones and Guglielmo Marconi. Barker started his career in 1856 at the age of 161861 Census of England and Wales as a clerk with James Baines & Co., owners of the Black Ball Line of ships (at the time one of the largest shipping companies in Liverpool). Later he moved to work for Reynold, Mann & Co., ship-owners and East India merchants, for whom he travelled extensively to America, Australia, and elsewhere. After this he joined the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce as an assistant to William Blood, who was then Secretary of the Chamber. Blood retired in 1884, and Barker was appointed Secretary in his place, at the age of 43. The Chamber at this time was involved in negotiating around the trade in cotton, wheat, and iron with India, and Barker worked in this area in relation to the East Indian Railway Company, and lobbied for reductions in import tariffs to India. The Chamber's first 'Trade Section' or subcommittee (relating to the cotton trade) had been set up in 1882, and by the end of the 1890s had twenty-three such Sections ‚Äî with Barker instrumental in much of their organisation. West African trade was also of great importance to the Chamber around the time when Barker became Secretary, and he was involved along with Sir Alfred Jones in establishing the West African Trade Section. Barker also was instrumental in forming the Tobacco Trade Section. \\"Tobacco had been previously warehoused at various Liverpool docks, which was highly inconvenient. On the formation of the Tobacco Section, however, representations were made to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board which led to the creation of a warehouse at the Stanley Docks, capable of storing the entire stock of tobacco entering the port.\\" Towards the end of 1902 (following a visit to Liverpool by a British commercial agent from Moscow, H.A. Cooke) the Russian Trade Section was established, chaired by Hermann Decker and H. Clements. The following year, Cooke was sent to Siberia to make \\"inquiries on behalf of the Section\\", and a few months later Barker was sent (via Canada) to travel through Japan, Korea, China, and Russia, travelling on the Trans- Siberian Railway. In Beijing he met with de Lessar (the Russian Minister), after which he visited Shenyang and Harbin also in China. Then he travelled through Russia, visiting Irkutsk (and the Convict Settlement at Alexandrowski), then Tomsk and Omsk. The trip ended with a week in Moscow and St Petersburg, \\"where he was received by, amongst others, the British Minister (Sir Charles Scott), and Prince Khilkoff\\". He became Russian Trade Organiser for the Chamber, and this led to him later helping during the Russian imperial visit to Cowes in 1909 for which he was awarded membership of the Order of Saint Anna. Barker retired (after thirty-one years as Secretary) at the end of 1912, the year in which the Chamber had negotiated improvements to the Liverpool telephone network, alongside the General Post Office taking over UK telephone networks. (See also the photograph of Barker with Marconi at left.) During his time as Secretary he had been involved in many prominent people, such as Lord Halsbury, Lord Lansdowne, Winston Churchill, and the King of Siam.  Personal life  1906 portrait of Barker, by Frank Thomas Copnall (husband of Teresa Copnall). Barker was born on 18 May 1841 at 9 Earle Street in Liverpool, the second son of Charles Frederick Barker and Elizabeth Barker (n√©e Hezelwood), and he was baptised on 8 June 1841 at St Peter's Church, Liverpool.Batch no. PO2027-5, source film 93883, in Liverpool records office His siblings were Charles Frederick Barker (1838‚Äì1887), Elizabeth Barker (1838‚Äì1840) and Joseph Bolton Barker (1844‚Äì?). Thomas Henry was living at 79 Canning Street, Liverpool in 1861 at the age of 19, with his mother Elizabeth (already a widow) and working as a ships' clerk. In the household were his brothers Joseph Bolton Barker (aged 16) and Charles N. Barker (aged 24, working as a mariner), and their aunt Isabella Hazelwood (aged 52). On 25 April 1875 he married Mary Ellen Moulsdale in Walton, Liverpool. Barker enjoyed travelling, and as well as visiting many different parts of the world in the course of his professional duties he also travelled for pleasure. In 1908 after the Conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Montreal he went on a journey to Japan and China and returned to Liverpool via the Trans-Siberian Railway soon after it was opened. In April 1906 (fifty years after starting his career) the members of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce presented Barker with a large oil portrait of himself, which afterwards hung in the Chambers' offices and today is held by his descendants. Barker retired in 1912 and died five years later aged 75, in West Kirby.

Starting from 1837, he carried on a \\"flourishing school\\" with Chinese and Malays in Province Wellesley. When the London Missionary Society, which had been involved in educational outreach to the Chinese on Penang island since 1819, decided to withdraw from Penang in 1844 to focus their efforts on China, Bausum stepped in to take over the educational work of the LMS mission.  Marriage  Married : (1) Maria Tarn, widow of Samuel Dyer, in 1845; (2) JemimaPoppy in St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore, on 23 May 1848.Imported GEDCOM file [null [892 marriage took place at Singapore Cathedral. Bausum's first marriage was to an English missionary, a widow, Maria Tarn Dyer, who was considerably older than himself. Maria Tarn herself came from a missionary family, and her first husband was Samuel Dyer, an LMS missionary. Samuel Dyer worked in Penang from 1827 to 1845 and then at Malacca and Singapore, and produced a ‚ÄòVocabulary of the Hok-kien Dialect‚Äô. Maria had three children from her first marriage, all who were born in Penang and who later became missionaries in China. Their daughter, Maria Dyer eventually married an even more famous missionary, James Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission. After Dyer's death in Macao, Maria returned to Penang in 1843 to take over the LMS Chinese girl's school. Here, she met Bausum and the two married in 1845. In view of Mrs. Bausum's previous contributions as the wife of an LMS missionary, the London Missionary Society decided to allow the Bausums to make use of the property in exchange for its upkeep. Maria Bausum died in 1946, and her epithet states that ‚ÄòShe devoted her life to the extension of Christ‚Äôs Kingdom among the Chinese females in the Straits....‚Äô After Maria's death, Bausum married Jemima Poppy, a missionary who had come to Penang to work in women's education. The couple wed at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Singapore in 1848. The couple had four children, Mary Elizabeth, George Frederick, Samuel Gottlieb and Louisa Jane. Bausum continued his mission in Penang, where he died of heart failure in 1855. The eldest daughter, Mary Elizabeth Bausum (1849‚Äì1926), who was born in Penang, sailed to China with the China Inland Mission in 1866 and had a long missionary career in China.  Children  Had issue: Mary Elizabeth Bausum (b. 15 October 1849), GeorgeFrederick Bausum (b. 20 November 1850); Samuel Gottlieb Bausum (b. 3July 1853, d. 19 April 1854) and Louisa Jane Bausum (b. 3 March 1855,d. 9 March 1855), all by his 2nd wife.  Mission Work  Bausum was an independent missionary and an avowed ‚Äòdissenter‚Äô against the established church. As a way out of financial hardship, Bausum at different times considered working with the Episcopalians, the Presbyterians and the Anglicans, but could not come to any agreement with them or chose not to compromise his beliefs. He later received some support from the China Evangelization Society founded by the famous Charles G√ºtzlaff. Like G√ºtzlaff in China, Bausum in Penang carried on his Einmanmission without funding or interference from any church. In 1847, Bausum wrote to inform the LMS that he had purchased a parcel of land to expand the school at his own expense, which was intended as an addition to the girls‚Äô school, but the land was never transferred to the control of the LMS directors.  Death  He died 1 August 1855 at Penang, Straits Settlements (now Malaysia).

Gottlieb‚Äô ‚Äì the Harbour Master George Felix Gottlieb, a fellow German. His letter to the LMS in London, dated January 1860, records the arrival of the Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, whom many regard as the first Brethren missionaries in the Straits Settlements. During Bausum's time, the Chapel became a well-known gathering place for independent Protestants and non-denominational missionaries in the region. When the LMS wanted to sell off their mission properties, G. F. Gottlieb wrote to advise that a portion of the land on which the girl's school stood now belonged to Bausum's second wife, who had since remarried and was now known as Mrs. Lord. Moreover, a group of petitioners in Penang argued that the LMS had no right to sell the properties because they in part been paid for with donations collected to support the work in Penang. In 1870, the LMS directors sold off the chapel and other properties, but the Brethren managed to hang on to the site purchased by Bausum, and built a new Chapel there in 1876.

The labellum is light brown with a black strip along its mid-line. Description Pterostylis lineata, is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of between four and six leaves, each leaf long and wide on a stalk high. Flowering plants lack a rosette but have up to seven flowers on a flowering spike high with between four and seven stem leaves. The flowers are dark green with transparent sections and long and wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are joined to form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column. The lateral sepals turn downwards and are long, wide and joined for about half their length. The labellum is long, about wide and light brown with a blackish stripe along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming The Blue Mountains leafy greenhood was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones who gave it the name Bunochilus lineatus. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected near Woodford in the Blue Mountains. In 2010, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Pterostylis lineata. The specific epithet (lineata) is a Latin word meaning \\"marked with a linear line\\", referring to the markings on the labellum. Distribution and habitat Pterostylis lineata grows in moist soil in wet forest from the western side of the Blue Mountains to Lithgow and on the southern part of the Northern Tablelands.

He ruled from the city of Ayodhya, Kosala, in India. His name is found in ancient coins and the inscription. According to P. L. Gupta, he was among the fifteen kings who ruled from Ayodhya between 130 BCE and 158 CE, and whose coins have been found: Muladeva, Vayudeva, Vishakadeva, Dhanadeva, Ajavarman, Sanghamirta, Vijayamitra, Satyamitra, Devamitra and Aryamitra.P.L. Gupta (1969), Conference Papers on the Date of Kani·π£ka, Editor: Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Brill Archive, 1969, p.118 D.C. Sircar dates the inscription to 1st-century CE based on the epigraphical evidence.D.C. Sircar (1965), Select Inscriptions, Volume 1, 2nd Edition, pages 94-95 and footnote 1 on page 95 The paleography of the inscription is identical to that of the Northern Satraps in Mathura, which gives a 1st century CE date. The damaged inscription is notable for its mention of general Pushyamitra and his descendant Dhana‚Äì, his use of Vedic Ashvamedha horse to assert the range of his empire, and the building of a temple shrine. Sunga inscription from Ayodhya The Ayodhya inscription of the Sunga dynasty era was found by Babu Jagannath Das Ratnakara at the Ranopali monastery in Ayodhya. The inscription is in Sanskrit, written in Brahmi script, and the inscribed stone is found on a flat surface on a footstone at the eastern entrance to the samadhi (memorial) of Baba Sangat Bakhsh, of Udasi Sikhs. The Udasi trace their heritage to the eldest son of Guru Nanak. The samadhi monument is inside the Ranopali monastery of Udasi Sampradaya, also called Shri Udasin Rishi Ashram, in a section located to the west. It is believed to have been built during the time of Nawab Shuja-ud- daula, and the inscribed stone likely came from some ruins of the period. According to Kunal Kishore, the inscription is not grammatically correct Sanskrit.Kunal Kishore, Ayodhya Revisited, p.24, Prabhat Prakashan Others scholars disagree and state that except for one minor scribe error, the inscription is in good Sanskrit.RBDR Sahni, A Sunga Inscription from Ayodhya, Epigraphia Indica Volume 20, ASI, pages 54-58 =Inscription= The discovered inscription is damaged and incomplete. It reads: > 1\\\\. Kosal-adhipena dvir-asvamedha-yajinah senapateh Pushyamitrasya > shashthena Kausiki-putrena Dhana 2\\\\. Dharmarajna pituh Phalgudevasya ketanam > karitam ‚Äì Shunga dynasty Ayodhya Inscription, 1st-century BCE ‚Äì 1st century > CE =Translation= Sahni ‚Äì a Sanskrit scholar, translates it as, =Significance= The Sunga inscription is short but one that has attracted much debate. Scholars disagree on how to interpret Pushyamitrasya shashthena. It literally means the \\"sixth of Pushyamitra\\", which can be interpreted as \\"sixth son of Pushyamitra\\" or \\"sixth descendant of [generation after] Pushyamitra\\". The former interpretation would mean Dhana likely lived in early 1st-century BCE, the later would imply Dhana to be a great grandchild of a great grandchild through the father or mother side, and he lived in 1st- century CE. According to Bhandare, there is uncertainty if there were more than one ancient kings named Dhanadeva. The inscription suggests there was one in the 1st century BCE, while the dating of the coins with Dhanadeva name range from 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE. Typically, both are considered to be the same. The coins with Dhanadeva were mold cast, were made from silver or copper, and show a bull with fodder tray in front. His name is in Brahmi script, and the coins also show swastika and Ujjayini signs. The ancient Ayodhya inscription is significant also because it establishes that the Hindu Sungas dynasty was ruling Ayodhya around the 1st century BCE, that the custom of building temple shrines to popular leaders or famous kings was already in vogue by then, and that Phalgudeva may have been the same person as Pushyamitra. It is also the earliest epigraphical evidence that the general Pushyamitra Shunga founded a dynasty and performed the Vedic ritual Ashvamedha twice (it is unclear why he did it twice).

Iranian Consulate  History  According to architect Varazdat Harutyunyan, this part of the street belonged to Persia's Hadji Abbas Calibara Abdou Hussein Oglu in the 1950s. The architect, Mikhail von der Nonne, is German and graduated from Yerevan State University. The Consulate operated until 1920. Now the building has been rented out for about 25 years by Yerevan‚Äôs City Council for 600 Ruble's a month. The Armenian division headquarters were here from 1922-1937. Later, the Armenian Relief Committee, which was headed by poet Hovhannes Tumanyan, worked in the building for three years. During the Soviet Union in 1924, the school worked in the evening for Communists. Then, for 18 years, the Armenian military prosecutor's office was there. From 1964 to present, the Armenian Historical Monuments Conservation Company works there. Its founders are painter/academician Martiros Saryan, architect Varazdat Harutyunyan and archeologist/historian Babken Arakelyan. The first president of the company was Martiros Saryan.  The Building  The Building is one story high and is made up of black Tuff Rocks. On the top, in the center, there is a large circular design and the upper arches of the window are covered with ornaments. The walls of the Iranian Consul's office were completely covered with frescoes. There is a mirrored prayer hall in the center of the room. There is a door to the left from the entrance, that has stairs that take you to the basement (this segment collapsed). Al. Tamanyan's son, Yuri Tamanyan, has been stationed in the building on his father's initiative. The story of the building's torch is interesting. The torch in the Consul's room was designed individually by Al. Tamanyan and ordered in Italy in 1927. Renovation work was done and resulted in parquet, chandelier, and heating system. It is also planned to upgrade outside the building and to repair other rooms.  Frescoes  Frescoes date back to the construction period. The style is Oriental, Persian and rich in Armenian motives, which were made by Armenian masters. A striking example of this is the crosscuts left in the frescoes. The frescoes of the entrance to the arch, also feature gnats, dogs, veins, that are widely used in Armenian miniature paintings. Images and motifs on the upper part of the flower, skulls and birds are Persian. During the renovation of the Consul's room, the frescoes were restored by a professional group of painters, who updated colors and completely renovated fragments.

Location of Imperatorsky pavilyon station (at south) The first station  In 1895, at the beginning of the reign of Tsar Nicholas II, a pavilion was built to accommodate the Imperial family when traveling by train from St. Petersburg to the Alexandrovskaya station, which served Tsarskoye Selo. Approved on 30 June 1895, a wooden Imperial Pavilion with a covered platform was built. The pavilion was asymmetrical in plan and had only 4 rooms. The total area of the building was 24.38 square meters. A year later, on 9 August 1896, a project for an extension to the Imperial Pavilion was approved. The total area of the pavilion increased to 41.7 square meters. The so-called Imperial branch of the Moscow-Vindava-Rybinsk railway, starting at the Imperial Pavilion adjacent to the Vitebsky railway station opened in 1902. It started at Vitebsk station, where a special pavilion for the Emperor and his relatives was built in 1902. It ran parallel to the main line of the Tsarskoye Selo Railway and then branched south west at the village of Kouzmino. In 1903, the line was extended to the Imperial pavilion. It was reserved for members of the imperial family and representatives of foreign powers. The second station  The pavilion burned down in January 1911 and a new construction project was prepared by , one of the favorite architects of Tsar Nicholas II, who had just completed the construction of the Feodorovsky cathedral, which served as a family parish church for the Emperor and his family. The railway station was completed in 1912. A long alley of lime trees still leads to the Feodorovsky Imperial Cathedral and then a paved road leads to the Alexander Palace, located one kilometer from the station. After the revolution the station was renamed \\" Uritsky Pavilion\\" in 1918 and closed a few years after the Second World War. The pavilion itself suffered from damage during the German occupation. =Architecture= The style of the pavilion is Russian Revival architecture, as with the Feodorovsky Village and its buildings (the cathedral, the personal guardhouse of the Emperor, the Palace of Arms, etc.) which are all nearby. The platforms were two hundred meters long and were covered for a hundred metres. The entrance had a porch with a pointed roof supported by four pillars and surmounted by a double-headed eagle decorated with kokoshniks. The interior of the pavilion is adorned with frescoes imitating 16th-century Moscovite frescoes, carried out by the artists of the Moscow workshop of the \\"Heirs of P. P. Pashkov\\" under the supervision of its co-owner Nikolai Pavlovich Pashkov. =Current Condition= During the 1990s the building was used as an unofficial disco until it suffered a fire. On 18 March 2008, the Property Fund held tenders for the sale of rights to conclude lease agreements for the pavilion building, which was to be named \\"Tsarskoye Selo Station\\" (Pushkin, Academic Ave, 35b, lit. A). The auction winner was OOO Sansara, which concluded the contract for a period of 49 years. The possible use of the building was as a shopping mall or restaurant. In 2010 on the 300th anniversary of Tsarskoe Selo, it was planned to restore the pavilion. But this did not happen. The pavilion is currently almost in ruins. The sharp-pointed roof of the entrance door of honor has collapsed and been replaced with plastic coated roofing sheet. The stone carvings on the facade have survived, as well as the murals of the vaults of the front porch and some interiors have also survived.

Obv: Muladevasa, elephant to left facing symbol. Rev: Wreath, above symbol, below snake. The Deva dynasty of Saketa, was a dynasty of kings who ruled in the area of the city of Ayodhya, Kosala, in India from the 2nd century BCE until the end of 1st century BCE.  Political history  Five Deva kings are attested by their coins: Mula-deva, Vayu-deva, Vishakha-deva, Patha-deva, and Dhana-deva. Another king - Phalgudeva - is attested by the 1st century BCE Ayodhya inscription of his son Dhanadeva. After the decline of the Maurya empire, Saketa (modern Ayodhya) appears to have come under the rule of the Shunga ruler Pushyamitra. One interpretation of Dhanadeva's inscription suggests that Pushyamitra appointed at a Deva king as a governor at Saketa. This would mean that the Devas ruled as Shunga vassals. However, another interpretation suggests that the Devas ruled as sovereigns and considered themselves as legitimate heirs of the Shungas. The Yuga Purana mentions Saketa as the residence of a governor, and describes it as being attacked by a combined force of Greeks, Mathuras, and Panchalas. Patanjali's commentary on Panini also refers to the Greek siege of Saketa. The Yuga Purana states that Saketa was ruled by seven powerful kings after the retreat of the Greeks. The Vayu Purana and the Brahmanda Purana also state that seven powerful kings ruled in the capital of Kosala. These kings appear to be same as the Deva kings: Dhanadeva's is described as the king of Kosala (Kosaladhipati) in his inscription. Although the texts mention seven powerful kings of Kosala, only six Deva kings are known from coins and an inscription. Indologist Hans T. Bakker speculates that Mitra-deva, who is mentioned in the 7th century text Harshacharita, may have been the seventh Deva king. Mitra-deva is said to have killed Sumitra (that is, the Shunga king Vasumitra). If Bakker's identification is correct, it appears that the Deva kings rebelled against their Shunga overlords. However, several kings, whose names ended in -deva, ruled various parts of India, so this identification is not certain. Moreover, some manuscripts of Harshacharita mention the king's name as Muladeva. The Deva dynasty was replaced by the Datta dynasty at the end of the 1st century BCE, which itself was replaced by the Mitra dynasty in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, which also ruled in Mathura. It is thought that the Indo- Scythian Northern Satraps ultimately replaced these local kings, until the advent of the Kushan Empire.  Rulers  Based on the identification of Mitradeva as a Deva king, Hans T. Bakker provides the following list of Deva kings: # Muladeva (possibly a vassal of Pushyamitra at Saketa) # Mitradeva (contemporary of Vasumitra) # Vayu-deva # Patha-deva # Phalgudeva # Dhanadeva # Vishakhadeva References= Bibliography = * * * Category:Shunga Empire Category:Ayodhya Category:History of Uttar Pradesh Category:Dynasties of India ","title":"Deva dynasty (Saketa)"},{"id":"54435425","text":"Josephine de la Vi√±a (April 15, 1946 ‚Äì November 4, 2011) was a discus thrower from the Philippines who is considered as her country's greatest athlete in the event.

Howarth succeeded Anneliese Dodds who had represented the seat since the 2014 European Parliament election until she was elected as MP for Oxford East in the 2017 General Election, and he was re-elected at the 2019 European Parliament election. He was educated in Gateshead at Highfield Comprehensive School and at the University of Essex where he read Economics. He started his career as a Labour Party official, then working and running businesses in Information Technology, Design, Business Communications and Public Affairs. He spent 11 years as a Councillor serving on Berkshire County Council, Reading Borough Council and the South East England Regional Assembly.  Early life and education  His father, also John Howarth, worked in the coal industry first as a footplateman and later as a traffic foreman on the Bowes railway. His mother Freda Howarth (Robinson) was the daughter of Joe Robinson, a pit deputy at Heworth Colliery. Joe had served in the Northumberland Fusileers Regiment in the First World War and was wounded at Passchendaele (Third Battle of Ypres). During the Second World Ward Freda was an industrial conscript working as a welder in munitions production. John Howarth cites his Grandfather as particularly influential on his early political thinking. Howarth grew up on the Ellen Wilkinson Estate, a 1950s council housing development now part of Gateshead Borough. He attended Wardley Infant and Junior Schools and Highfield Comprehensive, a purpose-built comprehensive school that opened in 1970 upon the abolition of selection at 11 plus. The school would later be renamed Thomas Hepburn Community School and closed in 2019. He studied Economics at the University of Essex and after graduating gained a master's degree in the History and Theory of 20th Century Art. His MA thesis was on work of the German Director, Werner Herzog.  Political life  John Howarth became involved with the Labour Party during the February 1974 General Election when his father was on strike. He continued to be involved with Labour election campaigns in October 1974 and the Newcastle Central By-election of 1976 before university. In student politics he became National Secretary of Labour Students. On leaving the student world in 1982 Howarth became a Labour Party constituency organiser in Basingstoke and Secretary of the Hampshire County Labour Party. Having progressed to Labour's Southern Regional Office (covering what is now the South East Region) Howarth left Labour's staff in 1988 to work in the private sector and settled in Reading. In 1990 Howarth was elected Chair of Reading Labour Party which encompassed both of the town's parliamentary constituencies and the Reading local government functions. He served as Chair until 1994 after which he became Press Officer, a role which he continued for the ten years. He also served as Vice-Chair of Berkshire County Labour Party, Thames Valley European Constituency, the South East Regional Board/Executive and the National Policy Forum.  Working life  In 1989 Howarth joined a company providing software and IT solutions, working on marketing communications and eventually becoming Director of Marketing and a partner. In 1995 he founded his own business providing marketing consulting services and later brand, design and business communications. He became a member of the Chartered Society of Designers and also worked in public affairs as a consultant for the international business communications firm, Instinctif Partners.  Local government  In 1993 he contested Redlands Division on Berkshire County Council, winning the seat comfortably. On the county council he served as chair of the Transport Committee and later as vice-chair of the Environment Committee as part of the Labour-Liberal Democrat administration. Howarth was a strong advocate of the abolition of Berkshire County Council and its replacement with Unitary local government. He served five years on the county council until it was dissolved in April 1998. In 2001 he was elected to Reading Borough Council, by now a unitary council, for Park Ward and was re-elected in 2004. Serving for a year as deputy lead on sport and cultural services, he became the cabinet member responsible for transport and strategic planning and was appointed to the South East England Regional Assembly. He became a member of the UK Government's Regional Transport Board for the South East, the Joint Regional European Committee, the Regional Planning Committee, and the Berkshire Join Strategic Planning Committee. Howarth was also Chair of the Reading Station Project Board, which brought together stakeholders in the successful bid to attract funding for the expansion of the Great Western mainline facilities at Reading railway station. In 2007 he stood down from the Borough Council.  European elections  In 1994 John Howarth was Labour candidate for the Thames Valley coming close to unseating the Conservative MEP in what was not regarded as a Labour target. He contested South East England as a member of the Labour list at the first election using proportional representation in 1999. In 2013 he put himself forward for the South East Region once again. The ordering of the list ‚Äì with one male and one female candidate ‚Äì was determined by a ballot of Labour Party members. John Howarth won the male ballot and was placed second on the list, the decision having been made prior to the selection that the winner of the female ballot would be top of the list. In the 2014 European Elections Labour fell short of the necessary share of the vote to secure two MEPs in the region. Anneliese Dodds, who had been placed first on the Labour list, represented the seat until 9 June 2017 when she was elected as MP for Oxford East in the 2017 General Election. In the 2019 European Elections, Howarth as sitting MEP led Labour's list in South East England and was elected to the South East region as the only Labour MEP.

Regarding its style, Stan confessed, \\"I want to release what I like and not to follow the trend and speed up the creation process just because something needs to be released. [The song] is a mixture of [different] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel\\". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an \\"old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance.\\" According to her, the lyrical message is \\"[her way] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell me that you love me'\\". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, \\"As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune.\\" Critical reception Music critics were positive towards \\"Boy Oh Boy\\". Teodora Dinu from Antena 1 found the song had a positive vibe and was full of energy. Another editor from the same website applauded the summery style and danceable rhythm of the track.

Career=College= Crowe was drafted out of Pigeon Forge High School in the 31st round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft by the Cleveland Indians. He declined to sign, instead attending the University of South Carolina, where he pitched for the South Carolina Gamecocks. While at South Carolina, in April 2015, Crowe tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his right throwing elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews. He spent the next two years rehabbing with fellow Gamecocks pitcher Cody Morris, who described Crowe as \\"a mentor\\" to him during the process even though Crowe had his elbow procedure just a month sooner. Crowe made his return to pitching on June 1, 2016, starting the home opener for the Lexington County Blowfish and showing off a sharp slider and a fastball that reached 95 mph. The Indians again selected him in the 2016 MLB draft, using their 21st- round pick on him, but Crowe again did not sign, returning to South Carolina as a redshirt junior. Crowe led the Gamecocks in strikeouts while posting a 3.41 ERA across 92‚Öì innings in 2017 before being drafted with the 65th overall pick by the Nationals in the 2017 MLB Draft, who were known for selecting amateur players who had previously had or needed to undergo Tommy John surgery. Crowe received a $946,500 signing bonus from the Nationals, in line with the slot value of the selection. =Professional= After Crowe's signing, MLB Prospect Watch ranked him as the Nationals' sixth-best prospect, with Baseball America listing him eighth. Crowe made his professional debut with the GCL Nationals, and after giving up two earned runs in 3.2 innings, was promoted to the Auburn Doubledays, where he finished the season, posting a 2.61 ERA with a 1.02 WHIP in seven games started. Crowe opened his season with the High-A Potomac Nationals in 2018 by winning eleven straight decisions, earning a berth in the Carolina League All-Star Game. He was promoted to the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators midway through the season, losing all five of his decisions at the higher level. After the season, Crowe was named a co-Minor League Pitcher of the Year (with Ben Braymer) by the Nationals. In 2019, Crowe was invited to participate in his first major league spring training as a non- roster invitee, giving him the opportunity to work with veteran Nationals pitchers Patrick Corbin, Max Scherzer, and Stephen Strasburg, something he described to The Washington Post as \\"like getting a PhD in pitching\\". He was ranked before the season as the fifth-best prospect in the Nationals organization by MLB Pipeline, and the team's second-best pitching prospect behind Mason Denaburg. Crowe made his Major League Baseball debut on August 22, 2020, starting the second game of a doubleheader against the Miami Marlins for the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. Pitching style Crowe throws both four-seam and two-seam fastballs, reaching as of 2018. He complements his fastballs with a changeup, curveball, and slider.

She also served as the assistant minister for Gender, Culture and Social Services. She lost the 1992 elections for Msambweni Constituency to Kassim Mwamzandi. She also lost the 2002 elections to Abdalla Ngozi. Mwachai worked as a school teacher before venturing into politics. Controversy In November 1999, Mwachai was ordered by court to pay Jones Munyaga Ksh. 58,000 for attacking him while he was on duty. Munyaga claimed he blocked Mwachai from entering into St. Augustine's Preparatory School on a Sunday evening. Mwachai's daughter was a student at the school and Munyaga worked as a night guard. The school's rules did not allow visitation on Sundays. When he blocked her, Mwachai told her security detail to cuff him up and forced her way into the school. In June 2017, Mwachai was accused by her adopted son, Shaahidin Rajab, for abandoning him. Mwachai adopted Rajab from Mama Fatuma Goodwill Children's Home in Eastleigh, Nairobi. He, however, says that he was overworked in the Mwachai household and was always the first suspect whenever household items went amiss. Mwachai, however, accused him of having been a trouble child who has had several run ins with the law. Mwachai said that despite having schooled him at Msambweni Primary School from class one to eight, Rajab was constantly arguing with her first born daughter and stealing things from the house. Legacy Mwachai was the first woman in the Coast region to be elected to parliament. In 2002 after then president Daniel arap Moi announced that Uhuru Kenyatta would be the KANU presidential candidate, many prominent KANU members ditched the party. Mwachai was one of the few who stayed put and backed Uhuru for the presidency. As of July 2017, she is running for MP Msambweni Constituency on a New Vision Party ticket.

This was reorganized in June 1790 by a series of decrees of the National Assembly, which nevertheless kept him in office as the result of a letter from Jacques Necker, dated 10 August 1790, informing the Comte d'Ogny that \\"His Majesty by virtue of the decree of the National Assembly had committed him to exercise the functions of the former Intendant of the Posts.\\" He was associated with Lafayette and the events of 5 and 6 October 1789, in which, according to Antoine-Charles Tardieu, marquis de Maleissye, \\"it is M. d'Ogny, the son of the Superintendent of Posts, to whom the unfortunate Louis owed to not always had at his door the two heads of his unfortunate bodyguards \\" During the brief period while directing the post office alone, Rigoley secretly assured the security and regularity of correspondence between the King and the royal family, within the province and abroad, while they were detained at the Tuileries Palace under surveillance of the National Guard. These facts were discovered at the time of the trial of Louis XVI and recorded as incriminating evidence in the Valaz√© Report. In a letter to Mirabeau, Marie Antoinette wrote, during the summer of 1790, \\"M. d'Ogny is a reliable and faithful man\\".  Musical career  Title page of the Catalogue de la Musique vocale de M. le comte d'Ogny (Library of Congress) With his friend √âtienne- Marie de La Haye, survivor of his father, the ferme g√©n√©rale Marin de La Haye des Fosses, he founded the Olympic Lodge in 1782, the main object of which was the organization of concerts intended to replace the Concert des Amateurs dissolved in 1781 following the bankruptcy of one of its supporters, the tax ferme g√©n√©rale Pierre Haudry de Soucy. The concert des Amateurs used to take place in the salons of the H√¥tel de Soubise and was founded by their respective fathers, the Baron d'Ogny and Marin de La Haye des Fosses in 1769. The concerts of the Olympic Lodge were managed by the Olympic Society, the commercial entity of the Lodge, which installed a club for its subscribers in 1785 at the Palais Royal, known as the Sallon Olympique. On the first floor were the rooms of the lodge itself. The Olympic Society inherited the considerable musical background of the Concert des Amateurs which it continued to enrich thanks to the numerous and high contributions of its members. The most famous acquisition was that of the six Paris symphonies (82 to 87) and symphonies 90-92 commissioned to Joseph Haydn through Comte d'Ogny and the Chevalier de Saint-Georges. The concerts took place in the Social Contract Room (attached to the Saint John of Scotland Lodge and the Social Contract), in the H√¥tel de Bullion, rue Coq-H√©ron, until 1786. Then they took their seats in the Hall of the Hundred Swiss of the Tuileries Palace, liberated by the Concert Spirituel which had emigrated to the Salle des Machines in 1784, itself abandoned by the French Comedians who settled in 1782 in the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais (which became in 1797 the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on). After 5 and 6 October 1789, when the Court was installed at the Tuileries Palace, the \\"Salle des Cents-Suisses\\" returned to its original destination as \\"Salle des Gardes\\" and the Olympic Society ended its concerts. It was probably at this period, that the Comte d'Ogny donated his musical background to the Olympic Society. This considerable library represented the last twenty years of the musical life of the Ancien regime when it was most innovative. The works were premiered at the Concert des Amateurs, followed by those of the Olympic Society, when they followed, before being included among others by the Concert Spirituel. On the death of the Comte d'Ogny, the collection was subject of a public sale which lasted at least four days, from 7 to 10 February 1791. One can only identify as coming from this remarkable collection that of the nine autograph partitions of the \\"Symphonies Of the Olympic Lodge\\"Thus denominated in the Catalogue de la musique de Mr Pr√©sident de Meslay, musique grav√©e. L‚ÄôApostrophe-M√©diath√®que de Chartres by Haydn, kept at the Biblioth√®que Nationale for n¬∞ 82(1786), 83(1785), 86(1786), 87(1785) and 92(1789) and the Morgan Library for the 91(1788). The autograph manuscript of the Hob I 90 symphony is preserved in the Library of Congress of the United States. There are also two partial manuscript inventories, begun at the request of the Comte d'Ogny, presumably by his assistant the violinist Stanislas-Laurent Br√©val, one entitled Catalogue de la Musique de Monsieur le comte d‚ÄôOgny, British Library, Hirsch IV.1085, 52p;, Suppl√©ment [66], 67 p. the other Catalogue de la Musique vocale de Monsieur le comte d‚ÄôOgny, Library of Congress, 220 p.

It is a special plane section of the quadric, as this circle is the intersection with the quadric of the plane containing the circle. Any plane section of a sphere is a circular section, if it contains at least 2 points. Any quadric of revolution contains circles as sections with planes that are orthogonal to its axis; it does not contain any other circles, if it is not a sphere. More hidden are circles on other quadrics, such as tri-axial ellipsoids, elliptic cylinders, etc. Nevertheless, it is true that: *Any quadric surface which contains ellipses contains circles, too. Equivalently, all quadric surfaces contain circles except parabolic and hyperbolic cylinders and hyperbolic paraboloids. If a quadric contains a circle, then every intersection of the quadric with a plane parallel to this circle is also a circle, provided it contains at least two points. Except for spheres, the circles contained in a quadric, if any, are all parallel to one of two fixed planes (which are equal in the case of a quadric of revolution). Circular sections are used in crystallography.W. H. Westphal: Physikalisches W√∂rterbuch: Zwei Teile in Einem Band. Springer-Verlag, 1952, , p. 350.H. Tertsch: Die Festigkeitserscheinungen der Kristalle. Springer-Verlag, Wien, 1949, , p. 87.G. Masing: Lehrbuch der Allgemeinen Metallkunde. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1950, , p. 355. Using projective geometry The circular sections of a quadric may be computed from the implicit equation of the quadric, as it is done in the following sections. They may also be characterised and studied by using synthetic projective geometry. Let be the intersection of a quadric surface and a plane . In this section, and are surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, which are extended to the projective space over the complex numbers. Under these hypotheses, the curve is a circle if and only if its intersection with the plane at infinity is included in the ombilic (the curve at infinity of equation x^2+y^2+z^2=0). The first case to be considered is when the intersection of with the plane at infinity consists of one or two real lines, that is when is either a hyperbolic paraboloid, a parabolic cylinder or a hyperbolic cylinder. In this case the points at infinity of are real (intersection of a real plane with real lines). Thus the plane sections of cannot be circles (neither ellipses). If is a sphere, its intersection with the plane at infinity is the ombilic, and all plane sections are circles. If is a surface of revolution, its intersection with the ombilic consists of a pair of complex conjugate points (which are double points). A real plane contains these two points if and only if it is perpendicular to the axis of revolution. Thus the circular sections are the plane sections by a plane perpendicular to the axis, that have at least two real points. In the other cases, the intersection of with the ombilic consists of two different pairs of complex conjugate points. As is a curve of degree two, its intersection with the plane at infinity consists of two points, possibly equal. The curve is thus a circle, if these two points are one of these two pairs of complex conjugate points on the ombilic. Each of these pairs defines a real line (passing through the points), which is the intersection of with the plane at infinity. Thus, one has a circular section if and only has at least two real points and contains one of these lines at infinity (that is if is parallel to one of two directions defined by these lines at infinity).  Determination of circular sections of a quadric  In order to find the planes, which contain circular sections of a given quadric, one uses the following statements: :(S:) If the common points of a quadric with a sphere are contained in a pair of planes, then the intersection curve consists of two circles. :(P:) If the intersection of a plane and a quadric is a circle, than any parallel plane, that contains at least two points of the quadric, intersects the quadic in a circle, too. Hence the strategy for the detection of circular sections is: :1) Find a sphere, which intersects the quadric in a pair of planes and :2) The planes, which are parallel to the detected ones, deliver the remaining circular sections.  Tri-axial ellipsoid  tri-axial ellipsoid with circular sections (blue and green) and the auxiliary sphere (red), which intersects the quadric in the blue circles Ellipsoid intersected by spheres: c<{\\\\color{seagreen}r_1}<{\\\\color{blue}b}<{\\\\color{purple}r_2} For the ellipsoid with equation :\\\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\\\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\\\\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1 and the semi- axes a>b>c>0 one uses an auxiliary sphere with equation :x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2\\\\ . The sphere's radius has to be chosen such that the intersection with the ellipsoid is contained in two planes through the origin. Multiplication of the ellipsoid's equation by r^2 and subtracting the sphere's equation yields: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{r^2}{a^2}-1\\\\right)\\\\;x^2+\\\\left(\\\\frac{r^2}{b^2}-1\\\\right)\\\\;y^2+\\\\left(\\\\frac{r^2}{c^2}-1\\\\right)\\\\;z^2=0\\\\ . This equation describes a pair of planes, if one of the 3 coefficients is zero. In case of \\\\ r=a\\\\ or \\\\ r=c\\\\ the equation is only fulfilled by either the x-axis or the z-axis. Only in case of \\\\ r=b\\\\ one gets a pair of planes with equation *\\\\left(\\\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-1\\\\right)\\\\;x^2+\\\\left(\\\\frac{b^2}{c^2}-1\\\\right)\\\\;z^2=0\\\\ \\\\quad \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\quad z=\\\\pm \\\\tfrac{c}{a}\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{a^2-b^2}{b^2-c^2}}\\\\; x \\\\ , because only in this case the remaining coefficients have different signs (due to: a>b>c). The diagram gives an impression of more common intersections between a sphere and an ellipsoid and highlights the exceptional circular case (blue). If the values of the semi-axes are approaching, the two pencils of planes (and circles) approach either. For a=b all the planes are orthogonal to the z-axis (rotation axis). Proof of property (P): Turning the ellipsoid around the y-axis such that one of the two circles (blue) lies in the x-y-plane results in a new equation of the ellipsoid: :Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+D{\\\\color{red}xz}=E For z=0 one gets Ax^2+By^2=E, which has to be the equation of a circle. This is only true, if A=B e 0,\\\\ E>0. The intersection of the ellipsoid by a plane with equation z=z_0, (parallel to the x-y-plane) has the equation :A(x^2+y^2)+Dz_0 x=E-Cz_0^2. This equation describes a circle or a point or the empty set. Center and radius of the circle can be found be completing the square.

Primarily operated as a lecture theatre for the University of Edinburgh, it is also used for general theatre performances, as well as being a designated Edinburgh Fringe Festival venue. In 2018 the University changed the name of the theatre - previously known as George Square Theatre - in memory of Gordon Aikman, a graduate of the University's Business School who raised more than ¬£500,000 for research funding into motor neurone disease. Construction of the Modernist style theatre was completed in 1970, and opened to the general public the same year. Its seating capacity of 481 makes it the University's largest lecture facility, and an asset to the busy Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Since 2011, and while a venue for the Fringe, the theatre was under the branding of Assembly Group, an events promotion company responsible for the operation of Edinburgh's main Fringe venues, which had moved from their original base at George Street in the city. Subsequently, during the Festival the theatre was branded Assembly George Square Theatre. The theatre's location has allowed its use and popularity to increase, being situated near the Quartermile district development in the grounds of the old Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, along with the building and development of new University of Edinburgh facilities. The theatre can also be seen and accessed from The Meadows, a large park popular with tourists and students. Due to the building's striking stand-alone appearance, it has been a popular location for filming and productions, with the facade often changed to suit different purposes.

Many of these media are supported and headed by various health and wellness gurus who typically base the information they provide on personal experience. Advocates include Ella Mills, Natasha Corrett, and the Hemsley sisters.  Criticism  thumb The idea of clean eating has been criticized as lacking scientific evidence for its claims, and in extreme cases posing health risks by cutting entire food groups out of the diet. It has also been claimed that processed foods have been modified to prevent diseases and therefore have some health benefits (in the form of food safety) over a clean eating diet. It has also been claimed that a clean eating diet may increase the risk of osteoporosis due to a lack of calcium from dairy products.

Description Amblypharyngodon chulabhornae has 10 soft rays in the dorsal fin with 8 in the anal fin, it has 31-32 vertebrae. It is distinguished from other species in the genus Amblypharyngodon in having a smaller number scales on the lateral row, 42-50 in A. chulabhornae compared to 50-79 in other species in the genus, likewise this species has 6-7 perforated scales along its lateral line and 4-5 scales on a transverse row situated along the normal course of the lateral line in other fish and the pelvic fin base. The body is golden in colour, with a blue eye and lacks a barbel. Its maximum standard length is 30-40mm but mature females grow a little larger than the males and have a more rounded belly. Habitat and distribution Amblypharyngodon chulabhornae can be found in shallow standing water such as within paddy fields and in ditches, preferring vegetated areas with growths of floating and emergent vegetation as well seasonally flooded terrestrial grasses. It is found in the Chao Phraya and Mekong basin in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, as well the Mae Klong basins and river systems in southeast Thailand extending into the upper Thai-Malay peninsula. It may have been introduced to Singapore and appears to be established there. Habits Amblypharyngodon chulabhornae probably feeds small invertebrates, zooplankton and algae. They are sociable fish and prefer to live in small schools. they breed by spawning, most likely scattering the eggs on the substrate and showing no care thereafter. Conservation It is still common and is treated as being of \\"Least Concern\\" by the IUCN but population in some areas appear to be in declining such as on Chae Phraya in Thauland while in waters around Phnom Penh the species remains common. It does not appear in the local fishmarkets but may be consumed by subsistence fishermen, and the main threat appears to be pollution. It is rare in the aquarium trade and if it is offered for sale in that trade this is probably as a result of bycatch by fishermen hunting other species. Etymology The generic name derives from the Ancient Greek ambl√∫s meaning \\"blunted\\", ph√°ruks meaning throat and od·πìn meaning \\"toothed\\" in referenced to the shape of the pharyngeal teeth, the specific name is in honour of H.R.H. Princess Chulabhorn Mahidol of Thailand in recognition of her interest in and patronage of the sciences and technology.

Inspired by Ivory's \\"99 and 44/100 percent pure\\" campaign for bath soap, and by low-calorie or \\"light\\" beverages, sodas were redesigned in the 1980s and 1990s as being free of artificial dyes, such as the caffeine- free and preservative-free Crystal Pepsi. Personal hygiene products were then relaunched as clear dye-free gels, and many electronics have transparent cases. History Play It Loud! Nintendo Game Boy, an example of clear craze design Since the introduction of Plexiglas in the late 1930s, devices have been made with clear shells to expose the electromechanical components inside. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a 139 Pontiac Deluxe Six engine with a clear Plexiglas body was on display. Peaking in the 1960s and 1970s, transparent-shelled devices fell out of fashion until the clear craze in the late 1980s. Following the breakup of the Bell System in the mid 1980s, a surge of manufacturers began creating phones, many of them transparent and having flashing neon lights when the phone rang. A trend of \\"light\\" beer with fewer calories started in the 1960s. Then, color was identified in the marketing industry as a \\"tool for visual persuasion\\" toward a product's purity and health consciousness. Ivory soap was adapted from its classic milky solution and its slogan of \\"99 and 44/100 percent pure\\". This led up the clear craze starting in the 1980s. To showcase the reduction of calories or artificial flavors, many companies released clear versions of their products. The clear cola market was entered by Crystal Pepsi on April 13, 1992\\"Business Digest\\". The New York Times, April 13, 1992 featuring no preservatives or caffeine, although the existing Pepsi also did not have preservatives, and a caffeine- free version was already available.Zyman, Sergio.

In August 1992, Coors announced Zima, a clear, carbonated malt beer and in 1993, Miller released Miller Clear, a clear variant of their beer to mixed reviews. Gillette released versions of its existing deodorants and shaving creams in a clear gel form which is still in use today. Through the 1990s, the clear trend continued with transparent watches, staplers, calculators, handheld gaming devices such as the Nintendo Game Boy, and computers such as Apple's iMac.

History  The former station building at Seaham Hall Dene which is now a private residence, seen in July 2017. In 1854 the Londonderry Railway opened the Londonderry, Seaham and Sunderland Railway to link its network of colliery railways to the newly constructed South Dock in Sunderland due to the lack of capacity in Seaham Harbour. Though constructed primarily for mineral traffic, passengers were also carried between and Hendon Burn in Sunderland from 1855 until the LS&SR; began to use the Hendon terminus of the North Eastern Railway in 1868. An additional station was opened in 1875 to serve the home of the Londonderry family who had provided much of the funding for the line. The station was situated north of Seaham station (originally Seaham Colliery station) and south of Ryhope East station. In 1879 the North Eastern Railway closed Hendon station to be replaced by Sunderland Central station and so all LS&SR; services were diverted into the new station. The LS&SR; did, however, remain independent until the Londonderry Railway agreed to sell its Seaham to Sunderland route to the North Eastern Railway in the Act of 30 July 1900 though this sale did not include Hall Dene station which remained under the ownership of the Marquess. The NER took over operation of the route on 6 October 1900 and then, on 1 April 1905 opened an extension of it along the coast to West Hartlepool. As part of the 1900 Act that enabled the NER to purchase the Seaham to Sunderland line, the Marquess retained the power \\"to stop other than express trains within reasonable limits\\" although this privilege was only used four times between 1900 and 1923. After the NER was amalgamated into the London & North Eastern Railway in the grouping of 1923, the LNER requested that this privilege be abolished and consequentially the station ceased to be used from 1 March 1925. The original station building remains and has been convert to a private house.

Biography Ottaviano Maria Sforza was born in Milan, Italy in 1475, the son of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza Archivio Capitolare della Cattedrale Sezze: \\"Cronotassi episcopale\\" retrieved July 1, 2017 and his mistress Lucia Marliani. On 27 October 1497, he was appointed during the papacy of Pope Alexander VI as Bishop of Lodi. His title was more than pastoral and he used his position to secure funding and troops for the expeditions of his uncle Ludovico il Moro. In 1499, he was forced to resign as Bishop of Lodi after the French conquest of Milan by Louis XII. The Frenchman Claude de Seyssel (Claudio Sassatelli) was appointed as administrator in his place in 1501. In 1512, he was again reappointed as Bishop of Lodi by Pope Julius II after the expulsion of the French from Italy. He was once again forced from the bishopric in 1515 after the Duke of Milan Massimiliano Sforza and the Bishop of Sion, Matth√§us Schiner, suspected him of collaborating with the French; others contend that it was jealousy on the part of Duke Massimiliano Sforza. Fleeing to Germany, he returned to Italy in 1519. On 19 November 1519, he was appointed Bishop of Arezzo by Pope Leo X(switching places with Gerolamo Sansoni), where he served until his resignation in 1525. In 1527, he returned to Lodi, this time as the head of a band of mercenary troops where he helped to secure Milanese control of the city from the Venetians (who had seized it from the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V in 1526). He also regained the bishopric of Lodi, serving until his resignation in 1530 (some sources state he served from 1525-1531). His successor was again Gerolamo Sansoni. He retired to Milan where after the death of the Duke of Milan, he unsuccessfully sought the ducal throne. Thereafter he moved to Murano. On 20 May 1541, he was appointed Bishop of Terracina, Priverno e Sezze and Titular Patriarch of Alexandria by Pope Paul III. He served as Bishop of Terracina, Priverno e Sezze until his death in 1545 (some sources say 1540 or 1541).

Bred in Kentucky he was sent to race in Europe after being sold for $375,000 as a yearling. His brief racing career comprised only five races between May and September 1977 but he showed himself to be a high-class staying colt with wins in the Churchill Stakes, Ulster Derby and Irish St. Leger. He returned to America his stud career and had some success as a breeding stallion. Transworld died in 2001 at the age of 27. Background Transworld was a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and four white socks bred in Kentucky by Elmendorf Farm. As a yearling he was put up for auction and was sold for $375,000. He was sent to race in Europe where he was trained by Vincent O'Brien and competed in the colours of Simon Fraser. His sire Prince John recorded his biggest wi in the Garden State Stakes before his career was ended prematurely by injury. He became a very successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Speak John, Stage Door Johnny, Typecast, Silent Screen and Deceit. Transworld's dam Hornpipe failed to win a race but produced several other winners including Transworld's full brother Protagonist, the American Champion two-year-old colt of 1973. She was a granddaughter of Galatea who won the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks in 1939. Racing career=1977: three-year-old season= Transworld was unraced as juvenile in 1976 and made his debut in the Group 2 Gallinule Stakes over one and a half miles at the Curragh in May 1977. He showed some promise but finished unplaced behind his stablemate Alleged. In June he was sent to Ascot Racecourse in England for the Churchill Stakes, which was run over one and a half miles on the Saturday following the Royal Ascot meeting. He started favourite and overcame some difficulties in running before pulling away and winning by four lengths from the Guy Harwood-trained Mallard Song. Later that month he was sent to Down Royal in Northern Ireland and recorded a very easy wi in the Ulster Derby. In August at the Curragh he attempted to win his third consecutive race in the Blandford Stakes but was beaten a length into second by the Dermot Weld-trained Panamint with the filly Sassabunda in third. In the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh on 17 September Transworld was partnered by Tommy Murphy after Lester Piggott opted to ride the O'Brien stables main hope Valinsky, the winner of the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. Despite being rejected by the stable's top jockey, the colt was strongly supported in the betting market and started the 13/2 third choice behind Valinsky and Panamint. The other six runners included Sassabunda, Orchestra (Nijinsky Stakes) and Aristocracy (Whitehall Stakes). Murphy sent Tranworld into the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, shaking off his closest pursuer Valinsky early in the straight and drawing clear of the field to win by four lengths from Orchestra. His victory gave Vincent O'Brien a third consecutive win in the contest after Caucasus in 1975 and Meneval in 1976. At the end of the year the independent Timeform organisation gave Transworld a rating of 121, sixteen pounds behind their Horse of the Year Alleged. Stud record Transworld was exported to the United States and was expected to continue his track career. He was, however, retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Elmendorf Farm before moving to the Gainesway Farm in Kentucky and being relocated to the Stonewall Farm in New York in 1994. He died in June 2001 Alexander Farm near Byers, Colorado at the age of 27. The best of his offspring was the outstanding steeplechaser Lonesome Glory but he sired several other top-class performers including Winton (Venezuelan Horse of the Year), Powder Break (Pan American Handicap), The Hague (Hollywood Turf Cup) and Only Queens (Demoiselle Stakes).
