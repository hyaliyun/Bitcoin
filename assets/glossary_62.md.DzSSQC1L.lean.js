Biography Born in New York City, New York, Grant worked for Walt Disney Animation Studios as a character designer and story artist beginning in 1933 on the Mickey Mouse short, Mickey's Gala Premier. He created the Evil Queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. He led the development of Pinocchio and co- wrote Fantasia and Dumbo. During World War II, Grant worked on war cartoons including the Oscar-winning Der Fuehrer's Face. Grant was Jewish, and rigorously denied rumors that Walt Disney was anti-Semitic claiming \\"As far as I'm concerned, there was no evidence of anti-Semitism...I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried deep. He was not anti-Semitic. Some of the most influential people at the Studio were Jewish. It's much ado about nothing. I never once had a problem with him in that way. That myth should be laid to rest.\\"Gabler, Neal, 2006, Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination, Page 455, New York, Alfred A.

Section; 'What a Perfect Little Lady: The Story of Lady and the Tramp' it is said by his daughter on the DVD (Lady and the Tramp) that Walt Disney thought the dog's long fur looked like a dress and suggested creating a storyboard featuring his dog. Grant left the Disney studio in 1949 and ran a ceramics business and a greeting card business but returned in 1989 to work on Beauty and the Beast. He also worked on Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Fantasia 2000, and Pixar's Monsters, Inc. among others. Grant was also specially mentioned in the credits of Monsters, Inc. The last two films he worked on before his death, Chicken Little and Pixar's Up, were dedicated to him. Grant worked four days a week at Disney until he died, nine days before his 97th birthday. Grant's final project, Lorenzo, for which he conceived the idea and helped storyboard, received an Academy Award nomination in 2005. He was a recipient of the Disney legend award. Lorenzo In 2004, a short film he developed called Lorenzo was made and was based on his cat who got into a fight with two poodles in 1949. While it happened, he was thinking, \\"what would happen if he lost his tail?\\" The short, directed by Mike Gabriel, was released on March 4th, 2004 at the Florida Film Festival and made its world premier in front of the critically panned Raising Helen, with this the only positive feedback from critics and audiences. The finished short was planned at the time to be attached for a planned third Fantasia movie, but in 2003, the planned feature was eventually cancelled due to several years of funding and staff cutbacks from Walt Disney Feature Animation. The short won an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject, and was included at the Animation Show of Shows. Death On May 6, 2005, Grant died of heart attack while working at his drawing board in his home studio, nine days before his 97th birthday. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. The film Chicken Little, released five months after his death, was dedicated to his memory.

It originally appeared as Heckler & Koch's candidate for the US Army's Enhanced Grenade Launcher requirement, evaluated for use with the XM8 and FN SCAR rifles. As is commonly mistaken, the \\"A\\" is not an addition to the name \\"G36\\", which is short for Gewehr 36, but is in fact an abbreviation of the German Anbaugranatwerfer, literally meaning \\"attached grenade launcher\\" and the 36 coming from the name of the primary weapon it was designed to enhance ‚Äì the G36. It can also be used dismounted, with a stock attached as a stand-alone model, or a LLM01 laser light module can be attached to it. Design details The AG36 on a Latvian G36KV carbine. As in many modern weapon systems, including the G36 series, extensive use of polymers and high-strength aluminium in the AG36 launcher contributes to its low mass and high durability. It is capable of firing almost all 40√ó46mm grenade rounds, including plastic training cartridges, flexible baton rounds, CS gas, and oleoresin capsicum (OC, the same chemical used in pepper spray) gas cartridges, white phosphorus, and HE ammunition. With the grenade launcher fitted, when firing 5.56 mm ammunition, the G36 Rifle‚Äôs mean point of impact shifts approx. 10 cm downwards at a range of 100 meters. AG36 Operators Manual Page 6 The AG36 is a part of Germany's Infantryman of the future program. The AG36 is a single-shot weapon with a break-action steel barrel and unlike its American counterpart, the M203, the AG36 swings out laterally for loading, allowing for the use of longer rounds when necessary, e.g. baton or flare rounds. When open, the breech is on the left. For installation, the rifle's existing barrel handguard is removed and replaced by the AG36. The weapon has a trigger group with a manual safety lever and a pistol grip for ease of handling. Aiming is accomplished using standard ladder sights, which are located on the left side of the launcher body and folded down when not in use. Due to its modular design, the launcher can be readily adapted to other rifles, such as the M16-series and the Diemaco C7 and C8. Variants The L17A1 and L123A2 UGL (Underslung Grenade Launcher) are the under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers used by the British Army in conjunction with the L85A2 rifle (L123A2 UGL), and in small numbers with the L119A1 carbine used by United Kingdom Special Forces and the Pathfinder Platoon (L17A1 UGL). It is designed and built by Heckler & Koch and is a modified variant of the AG36. The UGL was first deployed during Operation Telic in 2003. The UGL replaced the muzzle- launched Rifle Grenade General Service. One UGL is issued per fireteam within infantry battalions. A further version of the AG36 is the Heckler & Koch AG-C/EGLM.

A pop filter, pop shield or pop screen is a noise protection filter for microphones, typically used in a recording studio. It serves to reduce or eliminate popping sounds caused by the mechanical impact of fast-moving air on the microphone during recorded speech and singing. Background Popping sounds occur particularly in the pronunciation of aspirated plosives (such as the first 'p' in the English word \\"popping\\"). The popping sound recorded by a microphone has two components: High-frequency components are from air moving past the grille or other parts of the microphone body. The low-frequency component is from air impacting the diaphragm. Mechanical and electrical saturation (e.g. clipping) can also play a role depending on the amount of headroom designed into these systems. Construction A typical pop filter is composed of one or more layers of acoustically semi-transparent material such as woven nylon stretched over a circular frame, and often includes a clamp and a flexible mounting bracket. Metal pop filters use a fine mesh metal screen in place of the nylon. Some studio condenser microphones have an integral pop filter built into their design. An improvised pop shield, functionally identical to the professional units, can be made with material from tights or stockings stretched over a kitchen sieve, embroidery hoop or a loop of wire such as a bent clothes hanger. It is important that the pop shield not be attached directly to the microphone as vibrations will be transmitted from the shield to the mic. Function Pop filters are designed to attenuate the energy of the plosive, which otherwise might exceed the design input capacity of the microphone, leading to clipping. In effect, the plosive's discrete envelope of sound energy is intercepted and broken up by the strands of the filter material before it can impinge on, and momentarily distort, the sensitive diaphragm of the microphone. Pop filters do not appreciably affect hissing sounds or sibilance, for which de-essing is used. Additionally, a pop filter can protect against the accumulation of saliva on the microphone element. Salts in human saliva are corrosive, so the use of a pop filter may improve the lifespan of the microphone. A pop filter differs from a microphone windscreen. Pop filters are generally used in a studio environment, while windscreens are typically used outdoors. Windscreens are also used by vocalists on stage to reduce plosives and saliva, though they may not be as acoustically transparent as a studio pop filter.

The main V-weapons were the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket ‚Äì these were launched against Britain from 1944 to 1945 and used against European targets as well. It included strategic operations against research and development of the weapons, their manufacture, transportation and attacks on their launch site, and fighter intercepts against missiles in flight. Initial intelligence investigations in 1943 into the progress of German long range weapons was carried out under the code name Bodyline. On 15 November, a larger operation was set up under the name Crossbow. Post-war, Crossbow operations became known as \\"Operation Crossbow\\" particularly following the 1965 film of the same name.  Strategic bombing  Peenem√ºnde Test Stand VII In May 1943 Allied surveillance observed the construction of the first of eleven large sites in northern France for secret German weapons, including six for the V-2 rocket. In November it discovered the first of 96 \\"ski sites\\" for the V-1 flying bomb. Officials debated the extent of the German weapons' danger; some viewed the sites as decoys to divert Allied bombers, while others feared chemical or biological warheads. When reconnaissance and intelligence information regarding the V-2 became convincing, the War Cabinet Defence Committee (Operations) directed the campaign's first planned raid (the Operation Hydra attack on Peenem√ºnde in August 1943). The works in France were the German \\"Site System 1\\" which was to be 96 fixed launching sites with storage bunkers (the 'ski' shapes) and outdoor ramps. Site System 2 (a reserve) and System 3 were planned. There were also four larger Wasserwerk (\\"Waterworks\\") bunker sites: Siracourt, Lottinghen, Nardouet, and Br√©court. Intended for use in January 1944 actual progress in construction, training and supply of V-1s was behind when inspected by German high command in October. French reports and detailed aerial reconnaissance linked with reconnaissance of Peenem√ºnde indicated possibility of 2,000 missiles per day against England. Over half the sites were completed by December but Allied intelligence had identified all 96 by end of January. The first bombing of sites was by USAAF Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers in early December with RAF Bomber Command starting night-time attacks shortly after but the greater inaccuracy of night bombing against small targets led Joint Chiefs of Staff to use US heavy bombers in daylight. By end of December 54 sites had been attacked and seven were destroyed. The bombing continued ‚Äì by end of March 9 destroyed and 35 seriously damaged, by May 24 destroyed and 58 seriously damaged. Following Operation Hydra, a few Crossbow attacks were conducted on the \\"Heavy Crossbow\\" bunkers of Watten (V-2) and Mimoyecques (V-3) from August and November 1943 respectively. \\"Crossbow Operations Against Ski Sites\\" began on December 5 with the \\"Noball\\" code name used for the targets (e.g., 'Noball 27' was the site, \\"Noball No. 93\\" was in the Cherbourg area, \\"Noball No. 107\\" was at Grand Parc, and \\"Noball V1 site No.147\\" was at Ligescourt). The US formed its own Crossbow Committee under General Stephen Henry (New Developments Division) on December 29, 1943, and the US subsequently developed bombing techniques for ski sites in February/March 1944 at the Air Corps Proving Ground. A mid-1944 plan for US Marine Corps aircraft to attack V-1 launch sites from aircraft carriers fell victim to inter-service rivalry ‚Äì being opposed by the Army. V-2 facilities were also bombed in 1944, including smaller facilities such as V-2 storage depots and liquid oxygen plants, such as the Mery-sur-Oise V-2 storage depot on August 4, 1944 and, by the Eighth Air Force, which bombed five cryogenic liquid oxygen plants in Belgium on August 25, 1944 but aborted the next days attack on plants \\"at La Louviere, Torte and Willebroeck, Belgium\\" due to cloud.  Bombing priority  A World War II map shows the two areas where the Germans were setting up their secret \\"V\\" weapons to bombard England (right, center). These are the areas in which the Royal Air Force and 8th Air Force heavy bombers concentrated their bombs in order to knock out the weapons -- part of the pre-invasion plan. This event was given the operational code name Crossbow during World War II. At the request of the British War Cabinet, on April 19, 1944, General Eisenhower directed Crossbow attacks to have absolute priority over all other air operations, including \\"wearing down German industry\\" and civilian morale \\"for the time being\\", which he confirmed after the V-1 assault began on the night of June 12/13, 1944 saying to Arthur Tedder \\"with respect to Crossbow targets, these targets are to take first priority over everything except the urgent requirements of the Overlord [invasion of Normandy] battle; this priority to obtain until we can be certain that we have definitely gotten the upper hand of this particular business\\". The launches surprised the Allies, who had believed that the earlier attacks on the sites had eliminated the danger. The British, who had not expected German bombing of Britain to resume so late in the war, were especially upset. Some suggested using gas on the launch sites, or even executing German civilians as punishment. Carl Spaatz, commander of U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USTTAF), responded on June 28 to \\"complain that Crossbow was a 'diversion' from the main task of wearing down the Luftwaffe and bombing German industry\\" for the Combined Bomber Offensive, and to recommend instead that Crossbow be a secondary priority since \\"days of bad weather over Germany's industrial targets would still allow enough weight of attack for the rocket sites and the lesser tactical crises.\\" By July 10, Tedder had published a list of Crossbow targets which assigned 30 to RAF Bomber Command, six to the tactical Allied Expeditionary Air Force, and 68 to Spaatz' USSTAF; after which Spaatz again complained, so Eisenhower allowed \\"spare\\" bombing of non-Crossbow targets: \\"Instructions for continuing to make Crossbow targets our first priority must stand, but ... when ... the entire strategic forces cannot be used against Crossbow, we should attack‚Äî(a) Aircraft industry, (b) Oil, (c) ball bearing (German): Kugellagerwerke, (d) Vehicular production\\" (Eisenhower, July 18). Nonetheless, over a quarter of the Combined Bomber Offensive's tonnage of bombs were used against V-weapon sites in July and August; many of the attacks were ineffective, as they were against unused sites rather than the launchers themselves. Spaatz unsuccessfully proposed that attacks concentrate on the Calais electrical grid, and on gyrocompass factories in Germany and V-weapon storage depots in France. The gyrocompass attacks, along with targeting liquid oxygen tanks (which the Allies knew the V-2 needed), might have been very effective against the missiles. On August 25, 1944, the Joint Crossbow Target Priorities Committee (established July 21) prepared the \\"Plan for Attack on the German Rocket Organization When Rocket Attacks Commence\\"‚Äîin addition to bombing of storage, liquid-oxygen, and launch sites; the plan included aerial reconnaissance operations. Following the last V-1 launch from France on September 1, 1944, and since the expected V-2 attacks had not begun, Crossbow bombing was suspended on September 3 and the campaign against German oil facilities became the highest priority. The V-1 threat from occupied France ended on September 5, 1944, when the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division contained the German military units of the Nord-Pas de Calais area with their surrender following on September 30.  Resumption of bombing  Crossbow bombing resumed after the first V-2 attack and included a large September 17 raid on Dutch targets suspected as bases for Heinkel He 111s, which were air-launching V-1s. Modified V-1s (865 total) were air-launched from September 16, 1944 to January 14, 1945. The British had initially considered that an earlier July 18‚Äì21, 1944 effort of 50 air-launched V-1s had been ground-launched from the Low Countries, particularly near Ostend. In addition to air-launched V-1s, launches were from ramps built in the province of South Holland, the Netherlands in 1945. Allied reconnaissance detected two sites at Vlaardingen and Ypenburg, and along with a third at Delft, they launched 274 V-1s at London from March 3‚Äì29. Only 125 reached the British defences, and only thirteen of those reached the target area. Three additional sites directed their fire on Antwerp. After using medium bombers against V-2 launch site in the Haagse Bos on March 3, the RAF attacked the Holland V-1 sites with two squadrons. An RAF Fighter Command unit used Spitfires against Ypenburg on March 20 and 23, while a RAF Second Tactical Air Force unit used Hawker Typhoons against Vlaardingen on March 23. Counterattacks on Holland's V-1 and V-2 sites ended on April 3, and all Crossbow countermeasures ended on May 2 with the end of World War II in Europe. A Spitfire tipping the wing of a V-1 to disrupt the missile's automatic pilot.  V-1 defence  On January 2, 1944, Air Marshal Roderic Hill, Air Officer Commander-in-Chief of Air Defence of Great Britain submitted his plan to deploy 1,332 guns for the defence of London, Bristol and the Solent against the V-1 \\"Robot Blitz\\" (the \\"Diver Operations Room\\" was located at RAF Biggin Hill). Against V-1s attacks there were belts of select units of Fighter Command (No. 150 Wing RAF) operating high-speed fighters, the anti-aircraft guns of Anti-Aircraft Command, and approximately 1,750 barrage balloons of Balloon Command around London. \\"Flabby\\" was the code name for medium weather-conditions when fighters were allowed to chase flying bombs over the gun-belt to the balloon line, and during Operation Totter, the Royal Observer Corps fired \\"Snowflake\\" illuminating rocket flares from the ground to identify V-1 flying bombs to RAF fighters. After the Robot Blitz began on the night of June 12/13, 1944, the first RAF fighter interception of a V-1 was on June 14/15. Moreover, anti- aircraft guns increased the rate of downed V-1s to 1 per 77 rounds fired after the introduction of proximity fuses. Despite the defences, by June 27, \\"over 100,000 houses had been damaged or destroyed by the V-1 ... and shattered sewage systems threatened serious epidemics unless fixed by winter.\\" Of the 638 air-launched V-1s that had been observed, guns and fighters brought down 403; the 66 fell in the London Civil Defence Region and 169 in other places, including Southampton on July 7 and one as far north as Manchester.  V-2 counter-measures  The British intelligence services (Secret Intelligence Service and Air Ministry's Scientific Intelligence Office) were monitoring German rocket artillery research and information received by bugging high- ranking German prisoners-of-war increased focus on activities at Peenemunde. In response to discussions by the vice-chiefs of staff on the subject of German long range rocket developments, in April 1943 Duncan Sandys was given the responsibility of investigating how far Germany had progressed.Gruen, 1998 Under the codename Bodyline, investigations by SIS, the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, and the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit were able to confirm existence of rocketry activities at Peenemunde and Sandys reported his findings to the chiefs of staff that the Germans were developing rockets, were probably well-advanced and countermeasures should be studied The Bodyline Scientific Committee (19 members, including Duncan Sandys, Edward Victor Appleton, John Cockcroft, Robert Watson-Watt) was formed in September 1943 regarding the suspected V-2 rocket. After the 1944 crash of a test V-2 in Sweden, \\"transmitters to jam the guidance system of the rocket\\" were prepared. A British sound-ranging system provided \\"trajectory [data] from which the general launching area could be determined\\", and the microphone(s) in East Kent reported the times of the first V-2 strikes on September 8, 1944: 18:40:52 and 18:41:08. In November 1943, the Bodyline committee handed over the tasks to the Air Ministry as the extent of the issue became clear. On March 21, 1945, the Pile's plan for the \\"Engagement of Long Range Rockets with AA Gunfire\\" which called for anti-aircraft units to fire into a radar- predicted airspace to intercept the V-2 was ready, but the plan was not used due to the danger of shells falling on Greater London. Unlike the V-1 which was of comparable speed to a fighter, the velocity and trajectory of a V-2 made aircraft interception an impossibility. Happenstance instances of Allied aircraft encountering launched V-2 rockets include: October 29, 1944, Lieutenants Donald A. Schultz and Charles M. Crane in a Lockheed P-38 Lightning attempted to photograph a launched V-2 above the trees near the River Rhine,Kennedy, p4 January 1, 1945, a 4th Fighter Group pilot aloft over the northern flightpath for attacking elements of five German fighter wings on Unternehmen Bodenplatte that day, observed a V-2 \\"act up for firing near Lochem ... the rocket was immediately tilted from 85 deg. to 30 deg\\", and on February 14, 1945, a No. 602 Squadron RAF Spitfire Mk XVI pilot, Raymond Baxter's colleague \\"Cupid\\" Love, fired at a V-2 just after launch. After the last combat V-2 launch on March 27, 1945, the British discontinued their use of radar in the defence region to detect V-2 launches on April 13.

He also played semi-professional baseball in Weiser, Idaho, where he caught the attention of New York Yankees scout Joe Devine.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/982ed387 Career Carey signed with the Yankees, receiving a $60,000 signing bonus. He made his major league debut with the Yankees in 1952. By 1954, Carey was the Yankees' starting third baseman. That year, he had a .302 batting average and 65 runs batted in (RBIs) in 122 games played. In 1955, Carey led the American League with 11 triples. While playing for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series, Carey twice helped preserve Don Larsen's perfect game against the Dodgers on October 8, 1956. In the second inning, the Dodgers‚Äô Jackie Robinson smacked a shot between third and short that Carey knocked down, allowing shortstop Gil McDougald to pick up the ball and nip Robinson at first. In the eighth, he robbed Gil Hodges by snaring a low line drive that seemed headed for left field. Carey played for the Yankees into the 1960 season. By this point, the emergence of Clete Boyer as the Yankees third baseman led them to trade Carey after four games to the Kansas City Athletics for Bob Cerv. In June 1961, the Athletics traded Carey, Larsen, Ray Herbert, and Al Pilarcik to the Chicago White Sox for Wes Covington, Stan Johnson, Bob Shaw, and Gerry Staley.United Press International. \\"Weekend Summary\\" (sports), Elizabethton Star, June 12, 1961, page five. After the 1961 season, the White Sox traded Carey with Frank Barnes to the Philadelphia Phillies for Taylor Phillips and Bob Sadowski. However, Carey refused to report to Philadelphia, and the White Sox sent Cal McLish to the Phillies to compensate them.McLish ready after slow start The White Sox then traded Carey to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ramon Conde and Jim Koranda before the 1962 season. The Dodgers released Carey after the 1962 season. In an 11-year career, he had a .260 batting average, with 64 home runs, and 350 RBIs. He had 741 career hits. He finished his career with 38 triples. Personal life After he retired, Carey worked as a stockbroker for Mitchum, Jones, and Templeton in Los Angeles.Al Carr. \\"Yanks' Andy Carey Shuns Baseball\\", Los Angeles Times, August 13, 1970, Part III, page 8.

The novel was serialized in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in April‚ÄìJuly 1953. Its first hardcover book publication was in 1954, and it was first published as a paperback book in 1958. Along with the novel, many editions (and most recent editions) of the book also include \\"Whirligig World\\", an essay by Clement on creating the planet Mesklin that was first published in the June 1953 Astounding. Clement published three sequels to Mission of Gravity: a 1970 novel called Star Light, a 1973 short story called \\"Lecture Demonstration\\", and a 2000 short story, \\"Under\\". Mission of Gravity was nominated for a \\"Retro-Hugo\\" Award for the year 1954. Setting The story is set on a highly oblate planet named Mesklin, which has surface gravity that varies between 700 g at the poles and 3 g at the equator. The story is told from the points of view of one of the local intelligent life forms and a human explorer. The locals are centipede-like, in order to withstand the enormous gravity, and terrified of even small heights, because in 700 g, even a tiny fall is fatal. (See Mesklin for a more comprehensive description of the planet's characteristics.) Plot summary The native protagonist, Barlennan, captain of the sailing raft Bree, is on a trading expedition to the equator. Prior to the story's opening, a human scientific probe has become stranded at one of the planet's poles, where the gravity is too strong to effect a rescue. A member of the scientific team, Charles Lackland, is dispatched to the equator where he has met Barlennan by chance. Even machine aided, Lackland is barely able to function in the 3 gee environment, one Barlennan considers incredibly light and a tiny fraction of what his culture is used to. Lackland teaches the Bree crew English and arranges a deal with Barlennan; in exchange for the humans providing warnings of the violent weather which often plagues trips to the pole, Barlennan will retrieve the probe and return it to the equator where it can be picked up. Communication is achieved through an audio- visual radio built to function in a high-gravity environment, which is treated as magical by other intelligences encountered on the planet. Along the way to the pole, the ship encounters and overcomes a variety of obstacles, some of which the humans help with using their superior scientific knowledge, and some of which rely on the cunning of Barlennan and his crew. They are captured by various lifeforms similar to themselves, but who live in the lower-gravity areas and have developed projectile weapons and gliders. Gradually, with human help, they gain an understanding of these and manage to escape. Barlennan has been dissatisfied with the humans' efforts to seemingly avoid explanation of anything scientific, and almost withholds the probe when they finally reach it; but the humans convince them that a scientific background is needed to understand the advanced equipment in the probe, and a deal is reached whereby the humans will educate the Mesklinites. The novel provides an exposition on how the weather, geology and atmosphere of the seas and the pole are affected by the local conditions, and sees the Mesklinites overcoming their fear of gravity as they learn to view it scientifically, eventually harnessing aerodynamics to make the Bree fly at the poles. Reception Mission was the runner-up for the 1955 International Fantasy Award for fiction.Hugo Nominees 1955, by Jo Walton; published October 31, 2010; retrieved August 21, 2016 Boucher and McComas found Mission \\"compact and unified, with a good deal of adventurous excitement\\" and characterized it as \\"a splendid specimen of science fiction in the grandest of grand manners.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, June 1954, p.70. Wayne Barlowe illustrated the Mesklinites in his Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials. Reputation The story is ‚Äúnoteworthy not only as an impressive piece of planet-building, but as the first SF novel built on actual observational data involving another possible solar system‚Äù,:170 making it an early and often-praised example of macrocosmic worldbuilding hard science fiction. Although Clement has stated that his original calculations concerning the polar gravity of Mesklin were inaccurate ‚Äî he later estimated the polar gravity should have been approximately 250 g instead of 700 ‚Äî the exploration of what existence might be like in such extreme conditions is detailed, convincing, and persuasive. The novel is frequently invoked in discussions of the sense of wonder, the sensation of dawning comprehension and understanding of a larger context for a given experience, that many readers of science fiction point to as the reason why they pursue the genre. The personalities of Clement's alien characters have been criticized as being \\"too human\\" or not \\"alien enough\\", as failing to be, in the words of John W. Campbell \\"something that thinks as well as a man, but not like a man\\".

Al-Timimi has been described as \\"arguably the first American born activist Salafi preacher.\\"Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, Khawarij in America: History, Evolution, Radicalization, october 2018, p. 67. Report for the George Washington University Program on Extremism. %20in%20America.pdf Link. Early life and Education Al-Timimi was born in 1963 and grew up in Washington, DC, where he attended Georgetown Day School until age fifteen.Milton Viorst, \\"The Education of Ali Al-Timimi\\", The Atlantic, June 2006; retrieved June 9, 2019. His father was an attorney who worked at the Iraqi embassy, and his mother was a mental health specialist with a doctorate in psychology. One of Al-Timimi's teenage friends was the son of journalist Milton Viorst, who later wrote in The Atlantic that the family was \\"not particularly ethnic or religious,\\" and that Al-Timimi celebrated holidays such as Halloween and Christmas with his brother and other friends at school. Viorst writes that Al-Timimi's parents were both practicing Muslims, but spoke English rather than Arabic at home and \\"did not push religious observance on the children.\\" At age fifteen, in 1978, Al-Timimi's parents moved the family to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for two years to expose them to their Islamic heritage. Al-Timimi attended Manarat High School, where he learned Arabic and studied Islam under the Imam Bilal Phillips. Al- Timimi became influenced by Salafism, a reform branch of Sunni Islam that advocates strict adherence to the Quran and Sunna (the teachings of the Prophet). In 1981, Al-Timimi returned to the United States and enrolled in a premed program at The George Washington University, while spending much of his time networking with different groups in the local Muslim community. Al-Timimi was quoted as saying that he \\"flirted with each group, only quickly to become disinterested in their rhetoric and what I perceived as their being out of touch with the questions being raised in America‚Äîabout Islam and the Muslims.\\" Stating that he was \\"hungry for answers to the larger philosophical questions,\\" Al-Timimi returned to Saudi Arabia in 1987, where he studied Salafiya for a year at the Islamic University of Madinah and became a student of Abdul-Aziz bin Baz. He also became influenced by Islamist thinkers like Sayyid Qutb, Safar Al-Hawali and Muhammad Surur. At his parent's urging, Al- Timimi returned to the United States after a year and earned a second undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Maryland. He later earned a Ph.D. in computational biology from George Mason University in 2004, after defending a doctoral thesis titled \\"Chaos and Complexity in Cancer.\\" Work and Islamic activities After returning from Medina, Al- Timimi began to deliver lectures on Salafiya at Islamic conferences throughout the 1990s, and gradually developed an audience. Dozens of his lectures have been published on the internet. Viorst writes that Al-Timimi avoided contemporaneous political issues, but instead reflected on \\"the Islamic vision of Judgment Day, prophecy, the nature of the divine, and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence)‚Äîsubjects with which he grappled in Medina and in his private reading.\\" In the late 1990s, Al-Timimi cofounded an Islamic center in Falls Church, Virginia with his mentor, Sheikh Jafar, which they named Dar al-Arqam. Al-Timimi became its primary lecturer, and delivered weekly lessons on Salafiya to approximately a hundred attendees a week. According to Umar Lee, Al-Timimi's lectures \\"became 'the place to be' for the youth of the masjids [mosques] throughout the D.C. area,\\" who were attracted to the fact that \\"this was a man who was born and raised in America, spoke in clear English, and not only had a great knowledge of the din (religion) but was college educated, a cancer researcher, and a very serious intellectual. This was a man who could take the knowledge of the Salaf and make it applicable to your everyday life and could speak in a language we all understood.\\" In the early 1990s, Al- Timimi led a five-person delegation from the Islamic Assembly of North America to the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China. Al-Timimi also translated into English a book about women in Islam that was written by Shaikh Abdel Rahaman Abdel Khaliq. In late 2002, the former Dar al- Hijrah imam Anwar al-Awlaki visited Al-Timimi and inquired about recruiting men for \\"violent jihad.\\".Schmidt, Susan; Imam From Va. Mosque Now Thought to Have Aided Al-Qaeda; The Washington Post, February 27, 2008. pg. 3. Retrieved November 20, 2009. But Al-Timimi became suspicious of al-Awlaki's motives, believing it to be an entrapment attempt and asked al-Awlaki to leave. As an IT specialist, Al-Timimi worked at an IT company named Xpedior, Inc. Clients he provided service to included America Online (AOL). He reportedly worked for two months for Andrew Card, while he was Secretary of Transportation under George H. Bush (1992‚Äì93). Trial and sentencing Prior to Al-Timimi's prosecution, a group of young Muslim men that prosecutors described as a \\"Virginia Jihad Network\\" were convicted on charges related to their travels to a militant training camp in Pakistan called Lashkar-e-Taiba, a group that the United States would later designate as a Foreign Terrorist Organization on December 26, 2001. Al-Timimi was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in that case. According to prosecutors, Al-Timimi told his followers at a private gathering on September 16, 2001 that he believed that the 9/11 attacks had been an omen that foreshadowed a looming end-of-times battle between Muslims and the West, and that \\"the time had come for them to go abroad and join the mujaheddin engaged in violent jihad in Afghanistan.\\" Another attendee at the gathering, Randall Royer, advised the men that they could receive military training from Lashkar-e-Taiba, and put the men in contact with the group. Several of the attendees went on to travel to Lashkar-e-Taiba and participate in military training exercises, though none ultimately did any fighting. After the conclusion of the Virginia Jihad Network trials, prosecutors tried Al- Timimi for helping to inspire their travel to Lashkar-e-Taiba. The case was tried before U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia, and charged Al-Timimi with 10 criminal counts, including solicitation of treason and attempting to aid the Taliban. Al-Timimi's defense lawyers argued his case was an attack on the freedom of speech and religious freedom, arguing that their client only told young Muslims that it might be better to emigrate from the United States to better practice their faith. After a week of deliberation, the jury found Al-Timimi guilty of all 10 counts in April 2005. At a sentencing hearing on July 14, 2005, he received a mandatory lifetime prison sentence. Judge Brinkema described the sentence as \\"very draconian,\\" but said \\"I don't think any well-read person can doubt the truth that terrorist camps are a crucial part of the new terrorism that is perpetrated in the world today. People of good will need to do whatever they can to stop that.\\" Royer was released from prison in December 2016, and now works for a nonprofit group that seeks to undermine religious extremism. Since his release, Royer has maintained that \\"Timimi did not specifically say join the Taliban or help al-Qaeda though he seemed to imply it.\\" However, Royer has also said that Al-Timimi's statement that Muslim men should \\"go be with the mujahideen\\" was \\"colossally bad advice.\\" Appeals Although Al-Timimi was convicted in 2005, his direct appeal is still ongoing. In late 2005, Al- Timimi's appellate attorneys sought discovery on whether Al-Timimi had been subjected to illegal wiretaps in light of the then-recently disclosed NSA warrantless surveillance program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit responded by remanding the case back to the district court, giving broad latitude to the trial judge. The Justice Department did not confirm or deny the use of NSA wiretaps against Al-Timimi. In 2006, Al-Timimi's attorneys also challenged his treatment by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, claiming that it had repeatedly moved him to new facilities to block him from meeting with his legal counsel. Attorney Jonathan Turley told NPR that Al-Timimi \\"was transferred to at least six different prisons in four states in less than six months. It became a version of Where's Waldo. We could not find him.\\" After an internal investigation, BOP found that a prison official had \\"verbally harassed\\" Al-Timimi, but concluded that it had insufficient evidence to substantiate Al-Timimi's other claims. In September 2015, the Fourth Circuit again remanded the case, this time on the grounds that \\"the FBI withheld evidence of its 2002 investigation into the first American on the CIA's kill or capture list, Anwar al-Awlaki\\". Between 2016 and 2019, Al-Timimi's attorneys further argued that several of his convictions have been rendered invalid by the Supreme Court's intervening decisions in Johnson v. United States and United States v. Davis. On April 27, 2020, Al-Timimi's attorneys filed a motion for his conditional release from prison pending the remainder of his appeal, arguing that intervening Supreme Court authority had cast doubt on the charges that continued to subject him to imprisonment, and that the COVID-19 pandemic additionally presented an exceptional reason justifying his release. On August 18, 2020, Judge Brinkema granted the motion and ordered Al- Timimi's conditional release from ADX and into home confinement while he pursues his appeal. On September 1, 2020, Al-Timimi was released out ADX Florence in placed into home confinement.

A member of the Von Erich Family, Von Erich is best known for his appearances with his father's World Class Championship Wrestling promotion. He is a one-time world champion, having held the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship.  Football career  Adkisson played football at North Texas State University as a fullback, second string to Garry Smith, until an injury ended his football career and dream of playing in the National Football League. Professional wrestling career= World Class Championship Wrestling (1976-1990) Early career = Adkisson started wrestling as Kevin Von Erich in 1976. He spent most of his career wrestling for his father's promotion, World Class Championship Wrestling. Kevin's natural athletic ability and good looks made him one of the promotion's biggest stars. He achieved great success in the company both as a singles and tag team wrestler, often participating in many of the company's high-profile feuds. Kevin was also known for wrestling barefoot, highly unusual in a sport where almost all wrestlers wear high-topped boots. World Class announcers often jokingly referred to him as \\"The Barefoot Boy\\" on WCCW broadcasts. Kevin later admitted in an interview that he never set out to wrestle barefoot, but that before one of his matches someone hid his boots as a joke, and he wasn't able to find them before his match, so just went out barefoot to wrestle, and it later became his trademark. Contrary to popular belief, he wore boots in matches in his early career, including his debut match against Paul Perschmann aka Playboy Buddy Rose and in a match against Superfly Jimmy Snuka. Kevin was a big fan of Snuka's, who also wrestled barefoot, and Kevin often performed a moved similar to Snuka's flying body splash from the top rope, which Snuka called The Superfly. During the late 70s, Kevin established himself in the Dallas territory. His first major success came in 1978 while wrestling as a tag team with his younger brother David. During the year, they captured the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship on two occasions as well as the NWA American Tag Team Championship. On Christmas Day 1978, he established himself firmly in the singles ranks of the promotion by defeating Bruiser Brody for the NWA American Heavyweight Championship. In 1980, Kevin Von Erich made his only wrestling appearance in the WWF on January 21 against Johnny Rodz, in a match he won. As the 1980s dawned, Kevin became one of the promotion's most viable performers and continued to win numerous championships in both singles and tag team competition with a variety of different partners. However, his highest profile partners would always be his brothers Kerry and David. As the early-1980s progressed, Kevin would appear often at other NWA-promoted territories, including St. Louis, Georgia Championship Wrestling and briefly Florida Championship Wrestling. Kevin also competed in a few matches for the World Wide Wrestling Federation. = Freebird-Von Erich Feud (1982-1984)= In early 1982, the Fabulous Freebirds, consisting of Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts, left Georgia Championship Wrestling after meeting WCCW booker Gary Hart at a show. Appearing in World Class, the trio instantly became fan favorites due to a combination of their unique talents and chemistry as well as their close friendship with the Von Erichs. All three rose quickly through the ranks and in late November 1982, Hayes and Gordy defeated the team of King Kong Bundy and Wild Bill Irwin for the NWA American Tag Team Championship. A feud between the Von Erichs and Freebirds developed roughly a month later. During WCCW's annual Christmas show in 1982, Kerry Von Erich faced Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship inside of a steel cage with Michael Hayes acting as a special referee. As explained in The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling DVD, the storyline, developed by Gary Hart, was written as Hayes having been selected by fans to be a special enforcer type of referee in the match. Near the end of the match, Flair shoved Hayes, which resulted in Hayes punching him. Hayes then tried to place Kerry on top of Flair to make the three count. Von Erich refused to do so since it wasn't the \\"Texas thing to do\\", which led to a brief shoving match and argument between the two. Hayes, disgusted with the situation, told Terry Gordy, who had been assigned as the gatekeeper, to open the cage door. As Hayes is about to leave Von Erich was attacked from behind by Ric Flair, with the former accidentally hitting Hayes and knocking him out of the cage. The angle was written as having neither Hayes nor Gordy being aware that Kerry was shoved into Hayes. As Kerry was getting to his feet inside the ring, that was the signal for Gordy to slam the cage door shut, hitting Kerry on the head and costing him the championship. The Freebirds immediately became the top heels in the company, due to the belief of many fans that their actions cost one of their local heroes the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. As the feud was building, the WCCW television broadcasts were syndicated to television stations all across the United States, giving the promotion millions of viewers each week in the U.S. alone. This changed the face of wrestling and how it was marketed and presented to audiences. The extremely physical nature of the matches between the two factions captivated fans, changing preconceptions about what professional wrestling was and could be. Throughout the next several years, the Freebirds and Von Erichs engaged in numerous high-profile matches that were very physical in nature with the various members of each group feuding over various championships within the promotion. The feud is seen today by many fans and wrestling industry insiders as one of the best worked and most memorable feuds in the history of professional wrestling. This line of drama ended, when Kevin's brother David von Erich, died in Japan from acute enteritis of the upper intestine. This broke up the symmetry of the wrestling rivalry, though eventually the remaining brothers went on to wrestle individually, with varying degrees of success. = Feuds with Chris Adams and Ric Flair (1985-1990) = Kevin also had a long feud with Chris Adams that lasted for months and had many violent matches, including two well-known chair shots on each other that required hospitalization for both men. Kevin would also tag-team with Adams on numerous occasions before and after their feud. Away from the ring, Kevin and Chris were close friends; Kevin served as a pallbearer during Adams' funeral in 2001 and traveled to England to visit Adams' family afterwards. In recent interviews, Kevin stated that Adams was the toughest wrestler he's ever wrestled in his career and he showed a great amount of respect for the British-born wrestler. Kevin had several close matches with NWA World Champ Ric Flair, including the main event of the 2nd David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium, but never won the title.  Folding of WCCW and United States Wrestling Association (1989-1990)  After the failure of SuperClash III, in 1989, Kevin became very despondent over his father's decision to sell the promotion to Jerry Jarrett, who owned the Memphis-based CWA, despite his brother Kerry welcoming Jarrett into the mix; the merged promotions became the USWA. However, because of disputes, including suing Jarrett himself, he pulled WCCW out of the USWA in 1990, but he couldn't resurrect the promotion his father built and had no choice but shut down World Class that November. Kevin did manage to draw crowds to the Sportatorium in the early going, but with the absence of his brother, manager/booker Gary Hart, and the lack of televised matches, World Class' survival was very thin. During that time, Kevin competed very little; other than wrestling in other independent cards promoted by either himself, Chris Adams or Gary Hart. Kevin did not participate at all in the August 4, 1989 card in which World Class formally became USWA Texas, while brother Kerry, who competed on the card earlier, reportedly left the Sportatorium shortly after his match. Kevin however did help out a young Steve Austin increase his abilities in the ring during this time, and considers Austin as one of his friends to this day.  World Wrestling Federation (1991)  Sixteen months after his brother joined the World Wrestling Federation, Kevin wrestled a dark match on December 2, 1991 at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Corpus Christi, TX where he faced and defeated Brian Lee.  Later career (1991-1995)  Von Erich competed in Mexico's Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in 1991. On April 2, 1993 he teamed up with Chris Adams to defeat Fabulous Freebirds' Michael Hayes and Buddy Roberts at Global Wrestling Federation's Adkisson Benefit Show at the Sportatorium. Kevin's last round of glory occurred on January 7, 1995 while competing for Jim Crockett, Jr.'s NWA promotion based at the Sportatorium; where he won the North American heavyweight title defeating Greg Valentine. A week later he dropped the title to John Hawk. He then formed a very brief alliance with manager Skandor Akbar. Kevin eventually cut back on his ring appearances and formally retired by the end of 1995.  Return to Wrestling (2017)  At 60 years of age, Von Erich returned to wrestling for the first time in 22 years on July 9, 2017. He teamed with his sons Ross and Marshall as they defeated Marty Jannetty, Jumping Lee and Gery Roif at Los Angeles Wrestling in Tel Aviv, Israel.  Retirement  On October 3, 2005, Kevin made an appearance on the WWE Raw Homecoming show alongside other WWE Hall of Famers. Later that night, as Dusty Rhodes and the WWE Hall of Famers were gathered in the ring, Rob Conway came out and interrupted Rhodes. This eventually led to Conway's beatdown by several Hall of Famers, in which Kevin used the legendary Iron Claw on Conway, to the raves of the partisan Dallas, Texas crowd. Jim Ross said afterwards that he never thought he would live to see the Iron Claw again. On January 20, 2006, Kevin and his son Ross Adkisson (billed as Ross Von Erich) appeared on a local wrestling card in Longview, Texas as guests of Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit. During the segment, in which Kevin and Piper talked about going to the Sportatorium as teenagers, Skandor Akbar interrupted the interview to berate both Kevin and Ross. At one point, Akbar pushed Ross, which prompted Kevin to apply the iron claw on Akbar. Greg Valentine then pulled Akbar away, with Kevin, Ross, Piper and The Grappler taking in the cheers of the crowd. In 2006, Kevin, and a number of others from World Class Championship Wrestling's heyday, participated in Heroes of World Class Wrestling, an independently produced retrospective documentary about the promotion and the Von Erich family. The documentary featured comments from Adkisson, Gary Hart, Skandor Akbar, Bill Mercer, Mickey Grant, David Manning, Marc Lowrance and via earlier interviews, Chris Adams. Later that October he sold the rights to the (pre-1988) WCCW name and tape archives to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). WWE subsequently began broadcasting WCCW's syndicated programming on their subscription video on demand service WWE Classics On Demand with Kevin and Michael \\"P.S.\\" Hayes acting as hosts and later included WCCW footage on the WWE Network. WWE produced The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class, their own documentary on the territory in 2007. Kevin was also featured in the 2007 WWE produced DVD The Most Powerful Families in Wrestling in a segment on the Von Erich family. On April 4, 2009, Kevin represented the Von Erich family as they were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Michael Hayes. On June 15, 2014, at Slammiversary, Kevin accompanied his sons Ross and Marshall to the ring for a tag-team match. On April 2, 2016 Kevin appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to discuss his relationship with The Fabulous Freebirds. In July 2017 Kevin, along with his two sons Marshall and Ross, wrestled at the Rage Megashow in Israel. He resides in Kauai, Hawaii.  Personal life  He has been married since August 1, 1980 to Pam Adkisson. They currently live in Hawaii and run a family investment business together. Kevin also dabbles in commercial real estate, and owns the rights to Southwest Sports (the distributor of World Class Championship Wrestling), which was later renamed K.R. Adkisson Enterprises. Together they have four children; Kristen Rain (born February 3, 1981), Jillian Lindsey (born February 10, 1985), David Michael Ross (born June 1, 1988), and Kevin Marshall (born November 10, 1992). He and Pam have 8 grandchildren as well. Kristen and Joseph Nikolas, her husband, have one daughter, Adeline Claire, twin sons Eli and Rush, and sons Abram and Josiah. Jill is the mother of three daughters.

It is an adaptation of one of Sappho's fragmentary lyric poems, Sappho 31. Catullus replaces Sappho's beloved with his own beloved Lesbia. Unlike the majority of Catullus' poems, the meter of this poem is the sapphic meter. This meter is more musical, seeing as Sappho mainly sang her poetry. Catullus is not the only poet who translated Sappho‚Äôs poem to use for himself: Pierre de Ronsard is also known to have translated a version of it. The poem The following Latin text of Catullus 51 is taken from D.F.S. Thomson; the translation is literal, not literary. { style=\\"border: 0px; margin-left:50px; white-space: nowrap;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"50px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"400px\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"400px\\"  - border=\\"0\\" - Valign=top  1 5 10 15  Ille mi par esse deo videtur, ille, si fas est, superare divos, qui sedens adversus identidem te spectat et audit dulce ridentem, misero quod omnes eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te, Lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus flamma demanat, sonitu suopte tintinant aures, gemina teguntur lumina nocte. otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est: otio exsultas nimiumque gestis: otium et reges prius et beatas perdidit urbes.  He seems to me to be equal to a god, he, if it is permissible, seems to surpass the gods, who sitting opposite again and again watches and hears you sweetly laughing, which rips out all senses from miserable me: for at the same moment I look upon you, Lesbia, nothing is left for me But my tongue grows thick, a thin flame runs down beneath my limbs, with their own sound my ears ring, my lights (eyes) are covered by twin night. Idleness is a troublesome thing for you, Catullus: In idleness you revel and delight too much: Idleness has destroyed both kings and blessed cities before. } *Catullus here builds upon a common interpretation of the lost original verse from Sappho. For a reconstruction of the original Greek first verse, see Sappho 31. *Line 8 is missing from the original manuscript. Oxford Classical Texts (ed. R.A.B. Mynors) provides no substitution.

The Prince was chairman of the \\"Central Civil Committee\\" (Centralny Komitet Obywatelski) in 1915. From 1916 to 1917 mayor of Warsaw. He was an activist of the \\"Real Politics Party\\" (Stronnictwo Polityki Realnej) and from 1917 to 1918 member of the Regency Council. Monitor Polski, z dn. 7 pa≈∫dziernika 1918, s. 1. From 1928 until 1935 member of the Senate and chairman of the \\"Council of Landowner Organisations\\" from 1931 to 1935. In 1893, Lubomirski married Maria n√©e Branicki, with whom he had three children: daughters Julia Maria (born 1894) and Dorota (born 1904), and son Jerzy Aleksander (born 1896). Together with his wife, he lived in a house in Warsaw district of Frascati, and in a family real estate located in the village of Mala Wies, near Gr√≥jec. Early life and education Zdzislaw Lubomirski was born on April 4, 1865 in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod. He was the son of Prince Jan Tadeusz Lubomirski, and Maria n√©e Zamoyska. Since his patriotic parents wanted their son to be raised in a Polish spirit, as a child he was sent to Austrian Galicia, where he attended Krak√≥w's St. Anna High School. In 1883‚Äì1887, Lubomirski studied law at Jagiellonian University and University of Graz. Career In the early 20th century, Lubomirski became a well-known public figure in partitioned Poland, due to his charity work. In 1904, he became a deputy chairman of Warsaw Association of Charity, and a curator of the Ophthalmic Institute, which provided free eye exams for the poor. Since official education in Russian- controlled Congress Poland was carried out in the Russian language, Lubomirski helped with founding Polish language schools and libraries. He co-founded administrative and organizational foundations of the future Polish education system. He co-created an organization called Spojnia Narodowa (National Unity; 1905), and participated in meetings of teachers ‚Äì members of Association of National Education. World War I During World War I, the prince continued his charity activities. Among others, he was chairman of such bodies, as Committee of Support of Social Work, Polish Sanitary Help Committee, and Temporary Self-Help of Landowners. On August 3, 1914, Lubomirski became a member of Civic Committee of the City of Warsaw. Since Russian oversight of this body was almost non-existent, the Civic Committee enjoyed wide autonomy. His activities were highly praised by residents of Warsaw. In August 1915, during the Great Retreat, the armies of the German Empire entered Warsaw. Lubomirski refused to leave the city, and with permission of German authorities, he was named chairman of the Central Civil Committee. Under his leadership, a network of Polish language schools was created, and Lubomirski served as a mediator between Polish residents and German government (the Committee was later renamed into Central Welfare Council). In order to win maximum autonomy for Poland, Lubomirski cooperated with the Germans. At the same time, he tried to democratize political life of the country. On July 16, 1916, with permission of German authorities, elections for Warsaw local government took place, after which Lubomirski became the mayor of the city. On December 13, 1916, Lubomirski for the first time met with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, offering him a post in the future Polish government. On November 5, 1916, the emperors of Germany and Austria-Hungary issued the so-called Act of 5th November, in which they promised an independent Polish state (see also Kingdom of Poland (1916‚Äì18)). A year later, on September 16, 1917, the Germans created a provisional government of Poland, the Regency Council, led by Prince Lubomirski, one of its three members along with Archbishop Aleksander Kakowski, and J√≥zef Ostrowski. The Council had its first meeting at Warsaw's Royal Castle on October 27, 1917. Political life Kakowski, and Lubomirski. On October 7, 1918, on initiative of Prince Lubomirski, Polish declaration of independence was announced. Seven days later, first Polish Army soldiers pledged allegiance to the Polish flag. Lubomirski himself regarded J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski as an excellent politician and statesman, and supported Pilsudski's nomination for the post of the head of state (see Naczelnik Panstwa). On November 10, 1918, Lubomirski welcomed Pilsudski at Warsaw's Rail Station, and four days later, Pilsudski became the head of Polish state. In the early 1920s Lubomirski stayed away from political life. He decided to return to politics after the May Coup. On May 13, 1926 he talked with Pilsudski at Warsaw East Rail Station. Soon afterwards, he was among four men considered for the post of President of Poland, but refused to accept the nomination. In 1928‚Äì1935, Lubomirski was a senator of Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government, and a chairman of two Senate commissions ‚Äì foreign affairs and military. He frequently participated in different international events, such as 1929 funeral of Marshal Ferdinand Foch. In 1930, Lubomirski resigned from the Senate in protest against the Brest trials, but Prime Minister Walery Slawek did not accept the resignation. Lubomirski disliked the so-called colonels‚Äô regime, and in the late 1930s, he organized several secret meetings, in which political situation of the Second Polish Republic was discussed. The sanacja government was aware of it, and blocked Lubomirski's run for Senate election in 1938. Meanwhile, Lubomirski continued his charity activities, as member of several civic organizations. Invasion of Poland and death In September 1939, during the Siege of Warsaw, Lubomirski actively participated in the Civic Committee, headed by Stefan Starzynski. In the early months of German occupation of Poland, he worked on creating an underground government under General Juliusz R√≥mmel, in which he was to be foreign minister. It was never created, as Polish leaders decided to open the government-in-exile, first in Paris and since summer 1940, in London. Lubomirski decided to stay in occupied Poland. On November 10, 1942 he was arrested by the Gestapo, and spent two months in prison. During this time, his health deteriorated, and he never recovered. Lubomirski died on July 31, 1943 in his real estate in Ma≈Ça Wie≈õ near Gr√≥jec. He was buried in a parish church at Bielsko Du≈ºe.

Label background The label was founded in 1997, with their first single \\"Holiday on Ice / Santa Claus\\" being the first release by de Homem-Christo and his label co-owner Eric Chedeville (under the guise of Le Knight Club). Crydamoure was one of the first French house labels to incorporate band and guitar influences into its production. The label was left defunct in 2003, and shut down. The launch of Crydamoure was a chance for de Homem-Christo to embark on a sound different from Daft Punk and also a chance to bring budding new producers such as Romain S√©o (Raw Man) and Paul de Homem-Christo (Play Paul; brother of Guy-Manuel) into the limelight. In 2015, Crydamoure was revived after Le Knight Club released a single named \\"The Fight\\", made for the Algerian film \\"Gates of the Sun.\\" Le Knight Club's involvement in the revival of the label is uncertain. There has been little information provided to the general public about the label.

His four brothers, David, Kerry, Kevin and Chris, also wrestled. He was the son of longtime Texas wrestler and wrestling promoter Fritz Von Erich and a member of the Von Erich family.  Early life  Mike had five brothers: David, Kerry, Kevin, Jack and Chris. His father, longtime Texas wrestler and wrestling promoter, Fritz Von Erich, trained all his sons in professional wrestling. Several wrestlers associated with Mike, such as his brother Kevin, King Kong Bundy, \\"Gentleman\\" Chris Adams, Gary Hart and Jake Roberts, have all stated that he never wanted to be a wrestler. Instead, he wanted to work for his father's company, World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), as a cameraman. Professional wrestling career=World Class Championship Wrestling (1983 - 1987); Mike made his debut on November 24, 1983, winning a match against Skandor Akbar during \\"WCCW Wrestling Star Wars\\" at the Reunion Arena. He was then involved in several encounters with The Freebirds. Von Erich and Michael Hayes brawled on October 17, 1983, in Ft. Worth, after Hayes ripped a jacket given to Mike by his brother Kerry. Mike teamed up with his brother Kevin against Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts on December 25, 1983. The only time Mike ever teamed up with his brother David was in January 1984 when, along with Kerry, they battled the Freebirds. Mike took David's place teaming with Kerry after David's death in February 1984. WCCW tried to give Mike a feud of his own against Brian Adias in October 1986, since Kerry was out of wrestling with an ankle injury. Mike and Adias were to battle in a match at Parade of Champions on May 3, 1987, but Mike died on April 12 of that year. His final match took place at the Sportatorium on April 3, 1987, against Mike Williams. New Japan Pro- Wrestling (1987) While wrestling for World Class, Mike ventured to Japan for the first and only time in his career, to wrestle for New Japan Pro- Wrestling in January 1987, during their New Year Dash series tour. Even though he didn't wrestle for very long on that tour, Mike had a strong encounter with then IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Shiro Koshinaka, facing him on January 3, in a losing effort. He also teamed with fellow foreigners such as Tony St. Clair, Black Bart, Konga The Barbarian and The Cuban Assassin against the likes of Antonio Inoki, Tatsumi Fujinami, Osamu Kido and Yoshiaki Fujiwara. However, he also enjoyed some success in it, scoring victories against veteran Kantaro Hoshino, young lion Shunji Kosugi and korean wrestler Sumon Kim. After wrestling for 10 days in their tour, Mike returned to Texas. Personal life Mike was married on February 14, 1985, to Shani Garza. He was a born-again Christian. He underwent shoulder surgery on August 22, 1985, due to an injury suffered during a wrestling tour of Israel. He was released from the hospital but later he developed a fever of . He was later diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome. He suffered some brain damage as a result of his illness and lost a great deal of weight. In 1986, he suffered head injuries from a car accident in which his vehicle overturned after he lost control. In addition, Kevin cited an incident in which Mike attacked a streetlight in frustration over his current condition. Kevin once said that Mike also suffered from the pressure of having to \\"be David\\" after his brother's death. Since the beginning of his career, the pressure was on for Mike to succeed on the same level as his brothers. Death On April 12, 1987, Mike left a suicide note for his family, then went to Lewisville Lake, where he drank alcohol and overdosed on the sleeping aid Placidyl. A few days before his death, Mike was arrested after a DWI. His body was found four days later and buried at Grove Hill Memorial Park in Dallas.

The organization reviews books to locate factual errors and to promote a conservative Christian point of view, offering preference to textbooks which, for example, promote sexual abstinence rather than contraception and firearms safety rather than gun control. They launched the organization in 1961 from their kitchen table in tiny Hawkins in Wood County in east Texas, after having begun to review textbooks assigned to their son. Many of the books that the Gablers have given high ratings have been adopted by the Texas State Textbook Committee. If a school district wishes textbooks with other viewpoints than those approved by the state committee, it must fund such materials from its own resources.  Criticism  Progressives, teachers, professors, parents, and civil libertarians have alleged that the Gablers promoted their fundamentalist views in the textbook selection process. They have pointed out that the Gablers did not have college degrees, yet assumed the role of textbook monitors and claimed editorial authority over textbook authors. Many criticized the State Board of Education for giving the Gablers undue influence. The Texas State Board of Education wields enormous influence upon the choice of textbooks used across America, because Texas, as a large and populous state, requires many textbooks, and both publishers and smaller states can save much-needed operating costs or education funds by simply using the Texas version of a given text.  The deaths of the Gablers  Mel Gabler died of a brain hemorrhage on December 19, 2004, after falling and hitting his head two days earlier. Norma Gabler died of Parkinson's disease on July 22, 2007.

Geography Cong is situated on an island formed by a number of streams that surround it on all sides. Cong is located on the isthmus connecting Loughs Corrib and Mask, near the towns of Headford and Ballinrobe and the villages of Clonbur, the Neale and Cross. Cong is known for its underground streams that connect Lough Corrib with Lough Mask to the north. History The 1111 Synod of R√°th Breasail included Cong (Cunga F√©ichin) among the five dioceses it approved for Connacht, but in 1152 the Synod of Kells excluded it from its list and assigned what would be its territory to the archdiocese of Tuam.Michael John Brenan, An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland, Dublin 1864, pp. 120‚Äì121, 250John Healy, \\"Tuam\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1912) No longer a residential bishopric, Cunga F√©ichin is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 877 Cong was also the home of Anglo-Irish landlord Sir William Wilde, who was also a historian and father to prominent playwright, novelist, poet, and short story writer Oscar Wilde. \\"The Bard of the West\\", Miche√°l Mac Suibhne, who composed his poetry and songs in Connaught Irish, was born at Cong around the year 1760. He spent most of his life in Connemara and died in poverty in about the year 1820. The Quiet Man's cottage Cong was the filming location for John Ford's 1952 Oscar-winning film, The Quiet Man,Cong on County Mayo Site featuring John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara and Barry Fitzgerald. Much of the film was filmed on the grounds of Ashford Castle. The town and castle area remain little changed since 1952, and Cong's connection with the movie make it a tourist attraction. (The film is still celebrated by the local \\"Quiet Man Fan Club\\"). Roman Catholic records for Cong do not survive from before 1870. Church of Ireland records from the 18th and 19th centuries have survived, however, and are held at the South Mayo Family Research Centre in nearby Ballinrobe. Attractions Ashford Castle Cong is the home of Ashford Castle, a luxury hotel, which was converted from a Victorian faux lakeside castle, built by the Guinness family. Ashford Castle is a tourist attraction in its own right. Cong also features a ruined medieval abbey, Cong Abbey, where Rory O'Connor, the last High King of Ireland, spent his last years. It also is the origin of a piece of Celtic art in the form of a metal cross shrine called the Cross of Cong. The 'Cross of Cong' is now held in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin. There is a High Cross in the village. Carrownagower Bridge, Cong Canal.The Cong Canal, built over five years by the Commissioners of Public Works between 1848 and 1854 as a combined scheme to provide navigation, drainage and mill-power. In 1854 the Commissioners abandoned the navigation aspect of the scheme and instructed Samuel Roberts, their engineer, \\"to suspend the execution of all navigation works in this division of the district, and complete only such as were necessary for the regulation of the waters of Lough Mask, for drainage purposes.\\" Now it is commonly known as the \\"Dry Canal\\"; the water level can vary between zero and 3.5 meters depending on the time of year (summer dry, winter full) and is 5 km in length.

She was named for Edward J. Ballard. History Ballard (DD-267) was launched 7 December 1918 by Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Eloise Ballard, great great granddaughter of the namesake; commissioned 5 June 1919, Lieutenant Commander H. M. Collier in command, and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. Between July 1919 and July 1920 Ballard cruised to various ports in Europe and the Mediterranean. She returned to the United States in July 1920 and served for a time with the Atlantic Fleet. She then proceeded to the Pacific where she carried out type training and participated in fleet maneuvers until placed out of commission in reserve at San Diego 17 June 1922. On 25 June 1940 Ballard was placed in commission in ordinary and was towed to Union Yard of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, San Francisco, California, for conversion to an auxiliary seaplane tender (reclassified AVD-10, 2 August 1940). She was placed in full commission 2 January 1941 and reported to Aircraft, Scouting Force, Pacific Fleet. With the entrance of the United States into World War II, Ballard steamed to Pearl Harbor where she arrived 28 January 1942. Ballard performed picket duty during the Battle of Midway, and on 14 June 1942 rescued 35 Japanese seaman from the carrier Hiry≈´ who had been adrift since their ship sank on 5 June. Until November 1943 she was engaged in tending patrol planes, laying aircraft buoys, escorting convoys, and patrolling throughout the Eastern Pacific (Phoenix, Midway, Fiji, Espiritu Santo, Guadalcanal, Florida, and New Caledonia). On 20 November 1942, Ballard recovered two sailors adrift at sea in separate rafts since the sinking of on 13 November. Only 10 survivors were rescued after Juneau sank.

Next, she performed patrol duties during the seizure of the Palau Islands (12 September ‚Äì 11 December 1944). Fate In late December 1944 she began another stateside yard period, at Seattle, Washington. Upon completion of repairs, she was once again assigned to plane guard duties, operating out of San Diego until 1 October 1945. Ballard arrived at Philadelphia 26 October 1945 to commence pre-inactivation overhaul. She was decommissioned 5 December 1945 and sold 23 May 1946 and broken up for scrap.

It is part of The Entertainer (through its parent company TEAL Group Holdings). It was a Subsidiary of Mothercare until 2019. History The first shop is in London Street, Reading, Berkshire in 1972. The business was started by David John Beale. The mail order department was in the basement. John employed the services of a child psychologist to ensure that the toys and books were of a positive and educational value to children. The clever and unique concept was for parents to join as a member, new sets of educational toys/books were then sent to them regularly. If they decided to keep the items, they would pay via their account. If they returned the items, they would not be charged. It proved very successful and within a year, much larger premises in Silver Street Reading were obtained. John‚Äôs partner was an accountant named David so Beal used his middle name to avoid confusion. Early Learning Centre in Harrogate, North Yorkshire (2013) Originally set up as a mail order company in 1974 and based near Swindon, by 1980, it had ten shops, and has since grown to 215 shops in the United Kingdom, and over 80 in 19 other countries including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Australia. In addition, their toys are available in some stores of Debenhams, Boots and Sainsbury's. Since 2001, the company sells via their website. In the 1980s, ELC opened a number of \\"nursery stores\\", which sold equipment such as pushchairs and cots. Until 1991, the chain had stores in the United States; contrary to standard American English, the British spelling \\"centre\\" (spelled \\"center\\" in American English) was preserved in these. Over 80% of products sold are own brand, being designed at a research centre in Hong Kong.

This cultured milk beverage is the results of microbial action of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and a surface-growing yeast-like fungus Geotrichum candidum present in milk, which forms a velvet-like surface on viili. In addition, most traditional viili cultures also contain yeast strains such as Kluveromyces marxianus and Pichia fermentans. The lactic acid bacteria identified in viili include the acid‚Äêproducing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. l. cremoris as well as the aroma producers L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Among those mesophilic LAB strains, the slime- forming Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris produce a phosphate-containing heteropolysaccharide, named viilian. Viilian is similar to kefiran produced by kefir grains. The production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by the strain forms the consistency character of viili and it has been claimed to have various functional benefits toward the rheological properties of milk products and the health improving potential. In modern practice, pasteurized milk is used, fermentation is carried out in a dairy plant in controlled conditions using laboratory-grown cultures and the product sold fresh. Viili is widely available in Finland in grocery stores in several variants.  Other variants  Several variants of fermented milk products are found in Western Finland and Sweden, such as filmj√∂lk (\\"viili milk\\") or l√•ngfil (\\"long viili\\"), which vary in consistency and fermentation. In Norway, filmj√∂lk is usually named \\"kulturmelk\\" (\\"cultured milk\\") or \\"surmelk\\" (\\"sour milk\\"), while in Gotland and Iceland, the name \\"skyr\\" is used to refer to fermented yoghurt variants. Cream viili (Finnish: kermaviili) is made from cream instead of milk, and is used in cooking like sour cream, or with dill, chives and other spices as cold sauce for fish, or as a base for dip sauces.

First, the bowler and league (or tournament) must be in good standing with the organization. In earlier years, the bowling ball(s) used in the scoring was taken for testing (hardness, weighting, and other aspects that would otherwise break the organization's regulations). Also, the lanes used in the scoring were shut down after the last game of the day was completed. The official then used a tape reader to test the oil condition, to make sure it met the organization's regulations. The data was then sent to the certifying body, and the score received a certification decision a few days to a few weeks later. There are cases where the tests do not meet regulation, and therefore the score is not recognized by the organization. However, the score still counts towards the league or tournament statistics. Modern recognition is much easier; lanes are no longer shut down, balls are no longer taken and inspected. The lanes are inspected once a year, and the ball's make and serial number (USBC only requires that the ball have an engraved serial number, they do not need the actual number) are taken by a league/tournament official and reported to the certifying organization. Recognition In league or tournament play, a certified 300 game is usually commemorated with a ring. Subsequent league 300s are denoted by setting \\"chips\\" or precious stones into the ring, so that skilled bowlers do not have to wear several rings. The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) offers a \\"multiple\\" 300 ring for an additional fee that features the number of approved 300 games for that bowler surrounded by stones. The ring can be returned to have the number changed as the bowler rolls additional perfect games. In casual or \\"open\\" play, a 300 game is not recognized officially by any certifying, professional, or other organization, but may be honored by other means within the bowling center, such as a plaque, trophy, \\"wall of fame\\" photo, or other prize. Televised 300 games A handful of 300 games have been broadcast on live TV. Grazio Castellano of Brooklyn, New York was the first to roll a on live television. This occurred on October 4, 1953, during an Eastern All-Star league session at Newark, New Jersey.Muskatevc, Eric. \\"Amateur's payday not too shabby.\\" Article in St. Petersburg Times, June 30, 2006. (Castellano is a member of the United States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame.) A more recent example came in October 2006, when England's Paul Moor became the first man to register a score of 300 in the Weber Cup (the first 300 on live British television), the annual Europe versus America team challenge event. Australian Jason Belmonte became the first bowler to ever roll a 300 game in the televised finals of the World Tenpin Masters, defeating Moor in the 2007 event. Tommy Jones had shot a perfect game in each Weber Cup from 2007 to 2009. Shota Kawazoe has rolled back-to-back 300 games on live Japanese television. A bowler that bowls a perfect game on a televised PBA Tour event receives a $10,000 bonus, although occasionally there is a $1 million bonus for a bowler that bowls a 300 game in the finals of a televised PBA event. Through January 2020, there have been 28 televised 300 games in title events on the PBA Tour, and two more on the Senior PBA Tour. The first 300 game in a televised PBA event was rolled by Jack Biondolillo in the opening match of the 1967 Firestone Tournament of Champions finals (broadcast by ABC).\\"PBA History\\" at www.pba.com This was also the first nationally televised broadcast of a perfect game. The most recent perfect game in a U.S. telecast of a PBA Tour event was accomplished by American Jakob Butturff in the televised seeding round of the 2020 PBA Tour Finals (July 18, 2020 on CBS Sports Network). Sean Rash rolled the PBA's 23rd and 25th 300 games, and is to date the only player with multiple televised perfect games in PBA Tour stops. Mika Koivuniemi narrowly missed joining this exclusive club. Having rolled the PBA's 16th televised perfect game in 2004, Mika shot a 299 game in the semifinals of the 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions. Two other players have shot multiple 300 games on U.S. television, though one or both games were not rolled in an official PBA title event. In 2009, Wes Malott rolled two 300 games in an ESPN broadcast of the King of Bowling series. Though this event featured PBA players, it was not an official PBA Tour event.\\"Malott Records Perfect Ending to King of Bowling Series.\\" Article at www.pba.com, May 20, 2009. Ryan Shafer, who earlier in his career rolled the PBA's 18th televised 300 in a PBA Tour event, threw his second televised 300 game in a singles match at the Geico PBA Team Shootout, a made- for-TV event broadcast on ESPN, July 2, 2011.Thomas, Jason. \\"Geico PBA Team Shootout Provides Plenty of Fireworks.\\" Article at www.pba.com on July 4, 2011. PBA Hall of Famer Chris Barnes, who rolled the PBA's 22nd televised 300 game, has also rolled live perfect games on European television (2014 QubicaAMF World Cup) and Japanese television (2015 PBA-DHC Japan Invitational). Female bowlers have also achieved perfection in front of a television audience. Ritsuko Nakayama of the Japan Professional Bowling Association became the first female to score a perfect game in front of a national television audience, doing so in Japan on August 21, 1970.Ritsuko Nakayama on YouTube Michelle Feldman of the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) became the first female to score a 300 on American national television, when she accomplished the feat in a 1997 Prime Sports broadcast.Feldman, Michelle. \\"Paying the price for ill-timed perfection...The Match I'll Never Forget.\\" Bowling Digest, April, 2003. Cara Honeychurch, Liz Johnson and Dasha Kovalova have also bowled 300 games in PWBA events on American TV. Urara Himeji, Wendy Macpherson and Takiko Naganawa have rolled 300 games on Japanese national television ‚Äì all during JPBA events. Andy Varipapa 300 Andy Varipapa, a standout bowler from the 1930s and 1940s, joked about a being twelve strikes in a row spanning two games. Hence, such a result is named after the veteran bowler. Back-to-back 75-year-old Will June, grandfather of Cato June, became the oldest player to bowl consecutive perfect games on August 31, 2010. Perfect series A 900 series, a three- game set with scores adding up to 900, is a more difficult feat to achieve than bowling a single perfect game because it requires more consistency and careful attention to the subtle changes in the lane conditions from game to game.Krupka, Jim. \\"Northern Lehigh Stars Shine At Boulevard Lanes Jim Krupka Bowling.\\" Article in The Morning Call on April 14, 1989. \\"Raising Your Bowling Average - Scoring Facts and Oddities.\\" The first six 900 series reported, starting with PBA Hall of Famer Glenn Allison's in 1982, were all rejected by the USBC for various reasons - mostly due to improper lane conditions. Finally, in 1997, an officially certified 900 series was bowled by collegiate bowler Jeremey Sonnenfeld, rolled at Sun Valley Lanes in Lincoln, Nebraska. It was the first 900 series approved by the USBC. Twelve perfect series were bowled in the ten-year period 1997-2008, and six were bowled in the two years 2009-2010. As of July 20, 2020, the USBC lists a total of 37 officially certified 900 series by 36 different bowlers, with Robert Mushtare the only person to roll more than one. In fiction The concept of a perfect bowling game has been regularly used in fiction for either suspenseful or comedic effect. * In a season 4 episode of Married... with Children, \\"Peggy Turns 300,\\" Peggy bowls a perfect game immediately after Al breaks the record at their local alley. * In one episode of Camp Lazlo, Scout Master Lumpus builds his own personal bowling lane and attempts to bowl a perfect game, but as usual, Lazlo and his friends Raj and Clam come along and foil it, in curiosity of what he's doing. * In one episode of The Flintstones, an invisible Barney helps Fred bowl a \\"perfect game\\" by knocking/kicking aside all the pins whenever Fred bowls the ball. * In the episode \\"Bowling\\" of Malcolm in the Middle, Hal almost bowls a perfect game, but Malcolm accidentally gets caught in the pinsetter and is dropped onto the pins on the 12th roll. Although the computer claims that Hal bowled a perfect game (since Malcolm did knock all the pins over), the game is dismissed by the gathered crowd. * In an episode of Hill Street Blues, the roll call sergeant had bowled a 300 game. After the bowling alley burned down, the sergeant was an arson suspect because his 300 was not league certified. * In the 1998 movie The Big Lebowski, the character of Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) is seen wearing three perfect game rings. * In The Simpsons episode \\"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\\", Homer bowls a perfect game in a parody of The Natural. Later, the baby Maggie also apparently bowls one. * An episode of The Andy Griffith Show titled \\"Howard the Bowler\\" features a bowling match between Mayberry and neighboring Mt. Pilot. Howard is one strike away from a perfect game, only to have the lights go out due to a power overload. He has a day to think about it before he tries for the final strike. They make bets on him bowling a perfect game, and when he returns he gets two practice frames before making his final attempt. Both are gutter balls, so Andy gets the guys to relinquish the bets. With the pressure relieved, Howard makes the final strike for a perfect game. * In a similar 2001 episode of the series According to Jim, Jim (James Belushi) bowls the first 11 strikes of a game when the power goes out at the bowling center. It is the day before Thanksgiving, and the proprietor tells Jim he cannot get credit for a (nor a photo on the center's \\"wall of fame\\") if he leaves and returns. Jim spends the night, and his wife, Cheryl (Courtney Thorne-Smith), surprises him by bringing Thanksgiving dinner to the bowling center while he waits for the power to return. Cheryl and Jim's family light the lane by placing candles in the gutters, and Jim rolls the final strike to complete the 300 game. * In the episode \\"Bowling for Votes\\" of the series Parks and Recreation, Ron Swanson bowls a perfect game by rolling the ball with two hands from between his legs. * In the episode \\"Blind Ambition\\" of the series Family Guy, where Peter becomes jealous of his friends' achievements, Mort Goldman bowls a perfect game despite rolling the ball so slowly it takes several seconds to reach the pins. * In an episode \\"Lawmen\\" of the series Lethal Weapon, Roger (Damon Wayans) has his photo on the \\"wall of fame\\" in a local bowling center for a 300 game (which he admits was only a 290), but was pushed to roll a perfect game to prove it.

A refinement of the formula introduced on the band's debut album Dinosaur, You're Living All Over Me features drawling vocals paired with loud guitars and driving rhythms. The album was well-reviewed upon release, and is now regarded as a high point of American rock in the 1980s.  Background  The album's title was long rumored to have been a phrase uttered by singer/guitarist J Mascis in frustration at the cramped conditions of a lengthy tour. However, Mascis has denied this story. \\"Poledo\\" is different from the rest of the album in that the first half is a low-fidelity recording of Lou Barlow singing and playing ukulele, much like he did with his own group Sebadoh, while the second half is a collection of sound collages and abstract noise pieces. In 2005, the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.  Release  The album was originally issued when the band was still known as Dinosaur, before a lawsuit forced the name change to Dinosaur Jr. The album was recalled by SST a few months after release, and new copies were printed crediting the band as Dinosaur Jr. The band made a music video for the song \\"Little Fury Things\\", which was directed by Jim Spring and Jens Jurgensen.  Legacy  The album is considered a classic of indie and alternative rock. In 2005, it was ranked number 31 in Spins list of the 100 greatest albums from 1985 through to 2005. Pitchfork Media placed the album at number 40 on its Top 100 Albums of the 1980s list.http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5882-top-100-albums-of- the-1980s/ Alternative Press ranked it number 5 on its Top 99 Albums of '85 to '95 list. Beats per Minute ranked it number 17 on its Top 100 Albums of the 1980s list. Acclaimed Music ranked it as the 429th-most acclaimed album of all time. In 2011, Nick Attfield wrote a book about the album as part of Continuum's 33‚Öì series.Attfield, Nick, Dinosaur Jr's You're Living All Over Me. Continuum: 33 1/3 no. 82. . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. The album has also proven to be greatly influential, especially on the shoegazing genre. Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine has named the album, among others, as an influence for his band's seminal You Made Me Realise EP; the two bands would eventually tour together. Several sources recognize the album's influence on Nirvana.

She used the names Kimona Wanaleya in ECW and Leia Meow in WCW. Professional wrestling career=Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996) Laum was asked by her friend Raven to go into professional wrestling while she was working as a go-go dancer at a club. She made her debut in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) on January 27, 1996 as Raven's new valet under the name Kimona Wanalaya (a play-on-words for \\"Come on, I wanna lay ya\\") and she managed Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the same night. According to the storyline, Raven used her to replace Beulah McGillicutty, his former girlfriend and valet, who had announced that she was pregnant with Tommy Dreamer's child on January 7 at ECW's House Party event. Wanalaya left Raven at Massacre on Queens Boulevard on April 13 after he slapped her for remonstrating with him, causing her to vow revenge. On April 20, 1996 at Hostile City Showdown, Shane Douglas, with Kimona by his side, called out Dreamer to inform him that Beulah had been cheating on him. While Dreamer was wondering who the person could be, in which Douglas replied ‚Äúit's not a he‚Äù, Kimona snatched the microphone from Douglas's hand and shouted \\"It's me!\\" Moments later, Beulah made her way to the ring and she and Kimona shared a racy kiss and fell to the mat together before Dreamer decided to date both women. The segment is widely believed to be the first lesbian angle in a major wrestling promotion. A career highlight came when she danced atop the ECW Arena, a moment that was used to sell VHS copies of Extreme Warfare Vol. 2 until the promotion died. Jersey All Pro Wrestling Laum later left ECW and worked for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) for a while as Kimona. While in JAPW, she wrestled Missy Hyatt in a series of mixed tag team matches and a steel cage match. World Championship Wrestling (1999-2001) She was signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1999, and she eventually debuted alongside The Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner) as the cheerleader, Leia Meow. This angle soon ended and she became the manager for The Jung Dragons (Jamie-San, Yun Yang, and Kaz Hayashi), thus turning heel. She would interfere in matches with a flying bodypress off of the top rope onto their opponents. She also had a dominatrix gimmick and carried a riding crop. She used it to attack Pamela Paulshock after Paulshock had won the \\"Miss WCW\\" contest that Meow participated in on September 25, 2000. She was then attacked by Midajah and had a brief rivalry with her leading to a fight on the following Thunder during Mike Awesome's Lava Lamp Lounge segment. She also had a short feud with Tygress and threatened to cut her hair off. By the time WCW was sold to Vince McMahon, she had been fired from WCW along with the majority of the other on-air female talent due to roster cuts. Independent circuit She went to the X Wrestling Federation (XWF) where she was known as Kris, a member of the X-Girls, a dance team that included Gorgeous George and Chiquita Anderson of the Nitro Girls.

The series was conceived by Steven Churchill in 1990. It was produced, directed, conceptualized and edited by Jan Nickman of Miramar Productions and produced by Steven Churchill of Odyssey Productions. The first three products in the series were released on VHS (by BMG) and LaserDisc (by Image EntertainmentBusiness Wire. \\"Image Entertainment Signs Exclusive Agreement With Odyssey Productions for DVD and VHS Release of State- of-the-Art Computer Animation Programs\\". Aug 18, 1999.) and also released on DVD (by Simitar Entertainment). The fourth program in the series was released and distributed by Sony Music on DVD. Overview The typical entry in the Mind's Eye series is a short package film, usually 50 to 60 minutes long, with an electronic music soundtrack over a series of music video-like sequences. The original film, titled The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey by director and co-producer Jan Nickman and co-producer Steven Churchill, consisted of a non-rigid structure of many semi-related sequences. The general style which characterizes the series is light and cartoony due to the difficulty of rendering more complicated images using the computers of the day. The computer animation sequences that appeared in the films were generally not produced specifically for the Mind's Eye series but rather were work originally created for other purposes, including demo reels, commercials, music videos, and feature films. Director and co-producer Jan Nickman then assembled these sequences into a narrative through creative editing, which resulted in a double platinum selling film considered to be a milestone in the field of computer animation. As a result, \\"The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey\\" reached #12 on Billboard's video hits chart. This approach gave Churchill access to the best-quality computer graphics of the time without having to bear their substantial production costs. The soundtracks for the films were composed by James Reynolds, Thomas Dolby, Jan Hammer and Kerry Livgren (founder and guitarist for Kansas).Fitzpatrick, Eileen. Computer Animation Reaches a Growing Niche. Billboard. Pg. 70. 18 October 1997. Films The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey (Miramar Images, Inc.) was the first effort by director and co-producer Jan Nickman which served as a demonstration of computer animation when the art-form was still in its relative infancy. It is composed of a sequence of segments ambitiously chronicling the formation of Earth (\\"Creation\\"), the rise of human civilizations (\\"Civilization Rising\\"), and the technological advances of humanity from the advent of agriculture to the future exploration of the cosmos. The video speculatively concludes with a segment of what might be the next sentient species to arise on Earth, as well as the CGI short Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice. The soundtrack was composed by James Reynolds. The sales of this video were RIAA certified as \\"Multi-Platinum\\" and reached as high as #12 on Billboard's video sales chart. Release Date: September 25, 1990 Beyond the Mind's Eye (Miramar Images, Inc.) featured the efforts of Jan Hammer and included the first vocal tracks in such segments as Too Far and Seeds of Life, a sequence themed around planet-colonizing seeds featuring the noted Panspermia by computer graphics artist Karl Sims. The DVD version included both the vocal version of Seeds of Life (sung by Chris Thompson) that blended the animation segment and footage of Hammer and his \\"band\\" performing (composed of four Jan Hammers), with an instrumental version of the same track. Beyond the Mind's Eye also features some CGI sequences from The Lawnmower Man. The DVD contains 11 segments. The sales of this video were RIAA certified as \\"Multi-Platinum\\" and reached as high as #8 on Billboard's video sales chart. Release Date: December 23, 1992 The Gate to the Mind's Eye (Miramar Images, Inc.) continued the trend of vocal tracks, along with music by Thomas Dolby. Five of its nine segments include vocal tracks: Armageddon, a sequence depicting massive devastation; Neo, an astronomy-themed song; Valley of the Mind's Eye, a song about the progress of human technology; Nuvogue, the first jazz track in the series; Quantum Mechanic starring guest vocalist Dr. Fiorella Terenzi. The Gate to the Mind's Eye also featured the animations Delirium Tremendus, God and the Quantum and Synchronicity produced and conceptualized by visionary artist Beny Tchaicovsky. Release Date: June 30, 1994 Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye (Odyssey Productions) features a soundtrack by Kerry Livgren and two more vocal tracks, One Dark World (sung by Darren Rogers) and Aspen Moon (sung by Livgren's nephew Jacob).Pell City, AL Library entry Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye features versions of CGI sequences from Johnny Mnemonic, Ecco: The Tides of Time and also features CGI sequences from '\\"Cyberscape\\" a 45 minutes computer animation vision produced and copyrighted by visionary artist Beny Tchaicovsky, released on VHS and DVD by Sony Music in 1997. Release Date: July 12, 1996 Spin-off titles and others Concurrently with the release of the Mind's Eye series, Churchill also released a series of titles such as Virtual Nature: A Computer Generated Visual Odyssey From the Makers of the Mind's Eye (Odyssey Visual Design, 1993) that obliquely referenced the series. This sister-series of videos continued after the release of Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye with the final three titles: The Mind's Eye Presents Luminous Visions (Odyssey Productions, April 24, 1998) and The Mind's Eye Presents Ancient Alien (Odyssey Productions, July 10, 1998), and The Mind's Eye Presents Little Bytes (Odyssey Productions, July 25, 2000). Other Anthology films released by Churchill such as Imaginaria (Odyssey Visual Design, December 21, 1993), and Turbulence (Odyssey Productions, March 16, 1996) did not include the term \\"The Mind's Eye\\" as part of their titles and are thus not considered to be a part of the series. Churchill's most recent releases have been members of the 8-member Computer Animation series which ran from 1996 to 2000 with Computer Animation Festival Volume 1.0 (Odyssey Visual Design, November 5, 1993), Computer Animation Festival Volume 2.0 (Odyssey Visual Design, September 2, 1994), and Computer Animation Festival Volume 3.0 (Odyssey Productions, July 12, 1996) forming the main series. The subsequent three Computer Animation titles again included oblique references to Mind's Eye and are entitled The Mind's Eye Presents Computer Animation Classics (Odyssey Productions, May 6, 1997), The Mind's Eye Presents Computer Animation Showcase (Odyssey Productions, August 29, 1997), and The Mind's Eye Presents Computer Animation Celebration (Odyssey Productions, May 1, 1998). The last two members in the series are Computer Animation Marvels (Odyssey Productions, July 23, 1999) and Computer Animation Extravaganza (Odyssey Productions, August 18, 2000).Chen, Chun-Wei.

Roger Ebert selected it as his \\"Video Pick of the Week\\" on the week of December 23, 1992 on Siskel & Ebert. Several excerpts from The Mind's Eye were seen in the 1992 Sci-fi Horror film The Lawnmower Man, which itself was featured in Beyond the Mind's Eye. The Mind's Eye and Beyond the Mind's Eye were both integral components in YTV's Short Circutz segments that aired between programs in the 1990s. Canadian independent television station NTV airs excerpts from the first three of The Mind's Eye videos among their \\"Computer Animated Art Festivals\\" that run overnight on Fridays. Pantera covered the song \\"Planet Caravan\\", originally by Black Sabbath, on their 1994 album Far Beyond Driven. The music video for this song features scenes from \\"Beyond the Mind's Eye\\".

The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. For this purpose, phasers usually include a low-frequency oscillator. Phasers are often used to give a \\"synthesized\\" or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech. The voice of C-3PO from Star Wars was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser. Process Spectrogram of an 8-stage phaser modulated by a sine LFO applied to white noise. The electronic phasing effect is created by splitting an audio signal into two paths. One path treats the signal with an all-pass filter, which preserves the amplitude of the original signal and alters the phase. The amount of change in phase depends on the frequency. When signals from the two paths are mixed, the frequencies that are out of phase will cancel each other out, creating the phaser's characteristic notches. Changing the mix ratio changes the depth of the notches; the deepest notches occur when the mix ratio is 50%. The definition of phaser typically excludes such devices where the all-pass section is a delay line; such a device is called a flanger. Using a delay line creates an unlimited series of equally spaced notches and peaks. It is possible to cascade a delay line with another type of all-pass filter. This combines the unlimited number of notches from the flanger with the uneven spacing of the phaser. Structure Traditional electronic phasers use a series of variable all-pass phase-shift networks which alter the phases of the different frequency components in the signal. These networks pass all frequencies at equal volume, introducing only phase change to the signal. Human ears are not very responsive to phase differences, but this creates audible interferences when mixed back with the dry (unprocessed) signal, creating notches. The simplified structure of a mono phaser is shown below: center The number of all-pass filters (usually called stages) varies with different models, some analog phasers offer 4, 6, 8 or 12 stages. Digital phasers may offer up to 32 or even more. This determines the number of notches/peaks in the sound, affecting the general sound character. A phaser with n stages generally has n/2 notches in the spectrum, so a 4-stage phaser will have two notches. Additionally, the output can be fed back to the input for a more intense effect, creating a resonant effect by emphasizing frequencies between notches. This involves feeding the output of the all-pass filter chain back to the input, as shown here: center Measured frequency response of an 8-stage phaser with no feedback, dry/wet ratio: 50/50% Measured frequency response of an 8-stage phaser with 50% feedback, dry/wet ratio: 50/50% The frequency response of an 8-stage phaser with or without feedback is shown. Note that the peaks between the notches are sharper when there's feedback, giving a distinct sound. A stereo phaser is usually two identical phasers modulated by a quadrature signal; the output of the oscillators for the left and right channels are a quarter-wave out of phase. Most modern phasers are a part of a digital signal processor, often emulating analog phasers. Phasers are mostly found as plugins for sound editing software, as a part of a monolithic rackmount sound effect unit, or as \\"stompbox\\" guitar effects. pedal on electric guitar (Maxon PT999 Phase Tone) Usage Phasing is a popular effect for electric guitar. The term was often used to refer to the original tape flanging effect heard on many psychedelic records of the late 1960s, notably \\"Itchycoo Park\\" (1967) by the Small Faces. In 1968, Shin-ei's Uni-Vibe effects pedal, designed by audio engineer Fumio Mieda, incorporated phase shift and chorus effects, soon becoming favorite effects of guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Robin Trower. By the early 1970s, phasing was available as a portable guitar effect, the first being the Maestro Phase Shifter PS-1 designed by Tom Oberheim. Unlike other phase shifters to follow, the Maestro PS-1 had three buttons to control the rate of speed: slow, medium, and fast speed. Notable users of the Maestro Phase Shifter were John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, Alex Lifeson of Rush, and Ernie Isley of The Isley Brothers. Another notable early example was the MXR Phase 90 which featured a control knob for speed control. From 1974, Steve Hackett in the Selling England by the Pound (1973) studio album and tour used the MXR Phase 90 for his Les Pauls, and from The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (1974) album and tour used the phase filter section in his Electronic Music Studios Synthi Hi-Fli. In the late 1970s, Brian May used large amounts of phasing, in such songs as \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\". In the late 1970s and 1980s, Eddie Van Halen often used the MXR Phase 90 as part of his signal chain, for example in the instrumental \\"Eruption\\" and on the song \\"Atomic Punk\\". Keyboard players also used phasing: in the 1970s, keyboard instruments like the Fender Rhodes electric piano, the Eminent 310 electronic organ, and the Clavinet were commonly treated with a phaser, especially in avant-garde jazz. Bill Evans, for instance, used a Maestro phaser on Intuition (1974). The phaser is also used to \\"sweeten\\" their sounds. Examples can be heard in Billy Joel's \\"Just The Way You Are\\", Styx's \\"Babe\\", and Jean Michel Jarre's Oxyg√®ne (1976) on which he used an EHX Small Stone phaser extensively. Tony Banks (Genesis) used an MXR Phase 100 on his RMI 368x Electra piano from 1974 (later he inserted this effect, as well as the fuzzbox, into the Electra's panel); from late 1977 he also used the phaser (along with a Boss CE-1) on his Hammond organ to replace the Leslie's rotating effect. Daft Punk helped to re-popularize the effect in the 21st century, utilizing it on a number of tracks on their Discovery album in 2001. Richard Tee also used a phase shifter hooked up to his Fender Rhodes. In motion picture or television production, the effect created by a phaser is often used to imply that the sound is synthetically generated, like turning a natural human voice into a computer or robot voice. The technique works because the frequency filtering produces sound commonly associated with mechanical sources, which only generate specific frequencies, rather than natural sources, which produce a range of frequencies. A vocoder is a different effect used for similar purposes. Similar effects A specific type of phasing, flanging is a similar effect, in which the notches are linearly spaced. In a flanger effect, the notches are created by mixing the signal with a delayed version of itself. Flangers tend to sound more pronounced and natural, like the \\"jet plane whoosh\\" effect, whereas phasers tend to sound more subtle and otherworldly. For comparison of the two effects, check .

The highway follows the shore of Lake Michigan and the Little Traverse Bay, with its southern terminus at US Highway 31 (US 31) near Bay View, about four miles (6.4 km) east of Petoskey; the northern terminus is at a junction with county roads C-66 and C-77 in Cross Village. North of Harbor Springs, the highway is known as the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route. This section of highway lacks a centerline and is known for its scenic beauty. On an average day, between 2,000 and 15,000 vehicles use various parts of the highway. The first highway along the route of the modern M-119 was a section of the original M-13 designated by July 1, 1919. This highway was later redesignated M-131 in late 1926, a designation it held until 1979. During this timeframe, another highway bore the M-119 moniker in the southern part of the state near Paw Paw from the 1930s until the early 1970s. In between 1926 and 1979, M-131 was extended and truncated on both its northern and southern ends at various times. Since the M-119 designation was applied to the current highway, no changes have been made to the routing. Route description M-119 starts at an intersection with US 31 about four miles (6.4 km) northeast of Petoskey near the community of Bay View in Bear Creek Township. The highway runs north between Petoskey State Park on the west and Round Lake on the east as it rounds the east end of Little Traverse Bay. The trunkline passes the eastern and northern edges of the Harbor Springs Municipal Airport as it turns westward near the junction with C-81 (Pleasantview Road). Through this area, M-119 runs through the community of Wequetonsing and forests just inland from the bay's northern shore. As it passes into the city limits of Harbor Springs, the highway follows Main Street into downtown. It turns north and then westward along State Street in the middle of town, intersecting the southern end of C-77 in the central business district. M-119 continues westward, passing through a residential area on Bluff Drive as it leaves the city. From Harbor Springs on, M-119 is the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route, one of the Pure Michigan Byways in the state. Bluff Drive becomes Lake Shore Drive near the Harbor Point Golf Course, and M-119 turns northward to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline at the mouth of Little Traverse Bay. The roadway meanders through oaks, maples, birch and cedars along an old Ottawa trail. The writers at National Geographic said that \\"only sometimes can you catch glimmers of Lake Michigan through the trees, but the dense foliage lends beauty to the winding road\\". Along this area of the routing, the highway narrows in width and continues through the forest without a centerline most of the remainder of the way. As the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) states on their website, \\"M-119 is not a road for those in a hurry.\\" The roadway is known as the Tunnel of Trees because, \\"the foliage from trees on either side of the road meets high over the middle of road where it forms a canopy so soft that it lets daylight trickle through in small amounts only.\\" The trunkline continues through the community of Good Hart up the Lake Michigan shoreline to the community of Cross Village. M-119, and state maintenance, end at the intersection between Lake Shore Drive and C-66/C-77 (State Road) in the middle of town. As part of the state's maintenance of M-119, MDOT tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-119 were the 14,647 vehicles daily near the southern terminus, on average; the lowest counts were the 2,036 vehicles per day at the northern terminus. None of M-119 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The Discovery Channel named the roadway as one of the \\"Top 10 Motorcycle Rides in North America\\". History=Previous designation The first incarnation of the M-119 designation ran from an intersection south of US 12 in Paw Paw south to Lawton in Van Buren County. By the middle of 1936, it had been extended farther south to US 112 near Mottville. In 1971, all of M-119 was redesignated as M-40. Current designation The current highway was designated in 1979, replacing the former route of M-131; the routing has remained unchanged since. This section of highway had been part of M-13 on July 1, 1919, when the state trunkline highway system debuted. Later on November 11, 1926, M-13 south of Fife Lake was redesignated as part of US 131, and the remainder of M-13 was designated as M-131. Until 1933, M-131 had terminated in Harbor Springs; the highway was extended to the north along Little Traverse Bay and the Lake Michigan shoreline through the community of Good Hart before terminating in Cross Village. This section of highway would be stripped of its designation in 1937 and truncated back to Harbor Springs. In late 1938 or early 1939, the State Highway Department extended US 131 along the M-131 corridor to Petoskey. This allowed US 131 to finally connect to its parent, US 31 for the first time since their inception in 1926. The MSHD re-extended M-131 back to Cross Village in 1945. The highway remained as such until 1967 when a slight realignment was made in Emmet County along the lakeshore where M-131 was routed on to its final alignment. The southern end was moved in 1969 out of Petoskey so that M-131 would no longer run concurrently with US 31 to connect with US 131.

Ghert-Zand, Renee (March 2, 2012).\\"How 'Eichlers' Brought Design to Suburbia - Jewish Builder Transformed American Ideal of Modern Homes\\". Jewish Daily Forward. Eichler Homes Between 1949 and 1966, Joseph Eichler's company, Eichler Homes, built over 11,000 homes in nine communities in Northern California and homes in three communities in Southern California. Later, other firms worked with Eichler's company to build similar houses. Together, they all came to be known as Eichlers. During this period, Eichler became one of the nation's most influential builders of modern homes. The largest contiguous Eichler Homes development is \\"The Highlands\\" in San Mateo, built between 1956 and 1964. Foster Residence, Granada Hills Joseph Eichler is considered by some to be a social visionary and commissioned designs primarily for middle-class Americans. One of his stated aims was to construct inclusive and diverse planned communities, ideally featuring integrated parks and community centers. Eichler established a non-discrimination policy and offered homes for sale to anyone of any religion or race. In 1958, he resigned from the National Association of Home Builders when they refused to support a non-discrimination policy. Design According to his son, Eichler was inspired by a short period of time when the family lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äìdesigned home in Hillsborough. Eichler was attracted to the style and decided to try to produce similar designs. Joseph Eichler used well-known architects to design both the site plans and the homes themselves. He hired the respected architect and Wright disciple of sorts Robert Anshen of Anshen & Allen to design the initial Eichlers, and the first prototypes were built in 1949. In later years, Eichler built homes that were designed by other architects including by the San Francisco firm Claude Oakland & Associates and the Los Angeles firms of Jones & Emmons, A. Quincy Jones, and Raphael Soriano. Eichler homes are examples of Modernist architecture that has come to be known as \\"California Modern\\", and typically feature glass walls, post-and-beam construction, and open floorplans in a style indebted to Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Eichler home exteriors featured flat and/or low-sloping A-framed roofs, vertical 2-inch pattern wood siding, and spartan facades with clean geometric lines. One of Eichler's signature concepts was to \\"bring the outside in\\", achieved via skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows with glass transoms looking out on protected and private outdoor rooms, patios, atriums, gardens, and swimming pools. Also of note is that most Eichler homes feature few, if any, front- facing (i.e., street-facing) windows; instead house fronts have either small, ceiling-level windows or small, rectangular windows with frosted glass. Many other architectural designs have large windows on all front-facing rooms. The interiors had numerous unorthodox and innovative features for the time period including: exposed post-and-beam construction; tongue and groove decking for the ceilings following the roofline; concrete slab floors with integral radiant heating; lauan (Philippine mahogany) paneling; sliding doors for rooms, closets, and cabinets; and typically a second bathroom located in the master bedroom. Later models introduced the distinctive Eichler entry atriums, an open-air, enclosed entrance foyer designed to further advance the concept of integrating outdoor and indoor spaces. Eichler homes were airy and modern in comparison to most of the mass-produced, middle-class, postwar homes built in the 1950s. At first, potential home buyers, many of whom were war-weary ex- servicemen and women seeking convention rather than innovation, were resistant to the innovative homes. Projects The Northern California Eichler Homes are predominantly in San Francisco, Marin County, Sacramento, the East Bay towns of Walnut Creek, Concord, Oakland, Castro Valley, and the San Francisco Peninsula towns of San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Mountain View and San Jose. The Southern California Eichler Homes developments are in Thousand Oaks, Granada Hills, Orange and Palm Springs.

There are also three Eichlers built as the first houses of an aborted tract in the mid-1960s in Chestnut Ridge, New York. As a result of soaring land prices in the mid-1960s urban redevelopment projects became popular, and Eichler began building low- and high-rise projects in San Francisco's Western Addition and Visitacion Valley, San Francisco districts, a luxury high-rise, the The Summit (a.k.a. the Eichler Summit) on Russian Hill and row houses on Diamond Heights. He also developed the suburban and trendsetting co-op communities Pomeroy Green and Pomeroy West in Santa Clara. These large projects began to overextend the company, and by the mid-1960s, Eichler Homes was in financial distress. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1967.

It is the second-highest mountain, and the highest volcano, on the planet Venus. It rises above the mean planetary radius at , and nearly 5 km above the surrounding plains. It is named after the Egyptian goddess of truth and justice, Ma'at. Structure Maat Mons has a large summit caldera, 28√ó31 km in size. Within the large caldera there are at least five smaller collapse craters, up to 10 km in diameter. A chain of small craters 3‚Äì5 km in diameter extends some 40 km along the southeast flank of the volcano, but rather than indicating a large fissure eruption, they seem to also be formed by collapse: full resolution imagery from the Magellan probe reveals no evidence of lava flows from these craters. At least two large scale structural collapse events seem to have occurred in the past on Maat Mons. Activity Radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. Intriguingly for planetary geologists, atmospheric studies carried out by the Pioneer Venus probes in the early 1980s revealed a considerable variation in the concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methane (CH4) in Venus' middle and upper atmosphere. One possible explanation for this was the injection of volcanic gases into the atmosphere by plinian eruptions at Maat Mons. More recent studies have suggested that the volcano structure, distribution of lava flows, pit craters, summit morphology, and other small-scale features are indicative of recent volcanic activity on Maat Mons. Although many lines of evidence suggest that Venus is likely to be volcanically active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed.

The novel was originally released under his real name, Kenneth Millar, by Alfred A. Knopf, while a condensed version was serialized in the August and September 1950 issues of Esquire.It's All One Case, 2016, p.16 In 1986 it was considerably adapted to film. Background Macdonald later described his third novel, Blue City, as \\"a tough thriller in the Spillane tradition\\", although The Chicago Sun noted that he was in a different league from Mickey Spillane. Publicity for the novel linked the author's name with James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, a comparison deprecated in the mixed reviews that the book received at the time.Nolan, 2015 Macdonald himself later said in an interview that Hammett was a particularly strong influence on the novel; \\"I imagine I might never have written hard-boiled detective stories at all if it hadn't been for Hammett\\".It's All One Case, 2016, p.14 Others have commented on the likeness between Macdonald's 'Blue City' and the 'Poisonville' of Hammett's Red Harvest.John Leonard, \\"Ross Macdonald, his Lew Archer and other secret selves\\", New York Times archives, 01 June 1969 The portrayal of the novel's unnamed Mid-Western small town, lying in the shadow of Chicago, is centered mostly on the disadvantaged who live in it and differs from the up- market Californian scenarios of the Lew Archer novels that Macdonald was yet to write.Brian Greene, ‚ÄúLost Classics of Noir: Blue City‚Äù, February 13, 2013 In a 1952 letter to his publisher, he explained that he had in mind \\"a town where I had suffered, and several of the characters were based on people I hated.\\" It is from this that the book's anger and political stance derive.Quoted by Jason Dean in ‚ÄúGreat 'Forgotten' Thrillers, Blue City, September 6, 2013 The protagonist is narrator throughout, but will occasionally diverge from talking tough into what Macdonald's biographer describes as \\"civics lectures\\" or he overdoes literary reference.Nolan 2015 The particular target of his anger is small-town pettifoggery. The self- congratulatory tabloid editorial justifying anti-union violence or the list of books suppressed in the library from which \\"it was somehow comforting to know that the good people of the town ‚Ä¶ were protected against the lubricity of Rabelais, the immorality of Flaubert, the viciousness of Hemingway, and the degradation of Faulkner.\\" Reviewing the book, Nelson Algren praised the over- all clipped descriptive style: \\"Kenneth Millar never uses two words when one will do; and when he wants you to see a thing, you see it.\\" A later commentator looked beyond thriller conventions and discovered that \\"Millar wanted to do in prose what jazzmen did in music\\".Nolan 2015 Here he was only following Macdonald himself, who had said in an earlier interview that \\"the imagery and rhythm and movements of jazz had a lot to do with forming my style in my early books. It's quite obvious in a book like Blue City.\\" He also noted then that Jack Kerouac's \\"jazz-prose\\" was written later and more diffusely. There was no direct influence.It's All One Case, pp.22, 24  Plot  Twenty- two-year-old John Weather has returned from the army, having served in the European Theater in the Second World War, only to find his estranged father had been shot two years previously. John had known his father as a prominent businessman and politician and now learns that he was a leading factor in the corruption of the town. Everyone seems more than happy to let his murder remain unsolved and, as John tries to uncover the murderer, he finds himself up against and manhandled by thugs in the pay of Roger Kerch. Kerch is a blackmailer who has taken over his father's slot machine franchise and seems to have a hold over his step-mother, Floraine, whom his father had married while John was young and living away from home. Finally, with the help of Carla, a hostess at the Cathay Club, John gets ahead of those trying to prevent him uncovering the truth. After Kerch has killed his step-mother (who turns out to be Kerch's bigamous wife), and John is in line to inherit his father's assets, he gains the co-operation of Ralph Hanson, the police inspector in charge of the case, and Freeman Allister, the ineffectual reformist mayor. Kerch and his surviving associates are jailed, while Allister, the real murderer of John's father, is shot by his mistress.

Ackomokki/Old Swan (I) The first Ackomokki (d. January 1795) was known as a peacemaker who was open to trade with Europeans. By the time Ackomokki was chief, the Blackfoot/Plains Confederacy had consolidated power throughout he plains of what is modern-day Montana, Alberta, and western Saskatchewan. Ackomokki/Old Swan (II)/Feathers Ackomokki's son was known to fur traders as \\"Feathers\\" (or \\"Painted Feathers\\"). After his father's death he adopted the name Ackomokki, although Europeans continued to call him \\"Feathers\\" or \\"Many Swans\\" to distinguish him from his father. The younger Ackomokki (d. 1814), like his father, worked to preserve peace among his people and the neighboring Cree and Assiniboine peoples, as well as with European traders. In 1800, Ackomokki allowed the Hudson's Bay Company to establish the Chesterfield House trading post within the Blackfoot's wintering grounds at the confluence of the Red Deer and South Saskatchewan Rivers. However, changes in the balance of power between the Blackfoot and neighboring tribes brought on in part by westward expansion of U.S. traders lead to increasing conflicts and military decline for the Siksika. Around 1801, the younger Ackomokki drew for Hudson Bay Company surveyor Peter Fidler a detailed map of the lands around the Upper Missouri, including names of rivers, mountains, and peaks and travel time between them and information about 32 tribes populating the region. These drawings were later incorporated into the 1802 edition of Aaron Arrowsmith's map of the Interior Parts of North America. Ackomokki's maps included significant details about the topography and inhabitants of the area, which proved helpful in expanding the Hudson's Bay Company activities in the region. Ackomokki/Old Swan (III) A third Old Swan (d. 1859/1860), possibly a son or nephew of the younger Ackomokki, assumed leadership of what was called by Europeans \\"Old Feathers' Band\\" by 1822. He was described in 1858 by Dr. James Hector as one of the principal chiefs of the Blackfoot Confederacy, and, in July 1859, the Palliser Expedition were guests at his encampment on the Red Deer River.

He is one of the first openly LGBT Italian politicians and the first openly LGBT heads of a regional government in Italy. Early life Born in Terlizzi, in the province of Bari, on 26 August 1958, Vendola was a member of the Italian Communist Youth Federation from the age of fourteen. He went on to study literature at his university, presenting a dissertation on the poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini. Vendola became a journalist for l'Unit√†. He came out as gay in 1978, and became an activist and a leading member of the Italian gay organisation Arcigay. A member of the National Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, he fiercely opposed the dissolution of the party proposed by Achille Occhetto in 1991. This led to the formation of the Democratic Party of the Left. Vendola instead joined the Communist Refoundation Party. Political career=Member of Parliament SEL meeting. In 1992, Vendola was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, to a seat which he held until 2005. As a member of the Antimafia Commission, he came to prominence as a strong opponent of the Mafia and organised crime. Nichi Vendola participates at the Padua Pride 2002 with Imma Battaglia and Marco Cappato In 2005, Vendola ran for the first primary election ever held in Italy, held by the centre-left coalition The Union to choose their candidate for the presidency of the Apulia region. He won the primary over the rival Francesco Boccia. Many moderates in the alliance criticised the choice, since it appeared impossible that a communist homosexual could be elected president of a southern Italian region such as Apulia, generally considered to be conservative and strongly Catholic. Vendola identifies as a \\"believer\\" (in the line of Pax Christi): he once said that \\"the most important book for a communist like me is the Bible\\". President of Apulia In the regional election in Apulia, held in April 2005, he narrowly defeated the incumbent president Raffaele Fitto, candidate for the centre-right coalition the House of Freedoms. He was the first member of the Communist Refoundation Party to be elected as president of any Italian region. In the July 2008 party congress, Vendola was one of the two major candidates running for the place of Chairman of the Communist Refoundation party; he lost to an alliance led by the other major candidate, Paolo Ferrero, formerly Minister for Social Solidarity in the Prodi II Cabinet. Following the defeat, Vendola's supporters have renounced all positions as party executives. Nichi Vendola in Bari in 2009 On 24 January 2009, at Chianciano Terme, Vendola split from Communist Refoundation and founded the Movement for the Left. In December 2009, Vendola became the first leader of the newly founded party Left Ecology Freedom, which the Movement for the Left had merged into. In late 2009, his candidacy for re-election was questioned by his centre-left allies from the Democratic Party. They asked him to step down to allow the choice of a candidate able to achieve wider support from other political parties, namely the Christian-democratic Union of the Centre. After Vendola refused to step down, chances of having a new primary election quickly increased. After some weeks of heated debate, elections were called for 24 January 2010. Supported by the Democratic Party, Francesco Boccia ran as Vendola's challenger. Vendola easily won the election with more than 67% of the votes, was picked again as leader of the centre-left coalition, and went on to defeat centre-right candidate Rocco Palese by a wide margin. In July 2010, during a general congress of the so-called \\"Factories of Nichi\\", Vendola announced his candidacy for the Primary Elections of the Italian centre-left. This voting was expected to foreshadow what might be expected in the 2013 Italian general elections. Nationwide polls showed Vendola winning over either Democratic Party Secretary Pier Luigi Bersani or Silvio Berlusconi, then Prime Minister of Italy. But came third in the primaries held on 25 November 2012 Vendola ranked third among the 5 candidates with 485,689 votes totaling 15.6%, failing to access the ballot.

On 6 March 2013, however, he announced that he would remain in charge of the Puglia Region, thus renouncing the seat in the Chamber. On 10 April 2013 he formalized his resignation as a deputy. Unable to apply for a third time as president of the region, in 2015 Vendola supports the former mayor of Bari Michele Emiliano who will win with 47%. On 17 December 2016, Left Ecology Freedom (SEL) was dissolved and merged with the Italian Left, on 19 February 2017. Homophobic insults During his political career he received insults related to his homosexuality. In 2012 he was insulted by a minister of Ferrara of the Democratic Party, Luigi Marattin. In October 2013 Alessandro Morelli, leader of the Lega Nord at the comune of Milan, published an image of Vendola on Facebook with the words \\"Gay and pedophile\\". The next day Morelli apologized.Il leghista su Facebook: \\"Vendola gay e pedofilo\\" , La Repubblica, 2 ottobre 2013 Personal life Vendola has lived with his partner Edward \\"Ed\\" Testa since 2004. In 2016, the couple used surrogacy in California to have a baby, Tobia Antonio. Vendola is also a poet: some of his poems have been collected in a book, named L'ultimo mare (\\"The last sea\\"). His figure has inspired a biographical film, Nichi. Vendola is a devout Roman Catholic, although he opposes many of the church's social positions. On 17 October 2018, Vendola had a heart attack, but he is in no danger after being fitted with a stent at Rome's Gemelli Hospital.

It runs between US Highway 31 (US 31) and US 131/M-66 in the Lower Peninsula. Running from Mancelona to Eastport, M-88 also goes through the communities of Bellaire and Central Lake. The highway is completely within Antrim County and is known by the street name of \\"Scenic Highway\\" outside of the various communities along its routing. M-88 is an original trunkline dating back to the 1919 signing of the state system. An extension in the 1920s and paving in the late 1930s created the highway as it exists today. The highway was not listed on the National Highway System, nor is it included in the Lake Michigan Circle Tour. Route description M-88 starts in the community of Eastport at an intersection four blocks east of the Grand Traverse Bay of Lake Michigan next to Barnes County Park. From its start, it runs east along the northern end of Torch Lake. M-88 zig-zags south and east along Scenic Highway to the community of Central Lake. In Central Lake it runs south along Main Street, following the western shore of Intermediate Lake. South of Intermediate Lake, M-88 crosses the Intermediate River on a historic designation-eligible Depression- era bridge along Bridge Street in Bellaire. This section of M-88 is just west of the Antrim County Airport before the highway turns east on Cayuga Street in downtown and south on Division Street. The Bellaire section of the trunkline is the location of the highest traffic levels along the highway. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the annual average daily traffic (AADT) in traffic surveys. The 2007 survey showed that 5,200 vehicles used the section of roadway on the average day in Bellaire. South of Bellaire, M-88 passes the Chief Golf Course and the Legend, Summit and Bellaire golf clubs. M-88 crosses the Shanty Creek, which is the namesake of a resort in the area. South of the Bellaire Golf Club, M-88 turns eastward again, passing south of Schuss Mountain, another resort. This section of trunkline is used by 3,300 vehicles in the 2007 AADT survey. Past Schuss Mountain, M-88 turns east at Alden highway and enters the community of Mancelona, passing the Fairview Cemetery. The highway runs along on State Street into downtown. M-88 ends at an intersection with US 131/M-66 running along Williams Street, and State Street continues eastward as C-38. History M-88 was first designated by July 1, 1919 along its current routing between Mancelona and Bellaire. It was extended in 1927 through Central Lake to end in Eastport. It was used as a temporary routing of US 31 between Eastport and Bellaire while the Elk Rapids to Eastport section of US 31 was reconstructed. The first sections of roadway were paved near Bellaire in late 1936. Paving was completed on the entire highway by late 1940 No changes have been made to the highway since.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 20, 2002. In the episode, Mr. Garrison tries to get fired from his new job as the fourth grade teacher at South Park Elementary by being overtly and explicitly homosexual in front of the students, so he can sue the school and get twenty-five million dollars in damages and shoves the school's gerbil Lemmiwinks into Mr. Slave's rectum. However, he is unable to as the rest of the faculty and the children's parents are desperate to appear tolerant of his homosexuality. The boys do not share their sentiments, and as punishment for not tolerating Garrison's outrageous behavior, they are sent to a Nazi-esque \\"tolerance camp.\\" All of the scenes inside the camp are shown in black-and-white, a homage to Schindler's List. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States. The Daily Telegraph has referred to it as one of the series' strongest episodes. Plot Finally promoted to teaching fourth graders, Mr. Garrison realizes that getting fired for being homosexual could allow him to sue the school for millions. He decides to perform outrageous sex acts in the classroom, hiring his partner Mr. Slave as his teaching assistant. Although the boys complain about Garrison's inappropriate activities, their parents mistakenly think their boys are intolerant of homosexuality. However, despite their thoughts about that, the adults bring the boys to the Museum of Tolerance to learn about tolerance of minorities or those with different life choices, though they hypocritically attack a nearby smoker with verbal abuse. Garrison, annoyed that no one has complained about his actions, steps up his campaign to get fired by shoving Lemmiwinks, the class gerbil, into Mr. Slave's rectum, an act called gerbilling. The boys mention their discomfort to Chef, who in turn, reports Garrison's actions to Principal Victoria, but ends up being sent to a \\"tolerance seminar\\". Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters refuse to attend class, so their parents send them to an Auschwitz-like \\"tolerance camp\\" (it is unknown if this is the same camp Chef was sent to). Back at the Museum of Tolerance, Garrison is to receive the \\"Courageous Teacher Award\\" for overcoming adversity. Still frustrated at not being fired, Garrison goes all out at the ceremony in an extremely flamboyant and stereotypically gay manner (humming Ferde Grof√©'s \\"On the Trail\\" from the Grand Canyon Suite). Although the parents finally understand what their kids were telling them about and are indeed shocked at Garrison's behavior, they cannot bring themselves to criticize it, as they fear being branded \\"intolerant\\". When the people continue to call Garrison and Mr. Slave \\"courageous\\" for their actions, Garrison finally breaks down and shouts at them that tolerating something does not mean you have to like it. He goes on to say that tolerating his homosexuality should not mean that he can do things which are obviously inappropriate in front of his students and begs to be fired so that he can collect on a discrimination lawsuit, but Principal Victoria says she has a better idea. The parents hurry to collect their malnourished and emaciated kids from the tolerance camp, but fail to realize that they tried to tell them about Garrison's behavior. Principal Victoria concludes that Garrison and Mr. Slave are \\"intolerant of their own behavior\\", and she is sending them to the tolerance camp so that they will accept themselves. As the outside events occur, Lemmiwinks traverses the regions of Mr. Slave's digestive system, receiving advice from three animal spirits ‚Äì the Frog King, Sparrow Prince and Catatafish. The journey is accompanied by songs that parody those used in the 1977 Rankin/Bass version of The Hobbit. As Mr. Slave arrives at the tolerance camp, he coughs up Lemmiwinks. The spirits, now free from Mr. Slave's gut, appear before Lemmiwinks and crown him \\"The Gerbil King\\". He exits the scene with the \\"Ballad of Lemmiwinks\\" playing over the credits. Production \\"The Death Camp of Tolerance\\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. By this point in the series' sixth season, the show had followed a story arc involving the death of Kenny (\\"Kenny Dies\\"), and several other tangents, among those Mr. Garrison's move to teaching kindergarten. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone began their attempts to return the show to normalcy, with Mr. Garrison's return to being the children's teacher in this episode. The staff at the studio found the subplot involving the Lemmiwinks ridiculous; Parker recalled watching an animatic and he and Stone being the only ones laughing, while the others sat and stared. The animation crew viewed the sequences as temporary, until Parker informed them that they would be in the final episode. Although few besides the creators found the episode humorous during production, Stone later recalled receiving calls from friends who found the subplot funny, while also remarking, \\"That's the most fucked up thing I‚Äôve ever seen.\\" The character and plot line originated as a spoof of The Lord of the Rings and its primary protagonist, Frodo Baggins, who Parker and Stone found a very ineffective and pointless main character. Lemmiwinks was originally a squirrel in a possible live-action Lord of the Rings parody the duo scrapped. Despite this, a mention of a fictitious program revolving around the Lemmiwinks was mentioned in a 2001 episode of the duo's live action series That's My Bush!. The character of Mr. Slave, who is introduced in this episode, is the voice of South Park staffer John Hansen. The voice originated in conversations with Parker and Stone as an arbitrary, stereotypical homosexual voice. Reception In 2010, The Daily Telegraph mentioned the episode as a moment in which the series solidified its form, writing, \\"The episode contains all the ingredients that have helped to transform South Park into the funniest, cleverest, most corrosive and watchable satire on television.\\" According to the paper, \\"some fans still regard [it] as the greatest episode.\\" Lemmiwinks, alongside The Frog King, The Sparrow Prince and The Catata Fish, later appear in the fifteenth season episode \\"Bass to Mouth\\" (2011) as well as the 2014 video game South Park: The Stick of Truth.

Hana was a self-proclaimed devotee of the MƒÅori sun god Tama-nui-te-rƒÅ, and claimed that he should wear as few items of clothing as possible, as an act of religious observance. As a result, he would sometimes remove all his clothing, which resulted in the consequent attendance of police officers.

In the late 1970s Hana associated with the Black Power gang, living in Wellington, going by the name BugsTrust: A true story of Women and Gangs. Pip Desmond. 2009. Page 22. and fathering two children.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8063784/Blanket-Man-died-of-heart- attack-inquest  Judicial hearings and convictions  Hana was arrested and imprisoned several times for offences including public nudity and possession of cannabis. His criminal record reportedly ran 17 pages long. In 1979, he was convicted of drunk driving causing death. Hana visited the South Island for the first time in 2010, was arrested, charged and flown home after being provided with a shower and new overalls. In 2010, a judge ordered that Hana be detained under the Mental Health Act 1992, and he was admitted to Wellington Hospital's psychiatric ward Te Whare O Matairangi, where \\"he will have clean clothes, regular meals, and no access to drink and drugs.\\" In the same year he was released back onto the streets without any notable change in character. In mid 2011 he was sectioned and detained again, subsequently diagnosed as living with schizophrenia. He was then discharged from hospital and given daily medication under a community treatment order, which allowed forced medical treatment as an outpatient. He mostly resided at his usual location on the central Wellington street of Courtenay Place until his death.  Local celebrity  With his distinctive look and high visibility location, Hana became something of a local celebrity. In general, he was tolerated by some shopkeepers outside whose premises he sat, and by passers-by, although there have been times of opposition from other shopkeepers. Also, on occasions when he decided to push the boundaries of offensive behaviour, police officers were likely to be in attendance. As someone who departed from the patterns of normal behaviour, Hana had become a figure of amusement, sympathy, disgust and even some academic interest. During the 2006 Rugby Sevens tournament, one costumed group appeared in dreads and blankets, mimicking his distinctive look.  In media  Hana featured in several works: * 2012 Blanket Man tribute song created by Leon Mitchell, sung by Michael Murphy, recorded and released by ZM radio https://web.archive.org/web/20120122091733/http://www.zmonline.com/player/ondemand/blanketman- song * \\"A Different Way of Life\\" by Marcelina Mastalerz, an interview with Hana * Te Whanau o Aotearoa ‚Äî Caretakers of the Land, a New Zealand documentary film by Errol Wright and Abi King-Jones. * In 2007 Victoria University of Wellington sociology lecturer Mike Lloyd and PhD student Bronwyn McGovern delivered a presentation titled \\"World Famous in Wellington: Blanket Man as contemporary celebrity\\" to the New Zealand Folklore Symposium * \\"The man behind the blanket\\" The Dominion Post ‚Äì Saturday, 19 June 2010 ‚Äì Tom Hunt. Death Hana, age 54, died in Wellington Hospital at 3:35 p.m. on 15 January 2012 of suspected viral myocarditis. However, he was suffering medical problems stemming from heavy alcohol use and malnutrition. A temporary shrine was created outside the ANZ Bank on Courtenay Place, a location where Hana could often be found. Messages were written on the building's facade, and flowers, candles, food and other items were left in tribute. Among those who paid tribute were Wellington mayor Celia Wade-Brown and sports athlete Sonny Bill Williams.Tributes to Ben Hana His funeral was paid for by philanthropist Gareth Morgan.

Also known by the lithologic term \\"marekanite\\", this variety of obsidian occurs as subrounded to subangular bodies up to about 2 inches in diameter, often bearing indented surfaces.American Geological Institute, Gary, Margaret, McAfee, Robert, Jr., Wolf, Carol L., eds., 1972, Glossary of geology: Washington, D.C Internally the pebbles sometimes contain fine bands or microlites and though in reflected light they appear black and opaque, they may be translucent in transmitted light. Apache tears fall between 5 and 5.5 in hardness on the Mohs scale.Apache Tears Obsidian Education and Information  Geology  Apache tears originate from siliceous lava flows, lava domes or ash-flow tuffs, often in close association with or embedded in, gray perlite. The spherules occur as cores within perlite masses that typically exhibit texture of concentrically curved, onion-skin fractures. Formation is apparently related to differential cooling and various alkali and water contents. Excessive water present during cooling and quenching of rhyolitic lava causes obsidian to hydrate (i.e., water entering the obsidian glass converts it to perlite). Where perlite is incompletely hydrated, fresh obsidian cores remain as pebbles of marekanite, or Apache tears; this origin has been occasionally described in the geologic literature (for example,Mrazova, Stepanka & Gadas, Petr, 2011, Obsidian balls (marekanite) from Cerro Tijerina, central Nicaragua: petrographic investigations: Jour. Geosci., v. 56, p. 43-49). Apache tears are well known from tertiary volcanic terrain in numerous localities throughout the western United States, particularly Arizona, from where specimens were widely collected and sold in the lapidary and specimen trade.Sinkankas, John, 1959, Gemstones of North America: Van Nostrand; p. 503-508 Several districts in western Nevada also have yielded abundant Apache tears eroding from tuff beds; such areas have been popularized in the lapidary trade through guides for rockhounds.Kappele, William A., 1998, Rockhounding Nevada: A guide to the state‚Äôs best rockhounding sites: Falcon Press Specimens from many of these sites have been avidly collected by rockhounds and lapidary enthusiasts, are often tumbled and may be considered semi-precious gemstones; locations are noted in the section \\"Gemstones of Nevada\\" by Rose and Ferdock.Castor, Stephen B. & Ferdock, Gregory C., 2004, Minerals of Nevada: Univ. of Nevada Press, NV Bur. Mines & Geol. Special Publication 31, p. 83  Culture  The name \\"Apache tear\\" comes from a legend of the Apache tribe: about 75 Apaches and the US Cavalry fought on a mountain overlooking what is now Superior, Arizona, in the 1870s. Facing defeat, the outnumbered Apache warriors rode their horses off the mountain to their deaths rather than be killed. The wives and families of the warriors cried when they heard of the tragedy; their tears turned into stone upon hitting the ground.Native American Legends American singer songwriter Johnny Cash wrote a song entitled \\"Apache Tears\\" for his 1964 album Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian.

Papua New Guinea receives an increasing number of visitors each year, with approximately 184,000 international arrivals in 2015. History In April 1883, James Burns and Robert Philp began a trading partnership, originally named the \\"Burns Philp & Company Limited\\".Douglas, N. and Douglas, N. (1996) \\"Tourism in the Pacific: Historical factors\\" in Hall, C.M. and Page, S.J. (eds.) Tourism in the Pacific: Issues and Cases, London pp. 65‚Äì80 They were the first company to offer tourism to New Guinea, in 1884, advertising the 'New Guinea Excursion Trip'.Sydney Morning Herald, 16 February 1884 in Douglas, N. (1994) \\"Electric Shadows in the South Seas: The Pacific Islands in film\\" in D. Aoki (ed.) Moving Images of the Pacific Islands: A Guide to Films and Video, Center for Pacific Island Studies: Honolulu, p. 40 This consisted of a five-week trip from Thursday Island and has been described as the \\"official beginning of tourist cruises in the South Pacific\\".Douglas, N. (1994) 'Electric Shadows in the South Seas: The Pacific Islands in film' in D. Aoki (ed.) Moving Images of the Pacific Islands: A Guide to Films and Video, Center for Pacific Island Studies: Honolulu, p. 40 The company later published a book titled Picturesque Travel. By 1914 the Burns Philp Tourist Department was established advertising tours on Lord Howe and Norfolk Island. Acquisition of the Port Moresby Hotel occurred in the same year, with the Papua Hotel purchased some years later. Burns Philp \\"maintained a near monopoly on passenger services to Melanesia until the outbreak of the war in the Pacific\\".Douglas, N. and Douglas, N. (1996) \\"Tourism in the Pacific: Historical factors\\" in Hall, C.M. and Page, S.J. (eds.) Tourism in the Pacific: Issues and Cases, London p. 27 The war saw the British government take over some of the Burns Philp fleet and the vessel Macdui was sunk in Port Moresby in 1942 as its first voyage as a troop carrier.Buckley, K. and Klugman, K. (1983) The Australian Presence in the Pacific: Burns Philp 1914-1916, George Allen & Unwin: Sydney  Attractions = Culture  The culture of Papua New Guinea is highly diverse, as implied by the existence of over 800 languages in the country. Styles of cultural expression - carving, dance, singing, ornamentation, architecture, and more - vary greatly across the nation.  Festivals  Hiri Moale Festival Public festivals which are open to tourists include the Coffee Festivalin Goroka - May, National Mask Festival in Rabaul-July, Mt Hagen Show - August, Goroka Show - September, Hiri Moale Festival in Port Moresby - September, Morobe Show in Lae - October, Kundu & Canoe Festival in Alotau - November.  Markets  The markets are a great drawcard for tourists. Along with local foods, arts and crafts are often on display and can be purchased for reasonable prices. Some of the items on display are traditional carvings and beadwork, traditional and contemporary paintings on canvas and traditionally woven baskets and serving trays. The larger more tourist oriented markets are usually held once a month in the larger towns.  Diving  PNG is arguably one of the best diving destinations in the world, having one of the healthiest coral reef systems on the planet. In addition to a large number of reef sites, there are also numerous wrecked World War II boats and aircraft, providing a wealth of Wreck Diving opportunities. Some of the best dive spots are at West New Britain (including Kimbe Bay), Kavieng, Madang, Alotau, Tufi and East New Britain (including Rabaul). The capital, Port Moresby, also offers superb diving. Many of the diving spots are easily accessible by day trip boat, and there are many sites further out which can be dived from one of the many liveaboards offered locally.  Surfing  Surfing can be enjoyed all year round. The southern side of PNG includes places such as Hula Beach (100 km from Port Moresby), Milne Bay, Bougainville, and East New Britain which can be surfed from June through to September. In the north of PNG surfing season is mid October to late April. There are great surfing locations which include Madang, Wewak and Kavieng, with the better and more consistent waves found in Vanimo.  Hiking/Trekking  The most famous walking trail in Papua New Guinea is the Kokoda Track, the site of a famous World War II battle between Australia and Japan. Another popular hike is climbing Mount Wilhelm, the highest mountain in Papua New Guinea. There are many more walking tracks, including the very rough Bulldog and Black Cat Tracks. Security Many countries have issued travel warnings to their citizens wishing to visit Papua New Guinea, due to its high level of violent crime, slow police response times and poor human rights record. Foreign nationals in Papua New Guinea have become tempting targets to criminals, especially those visiting from wealthier countries are more likely to become victims of violence and crime. Lone foreign females are usually advised not to travel unescorted in Port Moresby and in parts of the Highlands region due to the high risks of unwanted harassment and sexual assault. Travelers are usually advised by their origin countries to seek up-to-date information about the current situation before traveling and to only travel with qualified and experienced tour operators with extensive knowledge of Papua New Guinea and its local customs. It is generally advised by travel boards to never travel alone or at night in Papua New Guinea. LGBT travelers are usually advised to avoid traveling to Papua New Guinea entirely because homosexuality is criminalized and prohibited. Those caught engaging in anal sex can be sentenced with up to 14 years imprisonment. Other homosexual acts are punishable with up to 3 years imprisonment. Possession of pornographic material is also illegal. The use of private security companies are available to hire for tourists in Papua New Guinea as well as other security protection services. Transport Transport in Papua New Guinea is in many cases heavily limited by the mountainous terrain. The capital, Port Moresby, is not linked by road to any of the other major towns and many highland villages can only be reached by light aircraft or on foot.

The constituent files may be local and/or retrieved from one or more mirror sites. Jigdo's features are similar to BitTorrent, but unlike BitTorrent, Jigdo uses a client-server model, not peer- to-peer. Jigdo itself is quite portable and is available for many UNIX and Unix-like operating systems, and is also available for Microsoft Windows. Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Jigdo is free software.  Uses  A quite common use would be to construct a Linux CD or DVD image for installation or distribution, where a slightly older version or release of same, or a cache or local partial mirror, already contains some or many of the needed constituent files. That would typically proceed as follows: Jigdo would be invoked using the jigdo-lite command, with a command line argument of the URL of a \\".jigdo\\" file. Jigdo would then download that file, and after examining its contents, would also download a \\".template\\" file. After inspecting the \\".template\\" file, Jigdo would prompt for the location of files to scan. The user would then either enter or select from a list the location of files to scan. Jigdo would scan that location for any files that match any of the needed constituent files. Any matching files would be used in constructing the target image. Jigdo prompts again, and if the user gives a location, the process repeats - giving Jigdo the opportunity to scan multiple locations for the needed files. If the user enters no location, Jigdo proceeds to download any unmatched constituent files and to use them to assemble the target image file. The jigdo-file utility is generally used to create the \\".jigdo\\" and \\".template\\" files needed to create target images using Jigdo. Presently at least Debian and Ubuntu (and some older Fedora releases - see History) make files available for download via Jigdo. Other projects and sites may also do so or may be doing so - nothing inherently prevents such use.  Design  Jigdo was designed to solve several issues. By leveraging redundant available data, Jigdo works to ease loads on mirror systems - both by providing means for such mirror systems to assemble the needed large images while avoiding much redundant downloading, and also by encouraging those downloading from the mirrors to likewise use Jigdo and avoid downloading unneeded redundant data. Additionally, Jigdo can download from multiple mirrors, easing and typically speeding downloads and making them somewhat more resistant to various interruptions in downloading.  History  Jigdo was initially designed to aid in the distribution and downloading of large Debian image files for installation. Development of Jigdo appears to go back to at least January 1996. Debian has been available via Jigdo since at least 2002-01-09 Ubuntu has been available via Jigdo since at least 2004-11-12 By, or sometime after 2006-05 (release of Jigdo version 0.7.3), Jigdo is no longer undergoing active development, but is in \\"maintenance mode\\" - development has stopped. Fedora has been available via Jigdo since approximately 2008-02-05 with the 9 Alpha release. Fedora 8 discs as well as many other variants. were also made available via Jigdo. Fedora 15, released 2011-05-24, thus far appears to be the last Fedora release to have been made available via Jigdo by The Fedora Project.  Development  Jigdo is no longer undergoing active development, but is in \\"maintenance mode\\" - development has stopped. Though the command-line tools may be considered finished and \\"feature complete\\", the GUI client was not completed and does not support multi-image templates, meaning the command-line tools are required. See also Derivatives.  Derivatives  Fedora has been developing a Python-based GUI which used Jigdo, called pyJigdo.  Popularity  It may be difficult to know accurately how widely distributed and used Jigdo is, however some data are available. as of 2018 October 3: 0.86% (1,730) of approximately 200,471 reporting Debian systems have Jigdo installed as of 2018 October 1: 0.27% (7,572) of approximately 2,793,378 reporting Ubuntu systems have Jigdo installed  References  External links  * * Downloading Debian CD images with Jigdo * Debian Jigdo mini-HOWTO * Ubuntu Community Documentation: How to Download using Jigdo Category:Debian Category:Distributed data storage ","title":"Jigdo"},{"id":"1869580","text":"Hayabusa is a Japanese robot asteroid mission from 2003 to 2010, a.k.a.

The follow-up to Trout Mask Replica (1969), it is regarded by some critics and listeners as superior, and was Van Vliet's favorite. Van Vliet said that the title was an encouragement to \\"get rid of the labels\\", and to evaluate things according to their merits rather than according to superficial labels (or \\"decals\\"). Composition Musicians on the album were Don Van Vliet, vocals, harmonica, and woodwinds; Bill Harkleroad, guitar; Mark Boston, bass; Art Tripp, marimba, drums, and percussion; and John French, drums. French had been arranger and musical director on Trout Mask Replica. Van Vliet ejected French from the group‚Äîboth figuratively and literally, by allegedly throwing him down a flight of stairs‚Äîshortly after Trout Mask Replica was completed, and these roles passed to guitarist Bill Harkleroad. French returned to the group shortly before recording began. Most of the songs began as piano improvisations by Van Vliet. He would record extended improvisation sessions on a cassette recorder. Harkleroad then listened to these improvisations, picked out the best parts, and pieced them into compositions.Harkleroad, Bill with Billy James, 1998: Lunar Notes: Zoot Horn Rollo's Captain Beefheart Experience. SAF Publishing Ltd. The musical lines on Decals tend to be longer and more intricate than the assemblage of short fragments that characterized much of Trout Mask Replica. The album's liner notes contain two poems or lyrics for songs not present, one untitled and the other \\"You Should Know by the Kindness of uh Dog the Way uh Human Should Be\\". Critical and commercial reception Critic Robert Christgau said of the record: \\"Beefheart's famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny.\\" Lester Bangs noted the maturation of Beefheart‚Äôs previous musical and lyrical concerns, writing that \\"even though the sonic textures are sometimes even more complex and angular than on Trout Mask, ... his messages are universal and warm as the hearth of the America we once dreamed of\\". Due to John Peel's championing of the work on BBC radio, Lick My Decals Off, Baby spent eleven weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number twenty. This remains Beefheart's highest-charting album in the UK. An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from \\"Woe-Is-uh- Me-Bop\\", silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and Beefheart kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road.

It was previously designated as M-171, a former state trunkline highway, until 1960, running from US Highway 23 (US 23) just north of Oscoda, and coming back to US 23 about south of Alpena. The road runs through rural, forested areas of Iosco and Alcona counties, inland from Lake Huron. Although it has been a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 when the state trunkline highway system was formed. It was a segment of the original M-10 that was replaced by US 23 in 1926. Later changes to US 23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US 23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970. Route description F-41 begins at an intersection with US 23 on the north side of Oscoda. The route travels to the northwest away from town, passing between Van Etten Lake and what was previously Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The road continues north through a rural area of Alcona County on Somers and Mikado roads, running parallel, but inland, to the Lake Huron shoreline. It passes through the small communities of Mikado and Gustin before coming to a junction with M-72. After crossing M-72, F-41 turns east into the community of Lincoln along Traverse Bay State Road, 2nd Street and Main Street before leaving town to the north. The road continues on to the north on Barlow Road through Alcona County before terminating at a second junction with US 23\\\\. The highway travels through wooded terrain along its routing. History The first highway designation to run from Oscoda toward Spruce to Alpena was the original M-10 on July 1, 1919. This segment of highway was later redesignated as a part of US 23 in 1926 when the United States Numbered Highway System was established. Realignments of US 23 created both versions of M-171. The initial incarnation of M-171 served as a loop route off US 23 which departed the main highway east of Spruce, traveled west through Spruce, then north past Hubbard Lake and through Wilson before returning to US 23 near Alpena. This roadway was part of US 23 before it was redesignated M-171 in 1932. This routing is now occupied by the present day routings of Spruce, Hubbard Lake and Wilson roads. This version of M-171 was removed from the system in 1934. F-41 near the intersection of F-30 in Mikado Township The second version of M-171 that ran between Oscoda and Caledonia Township in Alcona County was assumed into the state trunkline system in 1936. This was another former segment of US 23. Expansion of the Oscoda Army Air Field (later Wurtsmith Air Force Base) in the early 1940s shifted M-171 eastward, more closely following the west shore of Van Ettan Lake. Portions of the old route were taken up by the expansion, while the rest became part of present-day Skeel Avenue.

Overview and history  Originally formed by teachers in 1945, the Sarawak Tribune was the second English language daily in Sarawak and was, prior to its suspension, the state's oldest and largest operating state daily, with over 400 employees throughout the state and 70 editorial staff in Kuching. The daily was regarded as a legacy of British colonial Sarawak. Its sister paper was the state Malay-language daily, Utusan Sarawak. Formerly, its other sister paper was the state Mandarin daily, Chinese Daily News, now known as United Daily. It was last owned by Sarawak Press Sdn Bhd.  2006 Muhammad cartoons controversy  During the Jyllands- Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, the daily reprinted a collection of the cartoons on page 17 of the 4 February 2006 edition to illustrate a story on the topic titled \\"Cartoon No Big Impact Here\\". The publication drew flak from the Malaysian government, which consisted predominantly of Muslim politicians. As a result, Lester Melanyi, an editor of the newspaper, resigned from his post for allowing the reprinting of the cartoon. Company advisor Senator Datuk Idris Buang announced that the daily would choose to suspend itself. The paper was officially suspended on 9 February 2006, while a formal letter was delivered to Idris at the daily's main office. The group editor, Toman Mamora, resigned soon after. The daily's indefinite suspension has been generally described as a loss.  Successor  A new tabloid, the Eastern Times, is said to have replaced the Sarawak Tribune. Its printing license was approved on 1 March, and began publication on 26 March 2006. The Eastern Times is owned by Total Progressive Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of a real-estate developing corporation and government-linked company, Naim Cendera Holdings .

Origins and history  The origins of this song are obscure. The earliest extant record is a version noted in Anne Gilchrist's Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society (1937), learnt from her Welsh nurse in the 1870s under the title \\"Jack Jintle\\" with the lyrics:A. G. Gilchrist, \\"Jack Jintle\\", Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, 3 (2) (1937), pp. 124‚Äì5. > My name is Jack Jintle, the eldest but one, And I can play nick-nack upon my > own thumb.

Variations  Nicholas Monsarrat (1910‚Äì1979), in his autobiography 'Life is a Four Letter Word,' refers to the song as being 'a Liverpool song' adding that it was 'local and original' during his childhood in Liverpool. A similar version was included in Cecil Sharp and Sabine Baring-Gould's English Folk- Songs for Schools, published in 1906.S. B. Gould and C. J. Sharp English Folk- Songs for Schools (London: J. Curwen & Sons, 1906) pp. 94‚Äì5. It was collected several times in England in the early 20th century with a variety of lyrics. In 1948 it was included by Pete Seeger and Ruth Crawford in their American Folk Songs for Children and recorded by Seeger in 1953. It received a boost in popularity when it was adapted for the film The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958) by composer Malcolm Arnold as \\"The Children's Marching Song\\", which led to hit singles for Cyril Stapleton and Mitch Miller.N. Musiker and D. Ad√®s, Conductors and Composers of Popular Orchestral Music: a Biographical and Discographical Sourcebook (London: Greenwood, 1998), p. 248. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961) The children's show Barney & Friends used the song \\"I Love You\\" as its closing song and was sung to the tune of \\"This Old Man.\\" In the television series Columbo, the title character often whistled the music to this song, generally when he was happy and closing in on a suspect. British musical comedy duo Flanders and Swann recorded a satirical version called \\"All Gall\\", about French President Charles de Gaulle, replacing the original's refrain with \\"Cognac, Armagnac, Burgundy and Beaune\\".

It is the first book in the Samaria series of novels.  Plot summary  Angels and mortals, who need one another but have a love-hate relationship, inhabit the land of Samaria. The angels have wings and fly, and are taller and stronger than humans. Legends state that angels were made by Jovah to oversee Samaria under the guidance of the Archangel. The angels are supposed to protect humans, answer their petitions, solve their problems, and intercede to god for them by petitioning the god Jovah through song, especially for rain when the crops need it and the sun when it is stormy. In addition, the angels must sing to Jovah at the annual Gloria held on the Plain of Sharon, otherwise god would destroy the world. The Archangel and his consort, the Angelica, lead this mass in praise of Jovah. Archangels do not serve for life, but every twenty years Jovah selects a new Archangel. Samaria is divided into three regions, Gaza, Bethel and Jordana, separated by rivers. Each region has an angel hold or fortress that acts as the governing center for the region. The citizens of Gaza, the Manadavvi, are highly cultured and wealthy. The Jansai, who are calculating and greedy merchants, and run the Edori slave trade inhabit Jordana. The Edori are the wanderers and frequently become enslaved by the Jansai. The Oracle has declared that the angel Gabriel is to be the next Archangel. However, Raphael, the current Archangel, who is corrupt and uses his position for himself, does not want to step down. Gabriel has an additional problem in that he procrastinated getting married. He tracks down the mortal that god has selected be his wife, but she has her own thoughts about the marriage and the expectations of her as the archangel‚Äôs consort, the Angelica. Rachel, an Edori slave, dislikes angels because of what they had done to her family when she was younger. Gabriel is faced with many trials having to contend with Raphael on the one hand, and his reluctant wife, who is a constant thorn-in-the-side. But the trials and tribulations confronting Gabriel and Rachel brings them close together and they finally realize that they love each other. The story ends with Gabriel and Rachael singing together at the Gloria, thus satisfying the wishes of the god.  External links  *Archangel review from ABC. *Archangel review from Sci Fi Weekly.

Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home is the presidential library and museum of Dwight David Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States (1953‚Äì1961), located in his hometown of Abilene, Kansas. The museum also includes his boyhood home, where he lived from 1898 until being appointed to West Point in 1911, and his final resting place. It is one of the thirteen presidential libraries under the auspices of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Admission to the Visitor Center, Place of Meditation (gravesite), and the archives is free. Admission to the museum is $20 for adults and includes a tour of the Boyhood Home. The complex is open every day except New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. History The Eisenhower Presidential complex is only one of two whose creation preceded the close of a presidency, and while this is obviously the case with his boyhood home, construction of the library itself began in 1958, and the museum portion before he even took office, coinciding with the then- General's announcement of his presidential candidacy in June 1952. Eisenhower Foundation As World War II came to an end, local admirers of the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in Europe, such as Charles L. Brainard, decided to honor Eisenhower with a museum. In 1945, a non-profit foundation in his name was created to purchase his boyhood home and build the museum on the same property. It was to house artifacts from veterans, and the honors of Eisenhower in particular. At the time, the General's mother Ida was still alive and refused to sell the property. When she died in 1946, another purchase attempt was made. However, the fund-raising tactics of the foundation offended Eisenhower, and this almost scuttled the project. New fundraising rules were established for the Foundation after its discussion with Ike's youngest brother Milton, and agreement by all the Eisenhower brothers. They ultimately donated the house to the Foundation, and the entire site, in south Abilene, later became the Eisenhower Presidential Center. Construction of the Museum Mrs. Eisenhower's home opened to the public as a museum on June 22, 1947. and the cornerstone of an Eisenhower/World War II museum was laid in June 1952 by the General himself, just before he accepted the draft and formally announced his candidacy for President. The museum was completed in 1954, and the President was in attendance when it was formally opened on November 11 of that year. He was impressed by the results, and told the leadership of the foundation that if they could raise the money to build a facility, he would donate his papers and other materials to it. A fundraising campaign launched in 2015 seeks to refresh and expand the museum's exhibits in 2018. If plans remain the same, the museum would be closed for about a year while the remainder of the site would remain open as usual. Construction and dedication of the library With the fundraising constraints on the foundation still in place in 1954, the Kansas Legislature took up the slack, authorizing a separate \\"Eisenhower Presidential Library Commission,\\" and over the next five years enough money was raised to begin construction. Again, President Eisenhower was present when ground was broken on October 13, 1959. The project took three years to complete, and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the retired President Eisenhower at the dedication on May 1, 1962. Operation of the site was turned over to the NARA in 1966, when it became the fourth library in the system. Campus The campus has five buildings: *The Library *The Museum, restored and rededicated in 1971. *Visitors Center, containing a gift shop and theater where a short film on the President is shown several times daily. *Boyhood Home *A chapel, known as \\"The Place of Meditation;\\" the final resting place of the president, the First Lady, and their first-born son, Doud Eisenhower.

Braun (April 20, 1929 ‚Äì January 15, 2001) was an American local television and radio personality, best known for a program originating in Cincinnati, Ohio named The Bob Braun Show. The show, which he hosted from 1967 to 1984, had the highest Arbitron and Nielsen ratings of any live entertainment/information program in the Midwest. Originating at WLWT, the 90-minute live telecasts originally were syndicated to three other cities in the Midwest. Eventually, more television stations joined the line-up. Braun's show featured a live band, singers, and special guests including Bob Hope (a frequent guest), Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Paul Lynde, Red Skelton, Phyllis Diller, Dick Clark and NFL-star Jim Brown. Politicians including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, John Glenn, and Ted Kennedy were also guests. The local Cincinnati television show titled The 50-50 Club had occupied the time slot that Braun eventually filled. The 50-50 Club hostess, Ruth Lyons, retired in 1967 due to declining health. Braun had appeared regularly on The 50-50 Club show since 1957, and frequently had been a fill-in host. On his own show, Braun heavily promoted and supported Lyons' charity, \\"The Ruth Lyons Christmas Fund,\\" each Christmas season. (The charity, now known as \\"The Ruth Lyons Children's Fund,\\" remains in operation to this day.) Some years after Braun took over the show, the title was changed from The 50-50 Club to The Bob Braun Show. (An ad in a 1969 issue of TV Guide identifies it as Bob Braun's 50-50 Club.) Toward the end of its run in the 1980s, it was renamed Braun and Company. Regular cast members on The Bob Braun Show included Rob Reider, Mary Ellen Tanner, Nancy James, baritone Mark Preston (member of The Lettermen), and announcer/weatherman Bill Myers. Beginning with the telecast on the daytime schedule of Friday, June 7, 1968, an entertainment critic for a Columbus, Ohio newspaper, Ron Pataky, visited Cincinnati every Friday to discuss on Braun's television show which movies were playing in cinemas that weekend. Pataky continued making his Friday appearances until 1973. The longtime director of The 50-50 Club, Bob Braun's 50-50 Club and The Bob Braun Show was Dick Murgatroyd, who years later became the county-judge executive of Kenton County, Kentucky. The Department of Photographs and Films at the Cincinnati Museum Center has videotapes of The Bob Braun Show and Braun and Company that were preserved starting in 1982. All episodes of Braun's daytime show that were telecast prior to 1982 were lost because of wiping. Evidently, in 1969, Braun did a prime-time special on which Nick Clooney and his young son George were guests. George talked on-camera about his recent tonsillectomy, and that broadcast was preserved. Bob Braun began his career at the age of thirteen with WSAI Radio, hosting a Saturday morning Knothole Baseball sports show. He joined WCPO-TV in 1949. In 1957, after winning the $1,000 top prize on television's Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts talent show, Braun was immediately hired by WLWT and WLW-AM. After cutting a handful of unsuccessful pop vocal recordings for labels such as Fraternity and Torch, Braun signed to Decca Records and charted his only Top 40 hit, \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", in 1962. Braun later recorded for United Artists, but most of his subsequent recording efforts were released on small independent or vanity labels. In the mid-1970s he briefly hosted a local game show called On The Money. Braun recorded his album \\"Women of My Dreams in 1982 on the ANRO label. It featured original tunes written by the famous George David Weiss and also Roger Bowling who wrote Coward of the County for Kenny Rogers and was arranged by Angelo DiPippo with liner notes written by Bob's good friend Dick Clark. Bob Braun was one of Cincinnati's biggest TV stars until 1984, when he moved to California for ten years to do commercials, talk shows and small movie roles. During that time, he was most often seen as the spokesperson for Craftmatic adjustable beds and announcer for controversial no-money-down real estate promoter Tony Hoffman, who later produced and marketed a recorded interview with O. J. Simpson. Braun also had a part in the Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 2. In 1993, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Radio Hall of Fame. In March 1994, Braun left Hollywood and returned to WSAI Radio (by then featuring an adult standards musical format) as one of \\"The Sunrise Boys\\", working as the morning host alongside his nephew, \\"Bucks\\" Braun (himself a successful radio personality in nearby Dayton, Ohio) and newsman Don Herman. In June 1997, Mayor Roxanne Qualls and the entire City Council honored him with \\"Bob Braun Day in Cincinnati\\". Braun retired on November 24, 1999, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. His show business career had spanned a half century. He was replaced on WSAI by Nick Clooney. Braun died of Parkinson's and cancer in 2001 and was buried in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Wray Jean, and three children: Rob, Doug, and Melissa. Rob later worked at WKRC-TV as its primary news anchorman. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bob Braun among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

His career included participation in the American Civil War.Thomas, Owen, \\"Abbott, Anderson Ruffin\\" at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online.Anderson Ruffin Abbott: First Afro-Canadian Doctor Significant roles included coroner of Kent County, Ontario, and surgeon-in-chief. Early life Anderson Abbott was born on 7 April 1837 in Toronto to Wilson Ruffin and Ellen Toyer Abbott. The Abbotts were a prominent Black family in Toronto, who had left Alabama ‚Äì as free people of colourUniversity of Toronto Biography of Abbott ‚Äì after their store had been ransacked. After first living a short time in New York, they settled in Upper Canada in 1835 or 1836. Wilson Abbott soon began to purchase real estate, in and around Toronto, where he owned 48 properties by 1871. The senior Abbott also became active in politics. The family's prosperity allowed Anderson Abbott to receive an excellent education. He attended both private and public schools, including William King's school, in the black Elgin settlement (now North Buxton, Ontario). He was an honour student at the Toronto Academy and later attended Oberlin College in Ohio. He returned to Canada and in 1857, entered University College in Toronto and in 1858, became a medical student at the Toronto School of Medicine. He studied under Alexander Thomas Augusta, a black physician who was born in the U.S. Although he did not graduate,Reid, Richard M., African Canadians in Union Blue: Volunteering for the Cause in the Civil War, Vancouver, Toronto: UBC Press, 2014, p. 156. Abbott received a license to practise from the Medical Board of Upper Canada, in 1861, thus becoming the first Canadian-born Black physician. Legacy In 1866, Abbott resigned from service to the Union Army and returned to Canada. He attended primary medical classes at the University of Toronto the following year. While he did not graduate, he established a medical practice and was admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario in 1871. In an Anglican wedding ceremony in Toronto on 9 August 1871, he married Mary Ann Casey, the 18-year-old daughter of a successful Black barber. Abbott and his wife moved to Chatham where he resumed his medical practice. They eventually had three daughters and two sons. Like his father, Abbott soon became an important member of the Black community in Toronto. From 1873 to 1880, he fought against racially segregated schools as president of the Wilberforce Educational Institute and was appointed coroner for Kent County, Ontario, in 1874, the first Black man to hold that office. Abbott contributed to a local newspaper, the Chatham Planet, and was associate editor of the Missionary Messenger, the journal of the local British Methodist Episcopal Church. Abbott was made president of both the Chatham Literary and Debating Society and the Chatham Medical Society in 1878. Abbott moved his medical practice to Dundas, Ontario, in 1881 where he also served in some important community roles including trustee of that community's high school and chairman of the town's internal management committee from 1885 to 1889. He also worked as an administrator for the Dundas Mechanics' Institute. The family moved to Oakville, Ontario in 1889 but returned to Toronto the following year. He was elected a member of the local post of the Grand Army of the Republic and one of 273 Civil War veterans in Toronto to wear the badge of that fraternity. He was then known as \\"Captain Abbott\\", a rank which might reflect his office within the Grand Army of the Republic rather than his actual rank during the American Civil War. In November 1892, Abbott was appointed aide-de-camp on the Staff of the Commanding Officers Dept. of New York. A source of great pride for Abbott and his family, this was the highest military honour ever bestowed on a Black person in Canada or the United States. In 1894, Abbott was appointed surgeon-in-chief at Provident Hospital in Chicago,\\"U of T Medicine Celebrates Its Trailblazers\\", University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine. the first training hospital for Black nurses in the United States. He became the hospital's medical superintendent In 1896 but resigned the following year. Returning to Toronto, Abbott resumed his private practice and became more involved with writing for various publications including The Colored American Magazine of Boston and New York, the Anglo- American Magazine of London (for which he wrote \\"Some recollections of Lincoln's assassination\\"), and New York Age. Medicine, Black history, the Civil War, Darwinism, biology, and poetry were among his topics. Later life At the turn of the century Abbott became embroiled in the debate between W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington over social change. Siding with Du Bois, Abbott believed that Black access to higher education was essential and should not be compromised. Believing that blacks would be culturally assimilated, Abbott wrote: \\"It is just as natural for two races living together on the same soil to blend as it is for the waters of two river tributaries to mingle.\\" With Canada's black population on the decline, he thought this was especially true in his own country and wrote \\"by the process of absorption and expatriation the colour line will eventually fade out in Canada\\". Death Anderson Ruffin Abbott died in 1913, at the age of 76, in the Toronto home of his son-in-law, Frederick Langdon Hubbard, (Toronto Transportation Commission Chairman from 1929 to 1930, and son of his long-time friend William Peyton Hubbard). He is buried in the Toronto Necropolis.

In 1879, the family settled in Pima County, Arizona Territory,Chaput, pg. 21 but soon moved to Tombstone in Cochise County.U.S. Census, Luttrell, Pima Co., Arizona, 7 June 1880: Chas. E.

Alvord‚Äôs education was informal, but he likely learned much from his father‚Äôs cases about local disputes.Chaput, pg. 20, 25 He also spent time working at the O.K. Corral where he got to know the townspeople very well.Chaput, pg. 29 Claims that Alvord witnessed the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1881 are unsubstantiated, though the banditry and lawlessness for which Tombstone was famous would certainly have made an impression on the young Alvord.Chaput, pg. 25-6 Law enforcement career Despite Alvord‚Äôs reputation for frequenting saloons and his participation in several bar altercations, Cochise County Sheriff John Horton Slaughter recruited Alvord as a deputy in 1886. The same year, Alvord‚Äôs mother died. Alvord served primarily as the muscle behind Slaughter's operations; he made several decisions which revealed his lack of experience and finesse in law enforcement. He was reportedly ‚Äúnot noble, temperate, far seeing, or unselfish‚Äù.Chaput, pg. 33‚Äì4 He did assist Slaughter in capturing or killing several rustlers and other outlaws between 1886 and 1889, but his reputation suffered when his alcoholism became increasingly apparent. Alvord continued to frequent saloons and eventually began to associate with gamblers and suspected outlaws. When Slaughter reprimanded him, he quit. Alvord next worked as a lawman in several towns in the 1890s, including Fairbank, Arizona and Pearce, Arizona. In 1896, Alvord moved to Cochise County, where he married Lola Ochoa, bought a ranch, and settled down. Once again he became a sheriff‚Äôs deputy.Chaput, pg. 48-9 Unfortunately, his life took a turn for the worse just two years later, when his father died.Chaput, pg. 54 In late December 1899, Alvord suddenly and inexplicably resigned his post of deputy sheriff.Chaput, pg. 57 Outlawry and last years Almost immediately after turning in his badge, Alvord left his wife and turned to crime. He formed a gang with outlaws Billy Stiles, Bill Downing, and \\"Three Fingered Jack\\" Dunlop, men he had once pursued during his career as a law officer. Alvord's gang committed several armed robberies in Cochise County, where he and Stiles were both captured. Somehow, they managed to escape. On February 15, 1900, Dunlop was killed by lawman Jeff Milton during a bungled train robbery in Fairbank, Arizona, and gang recruit Bravo Juan Yoas was wounded. Later that year, Alvord was again captured and taken to Tombstone. Billy Stiles rode to Tombstone and wounded the deputy on duty, allowing Alvord and 24 other prisoners to escape. In 1902, Alvord assisted Arizona Rangers Captain Burton C. Mossman in capturing the notorious Mexican bandit Augustine Chacon, in exchange for a share of the reward money and a reduced sentence. When Chacon was convicted of murder and hung at Solomonville, Alvord decided it was wiser not to surrender after all.Raine, pg. 74‚Äì77Wilson, pg. 45 Alvord and Stiles instead returned to crime, now pursued by the Arizona Rangers. They were captured in December 1903, but again managed to escape. Alvord even made a crude attempt at faking their deaths, using the bodies of two unknown Mexicans. Alvord sent the bodies to Tombstone, claiming they were himself and Stiles. However, an examination quickly showed the dead men were not the two \\"gringos\\". The irritated Arizona Rangers finally pursued the outlaws across the international border into Mexico, trapping them near Naco in February 1904. The outlaws resisted, but surrendered after both were wounded. Alvord spent two years in the Yuma Territorial Prison. Following his release, he announced he was going by ship to start anew in Central America. He was last seen in 1910 working as a Panama Canal employee. Following this, Alvord's fate is unknown. In media In 1955, Alvord and Stiles were portrayed by Chris Drake and Paul Sorensen in an episode of the syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring Jim Davis. Bing Russell played Alvord in the 1963 episode \\"The Measure of a Man\\" of the syndicated series Death Valley Days, narrated by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Alvord, with a serious arm injury, is promised a light sentence if he will surrender and deliver the whereabouts of the notorious bandit Augustine Chacon (Michael Pate). Rory Calhoun plays the Arizona Ranger Burton C. Mossman, who works to capture Chacon and return him to be hanged for an earlier conviction.

Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that established the right of unmarried people to possess contraception on the same basis as married couples. The Court struck down a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people for the purpose of preventing pregnancy, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Background William Baird was charged with a felony for distributing contraceptive foams after lectures on birth control and population control at Boston University.Eisenstadt v. Baird SummaryPersonal account of Plaintiff Bill Baird at prochoiceleague.org The prearranged violation of the law occurred on April 6, 1967 when Baird handed a condom and a package of contraceptive foam to a 19-year-old woman.The Short History of Our Right to Contraceptives: Eisenstadt v. Baird 40 Years Later Under Massachusetts law on \\"Crimes against chastity\\" (Chapter 272, section 21A), contraceptives could be distributed only by registered doctors or pharmacists, and only to married persons. After Baird was convicted, an appeal resulted in partial overturn by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which concluded that the lectures were covered by First Amendment protections. However, the court affirmed the conviction under contraceptive distribution laws. Baird filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, which was refused by the federal district court. Upon appeal, The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded the action with directions to grant the writ, and dismiss the charge, reasoning that the Massachusetts law infringed on fundamental human rights of unmarried couples as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, by Sheriff Eisenstadt, who had prosecuted the case, on the ground that Baird lacked standing to appeal, being neither an authorized distributor under the statute nor a single person. Supreme Court decision In a 6‚Äì1 decision. (Justices Rehnquist and Powell were not sworn in on time to participate in the case), the Court upheld both Baird's standing to appeal and the First Circuit's decision on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause, but did not reach the Due Process issues. The majority opinion was written by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. and joined by three other justices, William O. Douglas, Potter Stewart, and Thurgood Marshall. Brennan reasoned that, since Massachusetts did not (and perhaps could not under Griswold v. Connecticut) enforce its law against married couples, the law worked irrational discrimination by denying the right to possess contraceptives by unmarried couples. He found that Massachusetts's law was not designed to protect public health and lacked a rational basis. Brennan, writing for the Court, made four principal observations: # Baird had standing to assert the rights of unmarried persons who wished to have access to contraceptives. # Although states could constitutionally prohibit and punish sex outside of marriage, the Massachusetts law could not reasonably be held to advance that purpose, since a) fornication was a misdemeanor in Massachusetts, and a state could not reasonably wish to punish a misdemeanor by forcing an unwanted child on the fornicator; b) the state could not reasonably wish to punish the distributor of contraceptives as a felon for aiding and abetting the misdemeanor of fornication; c) the law did not prohibit the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons for the purpose of preventing sexually-transmitted diseases, and d) the law made no attempt to ensure that contraceptives legally obtained by a married person for the purpose of preventing pregnancy would not be used in an extramarital affair. # The Massachusetts law could not reasonably be held to promote health, as whatever health risks posed by contraceptives were just as great for married persons as unmarried persons. # The Massachusetts law could not be justified by the State's judgment that contraceptives are immoral per se, because the morality of contraceptives does not depend on the marital status of those who use it. It is possible that the Due Process right of privacy of married couples to use contraceptives recognized in Griswold v. Connecticut means that married couples have the right to have contraceptives distributed to them; if so, then unmarried people have that same right. (\\"If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\") But even if Griswold does not imply a Due Process right of married couples to be distributed contraceptives, the Equal Protection Clause prevents states from using the immorality of contraception as a basis for denying to unmarried people the same access to contraceptives as married people. Justice Douglas, concurring, argued that since Baird was engaged in speech while distributing vaginal foam, his arrest was prohibited by the First Amendment. Justice White, joined by Justice Blackmun, did not join Brennan's opinion but concurred in the judgment on narrower grounds. White and Blackmun declined to reach the issue of whether Massachusetts could limit distribution of contraceptives only to married couples. They argued that Massachusetts had asserted an implausible health rationale for limiting distribution of vaginal foam to licensed pharmacists or physicians. Chief Justice Burger dissented alone, arguing that there were no conclusive findings available to the Court on the health risks of vaginal foam since that issue had not been presented to the lower courts, and thus no basis for the Court's finding that the Massachusetts statute served no public health interest. Burger also held that the Massachusetts statute independently advanced the state's interest in ensuring couples receive informed medical advice on contraceptives. Significance While Brennan's ruling conceded that states may prohibit sex outside of marriage, later cases have interpreted its most famous sentence--\\"If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\\"‚Äîas recognizing the right of single people to procreate on the same basis as married couples, reasoning which would eventually be extended to a more general right to engage in sexual activity. Carey v. Population Services International, decided in 1977, struck down a New York law forbidding distribution of contraceptives to those under 16 but failed to produce a majority opinion and thus is not widely cited. Bowers v. Hardwick in 1986 rejected the claim of homosexuals to a fundamental right to engage in sodomy. However, Lawrence v. Texas overruled Bowers in 2003, citing Eisenstadt in support of this ruling, and recognized that consenting adults had a right to engage in private, consensual non-commercial sexual intercourse. Roy Lucas, a prominent abortion rights lawyer, assessed the case as \\"among the most influential in the United States during the entire [20th] century by any manner or means of measurement.\\" Eisenstadt v. Baird is mentioned in over 52 Supreme Court cases from 1972 through 2002. Each of the eleven U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit, as well as the Federal Circuit, has cited Eisenstadt v. Baird as authority. The highest courts of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have cited Eisenstadt v. Baird.

An animated cobweb diagram of the logistic map y = r x (1-x), showing chaotic behaviour for most values of r > 3.57. A cobweb plot, or Verhulst diagram is a visual tool used in the dynamical systems field of mathematics to investigate the qualitative behaviour of one-dimensional iterated functions, such as the logistic map. Using a cobweb plot, it is possible to infer the long term status of an initial condition under repeated application of a map. Method For a given iterated function f: R ‚Üí R, the plot consists of a diagonal (x = y) line and a curve representing y = f(x). To plot the behaviour of a value x_0, apply the following steps. # Find the point on the function curve with an x-coordinate of x_0. This has the coordinates (x_0, f(x_0)). # Plot horizontally across from this point to the diagonal line. This has the coordinates (f(x_0), f(x_0)). # Plot vertically from the point on the diagonal to the function curve. This has the coordinates (f(x_0), f(f(x_0))). # Repeat from step 2 as required. Interpretation On the cobweb plot, a stable fixed point corresponds to an inward spiral, while an unstable fixed point is an outward one. It follows from the definition of a fixed point that these spirals will center at a point where the diagonal y=x line crosses the function graph. A period 2 orbit is represented by a rectangle, while greater period cycles produce further, more complex closed loops.

Players move about on a virtual game board, with the object of the game being to reach the end first. It allows for up to four players, featuring six characters from other Namco games to choose from: Pac- Man (Pac-Man), Astaroth (Soulcalibur), Heihachi Mishima (Tekken), Ms. Pac-Man (Pac-Man), Tiger Jackson (Tekken), and Reiko Nagase (Ridge Racer). Gameplay There are three different types of game boards to play‚ÄîTropical, Space, and Medieval‚Äîeach with its own set of minigames. After selecting a board, players can also choose to play a short, medium, or long game, each having a different number of tiles that corresponded to the length's name. The object of the game is to get to the finish first. The game is played in rounds; each round begins with a four-player minigame, the results of which determine how many spaces each player moves forward on the board. Each tile on the board also has an effect. These include moving forward/going backward some number of steps, stealing/losing/gaining tokens, playing a single/two- player/free-for-all minigame, the ability to spend earned tokens, and a raffle game to earn redemption tickets with cherry, orange, or banana raffle tickets. When on a \\"store\\" tile, the player can spend tokens to move steps forward, move others backward, buy raffle tickets, multiply the amount of spaces moved next turn, or gamble to earn more tokens. The three spaces before the goal space are special raffle spaces (cherry, orange, and banana, respectively). In addition to functioning as a raffle space for the first player that reaches them (and as a token space thereafter), a player must place a certain rank or better in a minigame (3rd, 2nd, and 1st, for the cherry, orange, and banana tiles, respectively) in order to progress to the next space while on these tiles. If a player attains 1st place in a minigame while on the banana space, they advance to the goal space. Once a player has reached the end, the game is over and players will receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can then be used to buy each minigame separately, which can be played in short tournaments outside the main game. Alternatively, once all minigames have been bought, the player can let the tickets tally up to see their overall high score. Reception Pac-Man Fever received mixed reviews. Matt Casamassina of IGN gave the GameCube version a 4.9/10 and the PlayStation 2 version a 4.5/10. While the sound was praised, the gameplay and graphics were criticized. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the GameCube version a 54 out of 100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\", while the PS2 version received a 47 out of 100, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Ryan Davis of GameSpot gave both versions of the game a 5.2/10, disliking the lack of variety in the minigames and the slow pace on the boards.

Character Hamilton Burger first appears in chapter 10 of Gardner's 1935 novel, The Case of the Counterfeit Eye, in which he is described as \\"a broad-shouldered, thick-necked individual with a close-cropped moustache\\". Gardner describes Burger in the cast of characters of that novel as an \\"honest but stubborn\\" D.A. In chapter 15 of The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), Burger's residential address is given as 3297 West Lakeside, and his phone number is EXposition 9-6949. Burger is one of literature's least successful district attorneys, and critics have suggested that he must have been the most incompetent lawyer in history, although his record against defense attorneys other than Mason is unknown. Burger's cases inevitably involved prosecuting the wrong person, who was defended by Mason, who in the end, revealed the true criminal through a series of tactics that Burger characterized as courtroom tricks. Burger's bag of tricks was comparatively empty, chiefly comprising indignant exclamations of, \\"Incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial!\\" Once Mason had exposed the true perpetrator, Burger often joined in Mason's motion to the judge to dismiss the charges against Mason's client so that Burger could then charge the actual wrongdoer.  In film  Hamilton Burger appeared in the fifth installment of the Warner Bros. Perry Mason movie series of the 1930s, The Case of the Black Cat. He was portrayed by Guy Usher. The character, now portrayed by Charles C. Wilson, played a larger role in the sixth and final film in the series, The Case of the Stuttering Bishop. Television portrayal=Perry Mason Burger was portrayed by William Talman in the long-running CBS-TV series Perry Mason (1957‚Äì66). Asked about how he felt about Burger losing to Mason week after week, Talman said, \\"Burger doesn't lose. How can a district attorney lose when he fails to convict an innocent person? Unlike a fist or gun fight, in court you can have a winner without having a loser. As a matter of fact Burger in a good many instances has joined Mason in action against unethical attorneys, lying witnesses, or any one else obstructing justice. Like any real-life district attorney, justice is Burger's main interest.\\" Burger did defeat Mason twice on the television series: in \\"The Case of the Terrified Typist\\" (episode 1-38), and in \\"The Case of the Deadly Verdict\\" (episode 7-4), a much- publicized episode that begins with Mason's client being sentenced to death. The character of Hamilton Burger temporarily disappeared from the TV series during the series' third season. Talman was fired by CBS March 18, 1960, hours after he entered a not-guilty plea to misdemeanor charges related to his presence at a party that was raided by police. The schedule was immediately juggled to minimize Talman's presence on the show. \\"The Case of the Crying Cherub\\" (episode 3-20) debuts a pared-down title sequence that omits Talman; he is credited only in the four episodes he filmed before he was fired. Talman was defended by the show's executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson, Raymond Burr and others, but even dismissal of the charges in June did not soften the network's position. Patrick said that the role of Burger would not be recast, but that various actors would play assistant district attorneys. CBS reinstated Talman only after Gardner himself spoke out, together with millions of viewers. Talman went back to work in December 1960, and Burger returned in \\"The Case of the Fickle Fortune\\" (episode 4-15). The New Perry Mason In the short-lived CBS-TV series, The New Perry Mason (1973‚Äì74), Burger was played by Harry Guardino.  Perry Mason television films  Talman had passed away by the time of the Perry Mason television movies of the 1980s and 1990s, but his character was referenced in the first of the series, Perry Mason Returns. In it, a cocky young deputy prosecutor describes her case against Mason's client as a \\"dead-bang winner,\\" to which the District Attorney replies, \\"You know how many times Hamilton Burger said that?\\" HBO's Perry Mason In the HBO series, Perry Mason (2020), assistant district attorney Burger was a graduate of Yale Law with twenty-two years of trial experience, played by Justin Kirk. This series takes place 1931-1932, before Mason becomes a defense attorney. The adversary is district attorney Maynard Barnes, a character created for the series, played by Stephen Root. Burger, meanwhile, is depicted as helping Mason study for the bar exam.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/arts/television/review-perry-mason- hbo.html Mason believes, as does Della Street, that Burger is helping mainly so that he can run for DA when Barnes is humiliated by losing the high-profile case, but he does not himself confirm this. In the series, he is depicted as a closeted gay man who keeps up his facade by making public appearances with Della, who is herself a lesbian. Influence In her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2009, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor prefaced her remarks on the role of the prosecutor by claiming that she was inspired by watching Perry Mason as a child. \\"I was influenced so greatly by a television show in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was Perry Mason\\", Sotomayor said. In her 2013 memoir Sotomayor, now a Supreme Court justice, wrote of the show's influence on her while she was growing up in a Bronx housing project. Sotomayor granted that the defense attorney was the show's hero, \\"but my sympathies were not entirely monopolized by Perry Mason. I was fond of Burger, the prosecutor, too. I liked that he was a good loser, that he was more committed to finding the truth than to winning his case. If the defendant was truly innocent, he once explained, and the case was dismissed, then he had done his job because justice had been served.\\" NotesReferences Category:Fictional lawyers Category:Perry Mason characters Category:Characters in American novels of the 20th century Category:Literary characters introduced in 1935 ","title":"Hamilton Burger"},{"id":"1869737","text":"\\"Watermark\\" is a song by the Canadian indie rock band The Weakerthans from their 2000 album Left and Leaving.

The band is known for playing dark music heavily influenced by 20th- century chamber music. History In 1973, Claude Deron and Daniel Denis, both former members of Belgian \\"Zeuhl\\" band Arkham (which had disbanded the previous year), set up a new group, Necronomicon. By that time, apart from Deron (trumpet) and Denis (drums), the group consisted of Roger Trigaux (guitar), Guy Segers (bass guitar), Patrick Hanappier (violin) and John Van Rymenant (sax), and, later on, Vincent Motoulle (keyboards). At the time, Guy Denis (percussion) took part in some shows and rehearsals and Jean-Luc Manderlier (keyboards) was present only during rehearsals. Necronomicon was renamed Univers Zero in 1974. For a time, Univers Zero were part of a musical movement called Rock in Opposition (RIO) which strove to create dense challenging music, a direct contrast to the disco and punk music being produced in the late 1970s. Obvious early influences were Bart√≥k and Stravinsky, however the band also cited less well known composers such as Albert Huybrechts, who was also Belgian. Whereas their early albums were almost entirely acoustic, featuring oboes, spinets, harmoniums and Mellotrons, their 1980s albums tended to rely more on synthesizer and electric guitar, sounding much more electric. In 1977, they released their first eponymous album Univers Zero, later remixed and renamed as 1313. The album shows a heavy rock and roll approach despite the fact that the instrumentation was largely acoustic. This is mostly due to the use of drums and bass guitar. Two years later the album Heresie proved to be even darker. Subsequent albums lightened the sound only slightly but became ever more electric. Despite these changes, their overall sound remained fairly consistent. The group disbanded in 1987 but reformed in 1999. In the interim, drummer Daniel Denis released two solo albums and joined Art Zoyd, a similar band from France. Since 1999, Univers Z√©ro have released five studio albums. In 2003, Univers Z√©ro had retired from live performance with Daniel Denis being quoted as saying that only something like a festival would make it financially worthwhile. Coincidentally soon after, they were invited to headline the first day of NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in June 2004. In 2011, they joined forces with Belgian groups Present and Aranis to form a 17-member ensemble called Once Upon a Time in Belgium.

Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2011. This was also a tea trade route. It is also sometimes referred to as the Southern Silk Road or Southwest Silk Road, and it is part of a complex routes system connecting China and South Asia. There are numerous surviving archaeological and monumental elements, including trails, bridges, way stations, market towns, palaces, staging posts, shrines and temples along the route. Besides the route's importance for commercial activity, more significantly it was crucial for cultural exchange between the Indian subcontinent, Tibet and Southwest China. Especially, it was vitally important for the interchange of Buddhism between China and South Asia.Williams, Tim, Lin, Roland Chih-Hung and Gai, Jorayev.

History Men laden with tea, Sichuan Province, China, 1908, Ernest Henry Wilson Sichuan and Yunnan are believed to be the first tea-producing regions in the world. The first record of tea cultivation in the world suggested that tea was cultivated on Sichuan's Mount Mengding (ËíôÈ°∂Â±±) between Chengdu and Ya'an earlier than 65 BC. Ya'an has been an important hub of tea trading till the 20th century. Besides tea, silk products from Chengdu, notably Shujin (ËúÄÈî¶), was also traded through this road to South Asian from around 2000 years ago. From around a thousand years ago, the Tea Horse Road was a trade link from Yunnan to Bengal via Myanmar; to Tibet; and to Central China via Sichuan Province. In addition to tea, the mule caravans carried salt. Both people and horses carried heavy loads, the tea porters sometimes carrying over 60‚Äì90 kg (132-198 lb.), which was often more than their own body weight in tea. The porters carried metal-tipped staffs, both for balance while walking and to help support the load while they rested, so they didn't need to lay the bales down (as illustrated in the photo). It is believed that it was through this trading network that tea (typically tea bricks) first spread across China and Asia from its origins in Pu'er county, near Simao Prefecture in Yunnan.Jeff Fuchs.

Chiang Mai, Cognoscenti Books, 2011. The route earned the name Tea-Horse Road because of the common trade of Tibetan ponies for Chinese tea, a practice dating back at least to the Song dynasty, when the sturdy horses were important for China to fight warring nomads in the north. Future In the 21st century, the legacy of the Tea-Horse Road has been used to promote a railway that will connect Chengdu to Lhasa. This planned railroad, part of the PRC's 13th 5-Year Plan, is called the Sichuan-Tibet railway (Â∑ùËóèÈìÅË∑Ø); it will connect cities across the route including Kangding. Authorities claim it will bring great benefit to the people's welfare.http://news.cntv.cn/2015/08/13/ARTI1439458357250340.shtml Gallery File:È£û‰ªôÈòÅÊë©Â¥ñÈÄ†ÂÉèÁÖßÁâá.JPGFeixiange Grottoes (689 AD), Buddhist art on the route from Chengdu to Ya'an.

A blackout during war, or in preparation for an expected war, is the practice of collectively minimizing outdoor light, including upwardly directed (or reflected) light. This was done in the 20th century to prevent crews of enemy aircraft from being able to identify their targets by sight, for example during the London Blitz of 1940. In coastal regions a shore-side blackout of city lights also helped protect ships from being seen in silhouette against the shore by enemy submarines farther out at sea. M. R. D. Foot argues that blackouts did not impair navigation by bombers because navigators focused more on reflective bodies of water, railroad tracks, or large highways. World War I Plans to black out British coastal towns in the event of war were drawn up in 1913 by Winston Churchill in his role as First Lord of the Admiralty; these plans were implemented on 12 August 1914, eight days after the United Kingdom had entered the war. (p. 51) On 1 October 1914, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ordered that bright exterior lights were to be extinguished or dimmed in the London area and street lamps be partially painted out with black paint. Elsewhere, the matter was left to local authorities. Following the start of the German strategic bombing campaign early in 1915, ordinary people in towns without blackouts sometimes took the law into their own hands, smashing street lamps which they thought might attract an air raid.Wiggam p. 54 Blackout restrictions were extended to the whole of England in February 1916.Wiggam p. 52 In France, a blackout was implemented for Paris at the start of the Zeppelin campaign in the spring of 1915, but was later relaxed, only to be reintroduced in the spring of 1918 when the Germans began using heavy bombers against the city. In Germany, a blackout was only enforced in a zone 150 kilometres (93 miles) behind the Western Front.Wiggam p. 53 World War II During World War II, the Air Ministry had forecast that Britain would suffer night air bombing attacks causing large numbers of civilian casualties and mass destruction. It was widely agreed that navigation and targeting would be more difficult if man- made lights on the ground could be extinguished. As early as July 1939, Public Information Leaflet No 2 (part of the Air Raid Precautions (A.R.P.) training literature) warned of the need for popular discipline to ensure that the blackout regulations were fully enforced during the blackout periods. Blackout regulations were imposed on 1 September 1939, before the declaration of war. These required that all windows and doors should be covered at night with suitable material such as heavy curtains, cardboard or paint, to prevent the escape of any glimmer of light that might aid enemy aircraft. The Government ensured that the necessary materials were available. External lights such as street lights were switched off, or dimmed and shielded to deflect light downward. Essential lights such as traffic lights and vehicle headlights were fitted with slotted covers to deflect their beams downwards to the ground. Shops and factories had particular problems. Factories with large areas of glass roofing found it impossible to install temporary blackout panels and permanent methods (such as paint) lost natural light during daylight. Shops had to install double \\"airlock\\" doors to avoid lights showing as customers arrived and departed. Blackouts proved one of the more unpleasant aspects of the war, disrupting many civilian activities and causing widespread grumbling and lower morale. The blackout was enforced by civilian ARP wardens who would ensure that no buildings allowed the slightest peek or glow of light.The activities of ARP Wardens led to ambivalent public attitudes and the catch- phrase put that light out!. The BBC sitcom \\"Dad's Army\\" includes an officious and disliked Warden. Offenders were liable to stringent legal penalties. Blackout restrictions greatly increased the dangers of night driving and fatalities increased as a consequence. As a result, some aspects were relaxed and speed limits were lowered. Unsurprisingly, fatalities were also recorded amongst merchant seaman falling into the docks at night and drowning during the blackout. Crime also increased under cover of darkness, from looting, theft, burglary, and robbery, to fraud, cons, and gang-related activities, to rape and murder, and even serial murder. As German war-making capability declined, a \\"Dim-out\\" was introduced in September 1944, which allowed lighting to the equivalent of moonlight. A full Blackout would be imposed if an alert was sounded. Full lighting of streets was allowed in April 1945; on 30 April, the day Hitler committed suicide, Big Ben was lit 5 years and 123 days after the Blackout was first imposed. Moving ship silhouetted against city lights. Since the attack on Pearl Harbor, the continental United States was exposed to air attacks while engaging in a war with Japan, such as the bombing of Dutch Harbor, the Lookout Air Raids, and the Fu-Go balloon bombs, but these were considered minor or negligible and did nothing to damage American morale and war effort. Along the Atlantic coast, the lack of a coastal blackout served to silhouette Allied shipping and thus expose them to German submarine attack. Coastal communities resisted the imposition of a blackout for amenity reasons, citing potential damage to tourism. The result was a disastrous loss of shipping, dubbed by German submariners as the \\"Second Happy Time\\".Gannon, Michael. 1990. Operation Drumbeat: The Dramatic True Story of Germany's First U-Boat Attacks Along the American Coast in World War II. Harper and Row. Blackouts were held in cities, and along the coastal areas long after any enemy threat existed; the primary purpose was psychological motivation of the civilian population which saw blackouts as a patriotic duty. Techniques A blackout curtain used in Auckland, New Zealand during World War II. Lights can simply be turned off or light can sometimes be minimized by tarring the windows of large public structures. In World War II, a dark blackout curtain was used to keep the light inside. Tarring the windows can mean a semi- permanent blackout status. During the 1940s and 1950s, cities such as Detroit would practise blackout air raid drills. During this time, the city's Civil Defense workers would immediately activate the neighborhood air raid siren and families would be required to do the following in order: # Shut off all appliances, such as stoves, ovens, furnaces # Shut off valves for water and natural gas or propane, as well as disconnect electricity # Close blackout curtains (plain black curtains that would block light from coming in or going out). This step was changed after the atomic age began: where white curtains were used to reflect the thermal flash of the bomb, black curtains were used in World War II to prevent any airborne enemies from seeing light from windows # Get to a public shelter, a fallout or bomb shelter, or the household basement, and stay there until the local police or block warden dismissed the blackout. Modern technology The benefits of blackouts against air attack are now largely nullified in the face of a technologically sophisticated enemy. As early as World War II, aircraft were using radio-beam navigation (see \\"Battle of the Beams\\"), and targets were detected by air-to-ground radar, (e.g. H2X). Today, not only are night-vision goggles readily available to air crews, but sophisticated satellite-based and inertial navigation systems enable a static target to be found easily by aircraft and guided missiles. Nevertheless, during the 1991 Gulf War, authorities in Baghdad practised blackouts along with other civil defence procedures, before the Gulf War air campaign began striking the city.

The two started performing in 1973 while taking a break from the four-man comedy act The Firesign Theatre, with the comedy album \\"TV or Not TV\\", on which they based a short film in 1978. They reunited the Firesign Theatre in 1974, but resumed their duo act in 1975 during a second temporary split of the Firesigns, and continued to perform as a duo during several breaks of the Firesign Theatre until Bergman's death in 2012. History Peter Bergman and Philip Proctor met while attending Yale University in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting, and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with Austin Pendleton on two Yale Dramat musicals in which Proctor starred: Tom Jones, and Booth Is Back In Town. Proctor was in Los Angeles in 1966, looking for acting work and watching the Sunset Strip curfew riots. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for the comedy group he formed, along with producers Phil Austin and David Ossman. Bergman christened the group the Firesign Theatre, as all four were born under the three astrological fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius). In 1972, the Firesign Theatre combined parts of a live stage show, the Shakespeare parody The Count of Monte Cristo, with a live KPFK broadcast, Martian Space Party, plus some new studio material to produce their sixth album Not Insane or Anything You Want To. But before releasing the album in October 1972, they had discarded their original story line idea and some newly written scenes. The album performed poorly, and the Firesigns decided to take a break and perform in separate directions for a while. Proctor and Bergman decided to perform as a duo, and made a separate record deal with Columbia, producing TV or Not TV: A Video Vaudeville in Two Acts. They turned this into a vaudeville-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey Wolfman Jack. The Firesign Theatre reunited in 1974 and produced three more comedy albums for Columbia. The ninth one, In the Next World, You're on Your Own, was a black comedy which also sold poorly in 1975, and caused the Firesigns to lose their Columbia recording contract. They effectively split in half again, and Proctor and Bergman turned their attention to producing a live show and Columbia album, What This Country Needs, based in part on material from TV or Not TV. They appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the Starland Vocal Band. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 Golden Dragon Massacre, and in 1978 released another studio album Give Us a Break, which lampooned radio and television. The Starland Vocal Band also performed short comic radio breaks on this album. In 1979, Proctor and Bergman produced a film, J-Men Forever, using clips from old Republic Pictures movie serials with dubbed dialogue, combined with new footage of them as FBI agents tracking down a villain known as \\"the Lightning Bug\\" voiced by disk jockey M. G. Kelly. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series Night Flight. The Firesign Theatre reunited again late in 1979, but the changing American social and political climate marked by the election of President Ronald Reagan caused a cooling-off of the Theatre's first wave of popularity. In the summer of 1990, NPR producer Ted Bonnitt called Proctor and asked him if he wanted to contribute some comedy material to Bonnitt's nightly program HEAT with John Hockenberry. Proctor called Bergman, and the duo agreed to write and perform a serial consisting of 13 five-minute episodes, Power: Life on the Edge in L.A. In 1993, the Firesign Theatre reunited for a ten-city cross-country reunion tour, and experienced a second wave of popularity. They produced five albums of new material and continued to perform live, until Bergman's death on March 9, 2012, from complications involving leukemia. Original text The two Midwestern members of the group performed as a double act for a while in the mid-1970s and recorded a few albums,https://laugh.com/product- category/proctor-bergman-classic-comedyfiresign-theatreproctor-bergman/ though all four members continued to perform and record together. In 1977, they were regulars on a summer replacement television series on CBS hosted by the Starland Vocal Band. After the series, at the peak of their career as a duo, the performers and their entourage were eating a post show meal when they were ancillary to the Golden Dragon massacre. When Army veteran Bergman realized the perpetrators had emptied their weapons, he rose in time to see their faces as they exited, later testifying in their conviction. While only one person in their party was wounded in the massacre, it took the air out of their will to continue on the road. The screenplay for the 1979 movie Americathon was an adaptation by others of a play written by Proctor and Bergman.

Baseball career Tuttle was born and grew up in Cramer , a small farming community located south of Elmwood, Illinois, and three miles southeast of Farmington, where his parents operated a general store. After attending Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, he played in his first major league game on September 10, 1952. In his 11-year career, Tuttle had a .259 batting average, with 149 doubles, 47 triples, 67 home runs and 443 RBIs. He had 1,105 career hits. His finest offensive seasons came in and . In the former year, he reached career highs in runs scored (102), home runs (14) and runs batted in (78). In the latter season, Tuttle batted .300 for the only time in his MLB tenure, collecting 139 hits in 126 games. Throughout his career, he was considered one of the most reliable defensive players in the game, leading all American League outfielders in putouts in 1955 and 1960 and assists in 1959 and 1960. He also led center fielders in assists in 1955, and 1958. Advocacy On practically every baseball card issued for Tuttle, a large bulge of chewing tobacco is evident in his cheek. Tuttle died in Anoka, Minnesota, at the age of 69, and oral cancer was in all likelihood the cause of his death.

It also offers delivery (from some stores), take-out and private dining. Bertucci's was founded by Joey Crugnale in Davis Square, Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1981. The company expanded rapidly during the 1990s. Bertucci's locations are primarily found in the Northeast, but range as far south as Virginia. N.E. Restaurant Co. Inc. bought out Bertucci's in 1998, adopting the Bertucci's Co. name in 2001.  History  Joseph (\\"Joey\\") Crugnale, Bertucci's founder, was born in Sulmona, Italy. He landed his first job in a restaurant while in high school, after emigrating to Boston. He worked as a porter at the Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge. In 1974 he opened his first ice cream stand. In 1975, he refinanced his father's home and purchased Steve's Ice Cream from founder Steve Herrell for $80,000. Crugnale established 26 stores before selling the concept to Integrated Resources in 1983 for $4.5 million. The first 'Bertucci's Pizza and Bocce' was opened in 1981, two doors from Steve's Ice Cream in Davis Square. Bertucci's was opened to eliminate the possibility of an ice cream competitor moving in. The name was found in a magazine during a flight to New York City. The original location had a bocce court in the basement, as did the second location, in Brookline.  1980s  Two more Massachusetts restaurants opened in 1985, in Cambridge and Holliston, MA. They featured open-hearth brick oven specialty pizzas topped with ingredients such as artichoke hearts and roasted eggplant. No two Bertucci's were alike to avoid marketing as a chain. The Brookline restaurant contained an outdoor bocce court. It planned to operate 20 restaurants by 1990. The Brookline restaurant closed in September 2009. While the company grew it spent less than 1 percent of revenues on advertising, relying on word of mouth. USA Today listed Bertucci's as one of America's top 10 pizza restaurants in 1989; by then, its headquarters were in Woburn. 1990s In the 1990s Bertucci's menu added soups, salads, and pasta dishes before expanding into Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. (Now closed) Bertucci's became a publicly owned company in July 1991. The company offered 21 units for $13 per share. That year sales increased 30 percent to $37.4 million and net income increased by 90 percent to $3 million. Stock prices nearly doubled, selling for $24.75 per share.]Keynote Entrepreneur: Bertucci's Inc. In 1992 delivery and take-out services were added; Bertucci's grew from 26 to 36 stores. In 1994, it expanded to Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago; Orlando, Florida; and New Jersey. Bertucci's had 63 stores by 1995. A $10.4 million wrongful death lawsuit against Bertucci's was filed in July 1995. Janet Walker, of Salem, New Hampshire, went into anaphylactic shock and then slipped into a coma after ingesting pesto sauce that contained nuts. The waitress, according to the lawsuit, failed to mention the nuts. A week later, Walker died. The case never went to trial. Joey Crugnale attempted to take the chain private again in 1998, but though the board approved his attempt, he was outbid. N.E. Restaurant Co. Inc. purchased Bertucci's for $10.50 a share during the buyout. Crugnale has moved on to own two individual restaurants, Naked Fish in Waltham, Massachusetts, and Red Sauce (now closed).  2000s  In 2001, N.E. Restaurant Co. Inc. sold its Chili's and On the Border restaurants to Brinker International,Brinker adds restaurants in New England and changed its name to Bertucci's Corp. A $4 million advertising tagline \\"Everybody Eats\\" was developed in April 2002. In 2006, Italian chain Vinny T's rebranded as Buca di Beppo and withdrew from some markets. As part of their consolidation, they sold 11 Boston locations to Bertucci's Corp. 2010s In 2011, The Boston Globe did a DNA investigation of fish available in area restaurants and supermarkets and determined that 50% of the fish was not properly labelled as to species. Bertucci's was asked for comment, and acted swiftly to correct the issue ‚Äì an article on their search to find an acceptable serving of cod to replace the hake that their supplier had sourced them with appeared at the same time as the report on the investigation. On December 3, 2012, Bertucci's opened its first 2Ovens concept restaurant in the re-vamped White City shopping center in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. The brick ovens are the only method of cooking in the restaurant. On April 15, 2018, Bertucci's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The chain is expected to close about half of their locations and the plans are to hold an auction for the remainder of the company. The opening bid would be for $19.7 million and if no higher bid come is made, an affiliate of Right Lane Capital has agreed to purchase the chain. The company owes approximately $9 million to their suppliers and $110 million to financial lenders.

The series was based on an idea by Kevin O'Donnell and developed for television by Kevin O'Donnell, Robby London, Mike Maliani, and Andy Heyward. It received two Daytime Emmy nominations, in 2003 and 2004, both for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program (Walter Cronkite, playing Benjamin Franklin).Liberty's Kids: Awards Internet Movie Database Its purpose is to teach its viewers about the origins of the United States. Like the cartoon mini-series This Is America, Charlie Brown earlier before, Liberty's Kids tells of young people in dramas surrounding the major events in the Revolutionary War days. The theme song was performed by Aaron Carter and Kayla Hickle. Celebrity voice talents such as Walter Cronkite (as Benjamin Franklin), Sylvester Stallone (as Paul Revere), Ben Stiller (as Thomas Jefferson), Billy Crystal (as John Adams), Annette Bening (as Abigail Adams), Dustin Hoffman (as Benedict Arnold), Michael Douglas (as Patrick Henry), Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Baron von Steuben), Liam Neeson (as John Paul Jones), Whoopi Goldberg (as Deborah Sampson), and Don Francisco (as Bernardo de G√°lvez) lend credence to characters critical to the forming of a free country, from the Boston Tea Party to the Constitutional Convention. The episodes run a half-hour, including commercials. During PBS airings, these are replaced by segments that include \\"The Liberty News Network\\" or LNN (a newscast delivered by Cronkite summarizing the events of the episode, with each including his trademark sign-off \\"that's the way it is\\"), \\"Mystery Guest\\" (a guessing game where the kids guess a historical figure, who often is a character in the episode), \\"Now and Then\\" (a segment comparing life in the Revolutionary Era and today), and \\"Continental Cartoons\\" (a rebus word guessing game). The LNN segments were produced and art directed by designer Mike Bundlie. Plot Benjamin Franklin and four fictional associates of his in their experiences during the American Revolution. Although the series spans 16 years from the Boston Tea Party in 1773 to the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, no main characters appear to age much, except for Dr. Franklin. Characters=Fictional characters * Sarah Phillips (voiced by Reo Jones) ‚Äì A bright-eyed redheaded girl from England, Sarah travels to the Thirteen Colonies in 1773 at age fifteen in search of her father, Major Phillips, who was last heard exploring the region of Ohio; upon her arrival, she is warmly welcomed by and lives as a guest of Benjamin Franklin. Her mother, Lady Phillips, remains in England and is a good friend to Dr. Franklin. However, with the possibility of a war between the American colonists and the English mother country, she decides that she will become a reporter for Franklin's newspaper in order to offer a more balanced perspective to the press. Sarah believes firmly in the power of words and equal rights for all, and is not afraid to speak her mind. At the start of the series, she is a firm loyalist, which sparks many arguments between her and James. Later in the series, Sarah has a change of heart and realizes how much she has come to understand the people of the colonies and ends up supporting the Revolution. Some men know the way to her heart ‚Äì good manners; when this happens, James can seem almost jealous, although near the end of the series she appears to feel \\"more than friendship\\" for James. Throughout the series, Sarah and James grow closer. At the end of the series, her mother, Lady Phillips, joins Sarah and her father in the United States and Sarah hopes to explore more of her adopted country. * James Hiller (voiced by Chris Lundquist) ‚Äì A young American colonist who works as an apprentice journalist for Franklin's newspaper. James holds a great deal of respect and admiration for Dr. Franklin and his works, particularly his invention of the lightning rod, as when he was an infant both his parents died in a fire caused by a lightning strike. Street-smart and impulsive, James pursues the revolution from a slightly one-sided perspective ‚Äì something that prompts Sarah to counter his views. An apprentice in Franklin's Print Shop, James believes firmly in the American cause and will do almost anything to ensure that the people receive an honest view of what is happening. In the process, he also faces the less positive aspects of the political conflict that eventually forces his patriotic fervor into a new maturity. He highly values his friends, Sarah and Henri. He can be a little protective of Sarah while he attempts to keep Henri out of trouble, acting somewhat like an older brother figure to Henri. He is very laid-back and is constantly reminded of his bad etiquette and poor table manners by Sarah, toward whom he shows feelings of what might be \\"more than friendship\\". At the end of the series, James intends to start his own newspaper, following in the steps of his mentor. * Henri Richard Maurice Dutoit LeFevbre (voiced by Kathleen Barr) ‚Äì An energetic, rambunctious French boy, Henri shares a similar tragic story as James. Several years earlier, when he was six years old and still living in France, his parents made an agreement with a merchant for seven years of labor in exchange for passage to North America. However, during the voyage an illness broke out aboard the ship, killing half of those on board, including both Henri's parents. The merchant decided to make Henri his cabin boy and treated him very cruelly, until James and Moses discovered him locked in a cage while collecting a new printer from the merchant. Together they smuggled Henri off the ship and the boy found a home in Benjamin Franklin's workshop. While he speaks French fluently, Dr. Franklin has insisted that Henri learn to speak, read, and write in both English and French. Henri's small size has proved more than useful to Sarah and James, though he has a tendency to land himself in all sorts of trouble while not fully understanding the dangers of the war. His lookout on life is that of a \\"huge party for his benefit\\" and he has been labeled a \\"magnet for trouble.\\" In later episodes, he serves on the drum and bugle corps of the Continental Army. Curious and fearless, the only thing Henri values more than his freedom is finding a family of his own. At the end of the series he returns to France with Marquis de Lafayette, whom he had become close to during the series almost as a son. It is implied that Lafayette adopts Henri as his foster-son. * Moses (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) ‚Äì Born in Africa, Moses was brought in chains to North America as a slave and sold on the block in Charleston, South Carolina. Because of his ingenuity, Moses learned to read, forge metal, and buy his freedom from his master, thus freeing himself from the slavery of the American south. To keep from being confused for a runaway slave, Moses is required to carry papers proving that he is a free man. He eventually moved to Philadelphia and found work at Dr. Franklin's Print Shop. His brother, Cato, had not been so fortunate but later escaped, joining the British troops as a soldier to earn his freedom. Cato appears again at the end of the series when he does not tell on an African American Patriot spy, James Armistead, whose spying was crucial to the American victory at Yorktown, which ends the war for American independence. Moses looks out for Dr. Franklin's young wards, especially Henri. Like Henri, he values his freedom more than anything. Iron-willed Moses will never allow anyone to strip him of his dignity, despite his or her feelings on race. By working at the Print Shop, Moses hopes to educate children of all colors in the ideals of America so that everyone may one day be free. At the end of the series, Moses reveals a plan to set up a school for free black children, both boys and girls, but only to Dr. Franklin and Marquis de Lafayette. Cato goes to Canada with Mrs. Radcliffe, a British loyalist and friend of Sarah and her mother.

They include other forms of this pigment, such as chlorophyll b in green algal and higher plant antennae, while other algae may contain chlorophyll c or d. In addition, there are many non-chlorophyll accessory pigments, such as carotenoids or phycobiliproteins, which also absorb light and transfer that light energy to photosystem chlorophyll. Some of these accessory pigments, in particular the carotenoids, also serve to absorb and dissipate excess light energy, or work as antioxidants. The large, physically associated group of chlorophylls and other accessory pigments is sometimes referred to as a pigment bed. The different chlorophyll and non-chlorophyll pigments associated with the photosystems all have different absorption spectra, either because the spectra of the different chlorophyll pigments are modified by their local protein environment or because the accessory pigments have intrinsic structural differences. The result is that, in vivo, a composite absorption spectrum of all these pigments is broadened and flattened such that a wider range of visible and infrared radiation is absorbed by plants and algae. Most photosynthetic organisms do not absorb green light well, thus most remaining light under leaf canopies in forests or under water with abundant plankton is green, a spectral effect called the \\"green window\\". Organisms such as some cyanobacteria and red algae contain accessory phycobiliproteins that absorb green light reaching these habitats. In aquatic ecosystems, it is likely that the absorption spectrum of water, along with gilvin and tripton (dissolved and particulate organic matter, respectively), determines phototrophic niche differentiation. The six shoulders in the light absorption of water between wavelengths 400 and 1100 nm correspond to troughs in the collective absorption of at least twenty diverse species of phototrophic bacteria. Another effect is due to the overall trend for water to absorb low frequencies, while gilvin and tripton absorb higher ones. This is why open ocean appears blue and supports yellow species such as Prochlorococcus, which contains divinyl-chlorophyll a and b. Synechococcus, colored red with phycoerythrin, is adapted to coastal bodies, while phycocyanin allows Cyanobacteria to thrive in darker inland waters.

Angels Baseball LP was a legal case over the terms of the team's lease of the city-owned stadium. City of Anaheim v. Angels Baseball LP is a lawsuit filed in Orange County, California Superior Court by the city of Anaheim, California against the owners of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Major League Baseball franchise, concerning the team's official name. The lawsuit and a related political and public relations battle sought to reverse the team's official name change from Anaheim Angels to Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, which the city characterized as a breach of the team's lease on the city-owned Angel Stadium of Anaheim. The city was unsuccessful, as both a trial jury and an appellate court ruled in the team's favor. The Angels franchise was founded as the Los Angeles Angels in 1961 and played under that name until 1965, when it changed its name to California Angels upon its move from Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium to the new Anaheim Stadium (now Angel Stadium of Anaheim). In 1996, the Angels and the city of Anaheim agreed on a new lease that called for the city to fund renovations to Anaheim Stadium, and called for the team's name to contain the name \\"Anaheim\\". The following year, the team's official name changed again to Anaheim Angels. In 2003, the team was sold to Arturo \\"Arte\\" Moreno. Less than two years later, the team announced it was changing its name to Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, an attempt to market the team as being from Southern California‚ÄîMajor League Baseball's second-largest media market‚Äîrather than just Orange County. The \\"of Anaheim\\" phrase was included to comply with the terms of the 1996 lease. Anaheim city officials immediately denounced the change, characterizing it as a breach of the lease. Likewise, many fans denounced the change, as many Orange County residents consider Orange County to have its own identity separate from Los Angeles. A preliminary injunction filed by the city seeking to immediately reverse the name change was unsuccessful, and the Angels began playing under the new name for the 2007 season. Background=Autry ownership The present-day Angels franchise began play as the Los Angeles Angels in . Owned by actor Gene Autry and his wife Jackie, they played their inaugural season at Wrigley Field in South Los Angeles (not to be confused with the Chicago stadium of the same name). They moved to Dodger Stadium the following season, becoming tenants of the National League's Los Angeles Dodgers for four seasons. During the season, Gene Autry struck a deal with the suburban city of Anaheim on a new stadium for the Angels. The team changed its name to California Angels late in the season, as they were the only American League team in the state at the time, and moved to the city-owned Anaheim Stadium in . They would play under this moniker for over 30 seasons. Anaheim name change In The Walt Disney Company acquired a 25% interest in the Angels from the Autrys. The following year, the team changed its name to Anaheim Angels, the result of an agreement between the city and the team to refurbish and downsize Anaheim Stadium after the 1994 departure of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis. One clause of the new lease required that the team name contain the name \\"Anaheim\\". There was precedent for the name \\"Anaheim\\" in a major professional sports team name, as the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now known as the Anaheim Ducks), also owned by Disney, were enfranchised in 1993. Disney acquired the remaining share of the team in , less than a year after Gene Autry's death. Moreno ownership Arte Moreno (right) poses for a picture with an Angels fan. Early in the season, Disney sold the team to Arturo \\"Arte\\" Moreno, a fourth-generation Mexican American billboard magnate from Arizona. Though he vowed to keep the team in Anaheim, starting in the 2004 season, all references to Anaheim began disappearing from the Angels players' uniforms, officially licensed merchandise, web site, ticket media, and promotional materials, and were replaced with \\"Angels\\", \\"Angels Baseball\\", or the Angels' wordmark or halo insignia. On January 3, 2005 the Angels announced that the club's official name was being changed to Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In its official announcement, team spokesmen pointed out the Angels had been originally created as the American League's representative of the Greater Los Angeles area, which comprises the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino, in addition to Orange County. New owner Moreno believed the new name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County, thereby tapping into Major League Baseball's second largest media market. The of Anaheim phrase was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at Angel Stadium which requires that the team's name \\"include the name Anaheim therein\\", although it was correctly anticipated that the team would be referred to as simply the \\"Los Angeles Angels\\" by the media and the majority of the public. At the same time they announced the name change, the Angels aggressively marketed themselves to Los Angeles, buying space on nearly 500 billboards in the area that read simply \\"City of ANGELS\\" in the team's wordmark. The Dodgers, not wanting to give up any of its market share to the Angels, countered with their own billboard campaign, featuring the slogan \\"LA Baseball\\" (with \\"LA\\" depicted in the team's insignia), and putting Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles on special giveaway merchandise for Opening Day 2005. =Fan response= The name change upset some fans from Orange County who did not wish to be associated with Los Angeles. It has been claimed that a cultural divide (the \\"Orange Curtain\\") exists between Orange County and Los Angeles. Some fans suggested that Moreno, an Arizona native, did not take into account the alleged animosity between residents of the two counties when he attempted to restore the team's original name. Some fans wished for either the name to stay the same, or even for an alternate rename to the \\"Orange County Angels.\\" Some fans made and sold unlicensed merchandise with messages such as \\"We are not LA\\" and \\"Anaheim Angels of Anaheim\\" . Lawsuit Anaheim Mayor Curt Pringle and other city officials asserted that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney, and that the wording of the clause was merely to allow Disney some \\"wiggle room\\" in selecting the team name (Disney chairman Michael Eisner reportedly considered naming the team the Mighty Angels of Anaheim). They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation while reducing annual revenue for the city. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball L.P. in Orange County Superior Court, seeking monetary damages and a restoration of the Anaheim Angels name. Concurrently, city politicians boycotted the city's luxury suite at Angel Stadium, including during the Angels' 2005 playoff run, opting instead to donate game tickets in the suite to various charities. A trial, initially set for November 7, 2005 was postponed until January 9, 2006. In addition to the lawsuit brought by the city of Anaheim, the mayors of every Orange County city, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, signed a petition opposing the name change, while the city councils of Anaheim, Irvine, and Los Angeles adopted formal resolutions opposing the name change. The Los Angeles resolution specifically stated that the city only recognizes professional sports teams bearing the name \\"Los Angeles\\" as those whose home facilities are within the Los Angeles city limits, including the National League's Dodgers, the NBA's Lakers and Clippers, the WNBA's Sparks, the NHL's Kings, and the Arena Football League's Avengers. Disney and the city of Los Angeles filed amicus curiae papers in Orange County Superior Court supporting Anaheim's position in its lawsuit against the team. The city also sought a preliminary injunction to immediately reverse the name change in advance of the trial, which was rejected by the superior court judge. The city appealed the judge's ruling to the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, which granted an unusual writ moving the city's case to the top of the docket and held a hearing on March 28, 2005. Though a ruling had been anticipated by April 7, 2005 the three judges of the appellate court merely urged the city and the team to work towards a settlement prior to trial. The appellate court ruled against Anaheim's request for an injunction on June 27, 2005. The case proceeded to jury trial on January 9, 2006, and on February 9, 2006, the jury found in favor of the team, determining that the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim name was in compliance with the lease, and thus denying the city any monetary compensation. Both citing the jury verdict finding the team in compliance and noting that his own conclusion agreed with that judgment, on March 2, 2006, the judge in the case formally denied the city's request to force the team to restore the Anaheim Angels name. Appeal On February 26, 2007, the city of Anaheim appealed the jury's decision, citing some testimony that it wanted to present but was not heard in the jury trial, and sought to recoup an estimated US$7 million in court costs. On December 20, 2008, a state appellate court issued a split decision denying the city's appeal and refusing to either set aside the jury's verdict or order the team to pay for the city's court costs. On January 13, 2009, Anaheim's city council voted not to further appeal the court's decisions, bringing a conclusion to the legal battle. Aftermath Despite the legal victory, the team only uses its full name on official press releases and its website, and continues to market itself without direct reference to location wherever possible. Neither \\"Los Angeles\\" nor \\"Anaheim\\" appears on the team's uniforms or officially licensed merchandise or promotional materials; \\"Angels\\" or \\"Angels Baseball\\" are used instead. Major League Baseball and the national media have recognized the name change from the beginning, and team ownership correctly predicted that the national media and the general public would drop \\"of Anaheim\\" out of convenience and refer to the team as simply the \\"Los Angeles Angels.\\" And, prior to the 2016 season, the Angels officially dropped ‚Äúof Anaheim‚Äù from their name. Despite the prolonged legal battle, organized fan resistance to the new name subsided long before the appellate court ruling. The name controversy and the city's suit and boycott did little to quell fan enthusiasm for the team, as Angel Stadium consistently drew over 3.3 million fans through its gates each season from 2004 to 2008. It also had little to no impact on the team's on-field performance‚Äîthey won four American League West division titles over the same timespan, marking the most successful era in franchise history. The controversy also did little to negatively impact the perception of team ownership around the league, as evidenced by the Angels being selected to host the 2010 All-Star Game, with MLB Commissioner Bud Selig calling the Angels a \\"model franchise.\\" In 2007, the Angels' name change was the inspiration for the independent minor league Long Beach Armada baseball team's tongue-in-cheek name change to the Long Beach Armada of Los Angeles of California of the United States of North America Including Barrow, Alaska. The \\"Truth in Sports Advertising Act\\" On February 22, 2005, California state assemblyman Tom Umberg introduced a truth in advertising bill (AB 1041) in the State Assembly. If signed into law, the \\"Truth in Sports Advertising Act\\" would have required the Angels to disclose on all tickets and promotional materials that the team's home is Anaheim, not Los Angeles, unless Anaheim or Orange County exempted the franchise from the requirement. On May 16, 2005, the bill passed the California Assembly by a margin of 52‚Äì17 and was sent to the California State Senate where, on May 26, 2005, it was referred to the Business, Professions and Economic Development Committee. State Senate hearings scheduled on June 7 and June 27, 2005 were cancelled at the request of Assemblyman Umberg. On July 11, 2005, the hearing was postponed indefinitely by the Senate committee, effectively killing the bill. ReferencesExternal links * City of Anaheim v. Superior Court, no. G037202, (Cal.

Formed in 1999, they released two EPs and two full length albums before disbanding in 2008. Hoeffleur described their music as \\"influenced by old-school punk (Wire, Minutemen, Misfits) and old-school country (Hank, Lefty, Patsy, Johnny) with a dash of singer/songwriter (Leonard Cohen, Nick Drake)\\".http://www.thebeautyshopband.com/images/TBSonesheet.pdf History The Beauty Shop was formed by John Hoeffleur and drummer Casey Smith in 1999, in Champaign, Illinois. Hoeffleur (b. Arlington Heights, Illinois, November 26, 1977) grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, and graduated from the University of Illinois. He had previously played with local band The Blackouts, and on his own playing in local coffee shops. The duo's first release was The Grief EP, a self-released limited edition recorded in Smith's home, which they sold at local concerts.Beauty Shop : Interview The EP caught the eye of the Urbana, Illinois-based record label Parasol Records, who signed the band to produce an album. At the same time, the band put out hand-written ads for a bassist, and recruited Ariane Peralta. The band released their first album Yr. Money or Yr. Life in October 2000. The album garnered many positive critical reviews, and the band attracted a growing audience at its live performances, boosted when they opened at the last minute for The Violent Femmes in Champaign. According to one reviewer, \\"the unsettling cover art reflected the bleakness of Hoeffleur's lyrical vision ‚Ä¶ spinning tales of dysfunctional characters drawn into seemingly terminal decline.\\"MyStrands: The Beauty Shop In August 2001, Smith left the band, and Hoeffleur played several solo shows before he and Peralta recruited drummer Joe Martin in early 2002. By that time, the album had been licensed to Shoeshine Records in Scotland, who released it in the UK. Shoeshine also released a limited-edition 7\\" single of \\"Death March\\", the single from Yr. Money or Yr. Life. The band toured across the UK in July 2002 to promote the album's release, again gaining critical acclaim. However, they then took a second hiatus after Martin left, with Hoeffleur playing solo shows in the UK, and Peralta concentrating on school. The Beauty Shop reformed in 2004 to record a second album, Crisis Helpline, with drummer Steve Lamos. In July 2004 they returned to live performance in the United States, with drummer Brett Sanderson, of The Blackouts. Crisis Helpline was released in Europe in September 2004, the record company concentrating on seeking to break the band there first. They also released a 7\\" and CD single, \\"Monster\\", which enjoyed considerable airplay on BBC 6 in the UK. A second single, \\"Rumplestiltskin Lives\\", was released to UK radio stations in spring 2005. The band then signed to Bryan Morrisson's label, Snapper Records, in summer 2005. The label released two further singles in the UK, Paper Hearts for Josie (August 2005) and A Desperate Cry for Help (October 2005). New drummer Ben Ucherek replaced Sanderson for the filming of the video for \\"A Desperate Cry for Help\\". In April 2006, they released a hybrid album of the best tracks from their previous releases, Yard Sale. Their song \\"I Got Issues\\" was listed in Maxim magazine as \\"the #4 Song to download if you're missing Johnny Cash\\". They often include cover songs as B-sides. Their single release Monster includes a cover of the Misfits' \\"Hybrid Moments\\", Paper Hearts for Josie included The Pixies' \\"Gouge Away\\", A Desperate Cry Help contained Judas Priest's \\"Breaking the Law\\", and Death March featured a cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\". The band often played at The Great Cover-up, an annual Champaign-Urbana based charity show. Bassist Ariane Peralta left in late 2006 to pursue a PhD at university. She was replaced by Eric Fisher, formerly of the band Lorenzo Goetz. In October 2007, the band released a new EP, Just Some Demos, on their own label. The Beauty Shop disbanded in the summer of 2008 with the departure of Eric Fisher to Oregon and Ben Ucherek focusing his time on his new band Golden Quality. The band played its final show on June 6, 2008, at the Canopy Club in Urbana, Illinois. In late 2008, after the group disbanded, a new song entitled NuFuture was released on their MySpace page. The band's final demos were given a digital-only release as Just Some More Demos in January 2009. In mid-2009, Hoeffleur formed a new band, Heyokas, with Kelly McMorris (keyboards), Marc Turner (bass), and Jesse Greenlee (drums). With a line-up of Hoeffleur, Peralta and Ucherek, the Beauty Shop reformed for a one-off show in Champaign-Urbana in January 2016.

In addition, there are over a dozen smaller islets as Quign√©nec, Brilimec or Kastell Bargain. √éle aux Moutons, halfway to the continent, is considered to be a part of the archipelago.

An international diving school is also present on the islands. The islands are a popular tourist destination, particularly as a daytrip for those holidaying in the rest of Finist√®re. Both the presence of a shallow seabed and the availability of a catamaran with windows in its base have greatly contributed to this. It is difficult to stay on the islands overnight, as there is no hotel, and camping is forbidden. One or two small guesthouses exist. The islands are powered by a combined power plant.

The Microcord (1951) was based on the Rolleicord; it was soon (1952) followed by the Microcord Mk II, with an improved shutter (the German Prontor). The Ross lens is of high quality. In 1958, MPP brought out the lever-wound Microflex, inspired by the Rolleiflex. This had excellent optics (by Taylor, Taylor and Hobson) and the camera was well made, but the crank invited hard use for which it was not designed. Shortly after its introduction, Britain dropped the high duty rates that had made Rollei equipment prohibitively expensive, and the Microflex had to be heavily discounted. Other products included enlargers (even for large format), projectors, dark slides, carrying cases and a flashgun that was similar in design and appearance to Graflex models.

Her wealth contributed to the popularity of psychoanalysis, and enabled Freud's escape from Nazi Germany. Marie Bonaparte was a great-grandniece of Emperor Napoleon I of France. She was the only child of Roland Napol√©on Bonaparte (1858‚Äì1924) and Marie-F√©lix Blanc (1859‚Äì1882). Her paternal grandfather was Prince Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte, son of Lucien Bonaparte, 1st Prince of Canino and Musignano, Napoleon's rebellious younger brother.Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd. \\"Burke‚Äôs Royal Families of the World: Volume I Europe & Latin America, 1977, pp. 105-107, 325. For this reason, despite her title Marie was not a member of the dynastic branch of the Bonapartes who claimed the French imperial throne from exile. Her maternal grandfather was Fran√ßois Blanc, the principal real-estate developer of Monte Carlo. It was from this side of her family that Marie inherited her great fortune. Early life The young Marie Bonaparte during the 1890s She was born at Saint-Cloud, a town in Hauts-de-Seine, √éle- de-France and called Mimi within the family. Her maternal grandfather, Fran√ßois Blanc, had left an estimated fortune of FF 88M when he died in 1877. However, his widow, born Marie Hensel, left mostly debts for her three children, including Marie's mother Marie-F√©lix, to pay off upon her death in July 1881. Prince Roland protected his wife's fortune by persuading her to renounce that of her late mother before the amount of her debts became known. Marie-Felix died of an embolism shortly after Marie's birth, leaving half of her FF 8.4M dowry to her husband and half to her daughter. Most was managed in trust during Marie's youth by her father, who had few financial resources of his own. Marie lived with her father, a published geographer and botanist, in Paris and on various family country estates where he studied, wrote and lectured, leading an active life in Parisian academic circles and on expeditions abroad, while her daily life was supervised by tutors and servants. Afflicted by phobias and hypochondria as a youth, Marie spent much of her time in seclusion, reading literature and writing the personal journals which reveal her inquisitive spirit and early commitment to the scientific method reflected in her father's scholarship. Married life Royal Monogram of Princess Marie Bonaparte Several candidates for future husband presented themselves or were considered by Prince Roland for his daughter's hand, notably a distant cousin of the princely House of Murat, Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Louis II, Prince of Monaco. Following a Parisian luncheon Prince Roland hosted for King George I of Greece in September 1906 during which the king agreed to the prospect of a marriage between their children, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, second of the king's five sons, was introduced to Marie on 19 July 1907 at the Bonapartes' home in Paris. He courted her for twenty-eight days, confiding that from 1883, George had lived not at his father's Greek court in Athens, but at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen with Prince Valdemar of Denmark, his father's youngest brother. The queen had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist him in the Danish royal navy and consigned him to the care of Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet. Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George described to his fianc√©e the profound attachment he developed for his uncle. He admitted that, contrary to what he knew were her hopes, he could not commit to living permanently in France since he was obligated to undertake royal duties in Greece or on its behalf if summoned to do so. Once his proposal of marriage was accepted, the bride's father was astonished when George waived any contractual clause guaranteeing an allowance or inheritance from Marie; she would retain and manage her own fortune (a trust yielding 800,000 francs per annum, her father leaving 60 million francs on his death in 1924) and only their future children would receive legacies. On 21 November 1907 in Paris, Marie and George were married in a civil ceremony, with a subsequent Greek Orthodox ceremony on 12 December 1907, at Athens. Thereafter she was known as Princess George of Greece and Denmark. By March 1908 Marie was pregnant and, as agreed, the couple returned to France to take up residence. When George brought his bride to Denmark for the first visit with his uncle, Prince Valdemar's wife, Marie d'Orl√©ans, was at pains to explain to Marie Bonaparte the intimacy which united uncle and nephew, so deep that at the end of each of George's several yearly visits to Bernstorff he would weep, Valdemar would fall sick, and the women learned the patience not to intrude upon their husbands' private moments. During the first of these visits, Marie Bonaparte and Valdemar found themselves engaging in the kind of passionate intimacies she had looked forward to with her husband who, however, only seemed to enjoy them vicariously, sitting or lying beside his wife and uncle. On a later visit, Marie Bonaparte carried on a passionate flirtation with Prince Aage, Count of Rosenborg, Valdemar's eldest son. In neither case does it appear that George objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention. Marie Bonaparte came to admire the forbearance and independence of Valdemar's wife under circumstances which caused her bewilderment and estrangement from her own husband. Although Marie occasionally joined her husband in Greece or elsewhere for national holidays and dynastic ceremonies, their life together was spent mostly on her estates in the French countryside. For months at a time, George was in Athens or Copenhagen, while Marie was in Paris, Vienna or traveling with the couple's children. That pattern allowed each to pursue activities in which the other had little interest. The couple had two children, Peter (1908‚Äì1980) and Eug√©nie (1910‚Äì1989). From 1913 to early 1916, Marie carried on an intense flirtation with French prime minister Aristide Briand, but went no further because she did not want to share him with his mistress, the actress Berthe Cerny. Matters came to a head in April 1916, when Berthe Cerny broke off the relationship. The affair with Briand lasted until May 1919. In 1915 Briand wrote to her that, having come to know and like Prince George, he felt guilty about their secret passion. George tried to persuade him that Greece, officially neutral during World War I but whose King was suspected of sympathy for the Central Powers, really hoped for an Allied victory: He may have influenced Briand to support the Allied expedition against the Bulgarians at Salonika. When the prince and princess returned in July 1915 to France following a visit to the ailing King Constantine I in Greece, her affair with Briand had become notorious and George expressed a restrained jealousy. By December 1916 the French fleet was shelling Athens and in Paris Briand was suspected, alternately, of having seduced Marie in a futile attempt to bring Greece over to the Allied side, or of having been seduced by her to oust Constantine and set George upon the Greek throne. Sexual research Despite what she described as sexual dysfunction, Marie Bonaparte conducted affairs with Freud's disciple Rudolph Loewenstein as well as Aristide Briand, her husband's aide-de-camp Lembessiss, a prominent married French physician, and possibly others. Troubled by her difficulty in achieving sexual fulfillment, Marie engaged in research.Peter Cryle and Alison Moore, Frigidity, an Intellectual History (Palrgave, 2011) In 1924, she published her results under the pseudonym A. E. Narjani and presented her theory of frigidity in the medical journal Bruxelles-M√©dical. Having measured the distance between the clitoris and the vagina in 243 women, she concluded after analyzing their sexual history that the distance between these two organs was critical for the ability to reach orgasm (\\"volupt√©\\"); she identified women with a short distance (the \\"paraclitoridiennes\\") who reached orgasm easily during intercourse, and women with a distance of more than two and a half centimeters (the \\"t√©leclitoridiennes\\") who had difficulties while the \\"mesoclitoriennes\\" were in between. Marie considered herself a \\"t√©leclitorienne\\" and approached Josef Halban to surgically move her clitoris closer to the vagina. She underwent and published the procedure as the Halban‚ÄìNarjani operation. When it proved unsuccessful in facilitating the sought-after outcome for Marie, the physician repeated the operation.Alison Moore, Relocating Marie Bonaparte‚Äôs Clitoris. Australian Feminist Studies 24 (60), April 2009, 149-165 She modeled for the Romanian modernist sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. His sculpture of her, \\"Princess X\\", created a scandal in 1919 when he represented her or caricatured her as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus symbolizes the model's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm. Freud In 1925, Marie consulted Freud for treatment of what she described as her frigidity, which was later explained as a failure to have orgasms during missionary position intercourse. It was to Marie Bonaparte that Freud remarked, \\"The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?'\\".Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, Vol. 2, pg. 421 (New York, NY: Basic Books, 1955). The 4th Century BC South Italian Apulian bell krater given by Marie Bonaparte to Sigmund Freud, which today contains the ashes of Freud and his wife MarthaMichael Turner, Sigmund Freud's collection an archaeology of the mind, pg. 43 (Sidney: MUMA, 2008). Although Prince George maintained friendly relations with Freud, in 1925 he asked Marie to give up her work in psychoanalytical studies and treatment to devote herself to their family life, but she declined. Robed in the diplomatic immunity of a member of a reigning European royal family and possessed of great wealth, Marie was often able to help those threatened or despoiled by World War II. When the Greek royal family were in exile or Greece was under occupation, she helped support her husband's banished relatives, including allowing the family of her husband's nephew, Prince Philip of Greece, to occupy one of her homes in Saint-Cloud and paying for their private schooling while sending her own children to public lyc√©es. Later she paid Freud's ransom to Nazi Germany and bought the letters Freud had written to Wilhelm Fliess about his use of cocaine from Fliess's widow when he could not afford her price. Freud wished the letters destroyed, but Marie refused, insisting that they were of historical importance. She agreed never to read them, however, and they were not published until 1984. She was also instrumental in delaying the search of Freud's apartment in Vienna by the Gestapo and later arranged for Freud to smuggle abroad some of his savings in a Greek diplomatic pouch. She persuaded Anton Sauerwald, a Nazi, to sign the papers enabling Freud to leave Vienna and also arranged for the transport to London of his books, collection of antiquities and analytic couch.Cohen, D. 2013 Freud and the British Royal Family, in \\"The Psychologist\\", Vol. 26, No. 6, June 2013, pp.462‚Äì463 Later life On 2 June 1953, Marie and her husband represented their nephew, King Paul of Greece, at the coronation of Elizabeth II in London. Bored with the pageantry, Marie offered a sampling of the psychoanalytic method to the gentleman seated next to her, the future French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Mitterrand obliged Marie, and the couple barely witnessed the pomp and ceremony, finding their own dialogue far more interesting. She practiced as a psychoanalyst until her death in 1962, providing substantial services to the development and promotion of psychoanalysis. She authored several books on psychoanalysis, translated Freud's work into French and founded the French Institute of Psychoanalysis (Soci√©t√© Psychoanalytique de Paris SPP) in 1926. In addition to her own work and preservation of Freud's legacy, she also offered financial support for G√©za R√≥heim's anthropological explorations. A scholar on Edgar Allan Poe, she wrote a biography and an interpretation of his work. Bonaparte's translation of a sentence in Freud's thirty-first Vorlesungen, \\"Wo Es war, soll Ich werden\\", has generated some controversy. Strachey translated it into English as \\"Where Id was, Ego shall be\\".Freud, S. (1949). An Outline of Psychoanalysis. (trans. James Strachey). New York. W. W. Norton & Co., Inc. Lacan, arguing that Freud used \\"das Es\\" and das Ich\\" when he intended the meaning to be \\"Id\\" and \\"Ego\\", suggested \\"Wo Es war, soll Ich werden\\" be translated \\"Where It was, there shall I come to be\\".Lacan J. (1955) Ecrits (trans. Bruce Fink), \\"The Freudian Thing\\". New York. W. W. Norton & Company; 1 edition (January 17, 2007) Bonaparte translated it into French as \\"le moi doit d√©loger le √ßa\\", meaning in English roughly \\"Ego must dislodge Id\\", which according to Lacan is directly contrary to Freud's intended meaning.Johnston, Adrian. Irrepressible Truth: On Lacan's 'The Freudian Thing'. Palgrave MacMillan . Death She died of leukemia in Saint-Tropez on 21 September 1962. She was cremated in Marseille, and her ashes were interred in Prince George's tomb at Tato√Ø, near Athens. Legacy The story of her relationship with Sigmund Freud, including assisting his family's escape into exile, was made into a television film in 2004 as Princesse Marie, directed by Beno√Æt Jacquot, starring Catherine Deneuve as Princess Marie Bonaparte and Heinz Bennent as Freud.

The name \\"Leevi\\" is often taken to mean Sundqvist personally, although this is incorrect, and \\"Leevi\\" refers to a late friend of the band members. Sundqvist kept himself almost completely hidden from publicity and Leevi and the Leavings never performed in front of a live audience, with only one exception under the name \\"Tarmo Dynamo\\". In the 1980s and 90s, G√∂sta and the band gave some interviews but after the year 1996 Sundqvist became a total media hermit. Sundqvist is best remembered by the songs he composed, arranged, and wrote the lyrics for. His lyrics were down- to-earth which was probably the key to success among the Finnish public. His subjects covered loneliness, sexuality, alcoholism, mental health, environment and society, often with sarcasm and black humour. In 1990 Sundqvist expanded his work to include radio comedy. He wrote several humorous shows for the radio station formerly known as Radiomafia, including Tietokoneenkorjauskurssi (\\"Computer repair course\\") and Koe-el√§inpuisto (\\"Laboratory animal park\\").

He pioneered the use of gross national product (GNP) as the basis for studying national economies. Early years Colin Clark was born in London in 1905 and was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, then at Winchester College. He subsequently attended Brasenose College, Oxford,The college retains a small collection of his papers http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/bnc_society/autumn07edition.pdf where he graduated in Chemistry in 1928. After graduation he worked as a research assistant with William Beveridge at the London School of Economics (1928‚Äì29) and then with Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders and Allyn Young at the University of Liverpool (1929‚Äì30). During this time he ran unsuccessful campaigns to be elected to parliament for the Labour Party in the constituency of North Dorset (1929), and later at Liverpool Wavertree (1931) and South Norfolk (1935). In 1930 he was appointed a research assistant to the National Economic Advisory Council newly convened by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. He resigned shortly after his appointment, after being asked to write a background memorandum to make a case for protectionism. Despite this, he had sufficiently impressed one of the council members (John Maynard Keynes) to secure an appointment as a lecturer in statistics at Cambridge University. Lecturer at Cambridge At Cambridge, he was a lecturer in Statistics from 1931 to 1938. There he also completed three books: The National Income 1924‚Äì31 (1932), The Economic Position of Great Britain (jointly with A. C. Pigou) (1936) and National Income and Outlay (1937). His first book was sent to the publisher Daniel Macmillan with a recommendation from John Maynard Keynes: \\"[...] Clark is, I think, a bit of a genius: almost the only economic statistician I have ever met who seems to me quite first-class.\\"Don Patinkin, \\"Keynes and Econometrics: On the Interaction between the Macroeconomic Revolutions of the Interwar Period\\", Econometrica, Vol. 44, No. 6 (November 1976), pp. 1091‚Äì1123 Move to Australia Clark's sector model of an economy undergoing technological change.

During a visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1937 and 1938 he accepted a position with the Queensland Government at the invitation of the premier Forgan Smith.Clark named his second son Nicholas Forgan in recognition of Smith's offer. At the time he wrote to Keynes about his decision to stay in Australia. As he put it, the chance to advise the Queensland Premier on 'practically everything connected with economic matters' was 'too remarkable an opportunity to be missed for putting economics into practice' On 6 May 1938, he was appointed Government Statistician, Director of the Bureau of Industry, and Financial Advisor to the Queensland Treasury, and provided the State's first set of economic accounts in 1940. He also held the position of Deputy Director (Queensland) of the Commonwealth Department of War Organisation of Industry from 1942 to 1946.

The western end of the range is often referred to locally as the Whittier Hills. Geography The Puente Hills lie to the south of the San Gabriel Valley and the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60), to the east of the San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605), to the north of Whittier Boulevard, and to the west of the city of Diamond Bar and Chino Hills. Cities to its north are the City of Industry, Hacienda Heights, and Rowland Heights. To the south are Whittier, La Habra Heights, and Brea. The Brea-Olinda Oil Field, discovered in 1880 and still producing in 2014, is in the southernmost portion of the hills adjacent to the city of Brea. Flora The Puente Hills are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion of the California Floristic Province. The remnant California native plants here are in the chaparral and oak woodland plant communities, with stands of California native grasses. Vascular Plants of the Whittier Hills, a floristic study, was completed by Julie A. Schneider Ljubenkov and Timothy S. Ross (2001), and published in Crossosoma. It built on the work of Bob Muns. Puente Hills in Hellman Wilderness Park Landmarks Rio Hondo College is located at the foot of the western end of the hills, and the Puente Hills Landfill is nearby. Rose Hills Memorial Park occupies portions of the northern area. The highest point in the western hills is Workman Hill, named for the pioneer Workman family. The Puente Hills Mall is located north of the hills. Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, the second largest Buddhist temple and monastery in the western hemisphere, is located in the hills. In the 1953 film adaptation of H. G. Wells' science-fiction novel The War of the Worlds, the Puente Hills were the landing site of the first spacecraft in the Martian invasion.

D is an example of the use of a pedal note The piece, which lasts around six minutes in performance,Some performers see the piece as a challenge to play as fast as possible. Sharon Isbin in the example cited takes over six minutes. was originally written for the piano and set in the key of G minor. It was first published in Barcelona, by Juan Bta. Pujol & Co., in 1892 as the prelude of a three-movement set entitled Chants d'Espagne. The name Asturias (Leyenda) was given to it posthumously by the German publisher Hofmeister, who included it in the 1911 \\"complete version\\" of the Suite espa√±ola, although Alb√©niz never intended the piece for this suite. Despite the new name, this music is not considered suggestive of the folk music of the northern Spanish region of Asturias, but rather of Andalusian flamenco traditionsEverything You Ever Wanted To Know About... ALB√âNIZ'S LEYENDA (Preludio-Asturias), http://stanleyyates.com/articles/albeniz/leyenda.html (although the drama of the music is congruent with the landscape of the region of Asturias). Leyenda, Hofmeister's subtitle, means legend. The piece is noted for the delicate, intricate melody of its middle section and abrupt dynamic changes. Alb√©niz's biographer, Walter Aaron Clark, describes the piece as \\"pure Andalusian flamenco\\". In the main theme the piano mimics the guitar technique of alternating the thumb and fingers of the right hand, playing a pedal-note open string with the index finger and a melody with the thumb. The theme itself suggests the rhythm of the buler√≠a‚Äîa fast flamenco form. The \\"marcato\\"/\\"staccato\\" markings suggest both guitar sounds and the footwork of a flamenco dancer. The piece sounds as though it is written in the Phrygian mode which is typical of buler√≠as. The second section is a reminiscent of a copla‚Äîa sung verse following a specific form. Clark states that it is written in typical Alb√©niz form as it is \\"presented monophonically but doubled at the fifteenth for more fullness of sound. The music alters between a solo and accompaniment that is typical of flamenco. The short middle section of the piece is written in the style of a malague√±a‚Äîanother flamenco style piece. The malague√±a borrows two motives from the previous copla and builds on them. The piece returns to its first theme until a slow \\"hymn-like\\" passage ends the piece. Guitar versions Asturias performed at the White House by Sharon Isbin. It is not possible to transcribe the piece note for note for guitar. The original version makes uses of the piano keyboard's wider range compared to the tessitura of the guitar, and the key is not suitable for the guitar. Many have attributed the first transcription for guitar to Francisco T√°rrega who put it in its most recognizable key, E minor. According to the guitarist and guitar scholar Stanley Yates, the first guitar transcription of the piece was probably by Severino Garc√≠a Fortea, although Andr√©s Segovia's transcription is the most famous and most influential. The piece has become one of the most important works of the classical guitar repertoire. Robbie Krieger, guitarist of The Doors, uses a reworking of the melody from this classical piece in The Doors song \\"Spanish Caravan\\" from their 1968 album Waiting for the Sun.

The PIP is almost always actively determined by a targeting computer, which then projects a PIP marker (a \\"pipper\\") onto a Head-Up Display (HUD). Modern HUDs are focused so the weapon operator will see the marker projected directly over the point of impact, regardless of the position of their eye. Modern combat aircraft are equipped to calculate the PIP for onboard weapons at any given time. Using the PIP marker, pilots can achieve good accuracy at ranges of up to several kilometers, whether the target is ground-based or airborne. Variables included in the calculation are aircraft velocity, target velocity, target elevation, distance to target, forces on the projectile (drag, gravity), and others. Another example of devices that show the PIP are red dot sights like the M68 Aimpoint. Such sights, like on a HUD's, are collimated reflector sights, so the dot always appears over the weapon's impact point, regardless of the shooter's eye position. Red dot sights do not use internal computers and must be manually zeroed for maximum accuracy.

Overview The Pyrrhonists developed the concept of \\"epoch√©\\" to describe the state where all judgments about non-evident matters are suspended in order to induce a state of ataraxia (freedom from worry and anxiety). The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus gives this definition: \\"Epoch√© is a state of the intellect on account of which we neither deny nor affirm anything.\\"Outlines of Pyrrhonism, I.4. This concept is similarly employed in Academic Skepticism, but without the objective of ataraxia. In Stoicism the concept is used to describe the withholding of assent to phantasiai (impressions). For example, Epictetus uses the term in this manner: \\"If what philosophers say is true, that in all men action starts from one source, feeling, as in assent it is the feeling that a thing is so, and in denial the feeling that it is not so, yes, by Zeus, and in epoch√©, the feeling that it is uncertain: so also impulse towards a thing is originated by the feeling that it is fitting, and will to get a thing by the feeling that it is expedient for one, and it is impossible to judge.\\"Discourses I.18.1-2 Epoch√© plays an implicit role in subsequent philosophical skeptic thought, as in Ren√© Descartes' epistemic principle of methodic doubt. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by Edmund Husserl. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'bracketing' or 'phenomenological epoch√©' or 'phenomenological reduction' in Ideas I. Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. \\"The Phenomenological Reduction\\". Pyrrhonism Epoch√© plays an important role in Pyrrhonism, the skeptical philosophy named after Pyrrho. Pyrrhonism provides practitioners with techniques for achieving epoch√© through the use of the Ten Modes of Aenesidemus, the Five Modes of Agrippa, and the Pyrrhonist maxims.Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, I.18. Pyrrhonism is mostly known today through the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus whose surviving works appear to be an encyclopedia of Pyrrhonist arguments for inducing epoch√© across a breadth of philosophical and other intellectual issues of antiquity. Phenomenology Epoch√©, or Bracketing in phenomenological research, is described as a process involved in blocking biases and assumptions in order to explain a phenomenon in terms of its own inherent system of meaning. This is a general predisposition one must assume before commencing phenomenological study. This involves systematic steps to \\"set aside\\" various assumptions and beliefs about a phenomenon in order to examine how the phenomenon presents itself in the world of the participant.Christensen, T.M., Brumfield, K.A.

It is located in the lawns and gardens of Kings Domain on Lithgow Avenue close to the Arts Centre and the Southbank entertainment precinct. It was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, on 12 February 1959, with an audience of 30,000 people. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. History The businessman and philanthropist Sidney Myer inspired the construction of the building after attending the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. A violinist who enjoyed music, Myer established free open-air concerts with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in 1929, which were always well attended by Melburnians. These free concerts continue to this day, now being held at the bowl itself. There are usually three or four concerts a year. Upon his death in 1934, the Sidney Myer Fund was established to continue the tradition of philanthropy begun by its founder. The design and construction of a music bowl for the people of Melbourne was decided upon and funded by the fund. The venue was officially opened by the Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, on 12 February 1959, and was attended by an audience of 30,000.\\"Sidney Myer Music Bowl\\", retrieved 28 February 2013 Later that month over 70,000 people attended to hear the American evangelist Billy Graham.Australian Institute of Architects: \\"Sidney Myer Musical Bowl, Melbourne\\", retrieved 28 February 2013 Aerial perspective of the Sidney Myer Bowl, in relation to the Yarra River and Alexandra Gardens The largest crowd ever for a concert event in Australia was the 1967 Seekers homecoming concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl which an estimated 200,000 people attended.McFarlane, 'The Seekers' entry.

In 1980, administration of the bowl was handed over to the Victorian Arts Centre from the Sidney Myer Fund by Ken Myer, Sidney Myer's son. In 1984 a temporary ice-skating rink was created on the bowl's stage for use during winter months. The venue was closed for a major renovation in 2000 to bring the facilities up to an appropriate standard, and was reopened by the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, at Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve, 2002. Recent works on the lawns extending from the seating and stage, and the construction of a fence and gates has reduced the total capacity to a little over 12,000, however this has also improved the visibility and standard of facilities out of sight. 50th anniversary celebrations In 2009 the 50th anniversary of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl was celebrated. The Arts Centre put together a four-day commemorative program of free events. From 12 to 15 February, the festivities featured two concerts from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, including a recreation of their 1959 opening concert of the bowl and a romantic Valentine's Day program; a salute to 50 years of rock and roll at the bowl from RocKwiz and an afternoon picnic of family entertainment. There was also an informative exhibition at the St Kilda Road Foyer Gallery of the Arts Centre and a commemorative website depicting 50 years of the bowl.http://www.theartscentre.com.au/bowl50/ The Arts Centre website. Design and construction A map of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl The bowl's canopy consists of a thin membrane made out of half an inch weather-proofed plywood sheeted on both sides with aluminium attached to a cobwebbed frame of steel cables and supported by masts pivoted to the earth. The total area of the canopy is . The main cable at the edge of the canopy comprises 7 ropes, each about 9 cm in diameter and long, anchored deep into the ground in concrete blocks. Longitudinal cables hold up the roof and transverse cables hold it down. Project design was by Yuncken Freeman and Griffiths and Simpson during 1956. The project architect was Barry Patten. Construction commenced in 1958 with an innovative system of cables laced together and covered with aluminium faced plywood sandwich panels. To ensure the structure would be watertight yet aerodynamically stable and flexible, new construction techniques were developed. Ground anchors were required to be corrosion resistant. The shell also needed to be acoustically correct. Construction entailed input from a number of engineering and scientific organisations including the Aeronautical Research Laboratories and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Forest Products Division. Unlike the Hollywood Bowl's concrete shell structure in Los Angeles which inspired it, the Sidney Myer Music Bowl combined a tensile structural system with a free-form roof. The structural design predates by nearly 10 years noted German architect and engineer Frei Otto and his experiments in using lightweight tensile and membrane structures. Otto's design of Munich's Olympic Park for the 1972 Olympics and the temporary West German pavilion at the 1967 World's Fair in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were heavily influenced by Patten's design of Melbourne's Myer Music Bowl. The Sidney Myer Music Bowl is registered on the Victorian Heritage list for its cultural importance to Victoria, its architectural importance as the largest, purpose built, permanent outdoor performance venue in Australia and its engineering experimentation in new forms of construction involving use of membranes and a tensile structural system. Capacity There is a fixed seating area which can hold 2,030 people. Behind this area are sloping lawns which can accommodate up to 10,000. The stage area is 27.4 metres wide by 19.5 metres deep (). Major events The bowl holds major events including Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight, held every year on Christmas Eve, televised each year by the Nine Network.

Dom√≠nguez (January 3, 1906 ‚Äì December 31, 1957) was a Spanish surrealist painter.  Biography  Born in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna on the island of Tenerife, on the Canary Islands Spain, Dom√≠nguez spent his youth with his grandmother in Tacoronte and devoted himself to painting at a young age after suffering a serious illness which affected his growth and caused a progressive deformation of his facial bone frame and limbs. He went to Paris at 21 where he first worked for his father in the central market of Les Halles, and spent his nights diving in cabarets. He then frequented some art schools, and visited galleries and museums. He was rapidly attracted by avant-garde painters, notably Yves Tanguy and Pablo Picasso, whose influences were visible in his first works. At 25 he painted a self-portrait full of premonition as he showed himself with a deformed hand and with the veins of his arm cut. He chose to kill himself 27 years later by cutting his veins. In 1933 Dom√≠nguez met Andr√© Breton, a theoretician of Surrealism, and Paul √âluard, known as the poet of this movement, and took part a year later in the Surrealist exhibition held in Copenhagen and those of London and Tenerife in 1936. Dom√≠nguez was also working in Paris at the Atelier 17. He popularized the Russian-invented technique of decalcomania as a Surrealist automatic technique in 1936, using gouache spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a canvas. Automatism, invented by Andre Breton, was important for the Surrealists as a means of channeling their subconscious through art. Dominguez's style influenced many artists including Max Ernst, Hans Bellmer, Remedios Varo and Dutch poet and translator Gertrude Pape. His 1937 oil painting The Infernal Machine sold for 2 770 000 FF (US$404,375) on June 8, 2000 at Drouot-Montaigne in Paris. His 1933 oil painting Roma's portrait sold for 902,500 GBP (US$1,469,270) on Feb. 4. 2014 at Christie's in London. In 1952 he started an affair with Marie-Laure de Noailles, who called him \\"putchie\\".James Lord, Picasso and Dora, a memoir, London, 1993 Dom√≠nguez committed suicide December 31, 1957, by slitting his wrists in the bath.

Jacques Doucet (born March 8, 1940, Montreal)\\"Les intronis√©s - Jacques Doucet (b√¢tisseur)\\", Temple de la renomm√©e du baseball qu√©b√©cois. is a French radio play-by-play announcer. He broadcast Montreal Expos games for every year of the team's existence, from 1969 to 2004. He is currently the French play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue Jays on TVA Sports. Early career Doucet began his career in 1959 as a translator for the Canadian Press news agency. After one year in 1960-1961 as a sports journalist for the short-lived Nouveau Journal daily, he went to La Presse in 1962, still as a sports journalist, where he remained until early 1972. Sports broadcasting During a long strike in 1964 at La Presse, Doucet had a brief first experience in sports broadcasting, for Montreal Alouettes football games. He got the assignment as the Montreal Expos beat writer for La Presse as soon as the franchise was awarded to Montreal in 1968, in addition to being the official scorer for games at Jarry Park. Sometime in the middle of the Expos' first season in 1969, Doucet was asked to occasionally replace Jean-Pierre Roy as colour commentator on the now-defunct CKLM 1570, which held the French radio broadcast rights, as Roy moved to TV broadcasts once a week. Play-by-play In 1972, as CKAC 730 became the Expos' new French radio flagship, Doucet was hired by the (now-defunct) T√©l√©m√©dia network to do play- by-play for all Montreal Expos games, in addition to the All-Star, League Championship and World Series games and a selection of pre-season Expos games. When T√©l√©m√©dia merged with Radiomutuel on September 30, 1994, creating the new Radiom√©dia network, he became an Expos employee and continued to do play-by- play but only for Montreal Expos games, which continued to be aired mostly on CKAC 730 until the end of 2003. (He was heard for a few games on CKVL 850 (now CINF 690) in 1995, and on CJMS 1040 in 2002 and 2003. CHMP-FM 98.5 took over as the French radio flagship in 2004 for the last season of the Expos in Montreal). Over his career, Doucet described more than 5,000 Major League Baseball games, including two perfect games (by Dennis Mart√≠nez in 1991 against the Los Angeles Dodgers and by New York Yankees pitcher David Cone against the Expos in 1999). Awards Doucet was introduced in the Quebec Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002, in the Expos Hall of Fame in 2003 and in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004. While fans hope Doucet will be recognized by the Cooperstown Baseball Hall of Fame via the Ford C. Frick Award, this has not occurred (although he has been a finalist five times, including in 2011). Doucet has been described as \\"the French-Canadian equivalent of Jaime Jarr√≠n\\" and even as \\"Canada's Vin Scully\\", but it has been noted that \\"because he broadcast games in French, few of the people who cast final votes for admission to Cooperstown have heard Doucet work\\", and that the language barrier might keep Doucet out of Cooperstown; at least one observer has suggested that Doucet has failed to win the Award because he is not an American. Later career In March 2005, Doucet became the official spokesperson for Encore Baseball Montreal, an organization initially created to keep the Expos in Montreal and which is now focused on promoting baseball in Quebec. In June 2005, Doucet's efforts to create a French-language version of standard baseball terminology were underlined at length in a front-page story by the Wall Street Journal. Return to commentating From 2006 to 2011, Doucet was the play-by-play voice for the home games of the Quebec Capitales. The Capitales play in the Can-Am League, an eight-team independent baseball league; their games are heard on CHRC 800 in Quebec City. In August 2011, Doucet was hired by TVA Sports, a new sports television channel which went on the air a month later, as the play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue Jays. Books In collaboration with Marc Robitaille, Doucet has published a two-volume history of the Montreal Expos titled Il √©tait une fois les Expos. The first volume was published in 2009 and the second volume was published in 2011. Doucet previously published, in collaboration with Claude Raymond, a book titled Les secrets du baseball in 1980.

Geist (the main character) is MD-02, a Most Dangerous Soldier, genetically engineered to function as a killing machine, but every one of the MDS units went homicidally insane. As a result, Geist was placed in suspended animation in a stasis pod orbiting the planet Jerra until it crashed several years later, awakening him and bringing him into another war on the planet. Synopsis=M.D. Geist I: Most Dangerous Soldier The Regular Army of the planet Jerra has been locked in a bloody civil war with the rebellious Nexrum Army, who believe that Earth should not be involved in governing its extraterrestrial colonies. In response, the Jerran Army developed the Most Dangerous Soldiers, which turned out to work too well; the MDS units attacked everyone, including their allies. One such soldier, MD-02 \\"Geist\\", was ordered placed in suspended animation aboard a stasis satellite and launched into Jerra's orbit. After several years, Geist awakens after the stasis satellite crashes on Jerra. In a desolated city, Geist discovers a group of bandits, whose leader kills a stray soldier wearing a powered suit. Geist confronts the bandit leader over acquiring the dead soldier's suit. In a fight to the death over the suit, Geist slices off the leader's arms before impaling his combat knife through his skull. Vaiya, a female bandit, is attracted to Geist's strength, but other than her knowledge of both armies' activities, Geist shows no desire for her. The bandits spot a Jerran mobile fortress being attacked by Nexrum forces and find it as an opportunity to save the fortress for a price. Geist and the bandits form an uneasy alliance with the Jerran forces led by Colonel Krutes (Geist's former superior) before participating in a mission to stop the Jerran doomsday weapon \\"Death Force\\" from activating. Death Force's countdown commenced shortly after the president of a Jerran country was assassinated. Its purpose is to annihilate all life forms on Jerra without discrimination. Like a black knight, Geist equips himself with the acquired powered suit (which eventually becomes his trademark), and goes into the Brain Palace with Krutes' commandos and his bandit team in tow. All but Geist and Krutes are killed during the invasion. Upon reaching Brain Palace, Geist faces an advanced combat robot activated by Krutes, realizing that the colonel set him up. While Geist battles the robot, Krutes reaches the control center to deactivate the Death Force. He succeeds, but discovers that the robot he activated has failed to kill Geist. Krutes laughs heavily before Geist crushes his skull with his hands. When Vaiya arrives at the control center, she sees Geist set off Death Force, unleashing an army of machines that consume living matter to replicate, condemning all life on Jerra to death. M.D. Geist II: Death Force Less than a year after Geist activated the Death Force, which decimated most of Jerra's population, he has kept himself busy by dismantling the Death Force machines one by one. The remnants of the human population have fled to a remote haven run by a warlord named Krauser. Krauser is another MDS unit, MD-01, who has a technology that hides his mobile fortress from the Death Force. When he encounters Geist, an initial fight takes place, where Krauser 'defeats' Geist, throwing him from a bridge of the fortress. Some time after, Krauser and the Jerran army plan to lure the Death Force machines into an abandoned city and detonate the lethal \\"Jignitz Bomb\\" to exterminate them. Again, Geist's programming overrides any shred of humanity he may have, and he leads the Death Force off to Krauser's fortress, leaving Krauser's commandos to be destroyed in the Jignitz Bomb's detonation. Although most of the Death Force is consumed in the explosion as well, a large number of the machines fall upon Krauser's fortress while Geist confronts Krauser himself. Geist kills Krauser in hand-to-hand combat while the Death Force machines consume most of the refugees.(In the anime Krauser is caught in an explosion and Geist's empty helmet is later shown so while both are probably killed neither death is definitively confirmed.) M.D. Geist: Ground Zero This comic takes place before the events of the first OVA. At a board of Regular Army officials, Lt. Leigh Wong attempts to persuade them to use Geist in battle; he is a genetically-engineered soldier bred to specialize in strategy and versatility, designed to perform as a solitary fighter, rather than within a group. Wong also mentions how Geist strictly follows feasible commands. She is dispatched to a base along with Geist, who has been instructed to work with the squad already stationed at the base, much to her frustration. The squad, led by Col. Stanton, reject Geist, viewing him as lifeless, who in turn is unaffected and assigns himself to the reserves as ordered by Stanton, much to Wong's displeasure. Later, Stanton briefs his men on the mission they will be undertaking, in which they are to investigate and if necessary, destroy a Nexrum collective at a temple within a jungle. Wong interrupts the briefing to make mention of the Nexrum's cyborg units, to the interest of the men who have never heard of them before; her interruption is in hopes that Stanton will make use of Geist, who is the only soldier with experience against cyborgs. Suddenly, a private rushes in to tell both of them to come outside. Sgt. Robard, a soldier with whom Geist has gotten into a fight, lies twitching on the floor with both arms severed, Wong quite sinisterly sees it as proof of Geist's efficiency. The next morning, Stanton and his men are preparing to begin their mission, only to be halted when Wong and Geist suddenly show up. Once again, Stanton refuses to accept Geist, especially after what happened yesterday, keeping him as a reserve without armor. In the jungle, Geist takes effortless care of their encounters, eventually they reach the temple to discover a Nexrum ship armed with a large cannon. Geist and the soldiers quickly occupy the base, taking the enemy forces prisoner. Wong and Stanton investigate the ship, when suddenly the soldiers are ambushed by cyborgs piloting Nexrum machines. Geist is the only one to survive, having jumped onto the ship once it has begun to take off. On board, Wong discovers a plan for the Nexrum to fire the ship's cannon at their own city, which is loaded with nuclear weapons, and it's been ordered by Earth. With no way to stop the ship, Stanton and Geist take off to destroy the engines, but before they go any further, Stanton makes it clear that Geist is to tell no one of Earth's involvement with this plan, even if Geist outlives him, he must not mention it. The two of them battle with a machine that is guarding the engines, by the end of it Stanton is fatally wounded, and his armor covered in oil leaking from the enemy machine. With his view on Geist finally re-evaluated, Stanton delivers one final order, to don his armor and take out the ship's cannon. Geist successfully does so, tangling briefly with the same machine after he discovers its connections are still active, and prepares to hijack the jet section of it. Geist escapes just in time as a defense unit destroys the reactor circuit controls in the cockpit, destroying part of the ship's thrusters, causing it to dive into the temple. Wong cries out as she sees Geist fly past, unable to save her. The temple goes up in an enormous explosion, and a Regular Army patrol discovers Geist waiting to be picked up. Before a jury, Geist does not speak of what happened in the mission, remembering Stanton's orders. For this, Col. Krutes comes to the conclusion, based on evidence, that Geist is in some way responsible for the deaths of Regular Army personnel and for failure of the mission. Krutes expresses his wish to execute Geist, but because of President Ryan's input, he is instead to be imprisoned in stasis. Production notes Although Hayato Ikeda was credited as director of M.D. Geist, it was actually Ohata who did the overall direction. Because Ohata was 23 years old and inexperienced at the time, the producers brought in Ikeda for appearances. Ohata admitted that the numerous animation mistakes found on the first title were a result of a disorganized animation team. The \\"Director's Cut\\" edition, co-produced by Central Park Media, smoothed out most of the animation errors and featured additional footage - including a new introduction and epilogue. Release M.D. Geist was originally released in Japan by Nippon Columbia and re-released under the Denon label. In 1988, a trailer of the OVA under the title \\"Thunder Warrior\\" was produced by Gaga Communications along with a string of other anime titles the company was hoping to sell to the North American market.Forgotten Junk - Gaga Communications M.D. Geist was released in North America by Central Park Media in 1992; two years prior, the company used Geist as the logo for their mainstream anime label U.S. Manga Corps. Curiosity by fans over U.S. Manga Corps' logo boosted domestic sales of the OVA and prompted Central Park Media to collaborate with co-creator Koichi Ohata in producing a sequel. In 1996, Central Park Media released M.D. Geist - Director's Cut, featuring roughly five minutes of additional footage - including a new introduction and epilogue that paved the way for the sequel. Months later, CPM released M.D. Geist II: Death Force. In addition, the company commissioned Ohata and American artist Tim Eldred to illustrate the comic book adaptation. In the United States, the Sci Fi Channel premiered M.D. Geist I and II during their Ani-Monday block at midnight E.S.T. September 29 and October 6, 2008 respectively. Following the closure of Central Park Media, M.D. Geist was re-licensed by ADV Films and was re-released on DVD in July 2009. It is currently available for digital download on iTunes by Manga Entertainment, along with Now and Then, Here and There. Adaptations To coincide with the release of M.D. Geist I: Most Dangerous Soldier (Director's Cut) and M.D. Geist II: Death Force, CPM Manga released a comic book adaptation written and drawn by Tim Eldred with Ohata as guest artist. This comic was preceded by Ground Zero, and served as a more refined version of the original 1986 OVA, in which several details were explained better to make up for some of the plot holes present in the original version. Nexrum is also known as \\"Negstrom\\" in the comics, and Krutes' name goes by the original Japanese romanization of \\"Kurtz\\".  Reception  Darius Washington from Otaku USA magazine defined the original version of M.D. Geist as \\"an entertaining action vid with okay production values, unique elements and a psychotically fun twist\\" The owner of Central Park Media John O'Donnell jokingly named it \\"the best bad anime ever made\\".

The first righteous armies emerged during the Khitan invasions of Korea and the Mongol invasions of Korea. They subsequently rose up during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598), the first and second Manchu invasions, and during the Japanese occupation and preceding events. During the long period of Japanese invasion and occupation from 1890 to 1945, the disbanded imperial guard, and Confucian scholars, as well as farmers, formed over 60 successive righteous armies to fight for Korean freedom on the Korean peninsula. These were preceded by the Donghak movement, and succeeded by various Korean independence movements in the 1920s and beyond, which declared Korean independence from Japanese occupation. During the Japanese invasions of Korea The righteous armies were an irregular military that fought the Japanese army that twice invaded Korea during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598). Righteous armies were most active in the Jeolla Province in the southwestern area of Korea. Righteous armies included peasants, scholars, former government officials, and Buddhist warrior monks as well. Righteous armies were important during the war because a significant portion of the expected government organized resistance had been destroyed in Gyeongsang and Chungcheong Provinces in the south by the force of Japanese arms at the outset. The natural defenders had been stripped away and the residue had been called north to help protect the fleeing king. Moreover, many of the district officers had obtained their commissions not through merit, but by bribery or influence, and were essentially incompetent or cowards. This was highlighted in their performance and in the performance of their units in the early days of the conflict. This kind of resistance was totally unexpected by the Japanese invaders. In Japanese warfare, when the leaders fall, civilians would simply submit. However, after they learned that people were forming organized resistance against them, they were shocked. Japanese strategies were based on the premise that the people of Korea would submit to them and assist their supply line by giving their food. However, this was not the case and righteous armies continued to interrupt the Japanese supply line. People's voluntary resistance movements were one of the major reasons why Japanese invasion was not successful.

Late Joseon dynasty period Korean nationalism outgrew the unplanned, spontaneous, and disorganized Donghak movement, and became more violent as the Japanese occupation began a brutal regime throughout the Korean peninsula and pursued repressive policies against the Korean people. The Japanese occupiers fought with rifle guns, state-of-the-art cannons, machine guns, repeaters, mounted cavalry reconnaissance units in the mountains, and an entrenched class of informers and criminals developed over the previous decade before the battles began. Koreans fought with antique muzzle-loaders, staves, iron bars, and their hands. There were rare instances of modern weapons, and a few enemy weapons captured. For at least thirteen years after 1905, small irregular forces, often led by regular army commanders, fought skirmishes and battles throughout Korea against Japanese police, armies, and underworld mercenaries who functioned to support Japanese corporations looting Korea, and as well armed Japanese settlers who seized Korean farms and land. In one period, according to Japanese records in Boto Tobatsu-shi (Annals of the Subjugation of the Insurgent), between October 1907 and April 1908, over 1,908 attacks were made by the Korean people against the invaders. While most attacks were done using available weapons, and bare hands, international arms dealers profited. Arms dealers and governments who supplied the Korean resistance included Chinese arms dealers from across the Yalu and in coastal waters; German arms dealers provided Mausers, and a French cruiser in September 1908, resupplied Korean Catholic armies in payment for gold at exorbitant prices. Smugglers from Japan as well supplied Murada weapons, with links to anti-Meiji forces who hoped to see Ito and his clan toppled in the wake of disasters in the Japanese economy. After the Russian revolution, some weaponry was diverted from the White forces into what is now North Korea, and supporters built there, however this was sparse and while white Russian mercenaries fought against the Japanese, this was a minor element. During the Righteous Armies Wars The Righteous Army was formed by Yu In-seok and other Confucian scholars during the Peasant Wars. Its ranks swelled after the Queen's murder by the Japanese troops and Koreans. Under the leadership of Min Jeong-sik, Choe Ik-hyeon and Shin Dol-seok, the Righteous Army attacked the Japanese army, Japanese merchants and pro-Japanese bureaucrats in the provinces of Gangwon, Chungcheong, Jeolla and Gyeongsang. Choe Ik-hyeon was captured by the Japanese and taken to Tsushima Island where he went on hunger strike and finally died in 1906. Shin Dol-seok, an uneducated peasant commanded over 3,000 troops. Among the troops were former government soldiers, poor peasants, fishermen, tiger hunters, miners, merchants, and laborers. The Korean army was disbanded in August 1, 1907. The Army was led by 1st Battalion Commander Major Park Seung-hwan, who later committed suicide, occurred after the disbandment, led by former soldiers of the Imperial Army against Japan in Namdaemun Gate. The disbanded army joined the Righteous Armies and together they solidified a foundation for the Righteous Armies battle. In 1907, the Righteous Army under the command of Yi In-yeong massed 10,000 troops to liberate Seoul and defeat the Japanese. The Army came within 12 km of Seoul but could not withstand the Japanese counter-offensive. The Righteous Army was no match for two infantry divisions of 20,000 Japanese soldiers backed by warships moored near Incheon. The Righteous Army retreated from Seoul and the war went on for two more years. Over 17,000 Righteous Army soldiers were killed and more than 37,000 were wounded in combat. Unable to fight the Japanese army head-on, the Righteous Army split into small bands of partisans to carry on the War of Liberation in China, Siberia and the Baekdu Mountains in Korea. The Japanese troops first quashed the Peasant Army and then disbanded the remained of the government army. Many of the surviving guerrilla and anti-Japanese government troops fled to Manchuria and Primorsky Krai to carry on their fight. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea and starting the period of Japanese rule.

Marshall. Its members are civilian women and men appointed by the Secretary of Defense to provide advice and recommendations on matters and policies relating to the recruitment and retention, treatment, employment, integration, and well-being of women in the U.S. Armed Forces. It is authorized under the provisions of P.L. 92-463, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and meets on a quarterly basis to review issues and conducts information-gathering activities through installation visits, meetings, reports, and surveys. The committee provides recommendations to the Secretary of Defense through an annual report. Formation The 1948 Women's Armed Services Integration Act established defined roles for women in the peacetime armed forces of the United States. Previously, they only had been allowed to serve as nurses in peacetime; a wider variety of roles only open to them in time of war. However, with the start of the Korean War in June 1950, the Department of Defense began to investigate ways to increase recruitment and retention of women in all services. Internal inquiries from defense agencies such as the National Security Resources Board and external pressure from politicians such as Senator Margaret Chase Smith added to the sense of urgency in defining a more comprehensive position for women in the military. At the suggestion of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower Anna Rosenberg, Marshall formed the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services in August 1951. Its first chair was Mary Pillsbury Lord, a civic activist who had been chair of the National Civilian Advisory Committee of the Women's Army Corps. Some of its original members included Oveta Culp Hobby, the first Women's Army Corps (WAC) director; Mildred McAfee Horton, former director of the WAVES; Ruth Streeter, former director of the Women Marines; actress Helen Hayes; Sarah G. Blanding, Vassar College president, engineer Lillian Gilbreth; and publisher Beatrice Gould. Meeting for three days at the Pentagon in September 1951, they heard presentations about recruiting and the possible need for a women's draft based on the failure of recruiting during World War II to meet the military services' requirements for women. The committee would help to develop policies and standards for women in the military‚Äîusing them, expanding their opportunities, recruiting them, and training them. The committee ensured that military women would have representation at the Department of Defense. Beginning in 2002, the Committee began providing advice and recommendations on family issues related to recruitment and retention. DACOWITS' recommendations have been instrumental in effecting changes to laws and policies pertaining to military women. Personnel In October 1955, Margaret Divver, advertising manager of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, was named to head the Committee, replacing Oliver Crowther. The Committee was exploring ways to interest better qualified women in military careers and explaining the increasing variety of positions available to them. In October 1971, Estelle M. Stacy was appointed to serve as chair for the calendar year 1972, replacing Helen K. Leslie. History ;1968 *that the policy of establishing a system of appointment and promotion credit list allowances for advanced graduate degrees, professional education beyond the professional training requirement, or beyond the four-year college program, as well as any related experience in determining the rank and promotion dates (Professional Education Date) of directly commissioned officers in any of the Medical or Health components of the Services. It is further recommended that all Services seek to develop and adopt this policy as a valuable adjunct to recruitment and retention of qualified health professionals. *that legislation be established to the effect that a married military woman, regardless of grade, can establish a joint domicile with her husband and shall receive Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) in her own right. In the event the husband is also a member of the Military Services, he shall also receive BAQ in his own right. *that civilian husbands of military women be authorized access to and use of exchange and commissary facilities. ;1973 *that the Department of Defense prepare a legislative proposal to amend section 3579, Title 10, U.S. Code to provide the opportunity for officers of the Army Nurse Corps and the Army Medical Specialist Corps to exercise command within the Army Medical Department. Further, that similar statutory provisions relative to other military medical departments be reviewed for the purpose of similar modifications. (This recommendation was not implemented until 1998.) ;1974 *that, in view of the limited number of women physicians and dentists in the Service, increased efforts be made to inform women in schools and private practice of the opportunities available in military medicine. ;1975 *that the Department of Defense develop, and the Services implement, a sex education program including birth control and venereal disease prevention for all officer and enlisted personnel. As a minimum, the training should be given to all incoming personnel during initial entry training. ;1978 *that the U. S. Navy and The U. S. Marine Corps open their Limited Duty Officer commissioning program to women *that DoD's General Counsel make a priority inquiry into the propriety of the Congress of the United States prohibiting any specific or particular medical procedures in military hospitals ;1979 *that the minimum standards for eligibility for admission to the Services should be the same for women as for men, except legitimate physical differences. *that insofar as permitted by existing statutes, the Secretary of the Navy provide identical standards, including time in grade, for promotions of men and women in the Marine Corps Fall 1979 *That DoD and DoT that they support the concept that women and men shall be treated in the same way whatever legislative or policy decisions are made concerning the draft, national services or registration for either. (At the time, the United States Coast Guard was an element of the Department of Transportation.) ;1980 *that the President of the United States give priority to the consideration of the appointment of women as judges of the United States Court of Military Appeals ;1982 *that the Services take whatever management initiatives are necessary to ensure that lost time in delivery of medical care is reduced, particularly by giving the active duty women members priority of treatment in obstetrics and gynecology. ;1983 After a November 1982 recommendation that 23 additional job categories be closed to women, increasing the number to 60 of 360 categories, the Committee's chair, Mary Huey of Texas Women's University, sought assurance from Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger that women's promotion would not suffer from these exclusions, and Weinberger did so. *that a form letter signed by the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel be placed in the Official Military Personnel File of those female enlisted service members reclassified as a result of Direct Combat Probability Coding (DCPC), stating that reclassification was directed by Department of the Army as a result of the Women In The Army Study and that the service member should not be penalized as a result of action taken by Headquarters Department of the Army and that Letters of Instruction to promotion boards address this issue. * that the Services provide information to prospective applicants, prior to enlistment or commissioning, about limitations in particular specialties which exist as a result of combat exclusion laws or policy restrictions. ;1984 *that the Office of the Secretary of Defense reiterate, through the publication of a formal policy statement to commanders and field personnel at all levels, the requirement that women be fully utilized in their assigned operational units *that the Services adopt a policy of providing professional assistance for rape victims. When in the absence of military or nearby civilian Community Rape Crisis Centers, victims upon consent should be immediately evacuated to the closest available qualified facility. *that commanders be made aware that military women with alcohol abuse problems must be identified as early as their male counterparts *that the Marine Corps provided a rationale for the exclusion of women Marine from duty as Marine Security Guards and that the Marine Corps re-examine this policy. ;1988 *that all Services grant 6 weeks post-partum non-chargeable leave *that the Department of Defense and the Services remove the requirement that members characterize the legitimacy of their dependent children from DoD and Service forms for quarters allowances, dependent identification cards, dependency support statements, records of emergency data, Servicemen's Group Life Insurance, etc. ;1989 *that DoD expand existing leadership training to include dealing with unfounded accusations of homosexuality against Service members. *that the Army conduct a 4-year test program under which women in the Army will be allowed to enter all military occupational specialties (including combat and combat support). (This recommendation has not been implemented . ;1991 *that the Secretary of the Navy review aspects of the Marine Corps which continues to hinder full assimilation of women, such as: syllabus differences in Basic Warrior Training/Marine Combat Training (BWT/MCT) programs at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, accepted nomenclature of \\"Women Marines (\\"WM\\") as opposed to other Services which have discontinued use of gender specific labels, limited numbers of female instructors for male recruit training, and failure to eradicate the marketing slogan that characterizes Marines as \\"a few good men.\\" ;1992 *the Secretary of Defense establish a gender neutral assignment policy in military aviation for all Services Spring 1992 *that the Army open to the Army Nurse Corps and other AMEDD officers' opportunities for career- enhancing assignments, including command of medical facilities and units involved in delivery of health care. ;1993 *that the Chief of Staff of the Army fully integrate women into all Army ceremonial units, and, in particular, in the Military District of Washington, to include the Tomb of the Unknowns, the Continental Color Guard, and the U. S. Army Drill Team *that the Army provide women soldiers with the opportunity to enter unfilled Pathfinder training seats on the same basis as men *the Coast Guard adopt treatment guidelines for eating disorders similar to those used by the other Services Fall 1993 ;1996 *that the Secretary of the Navy open to women all classes of ships and vessels and their associated billets that remain closed because of cost considerations (although they are legally open after the repeal of the Combat Exclusion law). ;1998 In 1998 the Committee, then composed of 18 women and two men and chaired by Judith A. Youngman, an associate professor of political science at the Coast Guard Academy, and reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense, recommended increased integration of men and women during basic training after finding that \\"most service members from every service believed that more gender integration of training was needed than currently existed\\". It contradicted a late 1997 report of a committee headed by Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas, formed in response to reports of sexual harassment during training, that advocated the opposite. ;1999 *in the strongest possible terms that the Secretary of Defense open current and future Special Operations Forces (SOF) rotary wing aviation to the assignment of women *that plans for future submarine platforms incorporate appropriate berthing and privacy arrangements to accommodate mixed-gender crews ;2000 *with regard to women's health needs during deployment, that the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Services collaborate to ascertain what information on prevention and treatment of gynecological infections is available; perform a gap analysis to see what information is lacking; develop additional educational materials as needed; and disseminate that information to Service members, leaders and healthcare personnel and ensure an adequate supply of hygiene products during deployment. ;2001 In 2001, there were reports that the Bush administration was considering eliminating the Committee, along with a number of similar advisory groups devoted to women's concerns, and complaints that new appointments were being delayed.  2002  In 2002, the charter of DACOWITS expired and the committee face elimination.  2003  The Office of the Secretary of Defense issued a new charter for DACOWITs, reducing the number of members from 36 to 13 and adding family issues to the committee's remit.  2004  DACOWITS added the issue of sexual assault in the military to its review of policies and issues concerning the retention and deployment of female servicemembers. The committee conducted focus groups at military installations worldwide and used data and research from literature, military surveys, and military and civilian subject matter experts. The Committee's issued recommendations its 2004 report for dealing with sexual assault in the military, including the use of a new definition of sexual assault in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the establishment of victim advocates independent of the chain of command, provision of training for servicemembers on the procedures and resources available to victims following a sexual assault, and educational awareness efforts.Department of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, 2004 Report, https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a490466.pdf, pp. v-vi  2006  The Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services focused on problems in retaining female military doctors, lawyers, and chaplains for periods longer than 5 to 8 years, identifying the potential of overseas deployments away from young children as a barrier to retention and exploring possible solutions (including leaves of absence).  2009  The 2009 DACOWITS report included findings on U.S. servicewomen's roles in Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF) over the past several years, stating, \\"Most focus group participants reported that they or the females with whom they served had been involved in combat roles while deployed to OIF or OEF, e.g., in a combat theatre of operations, exposed to the possibility of hostile action from a threat to self or unit, and/or in a situation where they received hostile fire. The focus groups also described specific combat roles in which women have served, such as serving outside the wire‚Äîwhether on convoys, as drivers, or otherwise traveling between camps‚Äîand participating in female search teams, including the Lioness program. For the most part, female focus group participants shared feelings of satisfaction and pride about their combat experiences.\\"Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, 2009 report, https://dacowits.defense.gov/Portals/48/Documents/Reports/2009/Annual%20Report/dacowits2009report.pdf, p. ii.  2017  On March 21, DACOWITS co-hosted an event with Veteran Affairs Center for Women Veterans at the Women in Military Service for American Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia) celebrating the centennial of the enlistment of Loretta P. Walsh in the U.S. Naval Reserve Force on March 21, 1917. Walsh was officially the first woman to enlist in the U.S. military. References Further reading  D'Amico, Francine J., and Laurie L.

He developed a highly eccentric theory of human biorhythms and a possible nasogenital connection that have not been accepted by modern scientists. He is today best remembered for his close personal friendship, sexual relationship, and theoretical collaboration with Sigmund Freud, a controversial chapter in the history of psychoanalysis. Career Fliess developed several idiosyncratic theories, such as \\"vital periodicity\\", forerunner of the popular concepts of biorhythms. His work never found scientific favor, but some of his thinking, such as the idea of innate bisexuality, was incorporated into Freud's theories. Fliess believed men and women went through mathematically-fixed sexual cycles of 23 and 28 days, respectively.http://www.perbang.dk/orcapia.cms?aid=70 Another of Fliess's ideas was the theory of \\"nasal reflex neurosis\\". This became widely known following the publication of his controversial book Neue Beitrage und Therapie der nasaelen Reflexneurose in Vienna in 1892. The theory postulated a connection between the nose and the genitals and related this to a variety of neurological and psychological symptoms; Fliess devised a surgical operation intended to sever that link. On Josef Breuer's suggestion, Fliess attended several conferences with Sigmund Freud beginning in 1887 in Vienna, and the two soon formed a strong friendship. Through their extensive correspondence and the series of personal meetings, Fliess came to play an important part in the development of psychoanalysis. Freud, who described Fliess as \\"the Kepler of biology\\", repeatedly allowed Fliess to operate on his nose and sinuses to cure his neurosis and also experimented with anaesthetization of the nasal mucosa with cocaine. Together, Fliess and Freud developed a Project for a Scientific Psychology, which was later abandoned. Fliess wrote about his biorythmic theories in Der Ablauf des Lebens. Emma Eckstein (1865‚Äì1924) had a particularly disastrous experience when Freud referred the then 27-year-old patient to Fliess for surgery to remove the turbinate bone from her nose, ostensibly to cure her of premenstrual depression. Eckstein haemorrhaged profusely in the weeks following the procedure, almost to the point of death as infection set in. Freud consulted with another surgeon, who removed a piece of surgical gauze that Fliess had left behind.Christopher F. Monte, Beneath the Mask: An Introduction to Theories of Personality (6th Edition), \\"Chapter 2: Sigmund Freud - Psychoanalysis: The Clinical Evidence\\" (Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1999). Eckstein was left permanently disfigured, with the left side of her face caved in. Despite this, she remained on very good terms with Freud for many years, becoming a psychoanalyst herself. Fliess also remained close friends with Freud. He even predicted Freud's death would be around the age of 51, through one of his complicated bio-numerological theories (\\"critical period calculations\\"). Their friendship, however, did not last to see that prediction out: in 1904 their friendship disintegrated due to Fliess's belief that Freud had given details of a periodicity theory Fliess was developing to a plagiarist. Freud died at 83 years of age. Freud ordered that his correspondence with Fliess be destroyed. It is only known today because Marie Bonaparte purchased Freud's letters to Fliess and refused to permit their destruction. Personal life His son Robert Fliess was a psychoanalyst and a prolific writer in that field. He devised the phrase ambulatory psychosis.A Few Kind Words about Hate by Una Stannard Jeffrey Masson claimed that Fliess sexually molested his son Robert and that this caused Fliess to undermine Freud's investigation of the seduction theory because of its implications for his life.The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory Ballantine Books New York 2003 pages 138‚Äì142 His niece Beate Hermelin (n√©e Fliess) was an experimental psychologist who worked in the UK, where she made major contributions in what is now known as developmental cognitive neuroscience. Legacy Medical science has given a highly negative verdict to Fliess's theories. The nasogenital theory was briefly quite popular in late 19th century medical circles, but within a decade disappeared from the medical literature. Most scientists who have studied the question believe that the biorhythms theory has no more predictive power than chance \\"No evidence exists to support the concept of biorhythms; in fact, scientific data refute their existence.\\" and consider the concept an example of pseudoscience. \\"The theory of biorhythms is a pseudoscientific theory that claims our daily lives are significantly affected by rhythmic cycles overlooked by scientists who study biological rhythms.\\".. According to Frank Sulloway, most of Freud's sympathetic biographers have attributed Freud's adherence to Fliess's pseudoscience to their strong personal friendship. Martin Gardner suggested that Freud's willingness to entertain Fliess's \\"crackpottery\\" casts doubt on psychoanalysis itself and has strongly condemned what he viewed as orthodox Freudians' attempts to hush up an embarrassment in the history of the movement. Fliess appears as a character in Joseph Skibell's 2010 novel, A Curable Romantic. The story of the relationship between Freud and Fliess is told by Martin Gardner in his July 1966 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.

The mosque was established in 1826. This mosque is also known as Chulia Mosque and Periya Palli (meaning the \\"Big Mosque\\") among the Tamil Muslim community in Singapore. Together with its neighbour, Sri Mariamman Temple, the mosque stands out in its predominantly Chinese location. The Mosque Street that runs beside it may have been named after this mosque. History View of the mosque ca. 1900 Jamae Mosque was established by the Chulias, who were Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast of South India. They came to Singapore mostly as traders and money changers and set up three mosques within a short time, with Jamae Mosque being the first. The other two are Al-Abrar Mosque and Nagore Durgha, both of which are on Telok Ayer Street. A mosque was initially set up on South Bridge Road around 1826 under the leadership of Ansar Saib, and the current Jamae Mosque was then constructed on the site between 1830 and 1835. In 1881, after the early benefactors had died, a lease was granted to five trustees of the mosque, and in 1894, the Jamae Mosque and Nagore Durgha were placed under a new panel of court-appointed trustees. In 1917, the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board took over the management of the mosque until 1968, when it handed the reins over to Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). Despite two proposals to rebuild it, the present structure has remained more or less unchanged since it was completed in 1835. Repair work was undertaken in 1996. Jamae Mosque is skewed towards Mecca although the mosque's compound is aligned with the street grid. Jamae Mosque's value as a historical site was recognised when it was gazetted as a national monument on 19 November 1974. Architecture Masjid Jamae, showing the minarets which are octagonal at the base Worshippers enter the mosque through a gateway framed by two minarets topped by onion domes and a miniature four-storey palace fa√ßade. Rising out of solid bases, each minaret comprises seven levels embellished with a miniature mihrab motif and deep recesses. The palace fa√ßade sits on top of the gate, between the minarets. Intricately designed, it features tiny doors and cross-shaped windows. In the mosque compound are a covered foyer, the main prayer hall, and the ancillary prayer hall. It also contains a shrine to an early local Muslim religious leader, Muhammad Salih Valinvah, whose grave existed on the site before the construction of the mosque in the 1830s. From the foyer, a stairway leads to the parapet from which calls to prayer would have been announced. Beyond the foyer is the ancillary prayer hall, a square airy room with arched openings in its brick walls. Timber fanlights and bars decorate each opening, as do patterned Chinese green glazed tiles. Inside the ancillary hall is the main prayer hall. Also a square airy room, it is supported by two rows of Tuscan columns with elaborate mouldings. Verandahs lie on the north and south sides, separated from the hall proper by timber doors. The mosque's architectural style is eclectic that reflected the architectural styles of 1830s Singapore. While the entrance gate is distinctively South Indian, the two prayer halls and the shrine are in the Neo-Classical style typical of George Drumgoole Coleman, the first trained architect in Singapore. This uniqueness of Jamae Mosque made it a well-photographed landmark that may be seen in postcards from the 19th century to the present day.

Peniarth 28) Cyfraith Hywel (; Laws of Hywel), also known as Welsh law (Other names used by some manuscripts include Leges Howeli Boni, Leges Howeli Dha, Leges Howelda, Leges Wallic√¶, &c.;), was the system of law practised in medieval Wales before its final conquest by England. Subsequently, the Welsh law's criminal codes were superseded by the Statute of Rhuddlan in AD 1284 and its civil codes by Henry VIII's series of Laws in Wales Acts between 1535 and 1542. Welsh law was a form of Celtic law with many similarities to the Brehon law of Ireland and particularly the customs and terminology of the Britons of Strathclyde.Lloyd, J.E. A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest, Vol. I, p. 287. Longmans, 1912. Accessed 5 Feb 2013. It was passed down orally by jurists and bards and, according to tradition, only first codified during the reign of Hywel Dda in the mid-10th century. The earliest surviving manuscripts, however, are in Latin, date from the early 13th century, and show marked regional differences.Wade-Evans, Arthur. Welsh Medieval Law. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 1 Feb 2013. The law is only known to have been revised by a few rulers (particularly Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, who was credited with revisions retained in the kingdom of Powys) but was obviously updated by jurists in response to changing jurisdictions and circumstances, so that the surviving manuscripts cannot be considered an accurate portrayal of Hywel's first code. Notable features of Welsh law include the collective responsibility of kindreds (Welsh: cenedl) for their members; the gavelkind inheritance of land among all and only male descendants; a status-based system of blood money (galanas); slavery and serfdom; the inability of foreigners to naturalize earlier than the fourth generation; and very lax treatment of divorce and legitimacy that scandalized the non-native clergy. Overview The laws include the \\"laws of the court\\", the laws laying down the obligations and entitlements of the king and the officers of his court and the \\"laws of the country\\" dealing with every other topic. In some versions of the laws some of the material in the laws of the country are split off into the \\"justices' test book\\" dealing with homicide, theft and the values of wild and tame animals and other items. Within each of these sections there are tracts of varying length dealing with different subjects, for example the law of women and the law of contracts. Civil law differed from most other codes of law in the rule that on a landowner's death his land was to be shared equally between his sons, legitimate and illegitimate. This caused conflict with the church, as under canon law illegitimate children could not inherit. Once a case came to court, the method used to come to a decision was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended on the nature of the case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine. Origins Most of the surviving manuscripts of Welsh law start with a preamble explaining how the laws were codified by Hywel. The introduction to the Book of Blegywryd is a typical example: Medieval Kingdoms of Wales As each of the manuscripts dates from centuries later than Hywel‚Äôs time, this statement cannot be used to date the event described above. Professor Huw Pryce has demonstrated that some of the prologues were developed in response to attacks on Welsh law by Church men and Nobles who wished to gain rights more akin to those enjoyed by Ecclesiastics and the aristocracy in England.Pryce, ‚ÄòThe Prologues to the Welsh Lawbooks‚Äô, Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies 33 (1986), 151-182 In discussing Hywel‚Äôs association with the law, K. L. Maund suggests: On the other hand, the Iorwerth versions, produced in Gwynedd, have exactly the same attribution of the law to Hywel and the council at Whitland as do the southern versions. It is more likely that Hywel‚Äôs name was used to lend some form of ‚Äúancestral authority\\" to the laws. The best that may be said of Hywel‚Äôs association with the law is that a folk memory recalled a revision and rejuvenation of the law during his reign. Other kings are said to have introduced later modifications to the laws, for example Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, king of Gwynedd and Powys in the mid 11th century. Some of the legal material, such as the tract on the Seven Bishop Houses of Dyfed, may be dated to a very early period of law. Other material bears comparison with Early Irish Law. Manuscripts A page from the Black Book of Chirk (Peniarth 29) A page from a 13th Century Latin version of the laws of Hywel Dda. NLW, Pen.28 Although there are a substantial number of manuscripts containing the law texts, there are no existing manuscripts of law texts dating back to the time of Hywel and Welsh law was continually being revised and updated. There has been some debate among scholars as to whether the laws were originally written in Welsh or Latin. The Surexit memorandum in the Lichfield Gospels is a record of the outcome of legal proceedings dating from the 9th century and written in Welsh,For a translation of the Surexit memorandum see Charles- Edwards The Welsh laws p.75 and though it is not a law manual it does indicate the use of Welsh legal terms at that time. The earliest manuscripts known are Peniarth 28, written in Latin but now generally thought to be a translation of a Welsh original, and Peniarth 29, known as the Black Book of Chirk, written in Welsh. These are thought to date from the early or mid 13th century. There are a large number of law manuscripts, written mainly in Welsh but some in Latin, written between this period and the 16th century. Later manuscripts have been shown to reflect legal developments particularly in the Southern Welsh lordships.See S. E. Roberts, ‚ÄòPlaints in Welsh Mediaeval Law‚Äô, Journal of Celtic Studies 4 (2004), 219‚Äì61; G. A. Elias and M. E. Owen, 2013 \`Lawmen and Lawbooks', in Welsh Legal History Society XI, 106-51 and sources cited there. Apart from the full compilations there are shorter versions thought to have been working copies used by judges. However they are all usually considered to fall into three Redactions, known as the Cyfnerth Redaction, the Blegywryd Redaction and the Iorwerth Redaction. *The Cyfnerth Redaction, thought to be linked to the area between the River Wye and the River Severn, possibly Maeliennydd,Charles-Edwards The Welsh laws p.20 includes some of the least developed law. It is thought to have been compiled in the late 12th century when this area came under the rule of the Lord Rhys of Deheubarth. *The Blegywryd Redaction is associated with Deheubarth and shows signs of the influence of the church. *The Iorwerth Redaction is thought to represent the law as modified in Gwynedd during the reign of Llywelyn the Great in the first part of the 13th century by the jurist Iorwerth ap Madog. This is considered to be the most developed version of the law, though it does contain some archaic passages. The version in Llyfr Colan is thought to be a revision of Iorwerth, though also from the 13th century, and there is also the Llyfr y Damweiniau (possibly best translated as \\"The book of happenings\\", modern literal translation \\"The book of mistakes\\"), a collection of case-law linked to Colan. No manuscript has survived from Powys, though the Iorwerth Redaction does indicate where usage in Powys differs from usage in Gwynedd. Laws of the court Drawing of a falconer from Peniarth 28 The first part of the laws deal with the rights and duties of the king and the officers of the king's court. The order of precedence is set down: first the king, then the queen, then the or edling, the heir. Next come the officers of the court; the Iorwerth Redaction identifies twenty-four, of whom sixteen are the king's officers and eight the queen's officers. First in rank was the captain of the household troops, then the priest of the household, then the steward followed by the chief falconer, the court justice, the chief groom and the chamberlain. A list of additional officers follows, including such officers as the groom of the rein, the porter, the bakeress and the laundress. Each officer's entitlements and obligations are listed.Laws of Hywel Dda: Jenkins, Dafydd It introduces a number of legal terms. Sarhad could mean an insult or injury or the payment that was due to a person in the event of an insult or injury, and this varied according to the status of the person concerned, for example the queen or the edling's sarhad was one third that of the king. Galanas was a form of weregild and represented the value of a person's life in the event of a homicide and was set at three times the sarhad, though the sarhad was also payable by the killer. Dirwy was a fine payable for crimes and camlwrw a smaller fine for less serious offences, while ebediw was a death duty payable to the deceased's lord. Sarhad and dirwy are still Welsh words meaning ‚Äòinsult‚Äô and ‚Äòfine‚Äô respectively, The origins of the various redactions are reflected in the relative position of the rulers of the Welsh kingdoms. The Iorwerth Redaction manuscripts proclaim the superiority of the king of Aberffraw, chief seat of the kingdom of Gwynedd, over the others, while the manuscripts from Deheubarth claim at least equality for the king of Dinefwr, chief seat of the southern kingdom. While Welsh law lays more emphasis on the powers of the king than the Brehon Law of Ireland, this is still restricted compared to many other codes. As Moore comments: Laws of the country=Classes For the purposes of the laws, Welsh society was divided into five classes: the rulers, including the king (rhi or brenin) over his kingdom and the lords over their fiefs; the free Welsh, including both the pedigreed aristocracy (boneddigion or uchelwr) and the yeomen together; the Welsh serfs (taeogion, ailltion, or bileiniaid); foreigners resident in Wales (alltudion); and the slaves (caethion).Wade-Evans, p. 448.Note that Aneurin Owen, however, considered caethion as synonymous with ailltion by the time of Hywel. (Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales, Glossary). The privileges, penalties, and obligations due by law varied with the social status of the person concerned.Jenkins, Dafydd. Law of Hywel Dda. Naturalization At the time of Hywel's laws, Cymry the modern Welsh for all of the Welsh people apparently only applied to the free classes and not to serfs or slaves. However, none of them counted as a \\"foreigner\\" and, even if they moved from one Welsh \\"kingdom\\" (gwlad) to another, they did not suffer that status but were considered fully native.Wade-Evans, p. 331. Those from outside Wales were considered between serfs and slaves, forbidden to offer testimony, and obliged to pledge themselves to a native Welshman (even a serfWade-Evans, p. 325.) who would be responsible for them. This status could only be removed after three generations in the north and possibly as many as nine elsewhere, after which the foreigner's descendants were considered to be native serfs. Laws of women The position of women under Welsh law differed significantly to that of their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man without the consent of her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements as if she had been given by her kin.D. B. Walters The European context of the Welsh law of matrimonial property in Jenkins and Owen (ed.) The Welsh law of women p. 117 A number of payments are connected with marriage. Amobr, or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on the loss of her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. Cowyll, or maiden-fee, was a payment due to the woman from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (agweddi) was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple which was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool.Jenkins Hywel Dda: the law pp. 310‚Äì311, 329 The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as argyvrau. If a woman found her husband with another woman, she was entitled to a payment of six score pence (i.e. half a pound) the first time and a pound the second time; on the third occasion she was entitled to divorce him. If the husband had a concubine, the wife was allowed to strike her without having to pay any compensation, even if it resulted in the concubine's death.Morfydd E. Owen Shame and reparation: woman's place in the kin in Jenkins and Owen (ed.) The Welsh law of women p. 51 A woman could only be beaten by her husband for three things: for giving away something which she was not entitled to give away, for being found with another man, or for wishing a blemish on her husband's beard. If he beat her for any other cause, she was entitled to the payment of sarhad. If the husband found her with another man and beat her, he was not entitled to any further compensation. According to the law, women were not allowed to inherit land. However, there were exceptions, even at an early date. A poem dated to the first half of the 11th century is an elegy for Aeddon, a landowner on Anglesey. The poet says that after his death his estate was inherited by four women who had originally been brought to Aeddon's court as captives after a raid and had found favour with him.Jarman p. 119 The rule for the division of moveable property when one of a married couple died was the same for both sexes. The property was divided into two equal halves, with the surviving partner keeping one half and the dying partner being free to give bequests from the other half. Criminal law The 'Boston Manuscript'. An annotated 14th century Welsh version of the laws (f.6.v) Murder was regarded as an offence against the family rather than against society or the state. It was normally dealt with by the payment of blood money (galanas) by the killer and his extended family to the family of the deceased. The base sum was computed by the social status and position of the victim. The galanas of the king of Deheubarth was set at an impossibly long line of impossibly perfect cattle to ensure it could never be met; the family of a murdered slave, meanwhile, received no galanas, although the slave's owner was to be compensated for the loss. This sum might then be modified in certain situations (for example, an attack from ambush doubled the base fine). Upon the payment of the blood money, the victim's family was then legally bound to forgo its vengeance (dial). Murder by poison, however, carried the death penalty. Assault or offenses against honor were dealt with in a similar fashion, through a fine called sarhaed. However, it only applied to the upper classes: any serf who struck a free man was to liable to have the offending limb removed. The crime of rape was treated as a theft and remedied by the payment of another fine (dirwy), payment of which restored the woman's virginity for legal purposes. A man who could not pay the fine was to have his testicles removed. Similarly, a convicted thief was imprisoned in the first instance, but a serf convicted for the third time was to have his hand removed. (Assuming he was not caught in the act: thieves caught with goods in hand more valuable than four ceiniogau were liable for hanging.Lloyd, p. 306.) Such strong penalties led the Welsh to narrowly define \\"theft\\", however: forcible robbery was considered much less serious. Further, a hungry man who had passed at least three towns without receiving a meal could not be punished for stealing food.Richards. The law of Hywel Dda, p. 113 Aiding and abetting including witnessing a killing and failing to protect the victim or receiving stolen property was also punished with dirwy fines. Although Hywel's commission generally recorded the traditions of the country, one modification they made was to end the right of nobles to trial by combat, finding it unjust.Owen, Aneurin. Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales: comprising laws supposed to be enacted by Howel the Good and anomalous laws, consisting principally of institutions which by the statute of Ruddlan [sic were admitted to continue in force], Vol. II. Public Record Office of Great Britain, 1841. Accessed 5 Feb 2013. Compensation Medieval Welsh law placed a high value on compensation for any breach of the law. In particular, high and detailed compensation values were given for each limb of the body. There are nine limbs of equal value (that is the hands, the eyes, the lips, the feet, and the nose) each of which is valued at 480 pennies, every other limb is carefully valued and can be altered depending on various influencing factors. The values given to eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, and feet are identical; termed as the ‚ÄòLimbs of equal value‚Äô they represent 12.7% of the standard galanas for a boneheddig (A boneheddig is a standard free-man, whose galanas is valued at 3780 pennies/ 63 cows). There are no additional complexities to any of these costs, except when it comes to ears. The Iorwerth manuscripts and LATIN A do not value the ear itself at 480 pennies, instead they differentiate between the loss of an ear and the loss of hearing. If the ear is lost but the victim can still hear, then the price lies at 160 pennies, whilst deafness (even without the loss of ear) retains the 480 penny value. This is a rare example of a ‚Äòfunctional value being given where the loss of the function of the ear... is appreciated and not the organ itself‚Äô. Harris notes that although these members are all given equal value, it seems there is some underlying notion that some are perhaps more essential than others (at least in the Iorwerth and LATIN A texts) with hearing being more important than any of the other senses. Fingers are valued at 80 pence each, whilst a thumb has a value of 180 pence which corresponds to its use in ‚Äògripping agricultural equipment or arms‚Äô. The Iorwerth and Cyfnerth 5 recensions value a finger nail at 30 pence, whilst the top of the finger to the first knuckle is valued (in the same texts) at 26 2/3 of a penny. The price of a fingernail as it is valued in Iorwerth and Cyfnerth is 0.8% of the galanas, and intriguingly the thumbnail in the Wessex tariff also stands at 0.8% of the wergild value for the man.[7] Harris argues that these similar percentages reflect the co-existence of two legal systems in Wales; the Welsh and the English. The triad known as the Tri Arberygl Dyn (Three Dangerous wounds of man) specifies three injuries for which > ‚Äòteyr punt a geyf y nep a archoller y gan y nep ay harchollo‚Äô > ‚ÄòHe who is wounded shall have 3 pounds from him who wounds him‚Äô. These are; when a man is cut so that the brains can be seen, when a man is pierced so his entrails can be seen, and when one of the four posts of the body (the limbs) are broken. The body parts appear to be classed for compensation based on how much use they have in society. The higher the use; the higher the compensation cost. Loss of hearing, for example, as well as loss of testes and/or penis incur very high redress rates, because their loss will cause either danger or an inability to continue lineage, which was highly important in such a kin-based society. The tongue is also particularly high because, as with the ear, it would have formed the primary means of communication for the victim. Also notable are the different grades of compensation given to wounds depending on the degree of disfigurement produced by the wounding, with a differentiation between craith ogyfarch; a conspicuous scar which attracts remarks, and craith guiddiedig; a hidden scar which will therefore attract less remarks. The craith ogyfarch afforded the most compensation, but the value of the ogyfarch compensation varied according to its noticability. The three most conspicuous scars are given as those on a face (six score pence), on a hand (sixty pence), and on a foot (thirty pence), whilst a hidden scar is given only four pence. The Latin texts A and E ‚Äòmake provision for a cloak to cover facial disfigurement‚Äô and front teeth were also accorded a higher value than other teeth. Surety and contracts The section on surety lays down the rules if a person acts as mach or surety, for example for a debt, and gives the provisions for various cases, such as where the debtor refuses to pay or denies the debt and where the surety denies the suretyship or contests the sum involved. Rules are also given for the giving and forfeiting of gages. Another aspect is amod or contract, usually made by the two parties calling amodwyr who are witnesses to prove the terms agreed by the parties. It is laid down that: In what is thought to be an archaic survival in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled to act as sureties or to give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give sureties, and could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed to act as sureties. In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give sureties and could under certain circumstances act as sureties. This appears to indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of women in this respect.Robin Chapman Stacey, The archaic core of Llyfr Iorwerth in Jenkins and Owen Welsh law of women pp. 22‚Äì27 Land law This is followed by land law, setting out the procedure in the event of rival ownership claims over land. Court was convened on the land itself, with both claimants calling witnesses to support their claims. In the Iorwerth Redaction, it is stated that the claimants were entitled to the representation by both types of lawyer - cyngaws and canllaw. If both claims were deemed to have equal merit, the law allowed for the land to be shared equally between the two claimants. On the death of a landowner (priodawr) his immovable estate (land) passed in joint tenancy (cytir) to his sons, similar to the gavelkind system of Kent. Then the youngest son partitioned (cyfran) the land equally, and each brother took his share. Illegitimate sons were entitled to shares equal to those of legitimate sons, provided they had been acknowledged by the father. This provision differed the most from canon law; as the Iorwerth text puts it: Dadannudd is a son's claim to land which previously belonged to his father. A landowner's right to convey land was restricted; it was only allowed under certain circumstances with the consent of his kindred and coheirs (laudatio parentum). With the consent of the lord and the kindred, the landowner could use the living gage (prid). The land would be made over to a gagee (pridwr) for a period of four years, and if the land had not been redeemed by the gagor (owner) or his heirs at the end of the four years, the gage could then be renewed for additional four-year periods. After three renewals (or 16 years total), the land passed permanently to the gagee.T. Jones Pierce Medieval Welsh society p. 384 Succession From the time of the fall of Rome, Wales was divided into numerous petty \\"kingdoms\\" (gwledydd, lit. \\"peoples\\"Wade-Evans, p. 342.) which were repeatedly unified and then redivided. It is frequently stated that Welsh law demanded the division of a kingdom between all the ruler's sons, but that is a misunderstanding of the inheritance law the crown itself was unitary but the king's lands (maertref) were required to be divided among all of his acknowledged sons by whatever mother. This naturally weakened the position of the new king and that weakness, along with the long free and separate traditions of the various Welsh gwledydd, then permitted disputes and civil wars among the family appanages.Cf. Stephenson's Governance of Gwynedd, pp. 138‚Äì141. Further, by the time of Hywel, the kingdoms normally taken as independent Deheubarth, Powys, &c.; were nominally subordinate to the elder line of the family in Gwynedd and bound to display that with annual gifts. The confusion of the 11th century and the use of the Saxon loanword edling for the heir also seem to have clouded the issue. By law, the principal homestead (and presumably the realm) were to go to the king's eldest son, but this was subject to several important provisos: :(a) First, the son could not be damaged in any limb, blind, deaf, or mentally retarded.Owen, p. 687. :(b) Second, although this was not explicitly codified,Unless implicit in the requirements for mental maturity above. it seems to have been the case that the heir must be of age (around 27Wolcott's treatment ignores that the Welsh often counted inclusively (that is, their rule would state \\"14\\" or be \\"28\\" but the year intended would be our \\"13\\" or \\"27\\"). or 28 years old) to qualify as an edling.Wolcott, Darrell. \\"Minimum Age for Welsh Kingship in the 11th Century\\". Accessed 5 Feb 2013. The eldest son of a king who died before that was barred from direct inheritance but possessed the right to retake the throne himself on the attainment of majority. The number of princes rebelling just prior to their 30th year may even indicate that they were required to assert their rights at that point or lose them. If the eldest son were ineligible for whatever reason, his brothers, uncles, and first and second cousins were all considered legitimate substitutes. Likewise, even when the eldest son did inherit, other descendants of his great-grandfather were considered legitimate rulers and not usurpers if they were able to wrest control away from him. Finally, although our surviving editions of Hywel's law explicitly forbid inheritance by or through female members of the royal family, Hywel's line itself derived from lords of Man who had (allegedly) married into the dynasties of Gwynedd and Powys and there are numerous examples through the 11th century of kings asserting their legitimacy on account of royal mothers, despite surviving underage representatives of the male line of succession. The justices' test book This is only a separate section in the Iorwerth Redaction; in the other versions the material is incorporated in the \\"Laws of the country\\" section. It is a compilation of the rules for dealing with the \\"Three Columns of Law\\", namely cases of homicide, theft and fire, and \\"The Value of Wild and Tame\\". There are also appendices dealing with joint ploughing and corn damage by stock. The value of wild and tame \\"The value of wild and tame\\" gives the values of various animals, for example: Values are also given for trees, equipment and parts of the human body. The value of a part of the body was fixed, thus a person causing the king to lose an eye would pay the same as if he had caused a villein to lose an eye. However he would also have to pay sarhad, and this would be far greater for the king than for the villein. Administration of the law The main administrative divisions of mediaeval Wales were the cantrefs, each of which was divided into several commotes. These were of particular importance in the administration of the law. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the \\"uchelwyr\\", the main landowners of the cantref. This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present in the cantref, or if he was not present by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries and matters concerning inheritance. The commote court later took over most of the functions of the cantref court. The judges (Welsh ynad) in Gwynedd were professionals, while in south Wales the professional judges worked together with the free landowners of the district, all of whom were entitled to act as judges.Charles-Edwards The Welsh laws p.15 A person accused of a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding a certain number of persons prepared to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as compurgation. The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the man would have to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (gwybyddiaid). A witness who has once been proved to have given false testimony on oath was barred from ever appearing as a witness again. The task of the judge, having considered the case, was to determine what sort of proof was appropriate and which of the parties was to be required to produce proof, whether by the calling of witnesses, by compurgation or by pledges, then in the light of the proof to adjudicate on the case and impose the appropriate penalty in accordance with the law if a penalty was called for.R.R. Davies The administration of law in medieval Wales: the role of the Ynad Cwmwd (Judex Patriae) in Charles-Edwards, Owen and Walters Lawyers and laymen p.267 According to the Iorwerth Redaction, a prospective judge had to be at least twenty-five years of age and his legal knowledge has to be approved by the Court Justice: :... when his teacher sees that he is worthy, let him send him to the Court Justice, and it is for the Court Justice to test him, and if he finds him worthy, it is for him to send him to the Lord and it is for the Lord to grant him justiceship ... And it is for him to give twenty-four pence to the Court Justice as his fee.Jenkins Hywel Dda p. 141 It was possible to appeal against a judge's decision, and the appellant could demand that the judge show the authority of a book for his judgment. The consequences for a judge could be serious if his judgement was reversed, involving a financial penalty equivalent to the value of his tongue as laid down in the values of the parts of the body. He would also be banned from acting as a judge in future.Charles-Edwards, Owen and Walters Lawyers and laymen p.339 Impact of the Norman and Edwardian conquests=Marcher lordships Welsh law usually applied in the Welsh Marches as well as the areas ruled by Welsh princes. In the event of a dispute, the first argument in the border regions might be about which law should apply. For example, when Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn was in dispute with Roger Mortimer about some lands, it was Gruffydd who wanted the case heard under English law and Mortimer who wanted Welsh law to apply. The matter went to the royal justices, who decided in 1281 that since the lands concerned lay in Wales, Welsh law should be used.Moore The Welsh wars of independence p. 149 Edwardian conquest Welsh law came to be a particularly important badge of nationhood in the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly during the struggle between Llywelyn the Last and King Edward I of England in the second half of the 13th century.See the account of the dispute over land in Arwystli between Llywelyn the Last and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn supported by Edward I and its implications in Davies Conquest, coexistence and change: Wales 1063‚Äì1415 pp. 346‚Äì7 Llywelyn stated: The Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham when involved in negotiations with Llywelyn on behalf of King Edward in 1282 sent Llywelyn a letter in which he denounced Welsh law, stating that King Hywel must have been inspired by the devil. Peckham had presumably consulted the Peniarth 28 manuscript which was apparently held in the library at St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury at this time.Daniel Huws, Leges Howelda at Canterbury in The National Library of Wales Journal, XIX (1976), pp. 340‚Äì4 One of the features to which the English church objected was the equal share of land given to illegitimate sons. Following Llywelyn's death the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 introduced English criminal law into Wales: \\"in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters and manifest and notorious robberies ‚Äî we will that they shall use the laws of England\\".Quoted in Williams Recovery, reorientation and reformation pp. 35‚Äì6 Nearly two hundred years after Welsh law ceased to be used for criminal cases, the poet Dafydd ab Edmwnd (fl. 1450‚Äì80) wrote an elegy for his friend, the harpist Si√¥n Eos, who had accidentally killed a man in a tavern brawl in Chirk. Si√¥n Eos was hanged, and Dafydd ab Edmwnd laments that he could not have been tried under the more humane Law of Hywel rather than \\"the law of London\\".Parry, Thomas. ed. The Oxford book of Welsh verse. Oxford University Press, 1962. pp. 138‚Äì141 Welsh law was still used for civil cases such as land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer claim part of the inheritance.Davies Conquest, coexistence and change p.368 The Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542 brought Wales entirely under English law; when the 1535 Act declares the intention utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs belonging to Wales, Welsh law was probably the main target. Welsh law after the Laws in Wales Acts The last recorded case to be heard under Welsh law was a case concerning land in Carmarthenshire in 1540, four years after the 1536 Act had stipulated that only English law was to be used in Wales.Charles-Edwards The Welsh laws p.93 Even in the 17th century in some parts of Wales there were unofficial meetings where points of dispute were decided in the presence of arbiters using principles laid down in Welsh law.T. Jones Pierce Medieval Welsh society pp. 386‚Äì7 Antiquarian interest in the laws continued, and in 1730 a translation by William Wotton was published. In 1841 Aneurin Owen edited an edition of the laws entitled Ancient laws and institutions of Wales, and was the first to identify the various Redactions, which he named the \\"Gwentian Code\\" (Cyfnerth), the \\"Demetian Code\\" (Blegywryd) and the \\"Venedotian Code\\" (Iorwerth). His edition was followed by a number of other studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Carmarthenshire County Council has set up the Hywel Dda Centre in Whitland, with an interpretative centre and garden to commemorate the original council. Contemporary Welsh Law is a term applied to the body of primary and secondary legislation generated by the Welsh Parliament (Senedd), according to devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of the Senedd. The first legislation to be officially proposed was called the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008. These powers have been effective since May, 2007. It is the first time in almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since Cyfraith Hywel was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542 by King Henry VIII of England. In later fiction Ellis Peters in The Cadfael Chronicles often uses the ancient Welsh laws. The novel called Monk's Hood mentions the Cyfraith Hywel (called Hywel Dda). A recognised son, born out of wedlock has an over-riding claim to his father's property. The manor is in Wales. His demand could be accepted because the manor, lying in Wales, is under Welsh law.

Around 22,000 people attended the festival in 2007 where they witnessed the work of over 200 artists from all over the world. The festival took place once every two years in Boston, Massachusetts, USA usually spanning the last week of April and the first week in May. The festival was first held on 1 ‚Äì 15 May 1999, and the last festival took place on 22 April ‚Äì 8 May 2011. The Festivals were organized by Boston Cyberarts Inc, a non-profit arts organization. , the director of Cyberarts is George Fifield, who was one of the original cofounders of the organization. Boston Cyberarts, Inc. continues to exist as a non-profit arts organization, but has redirected its energies to promoting the arts and technology year-round, rather than biennially. The most visible continuing effort is the Boston Cyberarts Gallery, which used to be the Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media. The gallery was and is located in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, in the Green Street station building on the MBTA Orange Line rapid transit line. The online presence of the past Boston Cyberarts Festivals, including online exhibits, is archived and still accessible free of charge. Location The festival was located in Boston, Massachusetts. The festival usually featured a central headquarters where visitors could get information about the events and also attend the opening night party. Massachusetts had arguably the densest population of digital artists in the US, making Boston the high-technology cultural center of the country. The festival‚Äôs events were held in Boston‚Äôs art galleries, museums, universities, and public spaces. For those unable to attend the festival physically, there were virtual festival events held on the internet. First event Around 22,000 people attended the Festival in 2007 where they witnessed the work of over 200 artists from all over the world. Events and exhibitions took place at 81 Festival events organized by over 60 arts organizations in Boston. The events featured: * Visual art * Animation * Video * Music * Film * Dance * Installations * Lectures * Conferences; and * Discussions Boston Cyberarts Inc also presented its own exhibitions and performances during the Festival. For example, at the Computer Museum they presented the exhibition ‚ÄòMind into Matter‚Äô, co-curated by Festival director George Fifield and Francine Koslow Miller. This was the first international survey of digital sculpture. Over 100 events took place organized by 60 cultural and education institutions, including museum and gallery exhibitions and visual arts programming. Art The art work at the festival has been produced using computers; often alongside more traditional mediums such as paint, photography, film, musical instruments or dance and performance. The festival celebrates international art and the wealth of artistic talent in its home region of Massachusetts, United States. Awards In 2007, the Boston Cyberarts Festival received the following awards: * The Commonwealth Award. This is the State‚Äôs highest honor in the arts, humanities and sciences. This award recognizes an individual or group that has created economic activity, created jobs or generated income through arts and culture. The Awards are given every two years by the Massachusetts Cultural Council (MCC), and are chosen by a committee of cultural and business leaders from a pool of nominations received from across the State.

It is a neoclassical building which houses the Rhode Island General Assembly and the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and general treasurer of Rhode Island. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places. History This is Rhode Island's seventh state house and the second in Providence after the Old Rhode Island State House. The architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White designed it, and it was constructed from 1895 to 1904. The building had a major renovation in the late 1990s. It served as the United States Capitol exterior in the 1997 film Amistad. It also served as the City Hall of Capital City in Disney's Underdog. Description The Independent Man The Rhode Island State House is constructed of of white Georgia marble, 15 million bricks, and of iron floor beams. The dome is the fourth-largest self-supporting marble dome in the world, after St. Peter's Basilica, the Minnesota State Capitol, and the Taj Mahal. On top of the dome is a gold-covered bronze statue of the Independent Man, originally named \\"Hope\\". The statue weighs more than ; it is tall and stands above the ground. The Independent Man represents freedom and independence and alludes to the independent spirit which led Roger Williams to settle and establish Providence Plantations and later the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The chamber of the Rhode Island Senate is located in the east wing of the building, and the chamber of the Rhode Island House of Representatives is located in the west wing. Other notable rooms include the rotunda (beneath the dome), the State Library (north end), and the State Room (south end). The State Room is an entrance area for the office of the governor and contains a full-scale portrait of George Washington by Rhode Island native Gilbert Stuart. This room is also where the governor has press conferences and bill signings at the State House. It was one of the first public buildings to use electricity. It is lit by 109 floodlights and two searchlights at night. In 2013, Governor Lincoln Chafee's administration started to remove grass from the eastern side of the Statehouse lawn in order to provide extra parking for employees. The move was opposed by the Capital Center Commission, the public board designated to oversee zoning requirements within the district. Supporters of the proposed parking say that there is demand from employees and visitors to the building. Opponents point to existing zoning requirements that make the surface lot illegal, point to the expense of providing parking, and advocate an increased presence for transit, biking, walking, and carpooling instead. The state spent $3.1 million on an adjoining piece of land on Francis Street next to I-95 for parking, which provides 100 parking spots at around $30,000 a space. Christmas at the State House The 2013 State House tree It is an annual State House tradition to feature a Christmas tree and community and cultural holiday displays each December. A Fraser fir or Balsam fir is erected in the rotunda and decorated. The tree, donated by a local family or tree farm, is typically between 17 and 25 feet tall. It has become a holiday tradition in local media to feature stories about problems with Rhode Island's state tree, often meriting front page treatment: * In 2005, the tree was removed from the rotunda after a treatment with flame retardant caused the needles to fall out. * In 2007, a \\"sickly-looking\\" tree was spotted being replaced a few weeks before Christmas. * In 2011 Bishop Thomas J. Tobin and others objected to the wording on tree- lighting ceremony invitations, which referred to the tree as a \\"holiday\\" tree. Protestors at the tree-lighting ceremony lit a protest tree of their own and sang ‚ÄúO, Christmas Tree,‚Äù drowning out the official music provided by a local children's chorus. * In 2012, the official tree lighting ceremony was canceled, as Governor Chafee hastily flipped a switch and left the State House. * In 2013, Governor Chafee changed the wording to \\"Christmas\\" tree. * In 2016, a 14-foot Fraser Fir was deemed too small for the rotunda. A replacement 20-foot tree was placed in the rotunda, and the smaller tree moved to the south steps. * In 2017, the rotunda's 25-foot Fraser Fir made national headlines when it began dropping needles \\"at an alarming rate,\\" after being on display for three weeks. The New York Post remarked, \\"this is the saddest state capital Christmas tree.\\" The sickly tree was replaced with a smaller (12-foot) tree. * The 2018 tree was an 18-foot tall Douglas fir donated by a South Kingstown tree farm. * For 2019, state staff assembled and decorated 18-foot artificial tree, described as a \\"replica of a California Baby Redwood.\\" Since 2014, holiday displays from \\"any Rhode Island area-based religious or secular group\\" have been featured on the first and second floors. Participating groups have included local religious, ethnic, and secular organizations.

It is located between the towns of Birkirkara and ƒ¶amrun, and it also borders Qormi and Msida. History Casa Leoni The Old Church of Santa Venera was built in 1473, and it was enlarged in 1500, rebuilt between 1658 and 1688 and again in the 19th century. This church remained as the parish church until 1989. A new church was blessed in 2005. The reconstructed Wignacourt Arch In 1610, Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt financed the building of the Wignacourt Aqueduct to transport water from springs in Rabat and Dingli to the capital Valletta, passing through various towns along the way including Santa Venera. The Aqueduct was finished in 1615, and an ornamental gateway was built where it crossed the road between what is now Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera. The arches stopped at a tower known as it- Turretta (the Turret) also known as Tower Guard, also in Santa Venera. From this tower, water continued its journey to ƒ¶amrun, Blata l-Bajda, Floriana and Valletta through underground pipes. Casa Leoni, also known as Palazzo Manoel, was built around 1730 during the reign of Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena. Its design is attributed to Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, the French military engineer who also designed Mdina Gate and parts of Fort Manoel. During the French blockade, Casa Leoni served as a Maltese insurgent command base, and it later served as a residence of Governors of Malta, a depository of the Museums Department and a government primary school. It now houses the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change. The palace has a large garden behind it, part of which was opened to the public in 1977 as Romeo Romano Gardens. Former 7 Up factory, now multipurpose shops, restaurants and apartments In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town of Santa Venera saw more development and various churches and institutes were built. The town was considered as part of Birkirkara until 1912, and it became a separate parish six years later in 1918. A 7 Up factory was located at Santa Venera until it was closed in 2002. The factory was demolished to make way for flats but the fa√ßades of the buildings were retained. In 1990, a large church began to be built in Santa Venera. Although it is still unfinished as the belfries have not yet been built, it was consecrated in 2005 as the new parish church. Symbols The flag and coat of arms of Santa Venera are red with a white stripe in the middle and three red fleur-de-lys on the stripe, taken from the coat of arms of the Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt who ruled the islands from 1601 to 1622. The flag was introduced when Malta's local councils were created in 1993. Education Vincenzo Bugeja Conservatory and Chapel of St Vincent Santa Venera has a number of educational institutions which include the following: *Saint Elias College a Catholic secondary school run by the Carmelite Friars. Its mission statement is to form a learning community where each individual is considered to be a child of God.

Besides paper documents, it is one of four still-existing objects that were present during the Constitutional Convention, along with the Liberty Bell, the chair that George Washington sat in as the Constitutional Convention's presiding officer, and Independence Hall itself. The inkstand was made by Philip Syng in 1752 for the provincial assembly of Pennsylvania. It is both a work of art and an important historical artifact, as it was used by such prominent Founding Fathers of the United States as Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, James Madison, and the other signers of the founding documents. Desktop inkstands hold ink for quill pens and other tools that require ink. Ornate versions include a pen holder, an inkpot, a candle to melt sealing wax, and a pot similar to a salt or pepper shaker used to pour pounce to aid in the sizing of parchment or vellum. The Syng inkstand is decorated in late Rococo style and includes a pounce pot, quill holder, and inkpot (left to right in the image shown). Syng immigrated to America from Ireland in 1713. He was a renowned silversmith who created fine works in silver and gold for the wealthy families of Philadelphia. He was an associate of Benjamin Franklin and a prominent member of the Philadelphia community who assisted in founding the Library Company of Philadelphia, the American Philosophical Society, the Union Fire Company, and the University of Pennsylvania.. In 1731, Syng served as Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. The Syng inkstand became the property of the State of Pennsylvania and was moved to the state capital in Harrisburg soon after the Constitutional Convention ended. It was returned to the City of Philadelphia in 1876, on the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, where it became famous. It was displayed in Independence Hall on a desk in front of George Washington's chair. Cracks appeared in the plaster ceiling of Independence Hall in 1922 and stoked fears that the building would collapse, and the inkstand was considered such an important artifact that it was removed at the same time that the first floor was cleared of visitors. The National Park Service acquired the inkstand when it took over maintenance of Independence Hall from the City of Philadelphia. It is now on display in a special case in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, along with copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

They are thus referred to because usually at the end of each day, its footage is developed, synced to sound, and printed on film in a batch (or telecined onto video tape or disk) for viewing the next day by the director, for selected actors and film crew members. Dailies serve as an indication of how the filming and the actors' performances are progressing.IMDb Film Glossary ‚Äì 2007 Another way to describe film dailies is \\"the first positive prints made by the laboratory from the negative photographed on the previous day\\".\\"Glossary of Film / Video Terms\\" by the Magic Film Works, 2007 In some regions such as the UK, India and Canada, dailies are usually referred to as rushes or daily rushes, referring to the speed at which the prints are developed.\\"Glossary\\" of filmmaker terms, The Competition Commission (established by the Competition Act 1998), UK, 2001 In animation, dailies are also called rushes or sweat box sessions. Film dailies can refer to the viewing of dailies on film in a theater.\\"The case for film dailies\\", American Cinematographer, April 2004  Viewing  Dailies are usually viewed by members of the film crew either early in the morning before filming starts, during the lunch break, or in the evening after filming ends. It is common for several members of the film crew including the director, cinematographer, editor and others to view and discuss the dailies as a group, but some productions opt to distribute multiple copies of the dailies for individual viewing (e.g., on DVD). Viewing dailies allows the film crew to see exactly what images and audio were captured the previous day, in order to detect such technical problems as dirty, scratched, or out-of-focus film. It also presents opportunity for the director to evaluate the actor performances, toward avoidance of later schedule conflicts, and to confirm having captured a scene from an adequate assortment of camera angles. If additional filming seems expedient, the timely availability of the video is likely to avoid duplication of setup costs, and reduce later actor-scheduling conflicts. Dailies are also often viewed separately by producers, and by studio executives not engaged, day-by-day, in production and must have other assurances that it meets their respective expectations as investors. Commonly, dailies sequences are repetitious, often including multiple takes of the same shot. Film directors and film producers prefer to view dailies on film, rather than on DVD dailies. However, because of the costs involved, some productions will start by viewing film dailies and later switch to DVD dailies.Die Hard 4, \\"One Man Riot Squad\\", July 2007, American Cinematographer One reason why film dailies are preferred over DVD dailies, is that it is much easier to check for correct focus, when using film (rather than video) dailies.\\"Post-Production Planning During Pre-Production\\", by Andy Pratt, 2007 HD dailies can have resolution as high as 2k (e.g. 2048 x 858, with 2.39:1 aspect ratio).\\"RED  Mythbusters\\" http://www.red.com/ (2008) In the production of low-budget films with few crew and a short and uninterrupted shooting period, there may be no time available for viewing of dailies.(mostly in English)  Contents  Many films have one main film unit which does all primary filming and one or more smaller film units shooting additional \\"pickup\\" shots, stunts, or shots involving special effects. These shots are included with the main unit footage on the dailies reels. A typical pickup shot might be a simple shot of the exterior of a building which does not involve any actors, and is filmed with a smaller crew to save time and money. If a unit shoots with more than one camera usually all the shots from one \\"A\\" camera will be followed by all \\"B\\" camera shots because of the way the dailies are processed. To save time, ordinarily only a small amount of the previous day's footage is viewed. If viewing dailies on video, often all the footage is transferred and the viewer can fast-forward as desired. Dailies on print film are more expensive to produce and cannot be easily fast-forwarded. In this case, during shooting the director will specify which takes he or she wants converted to dailies. When a take is completed, the director yells, \\"Cut\\" and if the director wants the take converted to dailies, the director will also yell, \\"Print\\". Once the director yells, \\"Cut! Print!\\", the script supervisor, the camera assistant and the sound person circle the take number on their log sheets so that only these circle takes will be printed that night by the film laboratory. The end of a dailies reel may contain sound that was recorded without simultaneous picture recording called wild sound. Visual effects shots are often assembled daily for viewing by a visual effects or animation supervisor. They will contain the previous day's work by animators and effects artists in various state of completion. Once a shot is at the point where additional feedback from the director is needed they will be assembled and screened for the director either as part of the normal dailies screening or as a separate weekly VFX dailies screening. Dailies delivered to the editing department will usually have timecode and keycode numbers overlaid on the image. These numbers are used to later assemble the original high-quality film and audio to conform to the edit. Depending on how the dailies are produced, these numbers may only be on the editor's copy of the dailies or on all copies of the dailies.  Creation  During the typical filming of a motion picture, a movie camera captures the image on 35 mm film and a separate audio recorder (such as a Nagra tape recorder or digital hard disk recorder) records the sound on-set. The film negative is developed and printed or telecined so that the images can be viewed on a projector or video monitor. The sound is synched to the film using a clapperboard as a reference. The clapperboard is labeled to identify the scene, shot, and take number for the camera. The numbers are also read aloud to label the audio recording. Once camera and sound are rolling, a camera assistant will close the clapper creating a visual and auditory reference point. During the synching process after the film has been developed, the technician will look at the numbers on the slate board and then match the numbers with the verbal slate. Then the technician looks for the frame where the clapper first closes and for the beep or clapping sound on the audio tape, adjusting one or the other until they happen simultaneously when played back. This needs to be done for every take. Systems exist which record synchronized timecode onto the film and audio tape at the time of shooting, allowing for automatic alignment of picture and audio. In practice these systems are rarely used. Before computer-based editing tools became widely available in the late 1980s, all feature-film dailies were printed on film. These pieces of film are called the workprint. After viewing, the workprint is used by the film editor to edit the movie using a flatbed editor. Once the workprint is edited and approved, the negative is assembled so it is identical to the edited workprint. Today, most editing is done on computer based non-linear editing systems which use a video copy of the dailies. When the film is telecined, keycode numbers are logged which assign a number to each frame of film and are later used to assemble the original film to conform to the edit.  Video or digital film  When using a video camera or digital motion picture camera, the image and sound are often recorded simultaneously to video tape or hard disk in a format that can be immediately viewed on a monitor, eliminating the need to undergo a conversion process to create dailies for viewing. The footage recorded each day will still usually go through a daily process to create a second copy for protection and create multiple copies on DVD or other media for viewing by producers or other people not on set.  Other uses  Outside of their use in producing a motion picture, dailies are desirable by fans as a collectors item and to see more of the filmmaking process. They are also desirable to film students and teachers to illustrate how a film is shot and as a tool to practice editing. For a variety of reasons, major motion picture studios never release their dailies for outside use. One cited problem is that the Screen Actors Guild has a clause in their contract to protect their actors' privacy which says that the producers of all union productions must give up their rights to the actor's performance for anything but the edited movie. In most other English speaking countries, the actors unions have similar contracts which limit the distribution of all film dailies. New Zealand does not have this limitation, which is why the dailies from Xena and Hercules are on the DVDs for these shows. Every year American Cinema Editors holds the ACE Film Editing Contest in which they make dailies available to 50 film students for an editing contest. ACE also sells a video tape with film dailies from the 1950s TV show Gunsmoke. These film dailies have been used by many film schools for the last 40 years. Rushes and dailies are also used to create trailers, even if they may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different takes of a particular shot.

Production teams consisting of technical staff to produce the media. Generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertise is required, or how long they are involved in the project. For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the running crew, but also the theatrical producer, designers and theatre direction.  Tasks and functions  The production company may be directly responsible for fundraising the production or may accomplish this through a parent company, partner, or private investor. It handles budgeting, scheduling, scripting, the supply with talent and resources, the organization of staff, the production itself, post-production, distribution, and marketing. Production companies are often either owned or under contract with a media conglomerate, film studio, entertainment company, or Motion Picture Company, who act as the production company's partner or parent company. This has become known as the \\"studio system\\". Independent studios usually prefer production house (see Lionsgate), and sometimes as a production studio or production team (see Amazon Studios or Rooster Teeth). In the case of television, a production company would serve under a television network. Production companies can work together in co- productions. In music, the term production team typically refers to a group of individuals filling the role of \\"record producer\\" usually reserved for one individual. Some examples of musical production teams include Matmos and D-Influence  Type  Entertainment companies operate as mini conglomerates, operating many divisions or subsidiaries in many different industries. Warner Bros. Entertainment and Lionsgate Entertainment are two companies with this corporate structure. It allows for a single company to maintain control over seemingly unrelated companies that fall within the ranges of entertainment, which increases and centralises the revenue into one company (example: a film production company, TV production company, video game company, and comic book company are all owned by a single entertainment company). A motion picture company, such as Paramount Pictures, specializing \\"only\\" in motion pictures is only connected with its other counterpart industries through its parent company. Instead of performing a corporate reorganization, many motion picture companies often have sister companies they collaborate with in other industries that are subsidiaries owned by their parent company and is often not involved in the making of products that are not motion picture related. A film production company can either operate as an affiliate (under a contract) or as a subsidiary for an entertainment company, motion picture company, television network, or all, and are generally smaller than the company they are partnered with. Book to film unit A book to film unit is a unit of a book publishing company for the purposes of getting books that they published adapted into film. =Background= Films have been using books as a prime source for films for years. In 2012, six out of the nine best picture Oscar nominees were originally books. Previously, publishers did not develop their books into movie nor receive any of the profits. Neither Scholastic or Little Brown, get any box office revenue from the Harry Potter and Twilight movies just through book sales. As the publishers faced decreasing revenue due to increased competition from self-published e-books, or Amazon.com moving into the publishing field, publishers have started to enter the film and TV production business to boost their net income with Amazon attempting to compete there too. More screenwriters are turning to book publishers to get their screenplay published as a book, so as to have a boost in their attempt to have the screenplay turned into a movie, given that it is a known product after the book. =History= Publisher Simon & Schuster has been owned by media companies lately by ViacomCBS while the publisher is not involved with film and TV, S&S; shares with CBS for possible film or TV deals. Alloy Entertainment while not a unit of a publisher started using a book packaging to film model of film and TV development by developing the property in-house, hire authors for the books and films, so as to own the property. Random House was the first big six book publisher to establish a book to film unit, Random House Films, in 2005 with a Focus Features deal under a development and co- finance plan. Macmillan Films was launched by Thomas Dunne Books in October 2010 under the packaging model similar to Alloy while also moving to get film rights from Dunne's published author. Also that year, Random House changed their strategy to film development and packaging only. Cond√© Nast Entertainment was started by Magazine publisher Conde Nast in October 2012. In 2013, Macmillan Films became Macmillan Entertainment with an expansion to look at other divisions' book for possible films. Operation and Profit A production company is usually run by a producer or director, but can also be run by a career executive. In entertainment, a production company relies highly on talent or a well known entertainment franchise to raise the value of an entertainment project and draw out larger audiences. This gives the entertainment industry a democratized power structure to ensure that both the companies and talent receive their fair share of pay and recognition for work done on a production. The entertainment industry is centered on funding (investments from studios, investment firms, or individuals either from earnings from previous productions or personal wealth), projects (scripts and entertainment franchises), and talent (actors, directors, screenwriters, and crew). Production companies are judged and ranked based on the amount of funding it has, as well the productions it has completed or been involved with in the past. If a production company has major funding either through earnings, studio investors, or private investors, and has done or been involved with big budget productions in the past, it is considered to be a major production company. These companies often work with well-known and expensive talent. If a production company does not have much funding and has not done or been involved with any big budget productions, it is considered to be a small production company. These companies often work with up and coming talent. Small production companies will either grow to become a major production company, a subsidiary completely owned by another company, remain small, or fail. The success of an entertainment production company is centered on the projects it produces, the talent it can acquire, and the performance of the talent. Marketing is also a major factor. All films, as a tradition, are often marketed around the image and the performance of the actors; with an option of marketing the behind the scenes crew such as the directors and screenwriters. Unlike many other businesses, a production company does not rely on an ongoing revenue stream, they operate on ongoing investments; this often requires a parent company or a private corporate investment entity (see Legendary Pictures). Their only source of profit comes from the productions they produce. Because entertainment and media are currently in \\"high demand\\", a production company can profit if its management is capable of using its resources to supply good quality products and services to the public. Many entertainment production companies brand their entertainment projects. An entertainment project can either become a \\"one time hit\\" or an ongoing \\"entertainment franchise\\" that can be continued, remade, rebooted, or expanded into other sister industries; such as the video game industry (see Star Wars, Star Trek). Entertainment projects can be either an original or an adaptation from another industry. In rare occasional cases, a few troubled major studios would also shed their distribution and/or marketing staffs, mainly due to reduced resources, and resort to co-investing and/or co-distributing film projects with larger studios, operating as virtual, production-only movie studios. Notable examples include legendary studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which, after many years of box office flops (mostly with low budgets), bad management and distribution, and bankruptcy, was restructured at the end of 2010 under new management and currently struck deals with some of the Big Six studios (most notably the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group and Warner Bros.); Miramax, which was downsized by former owner Disney into a smaller division after the Weinstein brothers' 2005 divestment and, after 17 years under Disney ownership, was sold to a group of investors at the end of 2010 who eventually struck deals to co-finance the studio's projects with other independent companies; and DreamWorks Pictures, the independently run live action studio, which currently releases many projects through Universal Pictures and formerly released their projects through Disney after spinning off from Paramount Pictures (which purchased the studio in 2006 and stripped it of its independent distributor status) in 2008. Staffing, funds, and equipment Because a production company is only operational when a production is being produced and most of the talent and crew are freelancers, many production companies are only required to hire management staff that helps to oversee the company's daily activities. In some cases, a production company can be run by only a handful of people. The company's funds are mainly committed towards employing talent, crew, and acquiring new updated production equipment on a regular basis. Many productions often require at least one to two cameras and lighting equipment for on location shooting. Production equipment is either leased or purchased from another production company or directly from the manufacturer. In the entertainment industry, in order to secure experienced professional talent and crew, production companies often become a signatory company to that talent or crew members \\"guild\\". By becoming a signatory company, it agrees to abide by the guild regulations. All big budget guild productions are exclusive to guild members and non guild members are not allowed to participate in these productions unless authorized by the guild. Productions with smaller budgets are allowed to use both guild talent and talent from the public. The majority of the talent and crew working in the entertainment industry are members of their professions guild. Most productions in the entertainment industry are guild productions. Production A production company is responsible for the development and filming of a specific production or media broadcast. In entertainment, the production process begins with the development of a specific project. Once a final script has been produced by the screenwriters, the production enters into the pre-production phase, most productions never reach this phase for financing or talent reasons. In pre-production, the actors are signed on and prepared for their roles, crew is signed on, shooting locations are found, sets are built or acquired, and the proper shooting permits are acquired for on location shooting. Actors and crew are hand picked by the producer, director, and casting director, who often use collaborators or referenced personnel to prevent untrusted or unwelcomed people from gaining access to a specific production and compromising the entire production through leaks. Once a production enters into principal photography, it begins filming. Productions are almost never cancelled once they reach this phase. Codenames are often used on bigger productions during filming to conceal the production's shooting locations for both privacy and safety reasons. In many cases, the director, producers, and the leading actors are often the only people with access to a full or majority of a single script. Supporting actors, background actors, and crew often never receive a full copy of a specific script to prevent leaks. Productions are often shot in secured studios, with limited to no public access, but they are also shot on location on secured sets or locations. Due to the exposure, when shooting in public locations, major productions often employ security to ensure the protection of the talent and crew working on a specific production. After filming is completed, the production enters into post production, which is handled by a post production company and overseen by the production company. The editing, musical score, visual effects, re- recording of the dialog, and sound effects are \\"mixed\\" to create the final film, which is then screened at the final screening. Marketing is also launched during this phase, such as the release of trailers and posters. Once a final film has been approved, the film is taken over by the distributors, who then release the film. Other details For legal reasons, it is common within the entertainment industry for production companies not to accept unsolicited materials from any other company, talent, or the general public. It is also common for filmmakers or producers to become entrepreneurs and open their own production companies so that they can have more control over their careers and pay, while acting as an \\"in-house\\" creative and business driving force for their company but continuing to freelance as an artist for other companies, if desired.

The distribution company is usually different from the production company. Distribution deals are an important part of financing a film. The distributor may set the release date of a film and the method by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing; for example, directly to the public either theatrically or for home viewing (DVD, video-on-demand, download, television programs through broadcast syndication etc.). A distributor may do this directly, if the distributor owns the theaters or film distribution networks, or through theatrical exhibitors and other sub-distributors. A limited distributor may deal only with particular products, such as DVDs or Blu-ray, or may act in a particular country or market. The primary distributor will often receive credit in the film's credits, one sheet or other marketing material. Theatrical distribution If a distributor is working with a theatrical exhibitor, the distributor secures a written contract stipulating the amount of the gross ticket sales the exhibitor will be allowed to retain (usually a percentage of the gross). The distributor collects the amount due, audits the exhibitor's ticket sales as necessary to ensure the gross reported by the exhibitor is accurate, secures the distributor's share of these proceeds, surrenders the exhibitor's portion to it, and transmits the remainder to the production company (or to any other [intermediary], such as a film release agent). The distributor must also ensure that enough film prints are struck to service all contracted exhibitors on the contract-based opening day, ensure their physical delivery to the theater by the opening day, monitor exhibitors to make sure the film is in fact shown in the particular theatre with the minimum number of seats and show times, and ensure the prints' return to the distributor's office or other storage resource also on the contract- based return date. In practical terms, this includes the physical production of release prints and their shipping around the world (a process that is being replaced by digital distribution in most developed markets) as well as the creation of posters, newspaper and magazine advertisements, television commercials, trailers, and other types of ads. The distributor is also responsible for ensuring a full line of advertising material is available for each film which it believes will help the exhibitor attract the largest possible audience, create such advertising if it is not provided by the production company, and arrange for the physical delivery of the advertising items selected by the exhibitor at intervals prior to the opening day. Film distributors spend between $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion a year in the United States alone on direct buys of advertising such as TV commercials, billboards, online banner ads, radio commercials and the like.Article on Kantar Media movie advertising estimates That distributor-spending figure doesn't include additional costs for publicity, film trailers and promotions, which aren't classified as advertising but also market films to audiences. Distributors typically enter into one of the two types of film booking contracts. The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the sliding scale deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run.Marich, Robert. Marketing To Moviegoers: Third Edition (2013), SIU Press, p.277-78 The sliding scale actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep‚Äîoften called \\"the house nut\\"‚Äîafter which the sliding scale kicks in for revenue generated above the house nut. However, this sliding scale method is falling out of use. Whatever the method, box office revenue is usually shared roughly 50/50 between film distributors and theaters. International distribution If the distributor is handling an imported or foreign film, it may also be responsible for securing dubbing or subtitling for the film, and securing censorship or other legal or organizational \\"approval\\" for the exhibition of the film in the country/territory in which it does business, prior to approaching the exhibitors for booking. Depending on which studio that is distributing the film, the studio will either have offices around the world, by themselves or partnered with another studio, to distribute films in other countries. If a studio decides to partner with a native distributor, upon release both names will appear. The foreign distributor may license the film for a certain amount of time, but the studio will retain the copyright of the film.Levison, Louise. (2007) \\"FILMMAKERS AND FINANCING\\". Burlington, MA: Focal Press. p. 119-120 When a film is produced and distributed by an independent production company and independent distributor (meaning outside the studios), generally an international sales agent handles the licensing of international rights to the film. The international sales agent will find a local distributor in each individual international territory and license the exclusive rights to the film for a certain amount of time but in the same case as the studios described above, the production company will retain the copyright of the film. This means that this distributor in a certain territory has the exclusive right to exploit the film in various media (theatrical, TV, home entertainment, etc.) for a certain amount of time. Early distribution windows Although there are now numerous distribution techniques, in the past the studios and networks were slow to change and did not experiment with different distribution processes. Studios believed that new distribution methods would cause their old methods of revenue to be destroyed. With time, the development of new distribution did prove to be beneficial. The studios revenue was gained from myriad distribution windows. These windows created many opportunities in the industry and allowed networks to make a profit and eliminate failure. These new distribution methods benefited audiences that were normally too small to reach and expanded the content of television. With the new age of technology, networks accepted the fact that it was a consumer demand industry and accepted the new models of distribution.Lotz, Amanda. The Television Will Be Revolutionized Non-theatrical distribution This term, used mainly in the British film industry, describes the distribution of feature films for screening to a gathered audience, but not in theatres at which individual tickets are sold to members of the public. The defining distinctions between a theatrical and a non-theatrical screening are that the latter has to be to a closed audience in some way, e.g. pupils of a school, members of a social club or passengers on an airline, and that there can be no individual admission charge. Most non-theatrical screening contracts also specify that the screening must not be advertised, except within the group that is eligible to attend (e.g. in a membership organisation's newsletter or an in-flight magazine). Non-theatrical distribution includes the airlines and film societies. Non-theatrical distribution is generally handled by companies that specialize in this market, of which Motion Picture Licensing Company (MPLC) and Film bank media are the two largest: Motion Picture Licensing Company Film bank media Representing the major Hollywood studios and independent producers. Home video media is sold with a licence that permits viewing in the home only. Until these technologies were widespread, most non- theatrical screenings were on 16 mm film prints supplied by the distributor. Today, the most common business model is for a distributor to sell the exhibitor a licence that permits the legal projection of a copy of the film, which the exhibitor buys separately on a home video format. These licences can either be for individual, one-off screenings, or cover an unlimited number of screenings of titles represented by that distributor for a specified time period. The latter are often purchased by pubs and students' unions, to enable them to show occasional feature films on a TV in their bars. Home video distribution Some distributors only handle home video distribution or some sub-set of home video distribution such as DVD or Blu-ray distribution. The remaining home video rights may be licensed by the producer to other distributors or the distributor may sub-license them to other distributors. If a distributor is going to distribute a movie on a physical format such as DVD, they must arrange for the creation of the artwork for the case and the face of the DVD and arrange with a DVD replicator to create a glass master to press quantities of the DVD. Some movie producers use a process called \\"DVD-on- demand.\\" In DVD-on-demand, a company will burn a DVD-R (a process called \\"duplication\\") when a copy of the DVD is ordered, and then ship it to the customer. A distributor may also maintain contact with wholesalers who sell and ship DVDs to retail outlets as well as online stores, and arrange for them to carry the DVD. The distributor may also place ads in magazines and online and send copies of the DVD to reviewers. Distribution credits The primary distribution companies will usually receive some billing for the film. For example, Gone With the Wind was shown on the one sheet as \\"A Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer Release\\". A modern example, Jurassic Park, would be the credit \\"Universal Pictures presents ‚Ä¶\\". The Universal production logo also opened the film's trailer. In some cases, there is split distribution as in the case of Titanic (1997): \\"20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures present ‚Ä¶\\". Both companies helped to finance the film.

Usually, the fast is broken at a siyum celebration (typically made at the conclusion of the morning services), which, according to prevailing custom, creates an atmosphere of rejoicing that overrides the requirement to continue the fast (see Breaking the fast below). Unlike all other Jewish fast days, only firstborn children are required to fast on the Fast of the Firstborn. This fast commemorates the salvation of the Israelite firstborns during the Plague of the Firstborn (according to the Book of Exodus, the tenth of the ten plagues wrought upon Ancient Egypt prior to the Exodus of the Children of Israel), when, according to Exodus (12:29): \\"...God struck every firstborn in the Land of Mitzrayim (Ancient Egypt)....\\" Origins The primary source quoted for this custom is Tractate Soferim 21:3, where it is stated that firstborns fast \\"in commemoration of the miracle that they were saved from the Plague of the Firstborn.\\" Rabbeinu AsherAsher ben Jehiel, commentary to the Babylonian Talmud, Pesachim 10:19 and Rabbeinu Aharon HaKohein Orchot Chayyim, p. 76, ¬ß13 quote the Jerusalem TalmudPesachim 68a as an additional source for the fast. Rabbi Yehuda Grunwald (Rabbi of Satmar and student of the Ketav Sofer) suggests that the firstborn Israelites fasted in trepidation in advance of the Plague of the Firstborn; despite a divine guarantee of safety, they felt a need to fast in repentance to achieve greater divine protection. Rabbi Grunwald thus posits that this was the precedent for the Fast of the Firstborn.Zichron Yehuda, vol. 1. ¬ß133 Meaning of the fast Fasts in Judaism can have a number of purposes, including atonement for sins; commemorative mourning, and commemorative gratitude (see Ta'anit). The Fast of the Firstborn incorporates commemorative gratitude for salvation from the Plague of the Firstborn, as detailed above. According to Rabbi Jacob Emden, the Fast of the Firstborn also commemorates the salvation of the Jews from the plot of Haman. This is because Haman advanced his plot on the thirteenth of Nisan,Esther 3:12 and Queen Esther reacted by instructing all Jews of Shushan to undertake a three-day fast beginning the next day, the fourteenth of Nisan.Esther 4:16 according to Rashi on 4:17; according to Esther Rabbah 8:7, the fast began on the 13th but included the 14th. For this reason, even some non-firstborns maintain the custom to fast on the fourteenth of Nisan. According to Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach,Halichos Shlomo 3:179‚Äì180 the Fast of the Firstborn also includes an aspect of mourning: firstborns fast to mourn the loss of their priestly statusSee which had initially been granted them on the fourteenth of Nisan. Furthermore, during the Temple period, this loss was most profoundly felt on the fourteenth of Nisan, which was the busiest day of the year for the Temple priests and Levites.See Pesachim 58a Qualifications for fasting There is disagreement among the early halakhic authorities (authoritative scholars of Jewish law) as to who qualifies as a firstborn (Bechor) for purposes of the Fast of the Firstborn. All authorities agree, however, to the conditions of halakhic adulthood (generally speaking, this is 12 years for a female and 13 years for a male) and sanity, preconditions for all positive mitzvot, to obligate one to fast. (Other rare conditions, such as deaf-muteness, also exempt one from positive mitzvot). According to the Bayit Chadash, the Sefer Agudah, and arguably the Maharil, both men and women are obligated to fast. This is based upon the Midrash, which states that both men and women among the firstborn Egyptians perished in the plague.Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, 7; Exodus Rabbah, 18:3 Following a precedent common in Jewish commemorative rituals, the above authorities ruled that all those who were miraculously saved should participate in commemoration (see also Pesachim 108b). Since both men and women died from the plague, all firstborn Jewish men and women alive at that time are considered to have been miraculously saved. The Rema and the Vilna Gaon rule that women are exempt from the fast. As the Book of Exodus (13:12‚Äì15) mentions the biblical commandment of Redemption of the Firstborn as commemorative of the salvation of Jewish firstborns in Egypt, and as this command only applies to firstborn males, the Rema and the Vilna Gaon rule similarly that only males are obligated to fast. Common practice is that only males fast. While a firstborn to both parents, or a firstborn to only the mother, must fast according to all authorities, there is a dispute among the early halakhic authorities regarding the status of a firstborn to only the father. The Shulchan Aruch codifies that a firstborn to only the father is obligated to fast,Orach Chaim 470:1 while most printings of the Arba'ah TurimTur, Orach Chaim 470:1 indicate that such a person would be exempt. Common practice follows the Shulchan Aruch. Typically, if the oldest in the family died, the next oldest is not required to fast. However, if the oldest child had died within 30 days of birth, the next oldest is required to fast. (The Dagul Mervavah maintains that this only applies if the oldest child had been born prematurely or was not born viable). Many authorities, including the Rema, note the custom that the father of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood. The Rema rules that if the father is a firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years. The Sh'vut Ya'akov (1:17) rules that the above-cited custom of the father fasting for the child goes into effect as soon as the child is born, except where the child is born after chatzot ha'laila (halakhic midnight, which generally corresponds to solar midnight) on the 14th of Nisan of that year. (Since the child had not yet been born by the equivalent time that the Plague of the Firstborn had occurred in Egypt, the father need not fast for his child until the following year) The Korban N'tan'elPesachim 10:19:80 disagrees. He writes that the custom only goes into effect from the time the child is 30 days old. This relates, again, to the command to redeem the firstborn, which does not go into effect until the child is 30 days old. There is some discussion among the poskim (halakhic authorities) regarding whether a firstborn born through caesarean section is required to observe this fast, given that he is not obligated in the Redemption of the Firstborn. The Chok Ya'akov (470:2) suggests that such a firstborn may be required to fast, while the Kaf HaChayyim (470:3) rules that he need not fast. To circumvent this question, as well as dispute regarding a firstborn non-Jew who converts to Judaism, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashivcited in HaSeder Ha'aruch, Vol. 3, p. 44 suggests that such firstborns participate in a seudat mitzvah (see here and here below). Duration of the fast As with most Jewish fast days, the fast begins at dawn. The common practice is that it is subsequently broken in the morning at a seudat mitzvah (celebratory meal) following a siyum. If the fast is not broken at a seudat mitzvah, there is a dispute among halakhic authorities regarding the duration of the fast. Normally, all Jewish fasts continue until nightfall (most authorities rule that this is approximately 40 minutes after sunset, but varies by location and time of year). However, the presence of a fast immediately before a holiday presents a unique quandary. Normally, one may not enter a Shabbat (Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath) or Yom Tov (Festival) in a state of fasting. The Talmud (Eruvin 41a) discusses what one should do when a formal fast day (other than Yom Kippur) falls directly before Shabbat or Yom Tov. The sages of the Talmud are divided over two options: Either one should break the fast shortly before sundown, or one should fast through nightfall, regardless. Since the Talmud arrives at no clear conclusion, disagreement arose among halakhic authorities. The Maharil rules that the fast continues until nightfall, while others rule that it should be broken before sundown. Breaking the fast In modern times, however, this fast is rarely observed, as most firstborns opt to attend a siyum (festive meal celebrating the completion of a Tractate of the Talmud) instead. This is considered a legitimate form of \\"breaking\\" the fast, and therefore the firstborn may eat during the rest of the day. The Mishnah Berurah quotes three opinions regarding circumstances in which the fast may be broken. According to the first, a healthy individual must fast if he can sustain the fast without undue suffering and without any subsequent weakening that would affect his ability or inclination to heartily partake of his Passover Seder meal (and specifically the matzah). (If one is obligated to partake of a festive meal that day, such as if he is the father of an infant on the day of circumcision, this opinion requires him to undertake a reciprocal fast at the soonest opportunity.) According to the second custom (quoted by the Magen Avraham in the name of the Maharash Levi), the fast may be broken at any festive meal celebrating a circumcision or a redemption of the firstborn. According to the third custom, based upon the Maharshal,Yam Shel Sh'lomo, Bava Kamma 7:37 the fast may even be broken at a seudat mitzvah for a siyum celebrating the completion of study of a tractate of Talmud. The latter custom is commonly observed. If a firstborn attending a siyum does not hear the completion of the tractate, or if he does not understand what he hears, or if he is in the shiva period of mourning and is thus forbidden from listening to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a seudat mitzvah and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast.Ben Ish Chai 1:96:25; Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Elyashiv, Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, p. 168; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Chazon Ovadiah, p. 99 Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances.Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Teshuvos V'hanhagos 1:300, 2:210 in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky The Minchas Yitzchak (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position should at least try to contribute to the siyum in some way, such as by sponsoring or helping to prepare the meal. In order to break one's fast on a seudat mitzvah, many authorities rule that one must partake of at least a kotevet of food (around 1.5 to 2 oz.) or a melo lugmav of liquid (at least around 1.7 oz.) at the seudah.Minchas Yitzchak, ibid.; Chazon Ovadiah, ibid.; Teshuvos V'hanhagos, ibid. Other authorities rule that a firstborn need not eat anything at the siyum itself, and that he may break his fast anytime after the siyum.Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, ibid; Rabbi Yehoshua Menachem Mendel Ehrenberg, Devar Yehoshua 2:81 Rabbi Moshe FeinsteinOC 1:157, based on the N'mukei Yosef (Bava Batra 53b), the Ran (ibid. 121b), the Rashbam (ibid), and the Eliyah Rabba extends the possibility of breaking the fast to include even breaking it at a festive meal celebrating the completion of any mitzvah that required regular, continual involvement. According to these authorities, such a meal would be considered a seudat mitzvah of adequate caliber to exempt one from continuing the fast. Additionally, the MordechaiPesachim 107 quotes the ruling of his father-in-law Rabbeinu Yechiel that firstborns need not fast at all on the day before Passover; firstborns need only limit their diet to snacks. (The Bigdei Yesha commentary suggests the rationale behind this ruling was to avoid holding a fast during the month of Nisan, which is generally prohibited.) The Mishnah Berurah states that it is appropriate for a weak individual to follow this ruling. When Passover begins after Shabbat If the day before Passover falls on Shabbat, most authorities rule that the fast is set for the previous Thursday, and this has become common practice. This is because it is forbidden to fast on Shabbat (except for where Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat), and fasts are preferably not set for Friday. In such a scenario, the ritual of Bedikas Chametz (the formal search for forbidden leaven that is conducted before Passover) is set for Thursday night. Normally, it is forbidden to eat (starting from nightfall) before conducting the Bedikas Chametz. However, for a firstborn who is fatigued or uncomfortable from the fast, the Mateh Moshe and Maharil rule that some food may be eaten before the search or that another person may be appointed to perform the search on behalf of the firstborn. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (OC 4:69:4) raises the possibility, based on the RemaRema, Orach Chaim 686:2 (regarding a year when Taanit Esther was observed on Thursday instead of Shabbat, but a person celebrated a circumcision on this Thursday); this is supported by a similar ruling of the P'ri M'gadim that one who breaks the adjusted Thursday fast might be required to fast on Friday, as perhaps the fast is considered to have been moved to whichever earlier day is more appropriate, and not to Thursday specifically. Since there are many opinions that dispute the Rema,such as the Shulchan Aruch, Turei Zahav, Eliyah Rabba, Chayei Adam, Sh'vut Ya'akov, Mor U-K'tzi'a Rabbi Feinstein writes that, practically speaking, one should not fast on Friday in such circumstances. This rationale may be based on the above cited Korban N'tan'el, who writes that excessive strictures regarding keeping the Fast of the Firstborn should not come at the expense of possibly fasting unnecessarily during the month of Nisan. The above halakhic quandary is avoided completely if a firstborn fasts the entire day on Thursday. However, Rabbi Feinstein makes no mention of this requirement. In order for a firstborn (who eats on Thursday) to comply with the ruling of the Rema, the Piskei T'shuvot suggests participating in a second siyum on Friday, while Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank suggests partaking on Friday of leftovers from the previous day's siyum. Status of the fast In halakha, there are two general types of fast: the communal fast and the individuals' fast. Among other differences between the two, a special prayer is added by the Chazzan (leader of the prayers) on communal fasts whenever both ten fasting individuals congregate and the Chazzan is fasting. While the Magen Avraham treats the fast as an individuals' fast, the Shiyurei K'nesset Ha-G'dolah, the P'ri Chadash, and the Or Zaru'a view it as a communal fast. To avoid the practical implications of the controversy, the Mishnah Berurah suggests that a firstborn should not serve as Chazzan on the day of the fast. Additionally, this fast differs from most other fasts established in the Jewish calendar in that this fast is not indicated in the Hebrew Scriptures. This lessens the severity of the fast, and someone who experiences significant discomfort as a result of fasting may break his fast (Mishnah Berurah based on the Rema). Modern practice The custom of the Fast of the Firstborn is today observed nearly universally throughout Orthodox Ashkenazic communities. However some Sefardic and Mizrahi communities have not fully adopted the custom. It is not traditionally observed by Yemenite JewsThe Fast of the Firstborn on the Eve of Pesah: An Exposition on the Custom of the Jews of Yemen. Rason Arusi, p. 1 and its practice was discouraged by Moroccan-Israeli rabbi Joseph Messas.Mayim Haim, Orah Haim, Siman 109 Amongst Conservative Jews, the custom is endorsed by various communities and cited positively in their responsa.Responsa Concerning Pesah Eve ‚Äì R.

Childers and G. Hentzi Eds., p. 103 The related concepts of self-deception and ressentiment also derive from bad faith. Freedom and choice A critical claim in existentialist thought is that individuals are always free to make choices and guide their lives towards their own chosen goal or \\"project\\". This claim suggests that individuals cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an empire's colonized victims possess choices: to submit to rule, to negotiate, to commit suicide, to resist nonviolently, or to counter- attack. Although external circumstances may limit individuals (this limitation from the outside is called facticity), they cannot force a person to follow one of the remaining courses over another. In this sense the individual still has some freedom of choice. For this reason, an individual may choose in anguish, fully aware that this will have consequences. For Sartre, to claim that one amongst many conscious possibilities takes undeniable precedence (for instance, \\"I cannot risk my life, because I must support my family\\") is to assume the role of an object in the world, not a free agent, but merely at the mercy of circumstance (a being-in-itself that is only its own facticity, i.e., it \\"is\\" inside itself, and acts there as a limitation).Jack Reynolds, Understanding Existentialism (2006) p. 73 For Sartre, this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving. Intentional consciousness and freedom Humans are always aware that they are more than what they are aware of, meaning that they are not whatever they are aware of. In this sense, humans cannot be defined as \\"intentional objects\\" of consciousness that includes the restrictions imposed by facticity, personal history, character, bodies, or objective responsibility. Thus, as Sartre often repeated, \\"Human reality is what it is not, and it is not what it is.\\" An example of what he means is being a doctor but wishing to \\"transcend\\" that to become a pig farmer. One is who one is not: a pig farmer, not who one is, a doctor. One can only define oneself negatively, as \\"what it is not\\", and this negation is the only positive definition of \\"what it is.\\" From this we are aware of a host of alternative reactions to our freedom to choose an objective situation, since no situation can dictate a single response. We pretend that these possibilities are denied to us by assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature . But this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things. \\"Bad faith\\" is the paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom. Examples=Sartre Sartre cites a caf√© waiter, whose movements and conversation are a little too \\"waiter-esque\\". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously; \\"his movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid\\".Sartre, quoted in R. D. Laing, Self and Others (1969) p 44 His exaggerated behaviour illustrates that he is play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.Sartre, Jean-Paul, Essays in Existentialism, Citadel Press. 1993, pp. 167-169 Another of Sartre's examples involves a young woman on a first date. She ignores the obvious sexual implications of her date's compliments to her physical appearance, but accepts them instead as words directed at her as a human consciousness. As he takes her hand, she lets it rest indifferently in his, \\"neither consenting nor resisting ‚Äì a thing\\"Sartre, quoted in Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (1972)in p. 248 ‚Äì refusing either to return the gesture or to rebuke it. Thus she delays the moment when she must choose either to acknowledge and reject his advances, or consent to them. She conveniently considers her hand only a thing in the world, and his compliments as unrelated to her body, playing on her dual human reality as a physical being, and as a consciousness separate and free from this physicality.Sartre, Jean-Paul, Essays in Existentialism, Citadel Press. 1993, pp. 160-164 Sartre suggests that by acting in bad faith the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom, by using their freedom to do so. They manifestly know they are free, but are actively choosing not to acknowledge it. Bad faith is paradoxical in this regard: when acting in bad faith, a person is actively denying their own freedom, while relying on it to perform the denial. De Beauvoir De Beauvoir described three main types of women acting in bad faith: the Narcissist who denies her freedom by construing herself as a desirable object; the Mystic, who invests her freedom in an absolute; and the Woman in Love, who submerges her identity in that of her male object.Reynolds, p. 143 She also considered what she called the Serious Man, who subordinated himself to some outside cause, to be in bad faith inasmuch as he denies his own freedom.Reynolds, p. 150 and p. 161 Two modes of consciousness Sartre claims that the consciousness with which we generally consider our surroundings is different from our reflecting on this consciousness, i.e., the consciousness of \\"ourselves being conscious of these surroundings\\". The first kind of consciousness, before we think about, or reflect on, our previous consciousness, is called pre-reflective. Reflecting on the pre-reflective consciousness is called reflective consciousness. But this cannot be called unconsciousness, as Freud used the term. Sartre gives the example of running after a bus: one does not become conscious of \\"one's running after the bus\\" until one has ceased to run after it, because until then one's consciousness is focused on the bus itself, and not one's chasing it. In this sense consciousness always entails being self-aware (being for-itself). Since for Sartre consciousness also entails a consciousness of our separation from the world, and hence freedom, we are also always aware of this. But we can manipulate these two levels of consciousness, so that our reflective consciousness interprets the factual limits of our objective situation as insurmountable, whilst our pre-reflective consciousness remains aware of alternatives. Freedom and morality One convinces oneself, in some sense, to be bound to act by external circumstance, in order to escape the anguish of freedom. Sartre says that people are \\"condemned to be free\\": whether they adopt an \\"objective\\" moral system to do this choosing for them, or follow only their pragmatic concerns, they cannot help but be aware that they are not ‚Äì fundamentally ‚Äì part of them. Moreover, as possible intentional objects of one's consciousness, one is fundamentally not part of oneself, but rather exactly what one, as consciousness, defines oneself in opposition to; along with everything else one could be conscious of. Fundamentally, Sartre believes humankind cannot escape responsibility by adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice that we endorse, implicitly or explicitly, for which we must take full responsibility. Sartre argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a demonstration of choice, and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires. As a human, one cannot claim one's actions are determined by external forces; this is the core statement of existentialism. One is \\"condemned\\" to this eternal freedom; human beings exist before the definition of human identity exists. One cannot define oneself as a thing in the world, as one has the freedom to be otherwise. One is not \\"a philosopher\\", as at some point one must/will cease the activities that define the self as \\"a philosopher\\". Any role that one might adopt does not define one as there is an eventual end to one's adoption of the role; i.e. other roles will be assigned to us, \\"a chef\\", \\"a mother\\". The self is not constant, it cannot be a thing in the world. Though one cannot assign a positive value to definitions that may apply to oneself, one remains able to say what one is not. This inner anguish over moral uncertainty is a central underlying theme in existentialism, as the anguish demonstrates a personal feeling of responsibility over the choices one makes throughout life. Without an emphasis on personal choice, one may make use of an external moral system as a tool to moralize otherwise immoral acts, leading to negation of the self. According to existentialism, dedicated professionals of their respective moral codes ‚Äì priests interpreting sacred scriptures, lawyers interpreting the Constitution, doctors interpreting the Hippocratic oath ‚Äì should, instead of divesting the self of responsibility in the discharge of their duties, be aware of their own significance in the process. This recognition involves the questioning of the morality of all choices, taking responsibility for the consequences of one's own choice and therefore; a constant reappraisal of one's own and others' ever-changing humanity. One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and accountability. Taking on the burden of personal accountability in all situations is an intimidating proposition ‚Äì by pointing out the freedom of the individual, Sartre seeks to demonstrate that the social roles and moral systems we adopt protect us from being morally accountable for our actions.

It has been dated to c. 530 CE. The epic Beowulf Beowulf is an epic poem that refers to the conflict, but not to a battle on Lake V√§nern. In Beowulf, the Swedish king Ohthere (Ottar Vendelkr√•ka, who is often called the first historical king of Sweden)Alf Henrikson, Svensk historia had died and his brother Onela (√Åli) had usurped the Swedish throne. Ottar's sons Eanmund and Eadgils (Adils) had to flee to Geatland and seek refuge with the Geatish king Heardred. This induced Onela to attack the Geats and kill both Eanmund and Heardred. In order to avenge his king and kinsman, Beowulf decided to help Eadgils gain the throne of Sweden. During the battle Eadgils slew Onela and became the king of Sweden. Norse sagas There are a few references in Norse sources that give an account of the battle on the ice of Lake V√§nern. Some of the sagas differ from one another in detail. The equivalent of Onela, √Åli hinn upplenzki, has been placed in Norwegian Oppland, rather than Swedish Uppland. In Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, in the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, the battle is mentioned in two verses. In the first account, Snorri cites a fragmentary poem called K√°lfsv√≠sa: {:V√©steinn Vali, :en V√≠fill St√∫fi, :Mein√æj√≥fr M√≥i, :en Morginn Vakri, :√Åli Hrafni, :er til √≠ss ri√∞u, :en annarr austr :und A√∞ilsi :gr√°r hvarfa√∞i, :geiri unda√∞r.Sk√°lskaparm√°l at Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad, Norway.  :V√©steinn rode Valr, :And Vifill rode St√∫fr; :Meinthj√≥fr rode M√≥r, :And Morginn on Vakr (\\"Watchful, Nimble, Ambling, or perhaps Hawk\\"); :√Åli rode Hrafn, :They who rode onto the ice: :But another, southward, :Under Adils, :A gray one, wandered, :Wounded with the spear.Translation by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur at Cybersamurai .  } In the second account, Snorri relates: \\"They decided to fight on the ice of the water which is called V√§nern...In this fight king √Åli died and a great many of his people. Then king Adils took from him his helmet Hildisv√≠n [battle-boar] and his horse Hrafn.\\" In the Ynglinga saga, Snorri relates that King Adils (Eadgils) fought hard battles with the Norwegian king who was called √Åli hin upplenzki. They fought on the ice of Lake V√§nern, where √Åli fell and Adils won. Snorri relates that much is told about this event in the saga of the Sk√∂ldungs, and that Adils took Hrafn (Raven), √Åli's horse. The Skj√∂ldunga saga is lost but at the end of the 16th century, Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson saved a piece of information from this saga in Latin. He wrote: \\"There was animosity between king Adils of Sweden and the Norwegian king √Åli of Uppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake V√§nern. Adils won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse.\\" Adils would become a famous king of whom much is told in the legends of Hr√≥lf Kraki and in the Danish Gesta Danorum. According to Snorri, he is buried in Old Uppsala. Archaeology The accounts of the Battle on the Ice contain accurate information about this time and the Swedish Vendel Age. This period was characterized by the appearance of mounted warriors who fought on horseback and by the use of boar-crested helmets. In the Battle on the Ice, the combatants are described as fighting on horseback, although the later Norsemen and Anglo-Saxons who told of this battle in their legends would fight on foot. Likewise, Onela's helmet is called the battle-boar although the boar-crested helmets were long out of use by the time records of the event were written down. Many instances of boar-crested helmets have been found in extant examples, notably in the burial mounds of Vendel, Valsg√§rde and Uppsala. The power centre of ancient Scandinavia is up to much debate still.

Both 20 m booms were needed to create a 40 m dipole antenna for MARSIS to work; a less crucial 7-meter-long monopole antenna was deployed on June 17. The radar booms were originally scheduled to be deployed in April 2004, but this was delayed out of fear that the deployment could damage the spacecraft through a whiplash effect. Due to the delay it was decided to split the four-week commissioning phase in two parts, with two weeks running up to July 4 and another two weeks in December 2005. The deployment of the booms was a critical and highly complex task requiring effective inter-agency cooperation ESA, NASA, Industry and public Universities.  Science  MARSIS transmits a series of modulated chirps at frequencies between 1.8 and 5.0 MHz in subsurface sounding mode, with a 1 MHz bandwidth. It also emits chirps sweeping between 0.1 and 5.4 MHz when ionosphere sounding. Depending on mode the pulsewidth is 30, 91 or 250 Œºs and the nominal Pulse repetition frequency is 130 Hz.

The member-parties rejected both mainstream social democracy and the Third International. Organizational history The International was formed in 1932, following a fringe meeting at the Socialist International conference in Vienna in 1931. The IRMC underwent a variety of names. It was initially called the Committee of Independent Revolutionary Socialist Parties and later the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Unity, but throughout the period it was generally known simply as the London Bureau (and nicknamed by some the 3¬Ω International, in an analogy with the so-called 2¬Ω International of 1921-3), although its headquarters were transferred from London to Paris in 1939 (on the grounds that in addition to the French affiliate, five parties-in-exile had their central committees there). Its youth wing was the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations. For a period, the IRMC was close to the Trotskyist movement and the International Left Opposition. In the early 1930s, Leon Trotsky and his supporters believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which was intended to be a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.Joseph Stalin, \\"Industrialisation of the country and the right deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)\\", Works, Vol.11, pp. 255-302. Trotsky claimed that the Third Period policies of the Comintern had contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, and that its turn to a popular front policy (aiming to unite all ostensibly anti-fascist forces) sowed illusions in reformism and pacifism and \\"clear[ed] the road for a fascist overturn\\". By 1935 he claimed that the Comintern had fallen irredeemably into the hands of the Stalinist bureaucracy.Trotsky, \\"Open Letter For The Fourth International\\", New Militant, August 3, 1935. He and his supporters, expelled from the Third International, participated in a conference of the London Bureau. Three of those parties joined the Left Opposition in signing a document written by Trotsky calling for a Fourth International, which became known as the \\"Declaration of Four\\".\\"Declaration of the Four\\" , The Militant, September 23, 1933. Of those, two soon distanced themselves from the agreement, but the Dutch Revolutionary Socialist Party worked with the International Left Opposition to declare the International Communist League.George Breitman, The Rocky Road to the Fourth International, 1933‚Äì38 The Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism.John G. Wright, \\"Trotsky's Struggle for the Fourth International\\", Fourth International, August 1946. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split from the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International. The secretariat of the International Centre remained with the British Independent Labour Party (ILP) for all but one of the eight years 1932‚Äì1940. Fenner Brockway, ILP leader, was chairman of the Bureau for most of this period, while in 1939, Juli√°n Gorkin of the POUM became its secretary.

Plot In what is being billed as \\"The Race of the Ages,\\" the new forty-million-dollar ‚Äúradio powered‚Äù Streamlined Ocean Liner S.S. Gigantic (‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Challenge for Crossing Record‚Äù) is about to race its rival, the slightly smaller S.S. Colossal across the Atlantic from New York‚Äôs Pier 97 to Cherbourg in two-and-a-half days. Gigantic owner T. Frothingill ‚ÄúT.F.‚Äù Bellows (W. C. Fields) intends to send his nearly identical younger brother S.B. (also Fields) to sail aboard the Colossal, hoping he will cause trouble and sabotage the rival ship, enabling the Gigantic and his own Bellows Line to win. However S.B., who is held back due to a golf game, ends up flying over the ocean to meet the Colossal en route and mistakenly lands aboard the deck of the Gigantic instead, much to the consternation of Captain Stafford (Russell Hicks). Matters are made worse for the Gigantic when S.B.‚Äôs outrageously unlucky daughter Martha (Martha Raye) is brought onboard, being rescued after surviving the shipwreck of the yacht, Hesperus V. Popular OBC radio emcee Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope), who has just been released from ‚Äúalimony jail‚Äù and is broadcasting live from the Gigantic, is trying to juggle his three ex-wives Cleo (Shirley Ross), Grace (Grace Bradley), and Joan (Lorna Gray); his lukewarm girlfriend Dorothy Wyndham (Dorothy Lamour); and his inept microphone assistant Mike (Ben Blue). Buzz does his best throughout the voyage to announce the progress of the race and introduce a series of musical acts for the pleasure of the passengers and OBC‚Äôs radio audience. Meanwhile, Dorothy is romanced by First Officer (and inventor of the Gigantic‚Äôs enormous radio power plant) Robert Hayes (Leif Erickson), just as Buzz and Cleo get sentimental about their broken marriage.

The film was Hope's first feature film, and was the final film under Fields' long-running Paramount contract, before he moved to Universal Studios to make his final series of films. While the S.S. Colossal in the film appears to be similar to the 1935 steam turbo-electric-propelled passenger ship S.S. Normandie with its classic Art Deco French Line-styled exterior, the S.S. Gigantic is a Streamline Moderne futuristic-fantasy ship inside and out (based on Norman Bel Geddes \\"Liner of the Future\\"), with deck- mounted air propellers and diesel engines powered by remote controlled radio electricity capable of reaching 65 knots, a speed more than twice that of a real ocean liner of the time. Modern cruise ships have come to somewhat resemble the Gigantic's glass-enclosed upper deck design. Music Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin wrote six songs that appear in the film: ‚ÄúThis Little Ripple Had Rhythm‚Äù (an instrumental composition); ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Tell a Secret to a Rose;‚Äù ‚ÄúYou Took the Words Right Out of My Heart;‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks for the Memory;‚Äù ‚ÄúMama, That Moon is Here Again;‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Waltz Lives On.‚Äù The extended ‚ÄúThe Waltz Lives On‚Äù sequence features musical sections from the ragtime ‚ÄúAt a Georgia Camp-Meeting‚Äù written by Kerry Mills; and James P.

First retirement (2005‚Äì2007) Red wrestled CM Punk in a dark match at a WWE SmackDown taping on May 12, 2005. Red's last appearance was at a New York Wrestling Connection event at the beginning of 2006, where he lost his match to Javi-Air and re-injured his knee. It was made official on the Pro Wrestling Unplugged Website that he would be making his return to their \\"Haunted\\" event although he requested off since it was announced that his wife was expecting their child on March 14, 2008.  Return and Jersey All Pro Wrestling (2008) After being on the sidelines with his injury, Red made his return on December 13, 2008, at Jersey All Pro Wrestling's Best of the Light Heavyweights, the match was won by Archadia as he defeated Amazing Red, Flip Kendrick, and Louis Lyndon. Return to TNA (2009‚Äì2011) Suicide In April 2009, it was announced via the TNA website that the Amazing Red would return to the company in the Team 3D Tag Team Invitational Tournament. On the April 30 edition of Impact! he teamed with then-X Division Champion Suicide to defeat the Motor City Machineguns of Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin. Suicide and Amazing Red were eliminated from the tournament on the May 14 episode of Impact! by the new stable, The British Invasion after interference from the Motor City Machineguns. On the May 28 edition of Impact!, he challenged Suicide for the X Division Championship but was unsuccessful in winning the title for a second time. Red competed in a Steel Asylum match at the Hard Justice Pay-Per-View on August 16, in another losing effort. On the October 1 edition of Impact! Red became the number one contender to Samoa Joe's X Division title by defeating Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Sheik Abdul Bashir and Kiyoshi in a ladder match. On the following Impact! Red won the X Division Championship for the second time by pinning Samoa Joe following interference by Bobby Lashley. On the October 15 edition of Impact! Don West debuted as Red's new manager. At Bound for Glory Red retained his X Division Title in an Ultimate X match against Homicide, Daniels, Suicide, Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin. The following week on Impact! Red lost to Homicide in a non-title match. The return match between the two was booked for Turning Point, where Red was able to retain his title. Afterwards Don West quietly broke off his affiliation with Red, while he went on to defend his title on TNA's weekly Webmatches against the likes of Chris Sabin and Homicide. At Genesis Red retained his title in a match against the returning Brian Kendrick. On the January 28 edition of Impact! the British Invasion attacked Red after his six-man tag team match. As Rob Terry was going to cash in his \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase, which gave him the right to challenge for the X Division Championship anytime, anywhere, his stable mate Doug Williams managed to convince him to hand it over to him and defeated Red to win the Championship. On the April 12 edition of Impact! Red took the place of the injured Hernandez and teamed up with Matt Morgan to successfully defend the TNA World Tag Team Championship against the Motor City Machineguns. After the match Morgan attacked Red for getting the pinfall in the match. After a few weeks out of action, Red returned to Impact! on the June 10 edition, in a losing effort against Kurt Angle. On September 23 Red defeated Jay Lethal at a live event in his hometown of New York City to win the X Division Championship for the third time. Red re-lost the title to Lethal two days later at a live event in Rahway, New Jersey. On the December 23 edition of Impact! Red answered Jeff Jarrett's MMA Challenge, but was defeated by submission. After the match Red told Jarrett that he had a younger brother, who would answer the challenge the following week. The following week Red's storyline brother, billed simply as Little Red (later renamed Crimson), answered the challenge and was winning his match against Jarrett, before Jarrett was pulled away from the ring by his security guards Gunner and Murphy. Shortly afterwards, Crimson broke away from Red and the relation between the two was seldom mentioned again. On the April 19 edition of Xplosion, Figueroa debuted as Sangriento, a masked luchador, in a three-way match, where he defeated Jay Lethal and Chris Sabin. Sangriento made his Impact! debut on May 5, defeating Suicide. After defeating Suicide in a rematch the following week, Sangriento was not seen again for two months, until appearing in a backstage segment with Eric Young at Destination X on July 10. At the same pay-per-view Amazing Red wrestled in an X Division number one contender's Ultimate X match, which was won by Alex Shelley, and which would turn out to be his final match for the promotion. On August 4, 2011, Figueroa announced via his Twitter account that he had parted ways with TNA. Return to the independent circuit (2012-2019) On March 4, 2012, Red returned to Ring of Honor at the 10th Anniversary Show, where he teamed with T.J. Perkins in a losing effort against the House of Truth (Michael Elgin and Roderick Strong). In June 2012, Red wrestled a tryout dark match for WWE. On April 1, 2019, Red announced his retirement from professional wrestling due to a severe neck injury. However, he would return to the ring only a few months later. In August 2019, Red was announced for the New Japan Pro-Wrestling Super J Cup that takes place in late-August. He would be defeated in the first round by the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Will Ospreay. He would then be booked for the September U.S. tour Fighting Spirit Unleashed.  House of Glory (2014‚Äì2019)  Also, Red opened his own training school, House of Glory. During his stint in the company, he became one-time HOG Tag Team Champion with his former teammate Crimson after defeating the Young Bucks. He also won the HOG Heavyweight Championship at House of Glory's \\"High Intensity 6\\" and would hold the title for a record setting 364 days. He lost the title almost a year later at \\"High Intensity 7\\" to Anthony Gangone in a No Ropes Match. Red would be forced to join the House of Gangone stable, and would then, of his own chose, turn heel by attacking two of his students, Private Party (Marq Quen & Isiah Cassady). Professional wrestling style and persona Red is known for his high-flying style. He has been described as a pioneer and an innovator during the early 2000s. Pro wrestler Will Ospreay called him an inspiration.

He competes in Lucha Libre USA as Chi Chi. Professional wrestling career=World Championship Wrestling He first appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Allan Funk, wrestling on Saturday Night and WorldWide against opponents such as Sonny Siaki. Soon after his debut, Allan had a brief feud with Barry Horowitz, he then teamed with \\"Above Average\\" Mike Sanders, as the Re-Enforcers. The team dissolved after both men got brought to WCW Monday Nitro. Upon his graduation from the WCW Power Plant in 1998, Funk was moved up to the main roster and given a left field gimmick as an eccentric dressed all in pink, and given the ring name Kwee Wee. Contrary to popular belief Kwee Wee was not a homosexual, as demonstrated by his physical interactions with manager Paisley. Near the end of WCW's existence, Kwee Wee developed an aggressive alter-ego named \\"Angry Allan\\", whom Kwee Wee would suddenly \\"turn into\\" in the event he was angered, a gimmick similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or The Incredible Hulk. He feuded with Prince Iaukea, Elix Skipper and The Natural Born Thrillers. Kwee Wee Featured in the opening match of the March 18, 2001 Pay Per View WCW Greed. Unfortunately it was a losing effort as Jason Jett defeated him on the first and last Greed Pay Per View. He was signed by the WWE after the 2001 WCW buyout, but was never featured on WWE television and was quickly released. He then appeared in World Wrestling All- Stars as \\"The Funkster\\", an impression of \\"The Hulkster\\" Hulk Hogan. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Funk joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 19, 2002 as Bruce, a \\"homosexual\\" gimmick, forming a short-lived tag team with Lenny Lane known as The Rainbow Express. The team split on November 20, 2002. Bruce also won the Miss TNA Championship on July 31, 2002. Independents On September 27, 2003 at the Baltic Brawl event in Helsinki, Finland, Funk wrestled a tag team match with Mike Sanders against Elix Skipper and Sonny Siaki. During that match, Siaki botched a split-legged moonsault and landed on Funk's face knee-first. Funk was badly injured, breaking his eardrum, nose and jaw, also cracking his orbital bone. He has had four surgeries to repair the damage and is still 100% deaf in his left ear, but he made an otherwise full recovery. Funk resumed wrestling on the independent circuit in 2005, including an appearance in Vince Russo's Ring of Glory promotion as Queen Herod. He also wrestled numerous matches in the NWA Anarchy/Wildside promotion in Cornelia, Georgia. All Japan Pro Wrestling Funk made his debut in All Japan Pro Wrestling.

While the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956 states that \\"No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it\\", loopholes, liberal interpretations and loose enforcement of the law have allowed the sex industry to prosper and earn an estimated 2.3 trillion yen ($24 billion) per year. The term is used to describe prostitution in Japan, though the terms are not always synonymous. Since Japanese law defines prostitution as \\"intercourse with an unspecified person in exchange for payment\\", most services offer specifically non-coital services, such as conversation, dancing or bathing, sometimes accompanied by sexual acts that legally are not defined as \\"intercourse\\", in order to remain legal.  History  From the 15th century, Chinese, Koreans, and other East Asian visitors frequented brothels in Japan. This practice later continued among visitors from \\"the Western regions\\", mainly European traders who often came with their South Asian lascar crew (in addition to African crew members, in some cases). This began with the arrival of Portuguese ships to Japan in the 1540s, when the local Japanese people assumed that the Portuguese were from Tenjiku (Â§©Á´∫, \\"Heavenly Abode\\"), the ancient Chinese name, thus later Japanese name, for the Indian subcontinent, and thus that Christianity was a new \\"Indian faith\\". These mistaken assumptions were due to the Indian state of Goa being a central base for the Portuguese East India Company and due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being Indian Christians. More than Hundreds of Japanese especially women were sold as slaves.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/05/26/books/book-reviews/the- rarely-if-ever-told-story-of-japanese-sold-as-slaves-by-portuguese-traders/ Portuguese visitors and their South Asian and African crew members often engaged in slavery in Japan. They bought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as sexual slaves on their ships or taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in Southeast Asia, the Americas, and India, where there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders in Goa by the early 17th century. Later European East India Companies, including those of the Dutch and British, were involved in prostitution while visiting or staying in Japan. Anti-Portuguese propaganda and exaggerations was actively promoted by the Japanese, particularly in Portuguese of buying Japanese for sexual purposes.In the Name of God: The Making of Global Christianity By Edmondo F. Lupieri, James Hooten, Amanda Kunder In 1505 Japan received syphilis, likely because of Japanese prostitutes having sex with Chinese sailors. In Sakai and Hakata ports Japanese brothels had already been patronized by Chinese visitors far before Europeans came to Japan. When the Europeans (Nanbanjin) came to Japan, they too patronized Japanese prostitutes. Edo era  Map of the Yoshiwara from 1846. In 1617, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued an order restricting prostitution to certain areas on the outskirts of cities, known as . The three most famous were Yoshiwara in Edo (present-day Tokyo), Shinmachi in Osaka, and Shimabara in Kyoto. Prostitutes and courtesans were licensed as y≈´jo (), \\"women of pleasure\\", and ranked according to an elaborate hierarchy, with tay≈´ and later oiran at the apex. The districts were walled and guarded for taxation and access control. The prostitutes were rarely allowed out of the walls, except to visit dying relatives and, once a year, for hanami (viewing cherry blossoms). Japanese women engaged in sexual relations with foreign men like Chinese and Europeans at Hirado. In 1609 a post was set up there by the Dutch East India Company. Girls who were unmarried could be rented for a few months or weeks from her parents by stranded foreign sailors stuck there during typhoons. She would then retire from prostitution and then marry after getting a trousseau from the money she earned from sex work over several summers. Some Japanese women married the foreign traders or became their concubines for long term relationships. There were many choices in how to engage in relations between Japanese females and foreign men. leading to some strange situations. Two Japanese women bore daughters at the same time to Dutch merchant Cornelis van Nijenroode who in 1623 was made the Dutch trading posts' chief factor. Zheng Chenggong (Coxinga) was born to a Japanese woman and the Chinese Hokkien trader Zheng Zhilong. Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu had hired William Adams (sailor, born 1564), an Englishman who had in Hirado a Japanese concubine and also another Japanese woman as a wife, a daughter of a headman of a post-station in Honshu. Chinese men visiting Edo period Tokugawa shogunate Japan patronized Japanese sex workers in brothels who were designated for them. Japanese women designated for Chinese male customers were known as Kara-yuki while Japanese women designated for Dutch men at Dejima were known as Oranda-yuki while Japanese women servicing Japanese men were called Nihon-yuki. Karayuki-san was then used for all Japanese women serving foreigners in sexual capacities during the Meiji period. The Japanese girls were offered to Japanese and Chinese customers at a low fee but the price of Japanese girls for Dutch customers was expensive and higher. Dutch traders were confined to the designated post at Dejima where Oranda-yuki prostitutes were sent. Initially Chinese men were much less restricted than the Dutch were at Dejimi, Chinese men could live all over Nagasaki and besides having sex with the kara-yuki Japanese prostitutes, the Chinese men could have sex with ordinary Japanese women since 1635 unlike Dutch men who were limited to prostitutes. Later the rules that applied to Dutch were applied to Chinese and Chinese were put in J≈´zenji-mura into T≈çjun-yashiki, a Chinese settlement in 1688 so they would have sex with the Kara-yuki Japanese prostitutes sent to them. Chinese men developed long term romances with the Japanese girls like the Chinese Suzhou (Su-chou) merchant Chen Renxie (Ch‚Äô√™n J√™n-hsieh) Èô≥‰ªÅË¨ù with the Japanese Azuyama girl Renzan ÈÄ£Â±± who both committed suicide in a lover's pact in 1789, and the Chinese He Minde (Ho Min-t√™) ‰ΩïÊóªÂæ∑ who pledged eternal love in Yoriai-machi with the Chikugoya Japanese girl Towa ÁôªÂÄ≠. She killed herself to join him in death when he was executed for forgery in 1690. The Chinese men were generous with their expensive presents to the Japanese girls and were praised by them for it. The Japanese girls violated Japan's laws which only permitted each to spend one night in the Chinese settlement by retracing their steps after reporting to the guards when they left the gate open in the morning. The Japanese issued laws and regulations considering the mixed children born to Japanese women from Maruyama and the foreigner Dutch and Chinese men in the Sh≈çtoku era (1711-1716). The mixed children had to stay in Japan and could not be taken back to China or the Dutch country but their fathers could fund the children's education. The boy Kimpachi ÈáëÂÖ´ was born to the Iwataya Japanese girl Yakumo ÂÖ´ and the Nanking Chinese captain Huang Zheqing ÈªÉÂì≤Âçø (Huang Ch√™-ch‚Äôing). He requested a permit from the Chief Administrator's Office of Nagasaki to trade goods to create a fund his son could live on for all his life, after coming back to Nagasaki at age 71 in 1723. A Hiketaya Japanese girl in Sodesaki Ë¢ñÁ¨ë gave birth to a son fathered by the Chinese Jiang Yunge Ê±üËä∏Èñ£ (Chiang Y√ºn-ko) (Xinyi, Hsin-i ËæõÂ§∑), a poet, painter and sea captain. Yanagawa Seigan and Rai Sanyu were his friends. Chinese dishes, delicacies, sweets and candies were introduced to Japan by Chinese men teaching their Japanese prostitute lover girls how to make them. In the Genroku era (1688-1704) a Chinese instructed the Japanese prostitute Ume how to make plum blossom shaped sugar and rice flour soft sweet called k≈çsak≈ç. Her name also meant plum blossom. The songs were sung in the T≈çs≈ç-on The Kagetsu Entertainment (Kagetsu yoky≈ç) booklet contained information about songs the Chinese men taught to their Japanese prostitute lovers showing that they were sang in T≈çs≈ç-on with instruments like hu-kung (two-stringed violin), ch‚Äôi-hsien-ch‚Äôin (seven-stringed dulcimer) and y√ºeh-ch‚Äôin (lute). The Japanese prostitutes of Maruyama who served the Chinese men in Nagasaki were taught dance, songs and music of Chinese origin. The gekkin (y√ºeh-ch‚Äôin) were used to play these Ky≈´renhwan songs. The Kankan-odori dance accompanied one of these songs which spread in Edo and Ky≈çto as it gained fame. Exhibitions of the original Chinese style dance were performed in Edo by arranging for the sending of Nagasaki officials managing Chinese affairs and geisha to be sent there by Takahashi Sakuzaemon (1785-1829) who was the court astronomer of the Shogunate. He became famous due to the Siebold Incident. Later on the prostitutes were sent to service the Dutch at Dejima after they serviced Chinese at Maruyama being paid for by the Commissioners for Victualing. The Japanese prostitutes were provided by the Japanese government to Deshima where the Dutch were confined. Prewar modern era The opening of Japan and the subsequent flood of Western influences into Japan brought about a series of changes in the Meiji period. Japanese novelists, notably Higuchi Ichiy≈ç, started to draw attention to the confinement and squalid existence of the lower-class prostitutes in the red-light districts. In 1872, the Mar√≠a Luz Incident led Government of Meiji Japan to make a new legislation, emancipating burakumin outcasts, prostitutes and other forms of bonded labor in Japan.Downer, Leslie, Women of the Pleasure Quarters: The Secret History of the Geisha, Broadway,, page 97 The emancipating law for prostitution was named Geish≈çgi kaih≈ç rei (Ëä∏Â®ºÂ¶ìËß£Êîæ‰ª§). In 1900, the Japanese Government promulgated Ordinance No. 44, Sh≈çgi torishimari kisoku (Â®ºÂ¶ìÂèñÁ∑†Ë¶èÂâá), restricting the labor conditions of prostitution. The restriction neither reduced the total number of prostitution nor granted more liberty to women. Instead, prostitution thrived under the Meiji government. The name: \\"kingdom of whoring\\" (baishun o¬Økoku)Morisaki, Baishun o¬Økoku no onnatachi. was to describe Japan during the Meiji Period. Due to the development of the modern transportation system, the demand and the supply of prostitution increased, and the population of the female population drastically increased. The government, therefore, with the legislation, could legally collect taxation from prostitution. Rather than improving human rights or liberty, the legislation intended to facilitate government revenue. The prostitution industry contributed a large part of government revenue from the late Tokugawa period to the Meiji period. In 1908, the Ministry of Home Affairs' Ordinance No. 16 penalized unregulated prostitution. =Karayuki-san= Karayuki-san was the name given to Japanese girls and women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who were trafficked from poverty stricken agricultural prefectures in Japan to destinations in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Siberia (Russian Far East), Manchuria, and British India to serve as prostitutes and sexually serviced men from a variety of races, including Chinese, Europeans, native Southeast Asians, and others.  Postwar era  G.I.s in Recreation and Amusement Association during the occupation of Japan. Immediately after World War II, the Recreation and Amusement Association was formed by Naruhiko Higashikuni's government to organize brothels to serve the Allied armed forces occupying Japan. On 19 August 1945, the Home Ministry ordered local government offices to establish a prostitution service for Allied soldiers to preserve the \\"purity\\" of the Japanese race. This prostitution system was similar to the comfort system, because the Japanese police force was responsible for mobilizing the women to serve in these stations similarly to the way that Japanese Military during the Pacific War mobilized women. The police forces mobilized both licensed and unlicensed prostitutes to serve in these camps.Yuki Tanaka, Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution during World War II and the US Occupation, Asia's Transformations (NEW York: Routhledge, 2002)133-135. The official declaration stated that \\"Through the sacrifice of thousands of 'Okichis' of the Sh≈çwa era, we shall construct a dike to hold back the mad frenzy of the occupation troops and cultivate and preserve the purity of our race long into the future.\\"Herbert Bix, Hirohito and the making of modern Japan, 2001, p. 538, citing Kinkabara Samon and Takemae Eiji, Showashi: kokumin non naka no haran to gekido no hanseiki-zohoban, 1989, p. 244. Such clubs were soon established by cabinet councilor Yoshio Kodama and Ryoichi Sasakawa. SCAP abolished the licensed prostitution system (including the RAA) in 1946, which led to the so-called system, under which licensed nightlife establishments offered sexual services under the guise of being an ordinary club or cafe. Local police authorities traditionally regulated the location of such establishments by drawing red lines on a map. In other areas, so-called \\"blue line\\" establishments offered sexual services under the guise of being restaurants, bars or other less strictly-regulated establishments. In Tokyo, the best-known \\"red line\\" districts were Yoshiwara and Shinjuku 2-chome, while the best-known \\"blue line\\" district was Kabuki-cho. In 1947, Imperial Ordinance No. 9 punished persons for enticing women to act as prostitutes, but prostitution itself remained legal. Several bills were introduced in the Diet to add further legal penalties for soliciting prostitutes but were not passed due to disputes over the appropriate extent of punishment. On 24 May 1956, the Diet of Japan passed the Anti-Prostitution Law, which came into force in April 1958. The Anti-Prostitution Law criminalized the act of committing sexual intercourse in exchange for actual or promised compensation. This eliminated the \\"red line\\" and \\"blue line\\" systems and allowed a number of paid sexual services to continue under \\"sexual entertainment\\" regulations, e.g., \\"soaplands\\" and \\"fashion health\\" parlors. In 2013, Toru Hashimoto, co-leads the Japan Restoration Party proposed \\"There are places where people can legally release their sexual energy in Japan\\", and \\"Unless they make use of these facilities, it will be difficult to control the sexual energies of the wild Marines.\\" The U.S. Department of State later criticized Hashimoto's remarks. Religious connotations=Shinto The Shinto faith does not regard sex as a taboo. Sacred prostitution was even once practised by the Miko within traditional, pre-Meiji Shinto. Buddhism Buddhist teachings regarding sex are quite reserved: \\"It is true to say that Buddhism, in keeping with the principle of the Middle Way, would advocate neither extreme puritanism nor extreme permissiveness.\\" Buddhism has rules and protocols for those that are to live the Buddhist principles in the monasteries and the secular part of the [Shanga]. For the Buddhist monks or nuns, chastity is mandatory since they live on the premise of getting rid of any feelings of attachment. Their way of living is regulated by very strict rules concerning behavior and this includes sex. As for the secular Buddhists, there are no specific rules to be followed about sex; although any kind of abuse is regarded as \\"misconduct\\". Current status=Legal status Article 3 of the of 1956For the name, see WWWJDIC (link ). states that \\"No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it\\", but no judicial penalty is defined for this act. Instead, the following are prohibited on pain of penalty: soliciting for purposes of prostitution, procuring a person for prostitution, coercing a person into prostitution, receiving compensation from the prostitution of others, inducing a person to be a prostitute by paying an \\"advance\\", concluding a contract for making a person a prostitute, furnishing a place for prostitution, engaging in the business of making a person a prostitute, and the furnishing of funds for prostitution.Hongo, Jun, \\"Law bends over backward to allow 'fuzoku'\\", Japan Times, 27 May 2011, p. 3. The definition of prostitution is strictly limited to coitus with an \\"unspecified person\\".Ministry of Justice (H≈çmush≈ç), Materials Concerning Prostitution and Its Control in Japan. Tokyo: Ministry of Justice, 1957, p. 32. OCLC no. 19432229. This means sale of numerous acts such as oral sex, anal sex, mammary intercourse and other non-coital sex acts are legal. Paid sex between \\"specified persons\\" (acquaintances) is not prohibited. Soaplands exploit this by providing a massage, during which the prostitute and client become \\"acquainted\\", as a preliminary to sexual services. The , also known as the \\"Law to Regulate Adult Entertainment Businesses\\", amended in 1985, 1999 and 2005, regulates these businesses.  Types  Soaplands town Yoshiwara (2008) The sex industry in Japan uses a variety of names. Soaplands are bath houses where customers are soaped up and serviced by staff. Fashion health shops and pink salons are notionally massage or esthetic treatment parlors; image clubs are themed versions of the same. Call girls operate via delivery health services. Freelancers can get in contact with potential customers via deai sites (Internet dating sites). Kabukicho, an entertainment and red-light district in Shinjuku, Tokyo, measures only 0.34 km2, and has approximately 3,500 sex parlors, strip theaters, peep shows, \\"soaplands\\", 'lovers' banks, porno shops, sex telephone clubs, karaoke bars and clubs, etc. It was reported in 2003 that as many as 150,000 non-Japanese women were then involved in prostitution in Japan. According to National Police Agency records, out of 50 non-Japanese people arrested for prostitution offences (Â£≤Êò•Èò≤Ê≠¢Ê≥ïÈÅïÂèç) in 2013, 31 (62%) were mainland Chinese, 13 (26%) were Koreans and 4 (8%) were Thai. According to National Police Agency records, out of 224 non-Japanese people arrested for prostitution offences (È¢®Âñ∂ÈÅ©Ê≠£ÂåñÊ≥ï) in 2018, 160 (71%) were mainland Chinese, 19 (8%) were Thai. Many businesses related to prostitution voluntarily (i.e. despite there being no regulation requiring it) ban entry to foreigners, including tourists, people who cannot speak Japanese, and even people who do not have Asian traits. However in recent years, several businesses have been set up to specifically cater to the foreigner market.  Tokyo prostitution  In Tokyo, prostitution dates back several hundred years. In the early 17th century, the first attempts were made to regulate prostitution in the Yoshiwara district of Edo (present-day Tokyo). A law was passed that required prostitutes to register and work in secured facilities, its main purpose being for tax collection. Because of Tokyo's position as a top five global business and trade city, prostitution continues to thrive in Tokyo. Terms Several terms have been used as euphemisms for the sex industry in Japan: *Baishun (), literally \\"selling spring\\" or \\"selling youth\\", has turned from a mere euphemism into a legal term used in, for instance, the title of the 1956 Anti-Prostitution Law (Baishun-b≈çshi-h≈ç, ); the modern meaning of the word is quite specific and it is usually only used for actual (i.e., illegal) prostitution. The word for \\"prostitute\\" in Japanese is baishunfu (Â£≤Êò•Â©¶).(ja) Bai(Â£≤) is means to sell. *Kaishun (Ë≤∑Êò•), It means buying a prostitute. The name of the law (Jidou-kaishun-shyobatsu-h≈ç, ÂÖêÁ´•Ë≤∑Êò•Âá¶ÁΩ∞Ê≥ï); was used in 1999. Kai(Ë≤∑) is means to buy. *Mizu sh≈çbai (), the \\"water trade\\", is a wider term covering the entire entertainment industry. An older term originating in the pleasure quarters of the previous centuries, the mizu- sh≈çbai referred to not only yujo, but also their higher-class cousins the oiran, kabuki actors, and geisha; while the former two were legitimate in selling sex, the latter two did not do so officially, though some either chose to sell sex for money, or, in the case of the famous geisha Teruha, may have been coerced or even forced into it. In the present day, the \\"mizu-sh≈çbai\\" mostly refers to kabuki actors and geisha, with no expectations of prostitution. *F≈´zoku (), literally \\"public morals\\", is commonly used to refer specifically to the sex industry, although in legal use this covers, e.g., dance halls and gambling, and the more specific term seif≈´zoku (), \\"sexual morals\\", is used instead. The term originates from a law regulating business affecting public morals.  Sex trafficking  Japan is a destination, source, and transit country for men, women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Men, women, and children from Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Russia, East Europe, South America, and Africa travel to Japan for employment or fraudulent marriage and are subjected to sex trafficking. Traffickers use fraudulent marriages between foreign women and Japanese men to facilitate the entry of women into Japan for forced prostitution in bars, clubs, brothels, and massage parlors. Traffickers keep victims in forced prostitution using debt bondage, threats of violence or deportation, blackmail, passport retention, and other psychologically coercive methods. Brothel operators sometimes arbitrarily impose \\"fines\\" on victims for alleged misbehavior as a tactic to extend their indebtedness. Trafficking victims reportedly transit Japan before being exploited in onward destinations, including East Asia and North America. Japanese citizens‚Äîparticularly runaway teenage girls‚Äîare also subjected to sex trafficking. Enjo kosai, also known as \\"compensated dating\\", and variants of the \\"JK\\" business continue to facilitate the sex trafficking of Japanese children. Highly organized prostitution networks target vulnerable Japanese women and girls‚Äîoften living in poverty or with cognitive disabilities‚Äîin public spaces such as subways, popular youth hangouts, schools, and online, and subject them to sex trafficking. Private Japanese immigration brokers help Japanese-Filipino children and their Filipina mothers move to Japan and acquire citizenship for a significant fee, which the mothers often incur large debts to pay; upon arrival, some of these women and their children are subjected to sex trafficking to pay off the debts. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Japan as a 'Tier 1' country.

At the time, it was the shortest but not the smallest boat to cross the Atlantic nonstop (till today the smallest is Lindemann's folding kayak). He left Falmouth, Massachusetts on June 1 and arrived in Falmouth, Cornwall, England 78 days later, greeted by an armada of small boats and a huge crowd. Mayor Samuel A. Hooper of Falmouth officially welcomed him at the town's Custom House Quay. Robert Manry's wife Virginia and his children, Robin and Douglas, were also there, having been flown in from Willowick, Ohio. During the voyage Manry was knocked overboard by big waves, suffered from hallucinations, repaired a broken rudder in mid-ocean, and was woken up one morning by a surfacing submarine, USS Tench (SS-417). Manry later wrote about the voyage and its preparation in his book Tinkerbelle. Tinkerbelle, a little wooden Old Town \\"Whitecap\\" sailboat, was originally built by the Old Town Canoe Co. of Old Town, Maine. Manry extensively modified her himself for the voyage by adding a cabin and more seaworthy cockpit. Tinkerbelle's official registration number painted on her bow was OH 7013 AR.

This data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates, though they can also include altitude, bearing, distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a time stamp. Geotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. For instance, someone can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image search engine. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources. Geotagging can tell users the location of the content of a given picture or other media or the point of view, and conversely on some media platforms show media relevant to a given location. The geographical location data used in geotagging can, in almost every case, be derived from the global positioning system, and based on a latitude/longitude-coordinate system that presents each location on the earth from 180¬∞ west through 180¬∞ east along the Equator and 90¬∞ north through 90¬∞ south along the prime meridian. The related term geocoding refers to the process of taking non-coordinate-based geographical identifiers, such as a street address, and finding associated geographic coordinates (or vice versa for reverse geocoding). Such techniques can be used together with geotagging to provide alternative search techniques. Applications= In social media  Geotagging is a popular feature on several social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. Facebook users can geotag photos that can be added to the page of the location they are tagging. Users may also use a feature that allows them to find nearby Facebook friends by generating a list of people according to the location tracker in their mobile devices. Instagram uses a map feature that allows users to geotag photos. The map layout pin points specific photos that the user has taken on a world map. Photos Two main options can be used to geotag photos: capturing GPS information at the time the photo is taken or \\"attaching\\" geocoordinates to the photograph after the picture is taken. In order to capture GPS data at the time the photograph is captured, the user must have a camera with built in GPS or a standalone GPS along with a digital camera. Because of the requirement for wireless service providers in United States to supply more precise location information for 911 calls by September 11, 2012, more and more cell phones have built-in GPS chips. Most smart phones already use a GPS chip along with built-in cameras to allow users to automatically geotag photos. Others may have the GPS chip and camera but do not have internal software needed to embed the GPS information within the picture. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging. Devices use GPS, A-GPS or both. A-GPS can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings. Traditional GPS does not need cell phone towers and uses standard GPS signals outside of urban areas. Traditional GPS tends to use more battery power. Almost any digital camera can be coupled with a stand-alone GPS and post processed with photo mapping software, to write the location information to the image's exif header.  Remote sensing data  In the field of remote sensing the geotagging goal is to store coordinates of every pixel in the image. One approach is used with the orthophotos where we store coordinates of four corners and all the other pixels can be georeferenced by interpolation. The four corners are stored using GeoTIFF or World file standards. Hyperspectral images take a different approach defining a separate file of the same spatial dimensions as the image where latitude and longitude of each pixel are stored as two 2D layers in so called Input geometry data (IGM) files, also known as GEO files. Audio/video files Audio/video files can be geotagged via: metadata, audio encoding, overlay, or with companion files. Metadata records the geospatial data in the encoded video file to be decoded for later analysis. One of the standards used with unmanned aerial vehicle is MISB Standard 0601 which allows geocoding of corner points and horizon lines in individual video frames.MISB Standard 0601 Audio encoding involves a process of converting gps data into audio data such as modem squawk. Overlay involves overlaying GPS data as text on the recorded video. Companion files are separate data files which correspond to respective audio/video files. Companion files are typically found in the .KML and .GPX data formats. For audio and video files which use the vorbiscomment metadata format (including Opus, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Speex, and Ogg Theora), there is a proposed GEO LOCATION field which can be used. Like all vorbis comments, it is plain text, and it takes the form: \`GEO_LOCATION=(decimal latitude);(decimal longitude);([optional]elevation in meters)\` for example: \`GEO_LOCATION=35.1592;-98.4422;410\` SMS messages The GeoSMS standard works by embedding one or more 'geo' URIs in the body of an SMS, for example: :\`I'm at the pub geo:-37.801631,144.980294;u=16\` DNS entries RFC 1876 defines a means for expressing location information in the Domain Name System. LOC resources records can specify the latitude, longitude, altitude, precision of the location, and the physical size of on entity attached to an IP address. However, in practice not all IP addresses have such a record, so it is more common to use geolocation services to find the physical location of an IP address. HTML pagesICBM method= The GeoURL method requires the ICBM tag (plus optional Dublin Core metadata), which is used to geotag standard web pages in HTML format: The similar Geotag format allows the addition of place name and region tags: =RDF feeds= The RDF method is defined by W3 Group and presents the information in RDF tags: 55.701 12.552 =Microformat= The Geo microformat allows coordinates within HyperText Markup Language pages to be marked up in such a way that they can be \\"discovered\\" by software tools. Example: 50.167958; -97.133185 A proposal has been developed to extend Geo to cover other bodies, such as Mars and the Moon. An example is the Flickr photo-sharing Web site, which provides geographic data for any geotagged photo in all of the above-mentioned formats. In tag- based systems No industry standards exist, however there are a variety of techniques for adding geographical identification metadata to an information resource. One convention, established by the website Geobloggers and used by more and more sites, e.g. photo sharing sites Panoramio and Flickr, and the social bookmarking site del.icio.us, enables content to be found via a location search. Such sites allow users to add metadata to an information resource via a set of so-called machine tags (see folksonomy). \`geotagged\` \`geo:lat=57.64911\` \`geo:lon=10.40744\` This describes the geographic coordinates of a particular location in terms of latitude (\`geo:lat\`) and longitude (\`geo:lon\`). These are expressed in decimal degrees in the WGS84 datum, which has become something of a default geodetic datum with the advent of GPS. Using three tags works within the constraint of having tags that can only be single 'words'. Identifying geotagged information resources on sites like Flickr and del.icio.us is done by searching for the 'geotagged' tag, since the tags beginning \`geo:lat=\` and \`geo:lon=\` are necessarily very variable. Another option is to tag with a Geohash: \`geo:hash=u4pruydqqvj\` A further convention proposed by FlickrFly adds tags to specify the suggested viewing angle and range when the geotagged location is viewed in Google Earth: \`ge:head=225.00\` \`ge:tilt=45.00\` \`ge:range=560.00\` These three tags would indicate that the camera is pointed heading 225¬∞ (south west), has a 45¬∞ tilt and is 560 metres from the subject. Where the above methods are in use, their coordinates may differ from those specified by the photo's internal Exif data, for example because of a correction or a difference between the camera's location and the subject's. In order to integrate geotags in social media and enhance text readability or oral use, the concept of 'meetag' or tag-to-meet has been proposed. Differing from hashtag construction, meetag includes the geolocation information after an underscore. A meetag is therefore a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with an underscore (\\"_\\"). Words in messages on microblogging and social networking services may be tagged by putting \\"_\\" before them, either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g. \\"There is a concert going _montreuxjazzfestival\\", \\"the world wide web was invented _cern _geneve\\", ...) or appended to it. Geoblogging Geoblogging attaches specific geographic location information to blog entries via geotags. Searching a list of blogs and pictures tagged using geotag technology allows users to select areas of specific interest to them on interactive maps. The progression of GPS technology, along with the development of various online applications, has fueled the popularity of such tagged blogging, and the combination of GPS phones and GSM localization, has led to the moblogging, where blog posts are tagged with exact position of the user. Real-time geotagging relays automatically geotagged media such as photos or video to be published and shared immediately. For better integration and readability of geotags into blog texts, the meetag syntax has been proposed, which transforms any word, sentence, or precise geolocalization coordinates prefixed with an underscore into a 'meetag'. It not only lets one express a precise location but also takes in account dynamically changing geolocations. Wikipedia article geosearching apps One of the first attempts to initiate the geotagging aspect of searching and locating articles seems to be the now-inoperative site Wikinear.com, launched in 2008, which showed the user Wikipedia pages that are geographically closest to one's current location.Willison, Simon. (2008). \\"Wininear.com, OAuth and Fire Eagle\\", SimonWillison.net, Mar 22 2008 The 2009 app Cyclopedia works relatively well showing geotagged Wikipedia articles located within several miles of ones location, integrated with a street-view mode, and 360-degree mode. The app Respotter Wiki, launched in 2009, claims to feature Wikipedia searching via a map, also allowing users to interact with people around them, via messaging and reviews, etc. The app, in its current function, however, seems to give only geotagged photo results. As of 2017, the Wikipedia-World Project provides a simple map search tool which can display tagged articles near to a particular location, as well as a variety of more sophisticated tools integrated with external mapping services. Dangers Following a scientific study and several demonstrative websites, a discussion on the privacy implications of geotagging has raised public attention.Heussner, Ki Mae, \\"Celebrities' Photos, Videos May Reveal Location\\", ABC News, July 16, 2010Geo-tags reveal celeb secrets, 12 July 2010, by Jim Giles, New Scientist In particular, the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures taken with smartphones is often ignored by cell-phone users. As a result, people are often not aware that the photos they publish on the Internet have been geotagged. Many celebrities reportedly gave away their home location without knowing it. According to the study, a significant number of for-sale advertisements on Craigslist, that were otherwise anonymized, contained geotags, thereby revealing the location of high-valued goods‚Äîsometimes in combination with clear hints to the absence of the offerer at certain times. Publishing photos and other media tagged with exact geolocation on the Internet allows random people to track an individual's location and correlate it with other information. Therefore, criminals could find out when homes are empty because their inhabitants posted geotagged and timestamped information both about their home address and their vacation residence. These dangers can be avoided by removing geotags with a metadata removal tool for photos before publishing them on the Internet.For instance, ExifCleaner and JPEG & PNG StripperiPhone-App iMetaPhoto In 2007, four United States Army Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by Iraqi insurgent mortar fire; the insurgents had made use of embedded coordinates in web- published photographs (geotagging) taken of the helicopters by soldiers. Another newly realised danger of geotagging is the location information provided to criminal gangs and poachers on the whereabouts of often endangered animals. This can effectively make tourists scouts for these poachers, so geotagging should be turned off when photographing these animals.

This version of the dance was first published by D.G. MacLennan in 1952, who referred to it as a Hebridean dance, collected by MacLennan in 1925 from Archie MacPherson on the island of South Uist. MacLennan himself suggested \\"a more effective finishing\\" of the dance, with entrechat at the end.MacLennan, D.G. (1952). Highland and Traditional Scottish Dances. Edinburgh. p. 30-31, 58-59. Most national dances are usually danced in an Aboyne dress, but the Highland Laddie is one of two national dances that are typically danced in the standard kilt-based outfit, the other being \\"Wilt Thou Go to the Barracks, Johnny?\\". Scottish step dances Highland (or Hielan') Laddie is the name of several Scottish soft-shoe step dances, different from the National dance mentioned above. Two different dances of this name have been taught in Scottish (Ladies) Step dance classes within the frame of the RSCDS Summer Schools in St Andrews, Scotland.Royal Scottish Country Dance Society (2013). The St Andrew's Collection of Step Dances. Vol. 1. pp. 38-41. Yet another version, collected by Jack McConachie and published in 1972McConachie, Jack (1972). Hebridean Solo Dances. Caber feidh Publications. p. 12-18. is now commonly referred to as \\"Hebridean Laddie\\".United Kingdom Alliance of Professional Teachers of Dancing (2012). The UKA Highland, National and Hebridean Book. Blackpool. p. 34-35. There are reasons to believe that dances taught by Jack McConachie as Hebridean, namely Flowers of Edinburgh and Bonnie Dundee, originally used to be danced to the music of Hielan' Laddie as well.Robertson, Colin (1982). Hard Shoe Step Dancing in Scotland and The Flowers of Edinburgh. The Scottish national Dance Company. p. 4. Settings As a tune with martial affiliations Highland Laddie is still widely played by the regimental bands and/or pipes and drums of the Scottish regiments. As a traditional Scottish tune, Highland Laddie is also commonly played on the bagpipes for Scottish dances. Typically categorised as a \\"Quick March,\\" Highland Laddie is normally written in 2/4 time. The \\"standard\\" setting contains two parts (8 bars per part). As with any of the older melodies, variations have been composed and some published with the most distinctive settings appearing in Pipe Major William Ross' 1885 book containing eight parts to 'Highland Laddie'. Canadian settings \\"Highland Laddie\\" appears as the most frequently used regimental march in the Canadian Forces and demonstrates a variety of settings depending upon which music book and/or instructor was used in any particular area. Some regiments play two parts and some a four-part version as their regimental march. Not all the parts are in the same order and some are not played at all. Lyrics Numerous lyrics for the tune exist. Jacobite Rebellion Where ha' ye been a' the day?

It became part of the Metro group when A&P; Canada was sold to Metro for $1.7 billion in 2005. Food Basics lowers its prices in a number of ways: low maintenance (no free plastic bags, just free cardboard boxes), store decor is kept to a minimum and fewer staff are employed, mostly in part-time positions. The chain operates by pushing higher volumes on a limited selection of products than Metro stores allowing it to compete price-wise with other grocery stores. There are 117 locations in Ontario. 36 were franchise stores until Metro Inc. purchased all stores back by the end of 2008. Some Food Basics feature a pharmacy known as Drug Basics.

The two brothers were the only male descendants of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I, who had been dethroned and killed in 1185, and thus claimed to represent the legitimate government of the Empire following the conquest of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Although his rivals governing the Nicaean Empire succeeded in becoming the de facto successors, and rendered his dynastic claims to the imperial throne moot, Alexios' descendants continued to emphasize both their heritage and connection to the Komnenian dynasty by referring to themselves as Megas Komnenos or Grand Komnenos.R. Macrides, \\"What's in the name 'Megas Komnenos'?\\" Archeion Pontou 35 (1979), pp. 238‚Äì245 While his brother David conquered a number of Byzantine provinces in northwestern Anatolia, Alexios defended his capital Trebizond from an unsuccessful siege by the Seljuk Turks around the year 1205.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'empire de Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs au 13e si√®cle\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 46 (1988), pp. 110f Further details of his reign are sparse. Muslim chroniclers record how, in 1214, Alexios was captured by the Turks in the field while defending Sinope; despite sending an envoy to seek their surrender the city refused to capitulate to Sultan Kaykaus I, and Alexios was tortured in sight of the Sinopians. The city submitted to Kaykaus and Alexios was freed after becoming Kaykaus' vassal. Alexios died at the age of forty. From Constantinople to Georgia Alexios was the eldest son of Manuel Komnenos, and a grandson of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I (reigned 1183‚Äì1185). Andronikos had taken refuge at the court of King George III of Georgia in the 1170s, and was a governor in the Pontus when his cousin the emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180) died; upon hearing the news, he marched on Constantinople and seized the imperial throne. His reign was a turbulent one, and in 1185 Andronikos was dethroned and killed while his son Manuel was blinded and may have died from this mutilation.A. A. Vasiliev, \\"The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204‚Äì1222)\\", Speculum, 11 (1936), pp. 5‚Äì8 Manuel left two children, the Caesars Alexios and David. Their mother's name is not recorded in the primary sources; Byzantinist Alexander Vasiliev speculates that it is \\"possible\\" that their mother was a Georgian princess.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 17 Somehow the boys arrived at the court of their relative Queen Tamar of Georgia; scholars have speculated when and how they made their way there. One school of thought endorses the hypothesis of Fallmerayer, who believed the boys were taken from Constantinople during the chaos of their grandfather's fall from power in 1185, when Alexios was about three years old, and came to Georgia early in Tamar's reign. Another school of thought follows George Finlay's belief that the boys remained in Constantinople, and although educated in the capital, were somehow safe from Andronikos' successor, emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185‚Äì1195 and 1203‚Äì1204); Finlay argued that they were not at risk from \\"a government which, like that of the Byzantine empire, was recognized to be elective, and in which their father had been excluded from the throne by the exercise of an acknowledged constitutional prerogative.\\"George Finlay, The History of Greece and the Empire of Trebizond, (1204‚Äì1461) (Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1877), p. 317 Older writers who had no knowledge of the chronicle of the Trapezuntine chronicler Michael Panaretos nor access to Georgian records, such as Edward Gibbon, assumed the brothers were simply made governors of Trebizond, and when the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, Alexios declared himself emperor there. Vasiliev discussed these opinions in a 1936 article published in Speculum and considered Fallmerayer's hypothesis as closer to the truth.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 9‚Äì12 Exactly how Alexios and Queen Tamar of Georgia were related is not clear. According to Michael Panaretos, Queen Tamar was Alexios' \\"paternal relative\\" (œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœåœÇ Œ∏Œµ·Ω∂Œ±), a phrase that has baffled scholars. As early as 1854 the Russian scholar Kunik proposed that this phrase meant that Alexios' mother was Rusudan a little-known sister of Tamar, a theory Vasiliev endorsed. Cyril Toumanoff argued that their grandfather Andronikos, while in Georgia, had married an unnamed sister of king George III.Toumanoff, \\"On the Relationship between the Founder of the Empire of Trebizond and the Georgian Queen Thamar\\", Speculum, 15 (1940), pp. 299‚Äì312 More recently Michel Kur≈°anskis has argued against Toumanoff's theory, producing evidence that Alexios' mother and/or grandmother were daughters of the houses of Palaiologos or Doukas, yet failing to offer an explanation why Panaretos describes Tamar as Alexios' paternal aunt.Kur≈°anskis, \\"L'Empire de Tr√©bizonde et la G√©orgie\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 35 (1977). pp. 237‚Äì256 Despite the research of Vasiliev, Toumanoff, Kur≈°anskis and others, Alexios' life is a blank between 1185, when Andronikos was deposed and murdered, and 1204 when he and David arrived at Trebizond‚Äîalthough this lack of information has not prevented scholars from proposing various hypotheses. All authorities agree that Alexios and his brother found refuge at Tamar's court. Vasiliev even speculates that \\"Georgian became their native tongue\\" and that they \\"were thoroughly Georgian in language and education as well as in political ideals\\", but possibly \\"some Greeks were among their attendants in order that they might be familiar with the language of their own country\\".Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 18 However, Kur≈°anskis notes that there are few traces of Georgian influence in the administration and culture of the Empire of Trebizond, and points out that its elite always looked towards Constantinople for their political and religious models.Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et la G√©orgie\\", p. 238 Return from Georgia After marching from Georgia, and with the help of their paternal relative Queen Tamar, Alexios and David occupied Trebizond in April 1204.Michael Panaretos, Chronicle, ch. 1. Greek text and English translation in Scott Kennedy, Two Works on Trebizond, Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library 52 (Cambridge: Harvard University, 2019), p. 3 That same month Alexios was proclaimed emperor at the age of 22, an act considered by later writers as the moment the Empire of Trebizond was founded.Finlay, History, p. 370; Miller, Trebizond, pp. 14‚Äì19 Vasiliev was one of the first historians to suspect that Tamar assisted her young relatives for reasons beyond familial loyalty. \\"Religiously minded, Tamar had the habit of bestowing alms on monasteries and churches not only in her own country but also all over the Near East\\", Vasiliev wrote in 1936. One such gift she bestowed on a group of monks before they left for Jerusalem was taken from them by the Byzantine emperor Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195‚Äì1203) as they sailed past Constantinople; although Tamar subsequently made up for the theft by giving the monks a much more lavish gift, Alexios' theft insulted the queen. She decided to avenge the insult by supporting her nephews in their invasion of Byzantine territories.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 18‚Äì20 The date Alexios entered Trebizond may be narrowed down even further. Sergey Karpov has identified a lead seal of Alexios, on one side \\"the image of a strategos in the peaked helmet leaded by hand by St. George\\" with the inscriptions ·ºàŒªŒ≠ŒæŒπŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ ŒöŒøŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ [Alexios Komnenos] and ·Ωâ ·ºç(Œ≥ŒπŒøœÇ) ŒìŒµœéœÅŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ [Saint George] on either side; on the obverse is a scene of ·º© ·ºâŒ≥ŒØŒ± ·ºàŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ [The Holy Resurrection] with the corresponding inscription. Karpov interprets the significance of this image and the inscription as portraying the most important achievement of his life, St. George inviting the victorious prince to enter Trebizond and opening the gates of the city with his left hand. The importance of St. George was that Easter‚Äîthe date of the Resurrection‚Äîin 1204 fell on 25 April, while the memorial date of St. George was 23 April. \\"So I dared to assume,\\" writes Karpov, \\"that the seal points out the date of the capture of Trebizond.\\"Karpov, \\"New Archival Discoveries of Documents concerning the Empire of Trebizond\\", Gamer, 1 (2012), pp. 75f Vasiliev points out that the brothers occupied Trebizond too early to have done so in response to the Crusaders capturing Constantinople; Alexios and David began their march on Trebizond before news of the sack of Constantinople on 13 April 1204 could reach either Trebizond or Georgia. According to Vasiliev, however, their original intention was not to seize a base from which they could recover the capital of the Byzantine Empire, but rather to carve out of the Byzantine Empire a buffer state to protect Georgia from the Seljuk Turks.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 19 Kur≈°anskis, while agreeing with Vasiliev that Tamar was motivated by revenge for Alexios Angelos's insult, proposed a more obvious motivation for the brother's return to Byzantine territory: they had decided to raise the banner of revolt, depose Alexios Angelos, and return the imperial throne to the Komnenos dynasty. However, not long after they had gained control of Trebizond and the neighboring territories, news of the Latin conquest of Constantinople reached them, and the brothers entered the competition for recovery of the imperial city against Theodore I Laskaris in western Anatolia (ruler of the \\"Empire of Nicaea\\") and Michael Komnenos Doukas in mainland Greece (ruler of the \\"Despotate of Epirus\\").Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et la G√©orgie\\", pp. 243‚Äì245 Over the following months, David marched westward making himself master of the rest of the Pontus and of Paphlagonia. Anthony Bryer suggests the account in the Georgian Royal Annals of the invasion could be separated into the two routes the individual brothers took. Both started in Imereti and reached Trebizond; David proceeded along the coast, perhaps leading a fleet, capturing Kerasous, Cide, Amasra and Heraclea Pontica; meanwhile Alexios took possession of Limnia, Samsun and Sinope.Bryer, \\"David Komnenos and Saint Eleutherios\\", Archeion Pontou, 42 (1988‚Äì1989), p. 179 Although a minor port, Samsun was the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum's doorway to the Black Sea, and Alexios' occupation blocked the Sultanate from the trade and the opportunities of expansion Samsun represented; in the words of the Muslim historian Ali ibn al-Athir, he \\"closed the sea\\" to the Seljuks.Claude Cahen, Pre-Ottoman Turkey: A General Survey of the Material and Spiritual Culture and History c. 1071‚Äì1330, 1968 (New York: American Council of Learned Societies, 2014), p. 117 Gaining Paphlagonia gave the brothers access to an important base of support. The Komnenos family was popular in Paphlagonia, with which they had long-established ties, as it was their home province: Kastamone was said to be the ancestral castle of the Komnenoi;William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204‚Äì1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 15 during the reign of Isaac II Angelos a pretender to the throne had appeared in Paphlagonia, calling himself Alexios, and he succeeded in uniting several districts behind him.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 21‚Äì23 While David was in Paphlagonia, Alexios was forced to remain in the neighborhood of Trebizond, defending the eastern part of their domain from the attacks of the Seljuk Turks. These attacks culminated in the first siege of Trebizond by Sultan Kaykhusraw I.Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", pp. 109‚Äì111 In a panegyric to his master, the Nicaean emperor Theodore Laskaris, Nicetas Choniates compared Alexios to Hylas, a member of the expedition of the Argonauts who landed on the coast of Mysia to obtain water, but was kidnapped by the Naiads and never seen again.Miller, Trebizond, p. 18; Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 21 Although Theodore Laskaris pushed back the Komnenos brothers' western frontier by defeating an attempt to seize Nicomedia,Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 24; Bryer, \\"David Komnenos\\", p. 181 by 1207 the grandsons of Andronikos Komnenos ruled over the largest of the three Byzantine successor states. From Heraclea Pontica their domain extended east to Trebizond and past it to Soterioupolis on the Georgian frontier. Alexios also made parts of the Crimea a tributary to Trebizond. Cherson, Kerch, and their hinterlands were governed as an overseas province called Perateia (\\"beyond the sea\\").Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 26‚Äì29 It appeared that it was only a matter of time before one of the Komnenos brothers seized Constantinople to rule as \\"Basileus and Autokrator of the Rhomaioi\\". Unfortunately, this proved to be the high-water mark of their conquests.  Campaigns in Paphlagonia  Their adversary, Theodore Laskaris, had not been idle. He had neutralized rivals along his southern marches‚ÄîSabas Asidenos, Manuel Maurozomes, and Theodore Mangaphas; he had been crowned Emperor in March or April 1206; all the while Theodore had frustrated attempts of Henry of Flanders to expand the newly founded Latin Empire into Anatolia.Alice Gardiner, The Lascarids of Nicaea: The Story of an Empire in Exile, 1912, (Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert, 1964), pp. 75‚Äì78 In 1208 Theodore decided to strike against the Paphlagonian possessions of Alexios' brother David by crossing the Sangarios River and investing Heraclea Pontica. In response, David sent a deputation to Henry of Flanders, which reached the Latin Emperor in September 1208 with their request for help.Bryer, \\"David Komnenos\\", p. 183 Henry led his troops across the Sea of Marmara and occupied Nicomedia, threatening Laskaris' rear, and forcing the latter to lift his siege and return to his own territory. Theodore's withdraw was costly, for he lost about 1000 men in crossing the Sangarios, which was in flood. Despite this setback, Theodore did not abandon his attempts on Paphlagonia. Following the Seljuk defeat at Antioch on the Meander, he concluded a treaty with the new Seljuk Sultan, Kaykaus I, and together they encroached on the Trapezuntine territory.Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", p. 112 According to the panegyric of Niketas Choniates, there was no resistance to Theodore's incursions, and Theodore eventually captured Heraclea Pontica and Amastris.Shukurov, \\"The Enigma of David Grand Komnenos\\", Mesogeios, 12 (2001), p. 131; Bryer, \\"David Komnenos\\", p. 185 It was during this period that David Komnenos vanishes from the scene. We know of his ultimate fate from a note in a manuscript written at Mount Athos that tells us David died as a monk of Vatopedi monastery on 13 December 1212.Bryer, \\"David Komnenos\\", p. 184 How he went from trusted ally of Alexios to a monastic life‚Äîlikely an enforced change‚Äîhas not been documented. Shukurov believes this silence was intentional and therefore significant, that David somehow disgraced himself and was confined to Vatopedi by Alexios.Shukurov \\"The Enigma\\", pp. 129f A clue to his offence may be that at one point, faced with another attack from Theodore Laskaris with insufficient men to draw on, David had become a vassal of the enemy of the Byzantine successor realms, the Latin Empire, since, as William Miller explains, \\"It was his interest to prefer a nominal Latin suzerainty to annexation by the Nicene Emperor\\".Miller, Trebizond, p. 17 Kur≈°anskis suggests that Alexios also intrigued in the internal politics of the Seljuk Sultanate, supporting Kaykaus' brother Kayqubad against him. This is his interpretation of a puzzling passage in the account of Ibn Bibi, where he states that Sultan Kaykawus was at Sivas when messengers arrived with the report that Alexis had crossed the border and seized territory belonging to the Sultan‚Äîwhen there was no point to this action. If Kur≈°anskis' has correctly interpreted what lies behind this passage, this would provide Kaykaus with an even stronger reason to ally with Theodore. Kaykaus' role in this alliance was to capture Sinope, the most important port on the Black Sea, and controlling it would once again open the sea to the Seljuks. It was while besieging the port city that Alexios was captured in a skirmish; according to Ibn Bibi, he was hunting outside the city with an escort of 500 cavalry, which Kur≈°anskis dryly observes was overkill for a simple hunt. This fortunate incident provided Kaykaus with the leverage he needed to take the city, which lies on an isthmus and protected by formidable walls.Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", p. 113 Alexios was shown to the defenders of the city. At the Sultan's command, Ibn Bibi writes, he sent a confidante into the city to negotiate a surrender; the inhabitants told Alexios' man, \\"Suppose Alexius has been captured. None the less he has grown sons in Trebizond who are capable of governing. We will elect one of them as our ruler and will not surrender the country to the Turks.\\"Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 27 Shukurov suggests that the Sinopians' lack of concern for Alexios was out of spite for the deposition of his brother.Shukurov, \\"The Enigma\\", p. 131 Infuriated by their response, Sultan Kaykaus had the unfortunate Alexios tortured in sight of the city walls several times, until the defenders changed their minds. Negotiations began, and on 1 November 1214 the inhabitants surrendered their city to the Seljuks on terms. Alexios was freed, and after pledging his loyalty to the Sultan, and promising to pay tribute, he was allowed to return to Trebizond.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 27f; Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", p. 113  Later years  The loss of Sinope pushed the western frontier of Komnenine territories, which had been at Heraclea a few years earlier, back to the Iris and Thermodon rivers, only from their base at Trebizond. This loss isolated Trebizond from direct contact with the Empire of Nicaea and the other Greek lands.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", p. 26 Cut off from the rest of the Byzantine world, the Trapezuntine rulers for the next two generations turned their immediate attention to Asian affairs.Miller, Trebizond, p. 19. See Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", pp. 109‚Äì124 for a more thorough discussion of this period. Nothing certain is known of the remainder of Alexios' life. Vasiliev has suggested that when George IV Lasha of Georgia was campaigning near the Kura River, Alexios was amongst the \\"tributaries [who] arrived from Khlar and Greece with presents\\", in the phrasing of the Georgian chronicles. He identifies \\"Khlar\\" with Ahlat near Lake Van, and states that by \\"Greece\\" the chronicler meant the Trapezuntine Empire.Vasiliev, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 29f Kur≈°anskis, however, is not convinced by Vasiliev's arguments, pointing out that Alexios would have travelled too far from Trebizond to pay homage and emphasizes that Trebizond was always referred to in the Georgian Chronicle as \\"Pontus\\" and never as \\"Greece\\".Kur≈°anskis, \\"Tr√©bizonde et les Turcs\\", pp. 245‚Äì7 Alexios died at the age of forty on 1 February 1222 after a reign of eighteen years. His eldest son John was passed over in favor of his son-in-law, Andronikos I Gidos. Family and succession Alexios married at some point in his life, but contemporary writers fail to record any information about his wife. Theodora Axuchina is supposed by some to have been her name, which appears in the Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke. It has since found its place in several modern genealogies. Michel Kur≈°ankis has argued, on the strength of John I Axouchos‚Äôs surname and Alexios I‚Äôs known political affiliations, that he had married, probably about 1201, a daughter of John Komnenos \\"the Fat\\" (d.1200), son of the protostrator Alexios Axouch.Kur≈°ankis, \\"Autour des sources Georgiennes de la fondation de l‚Äôempire de Trebizonde\\", Archeion Pontou, 30 (1970), 107‚Äì115; cited in Kelsey Jackson Williams, \\"A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond\\", Foundations, 2 (2006), pp. 173f Alexios is known to have had two sons, the future emperors John I and Manuel I, and a daughter who married Andronikos Gidos. The Russian Byzantinist Rustam Shukurov has argued that Alexios had at least one more son, and speculated that one may have been the Ioannikios who was tonsured and confined to a monastery when Manuel became emperor.Shukurov, \\"The Enigma\\", pp. 131f Notes External links  * Alexios I Grand Komnenos, Vougiouklaki Penelope, Encyclopedia of the Hellenic World: Asia Minor Category:13th-century emperors of Trebizond Category:Grand Komnenos dynasty Category:1180s births Category:1222 deaths Category:Eastern Orthodox monarchs Category:Byzantine people of the Byzantine‚ÄìSeljuq Wars Category:Greek torture victims Category:Independence activists ","title":"Alexios I of Trebizond"},{"id":"1870447","text":"Billie Frank or Billy Frank may refer to: *Billie Frank (Rude Awakening), fictional character from the TV series Rude Awakening, played by Sherilyn Fenn *Billie Frank, fictional character from the film Glitter, played by Mariah Carey *Billy Frank, Jr., tribal fishing rights activist *Billy Frank, Sr. (Nisqually, 1880‚Äì1980), father of Billy Frank, Jr., original owner of Frank's Landing *Billy Frank (cricketer), South African cricketer *Billy Frank, childhood name of Billy Graham See also *William Frank (disambiguation) ","title":"Billie Frank"},{"id":"1870449","title":"Ben Wallace (politician)"},{"id":"1870457","text":"The Argus Corporation was an investment holding company based in Toronto, Ontario. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was the most powerful and best known conglomerate in Canada, at one time controlling the companies making up 10 percent of all shares traded daily on the Toronto Stock Exchange. At its height in the 1970s, it was a true conglomerate with many unrelated businesses. Among these were Dominion grocery stores, Orange Crush soft drinks, Massey-Ferguson farm machinery, Domtar wood products and Carling O'Keefe breweries. The company was purchased by Conrad Black in 1978. Black and his associates sold off most of the Argus assets by 1985, and by 2005 Argus contained only one asset and was itself wholly owned by Black's Ravelston Corporation. Due to the fallout of ongoing lawsuits, Ravelston went bankrupt in 2008, and Argus disappeared.  History  Argus was founded as an investment holding company in 1945 by E. P. Taylor with minority partners Colonel W. Eric Phillips, Wallace McCutcheon, Bud McDougald, and other less influential investors. The company was formed through Taylor's brewery empire, Canadian Breweries Limited, which was later known as Carling O'Keefe, and which Argus took control over. Argus was also set up with the support of the American Atlas Corporation, itself a holding company. In 1958, Argus moved its headquarters to the prestigious location of 10 Toronto Street, where it stayed until its demise.  Rise  Argus was once one of Canada's most powerful conglomerates. By 1964, 10 percent of all shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange were controlled by Argus. In 1969, E.P. Taylor appointed McDougald to run operations. In the 1970s, it controlled large companies including Canadian Breweries Limited, Dominion Stores, Hollinger Mines, Crown Trust, Domtar, Standard Broadcasting and Massey-Ferguson, as well as at some point or other having control or significant shareholdings in other Canadian companies such as Dominion Malting Co., Orange Crush Ltd., British Columbia Forest Products Limited and the St. Lawrence Corporation, a wood pulp processor. The company's importance was so great that when Paul Desmarais of the Power Corporation of Canada attempted, but later failed, to acquire Argus, the federal government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau responded by creating the Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration in 1975, which is held to be a token of the influence of the Desmarais clan over the affairs of the nation.  Conrad Black  Shortly after the death of McDougald in 1978, his widow and her sister sold their shares to Conrad Black while the widows were under the influence of what The Globe and Mail called \\"slow-witted advisers\\". The transaction led to a high-profile falling out between the families. The move gave Black effective voting control and he became president of the corporation. The move also was financially lucrative for Black - his net worth grew to an estimated $50 million in 1978. Black and his associates sold off most of the assets by 1985, and used the money to invest in media properties. In 2005, Argus's only asset was the Toronto-based holding company Hollinger Inc. Argus itself was 100 percent controlled by Ravelston Corporation‚Äîitself a holding company controlled until 2005 by Black and his long-time associate David Radler. The company went into receivership along with Ravelston in 2005 due to the legal troubles of its chairman, and eventually went bankrupt in 2008 while Black was in prison.  Notable assets  A list of assets once owned by Argus included: * Canadian Breweries Limited - renamed Carling O'Keefe; sold to Elders Limited and merged within Molsons; now Molson Coors Brewing Company * Dominion Stores - sold to A&P; and now renamed Metro when A&P; Canadian operations were sold to Metro Inc. * Hollinger Mines - renamed Hollinger Argus Limited in 1978 and again as Hollinger Inc.

Though the bishop is subject to the Roman Pontiff, he is not the vicar of the latter: he governs it in his own name. The diocese takes its name from the see city, the metropolitan area where the bishop resides. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong is a de jure suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Guangzhou (Canton).Apostolic Constitution of 11 April 1946, A.A.S. 1946, 301-313. However, in practice it is an immediate subject of the Holy See. Also in theory, not only Hong Kong, but also a small part of Guangdong province belongs to the diocese. In practice, however, the diocese only comprises the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. There were about 384,000 local Catholics as of August 2015, and 160,000 Filipino Catholics in Hong Kong. They are served by 223 priests, 26 deacons, 68 brothers and 474 sisters. There are 51 parishes, comprising 40 churches, 31 chapels and 26 halls for religious purposes includung the celebration of the liturgy. As for education, in 2017 there are 251 Catholic schools and kindergartens, having a total of over 150,000 pupils.  History  The organisation of what would become the Diocese of Hong Kong began immediately after the establishment of Hong Kong as a British colony.  Prefecture Apostolic  In 1841 Pope Gregory XVI created a Prefecture Apostolic comprising \\"Hong Kong with the surrounding six leagues\\" independent from the Diocese of Macau, but under the authority of the Bishop of Macau. The initial need for the establishment of the prefecture was the spiritual care of the British (Irish Catholic) soldiers stationed in the newly established colony. Theodore Joset, a Swiss diocesan priest, became the first Prefect Apostolic. The prefecture functioned much as a mission, but was intended from its inception to become a diocese. In the first ten years, the missionaries built churches, schools, a seminary, and institutions for the sick, elderly, and orphans. Following Joset's death in 1842, Anthony Feliciani became Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong. The foundation stone of the first church was laid in 1842. It was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in 1843, enlarged in 1858‚Äì59, burnt down on 18 October 1859, rebuilt and blessed on 18 March 1860. In 1858, the first missionaries, members of the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now PIME) arrived; they were designated to take over the administration of the mission in time. By 1860, the physical territory had spread well beyond the initial six leagues surrounding Hong Kong to include the San On District (), the Kowloon Peninsula, Sai Kung Peninsula, and Nam Tau.  Vicariate Apostolic  In 1874 the Hong Kong Prefecture was raised to a Vicariate Apostolic and entrusted to the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now PIME). While the prefecture had been run by missionary priests, a vicariate was the intermediary step before becoming a diocese, and required a bishop to run it. Since the territory was not yet a diocese, the bishops were called \\"titular bishop\\" of another place (where they had no ecclesiastical authority). The bishops were under the direct authority of the Pope, exercising their power in his name, rather than being vested with the office belonging to a diocese. The first Vicar Apostolic was Bishop Giovanni Timoleon Raimondi (consecrated 22 November 1874), who died at Mission House, Glenealy, Hong Kong, on 27 September 1894. He was succeeded by Bishops Louis Piazzoli (born 1849) and Dominic Pozzoni (born 1851) elected 26 May 1905. In 1880, the vicariate hosted the first synod of the fifth ecclesiastical region of the Catholic Church in China; it hosted a second synod in 1891, and a third in 1909. In 1883, the foundation stone of a new cathedral was laid. This is the present Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was built in 1888 and consecrated in 1938. The vicariate continued to grow. In 1913 it included 12 European and 10 native priests and 14,195 Christians; there were 26 churches, 5 of them with resident priests; 40 schools for boys and 29 schools for girls; 12 Brothers of the Christian Schools; 35 Sisters of Canossa; 22 Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres; and 54 native Sisters. Besides Hong Kong Island, the vicariate included Lantau Island, its adjacent islands and the three continental districts of San-on (), Kwei-shing (), and Ha√Ø-fung (). Churches with resident priests were the cathedral (Glenealy), St. Joseph's (Garden Road), St. Francis (Wan Chai), Church of the Sacred Heart (West Point), Church of St. Anthony (West Point). The Soci√©t√© des Missions Etrang√®res de Paris had a procurator, a sanitorium (B√©thanie) and a printing office (Nazareth) at Hong Kong; there was also a Dominican procurator. More missionaries arrived from many orders throughout the 1920s and 1930s, building more churches, schools, and hospitals. During World War II, the Japanese occupation stopped almost all activities. Missionaries evacuated, and were variously interned, released, and expelled. After the war, reconstruction began immediately.  Diocese  On 11 April 1946 Pope Pius XII established the episcopal hierarchy in China, raising all the apostolic vicariates to dioceses, Hong Kong among them. Since then, the Hong Kong Diocese is directly responsible to the pope. Enrico Valtorta became the first bishop of Hong Kong. In 1949 refugees fleeing the Chinese communist regime began to pour into Hong Kong, including many Catholics and clergymen from all over China; diocesan activities were effectively restricted to the boundaries of the Colony. In 1952, the diocese opened seven new chapels for refugees. In 1969 Bishop Francis Hsu became, after the resignation of Lorenzo Bianchi, the first ethnically Chinese bishop of Hong Kong. On 29 May 1988 John Baptist Wu, the fifth bishop, was named a member of the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. He was the first cardinal from the Hong Kong diocese. On 18 August 1991, an Open Forum on \\"Elections 1991\\", jointly organized by the Council of Priests, the Justice and Peace Commission, the Central Council of Catholic Laity and the Catholic Institute for Religion and Society, was held in the nine constituencies of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories in order to encourage the faithful to take an active part in the direct elections to the Legislative Council on 15 September. Church organisations also made a similar appeal to the faithful and ordinary citizens through publications, questionnaires and advertisements in newspapers. On 15 April 1993 the diocese was re-divided into nine deaneries. The Council of Priests was reorganised with all the deans included as ex officio members. After the death of Cardinal Wu on 23 September 2002, his coadjutor Joseph Zen Ze-kiun became the 6th bishop of Hong Kong. On 8 July 2004 the Legislative Council passed the Education (Amendment) Bill. Under the New Ordinance, which would be effective on 1 January 2005, every aided school would be required before 2010 to form an incorporated management committee (IMC) whose members should include elected representatives of teachers, parents of students and alumni, as well as other independent persons, with a view to promoting a school-based management. It was the concern of the Church that, as a sponsoring body, she would no longer be empowered in the future to supervise the schools under her sponsorship, nor be able to achieve her goals and objectives in Catholic education. On 5 June 2005, Bishop Zen announced that, if the Legislative Council passed the donation to support schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. After the Government decided to give up some of its main objectives and the Diocese subsequently decided to support the motion. On 22 February 2006. Pope Benedict XVI announced that Bishop Joseph Zen would be raised to the College of Cardinals. He was made a cardinal at a consistory held on 24 March. Zen was an outspoken supporter of democracy and a staunch critic of the People's Republic of China. His views on government policies were often at odds with those of Hong Kong's former Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, who is also a Catholic. On 15 April 2009. Pope Benedict XVI appoints Bishop John Tong Hon as the 7th Bishop of the Diocese of Hong Kong after the resignation of Cardinal Joseph Zen. Bishop John Tong was named a member of the College of Cardinals on 19 February 2012. On 1 August 2017. Pope Francis accept the resignation of Cardinal John Tong. Coadjutor Bishop Michael Yeung Ming Cheung was appointed as the 8th Bishop of the Diocese of Hong Kong, until his death on 3 January 2019. After few days of Bishop Michael Yeung's death. Pope Francis appoints Cardinal John Tong as the Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong Diocese.

Battle of Alarcos (July 18, 1195),Britannica.com was a battle between the Almohads led by Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur and King Alfonso VIII of Castile.Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia, 42. It resulted in the defeat of the Castilian forces and their subsequent retreat to Toledo, whereas the Almohads reconquered Trujillo, Mont√°nchez, and Talavera. Background In 1189 the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur returned from Marrakesh to fight the Portuguese who, with the help of a Christian alliance, had taken over Silves. He successfully recaptured the city and went back to his capital. An armistice between the Almohads and the Christian kings of Castile and Le√≥n ensued. At the expiration of the truce, and having received news that Yaqub was gravely ill in Marrakesh and that his brother Abu Yahya, the governor of Al-Andalus, had crossed the Mediterranean to declare himself king and take over Marrakesh, Alfonso VIII of Castile decided to attack the region of Seville in 1194. A strong host under the archbishop of Toledo (Mart√≠n L√≥pez de Pisuerga), which included the military Order of Calatrava, ransacked the province. Having successfully crushed his brother's ambitions, Yaqub al-Mansur was left with no choice other than to lead an expedition against the Christians, who were now threatening the northern province of his empire.Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi \\"Al- Mojib fi Talkhis Akhbar al-Maghrib\\" [The Pleasant In Summarizing the History of the Maghreb\\" (1224), pp.136-137 On the first day of June, 1195, he landed at Tarifa. Passing through the province of Seville, the main Almohad army reached Cordova on June 30, reinforced by the few troops raised by the local governors and by a Christian cavalry contingent under Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro, who held a personal feud against the Castilian king. On July 4 Ya'qub moved out of Cordova; his army crossed the pass of Muradal (Despe√±aperros) and advanced through the plain of Salvatierra. A cavalry detachment of the Order of Calatrava, plus some knights from nearby castles, tried to gather news about the Almohad strength and its heading; they were surrounded by Muslim scouts and almost exterminated, but managed to supply information to the Castilian king. Alfonso gathered his forces at Toledo and marched down to Alarcos (al-Arak, in Arabic), near the Guadiana River, a place which marked the Southern limit of his kingdom and where a fortress was under construction. He intended on barring the access to the rich Tagus valley, and did not wait for the reinforcements the Kings Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and Sancho VII of Navarre were sending. When on July 16 the Almohad host came in view, Yaqub al-Mansur did not accept battle on this day or the day after, preferring to give rest to his forces; but early the day after that, Wednesday, July 18, the Almohad army formed for battle around a small hill called La Cabeza, two bow-shots from Alarcos. Battle Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur gave to his vizier, Abu Yahya ibn Abi Hafs, command of a very strong vanguard: on the first line the Bani Marin volunteers under Abu Jalil Mahyu ibn Abi Bakr, with a big body of archers and the Zenata Tribe; behind them, on the hill itself, the vizier with the Amir's banner and his personal guard, from the Hintata tribe; to the left the Arab host under Yarmun ibn Riyah; and to the right, the al-Andalus forces under the popular Caid Ibn Sanadid. Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur himself held command of the rearguard, which comprised the best Almohad forces commanded by Yabir ibn Yusuf, Abd al-Qawi, Tayliyun, Muhammad ibn Munqafad, and Abu Jazir Yajluf al- Awrabi and the black guard (of black Africans). It was a formidable army, whose strength Alfonso had badly underestimated. The Castilian king put most of his heavy cavalry in a compact body, about 8,000 strong, and gave its command to Diego L√≥pez de Haro, lord of Vizcaya. The king himself would follow with the infantry and the Military Orders. The Christian cavalry charge was somewhat disordered. The knights crashed against the Zanatas and Bani Marin and dispersed them; lured by the Amir's standard, they charged uphill: Vizier Abu Yahya was killed,A·∏•mad ibn Mu·∏•ammad Maqqarƒ´, Ibn al-Kha·π≠ƒ´b, The history of the Mohammedan dynasties in Spain, (Johnson Reprint Corporation, 1843), lxv. and the Hintata fell almost to a man trying to protect themselves. Most of the knights turned to their left and after a fierce struggle they routed the al- Andalus forces of Ibn Sanadid. Three hours had passed; just afternoon, in the intense heat, the fatigue and the missiles which kept falling on them took their toll of armoured knights. The Arab right under Yarmun had been enveloping the Castilian flank and rear; at this point the best of the Almohad forces attacked, with the sultan himself clearly visible in the front ranks; and finally the knights were almost completely surrounded. Alfonso advanced with all his remaining forces into the melee, only to find himself assaulted from all sides and under a rain of arrows. For some time he fought hand-to- hand, until removed from the action, almost by force, by his bodyguard; they fled towards Toledo. The Castilian infantry was destroyed, together with most of the Orders which had supported them; the Lord of Vizcaya tried to force his way through the ring of enemy forces, but finally had to seek refuge in the unfinished fortress of Alarcos with just a fraction of his knights. The castle was surrounded with some 3,000 people trapped inside, half of them women and children. The king's enemy, Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro, who had taken little part in the action, was sent by the Amir to negotiate the surrender; L√≥pez de Haro and the survivors were allowed to go, leaving 12 knights as hostages for the payment of a great ransom. The Castilian field army had been destroyed. Those killed included three bishops (from Avila, Segovia, and Siguenza); Count Ordo√±o Garc√≠a de Roda and his brothers; Counts Pedro Ruiz de Guzm√°n and Rodrigo S√°nchez; the Masters of the Order of Santiago, Sancho Fern√°ndez de Lemus, and of the Portuguese Order of √âvora, Gon√ßalo Viegas. Losses for the Muslims included the death of the vizier and Abi Bakr, commander of the Bani Marin volunteers, who died of his wounds in the following year. Aftermath The outcome of the battle shook the stability of the Kingdom of Castile for several years. All nearby castles surrendered or were abandoned: Malag√≥n, Benavente, Calatrava,King, Georgiana Goddard, A brief account of the military orders in Spain, (The Hispanic Society of America, 1921), 26. Caracuel, and Torre de Guadalferza, and the way to Toledo was wide open. However, Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur moved back to Seville to make good his own considerable losses; there he took the title of al-Mansur Billah ('The one victorious by God'). For the next two years, al-Mansur's forces devastated Extremadura, the Tagus valley, La Mancha and even the area around Toledo; they moved in turn against Mont√°nchez, Trujillo, Plasencia, Talavera, Escalona and Maqueda. Some of these expeditions were led by the renegade Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro. Most significantly, however, these raids did not lead to any territorial gains for the caliph, although Almohad diplomacy did obtain an alliance with King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n (who had been enraged when the Castilian king had not waited for him before the battle of Alarcos) and the neutrality of Navarre. These alliances proved to be temporary only. But the caliph was losing interest in the affairs of the Iberian Peninsula; he was in poor health, his objective of retaining a hold over al-Andalus appeared to be a complete success, and in 1198 he returned to Africa. He died in February 1199. However, the success of the battle proved to be short-lived. When the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir attempted to build on it 16 years later with a new Iberian offensive, he was crushingly defeated in the more decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. This battle was to mark a turning-point that led to the end of Moorish rule in the Iberian Peninsula. The Almohad Empire itself collapsed a few years later.

Different common names are used in different contexts, with jute applying to the fiber produced from the plant, and jute mallow leaves for the leaves used as a vegetable. Description The plants are tall, usually annual herbs, reaching a height of 2‚Äì4 m, unbranched or with only a few side branches. The leaves are alternate, simple, lanceolate, 5‚Äì15 cm long, with an acuminate tip and a finely serrated or lobed margin. The flowers are small (2‚Äì3 cm diameter) and yellow, with five petals; the fruit is a many-seeded capsule. Taxonomy The genus Corchorus is classified under the subfamily Grewioideae of the family Malvaceae. It contains around 40 to 100 species. The genus Oceanopapaver, previously of uncertain placement, has recently been synonymized under Corchorus. The name was established by Guillaumin in 1932 for the single species Oceanopapaver neocaledonicum Guillaumin from New Caledonia. The genus has been classified in a number of different families including Capparaceae, Cistaceae, Papaveraceae, and Tiliaceae. The putative family name \\"Oceanopapaveraceae\\" has occasionally appeared in print and on the web but is a nomen nudum and has never been validly published nor recognised by any system of plant taxonomy.B.

Uses=Fiber The fibers from Corchorus (known as jute) are the most widely cultivated vegetable fiber after cotton. Food Bai po, the blanched leaves of Corchorus olitorius. Corchorus aestuans in Hyderabad, India. Corchorus leaves are consumed in the cuisines of various countries. Corchorus olitorius is used mainly in the cuisines of southern Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and West Africa, Corchorus capsularis in Japan and China. It has a mucilaginous (somewhat \\"slimy\\") texture, similar to okra, when cooked. The seeds are used as a flavouring, and a herbal tea is made from the dried leaves. The leaves of Corchorus are rich in betacarotene, iron, calcium, and vitamin C. The plant has an antioxidant activity with a significant Œ±-tocopherol equivalent vitamin E. In North Africa and the Middle East, the young leaves of Corchorus species are known in Arabic as malukhiyah and are used as green leafy vegetables . Malukhiyah is eaten widely in Egypt and some consider it the Egyptian national dish. It is featured in cuisines from Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia. In Turkey and Cyprus, the plant is known as molohiya or molocha and is usually cooked into a kind of chicken stew. The leaves of Corchorus have been a staple Egyptian food since the time of the Pharaohs and it is from there that it gains its recognition and popularity. Varieties of mallow-leaves stew with rice is a well known Middle Eastern cuisine. In Nigerian cuisine, especially amongst the Yorubas, it is commonly used in a stew known as ewedu, a condiment to other starch-based foods such as amala or added with gbegiri a local nigeria soup.

He was the Vicar Capitular of that diocese from 23 July 1974 to 25 July 1975. After that, he remained as the vicar general until 1992. As a former Vicar Capitular and Vicar General, he is entitled to be styled as \\"The Right Reverend\\". Biography Lam was among 200 guests from Hong Kong to be invited by the Chinese government for the 35th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in 1984. Thus, he reportedly became the first Catholic official from Hong Kong to be invited by to mainland China since the establishment of the PRC in 1949. The invitation was originally intended to be for Cardinal John Baptist Wu, the bishop of Hong Kong, but due to his prior commitments in Europe, the diocese recommended Lam as the alternative. Lam served as sole vicar general from 1975 onwards, and alongside John Baptist Tsang starting in 1985. Both Lam and Tsang ceased to be vicars general in 1992, when they were assigned to the newly-formed positions of Episcopal Vicar for Religious and Episcopal Vicar for Social Services, respectively. They were succeeded by Dominic Chan and John Tong Hon.

It is their first official release, and originally appeared alongside Overdose's S√©culo XX as a split album. The EP's songs were later released as bonus tracks on the CD version of Morbid Visions. Production values Because of Sepultura's collective lack of money, most of the instruments used on Bestial Devastation were borrowed from friends and acquaintances.Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 31. The vocals on the introductory track \\"The Curse\\" were performed by a friend of the band; according to Igor Cavalera: The band apparently fought with the producer during the recording. In an interview, Igor Cavalera said, \\"He wanted to clean everything up in the mix and we finally had to play him some records by Venom to show him that bands sounded this way.\\"As above. Overview Months prior to recording what would eventually become the Bestial Devastation EP, the band decided to switch their lyrics from Portuguese to English. None of the band members knew how to write or speak the language, so they asked their friend Lino to translate their lyrics. An example of Lino's crude translation skills can be seen in one of the verses of the song \\"Antichrist\\": Reception Bestial Devastation was released in December 1985, alongside Overdose's S√©culo XX EP.Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 32. Over the next few months it sold 8,000 copies.Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 34. Sepultura's surprising success was partly attributed to the first Rock in Rio, which took place in Rio de Janeiro in January 1985. This music festival's line-up included Whitesnake, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Queen, Ozzy Osbourne and the Scorpions, and was responsible for Brazil's hard rock/heavy metal boom.Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 25. The EP was later reissued by Roadrunner Records on one CD with Morbid Visions in 1997. The reissue included a demo version of the song \\"Necromancer\\" that was the first studio recording of the band, and a live version of \\"Antichrist\\" from the Chaos A.D. tour, re-written as \\"Anticop\\".

After having the understanding by the show's organisers that it was an evangelical concert, he sang only two of his own songs and decided to spread Christianity for the rest of his concert, sparking fury in many fans young and old who was not informed that it was an evangelical event. The concert organisers later offered refunds. From July to August 2014, 12 of his classic hits were featured in the musical Innamorati, directed by Goh Boon Teck and written by Jiang Daini, sung by various Singapore Mandopop singers. Moo most recently performed at the xinyao-themed Tomorrow 32 series of concerts in August 2014, The Songs We Sang showcase in the same year and Eric Moo in Concert in November 2014, which was dedicated to xinyao.

The neighbourhood is bounded by Lake Fures√∏ to the west, Holte in Rudersdal Municipality to the north, Brede to the east and Kongens Lyngby and Sorgenfri to the south. Virum station is located on the Hiller√∏d radial of the S-train network and is served by the Btrains. Virum is known for its religious society. History=Early history Virum (Wyrum) seen on a map from 1780 The village of Virum is first mentioned in a papal letter from 1186 but is no doubt considerably older. The name \\"an open place which is easy to defend\\" ( vigi: \\"easily defendable place\\" and -rum: open place). In the letter, Pope Clement III gives the Virum as well as many other villages in the area tio to Bishop Absalon. Absalon soon ceded the villages to the Bishopric of Roskilde. The Bishop of Roskilde constructed the small castle Hjortholm at the site in circa 1250. The castle was destroyed during the Count's Feud in 1535. Frederick III took over the estate in 1668. He renamed it Frederiksdal and constructed a small hunting lodge at the site. The old village The village of Virum was located where Virumgade is today. It belonged to the parish of Lyngby. The land was divided into three areas called \\"Geelsvang\\", \\"Mellemvang\\" and \\"H√∏ftevang\\" which were subdivided into fields and crops were rotated in accordance with the three-field system. The marchy land down towards Fures√∏en was grazed by livestock. In 1682, it consisted of 13 farms, three houses with land and 14 houses without land. The modern suburb Virum Torv The modern suburb was planned in connection with the conversion of the North Line into an S-train line. Virum station opened in 1936. The ambition was to create a healthy, well-functioning suburb with a population the size of a medium large Danish provincial town. The centre of the new suburb was Virum Torv, a mixed-use development centred on a roundabout next to the station. It contained retail space, service functions and apartments. Its northeastern corner was completed in 1939, its southeastern corner in 1943 and its southwestern corner less than a year later. A cinema, Virum Bio, was from the beginning located in the building on the southeastern corner. The same building also contained an Irma supermarket. Landmarks Frederiksdal Castle is located in Virum. Its main building was built from 1744‚Äì45 and was used as a summer residence for Foreign Affairs, Privy Councilor Johan Sigismund Schulin. The Schulin Family still owns the estate.http://www.frederiksdalslot.dk/frederiksdalslot.htm Transport Virum station is located on the Hiller√∏d radial of the S-train network and is served by the Btrains. Brede Station in the eastern outskirts of Virum is served by the Lokaltog service on the N√¶rum Line between J√¶gersborg in the south and N√¶rum to the north. Virum Church is from 1937 and was designed by Niels Skrivers. Virum Gymnasium is from 1957.

He supported the plan for W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's acceptance of the Czech crown from the Hussites. He supported pro-Hussite military expeditions of Sigismund Korybut to Bohemia in the years 1422-1427.http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/41057,,,,spytek_z_melsztyna,haslo.html After Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's death in 1434 he was the leader of the opposition against the political influences of Bishop of Krak√≥w, Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki during the early years of the reign of young King W≈Çadys≈Çaw III. Spytek's opposition to Ole≈õnicki was less personal and more an expression of sympathy with Czech Hussitism, and of opposition to the wealth and influence of the Catholic Church in Poland. During Church synods of Warka (1434), Sieradz and Piotrkow (1435) he spoke in favor of the abolishing of the Peter's Pence in Poland. In 1439 he organized the Korczyn Confederation (also known as \\"Confederation of Spytko of Melsztyn\\") against Ole≈õnicki. This was a reaction to Ole≈õnicki 's formation of an earlier anti-Hussite confederation there. His actions were condemned by the royal court, and he lost much support. Following a military escalation of the conflict, he died in the Battle of Grotniki on 4 May 1439. Spytek's defeat meant also the defeat of the Hussite cause in Poland. His legacy lay in King W≈Çadys≈Çaw's realization that the lesser nobility could be played off against the power of the great magnates and that the Catholic Church could be reigned in.

It uses the same AGI game engine as King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown and features King Graham as the player character. The title is a spoof of the 1984 film Romancing the Stone. Gameplay King's Quest II resembles King's Quest I in appearance and interface. Like in King's Quest I, the game world has 'wrap around' allowing player to travel infinitely in the directions of the north or south. (The King's Quest Companion which represented a novelized walkthrough explains that the western side of Kolyma folds back upon itself to both the north and south, forever bringing travelers back to where they started.) This was the first King's Quest to include an introduction cutscene, just past the credits. It also is the first game in the series with a linear story progression. The world actually changes as the story progresses,King's Quest II hint book, pp. 7, 15. new characters appear in the world, areas are opened up to the player, and closed off when no longer needed. Puzzles involve trading these or using these items to receive new items or to get past obstacles, allowing the player to progress. The game in general honors non- violent solutions, offering more points for them. Many puzzles have more than one solution, but only one optimum solution to earn maximum points. Alternate solutions will net less points or in some cases cause the player to lose points. Examples of alternate solutions are taking more violent approach to getting past an obstacle such as killing or stealing. Some choices may lead to dead ends or death. All puzzles in the game are solved through a parser. The player may type a phrase with a verb and noun, for example 'Look at' or 'Pick up', the word list in the parser is fairly robust and understands quite a lot of non-important verbs which will result in unexpected replies. For example, the player could type, 'dig', or 'dig the beach' and receive messages about how pointless it is to be digging. Sometimes even illogical verb/noun combinations will net unique comments, such as typing 'Pick up horse' will mention that the flying steed is too fast to catch. With this system the player is able to collect many items using 'pick up' placed into the games inventory. The items in the inventory have close up pictures giving an idea what the item looks like, or in some cases offering clues about the item. In a rare few examples an item may be manipulated in some way. Plot Having killed the evil Dahlia and retrieved the three stolen treasures of Daventry, Sir Graham became the new king of Daventry. The mirror shows him a vision about a beautiful young woman, Valanice, in captivity on the top of an ivory crystal tower. Being charmed by her, King Graham travels to the world of Kolyma to rescue Valanice. There he must travel through sea, air, and even death to gain the keys that unlock the three doors to the enchanted island where the witch Hagatha has imprisoned Valanice. After meeting legendary figures such as Neptune, Little Red Riding Hood and Count Dracula, the latter of whom he kills, Graham rescues Valanice. At the end of the game, they are married in a ceremony attended by many of Graham's friends and several of his former enemies. Development Limited floppy space would have restricted the design, but Sierra On-Line had been compressing the pictures by drawing them as lines and fill colors for a while. The original version for PC DOS/PCjr does not support sound cards or mice, as they did not exist at the time of publication.King's Quest Collection 2 manual, p. 4. That scheme was kept all the way up to King's Quest IV. This sequel to the original King's Quest provided not just a second look at the life of King (formerly Sir) Graham of Daventry, it also began a tradition of using King's Quest as a training ground for future designers. Future Space Quest series designers Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe joined the development team. They helped to make the game an even bigger hit than the original.King's Quest VIII manual, p. 3. According to the series; main designer and writer, Roberta Williams, King's Quest II contains 14 musical selections, including Tchaikovsky's love theme from Romeo and Juliet.The Royal Scribe, King's Quest Collection, 15th Anniversary Edition. Other tracks include Greensleeves on the title screen, Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor in Dracula's castle, and Michael Jackson's Thriller when encountering the ghosts outside the castle entrance (only the opening bars of the last are played so Sierra would not have to pay royalties for using the song). The music for the game was produced by Al Lowe, who was an accomplished jazz musician. Release The game was first released in 1985 on a self- booting disk that supported CGA, PCjr, and Tandy graphic cards (as opposed to King's Quest I, which had separate versions for all three) in 1985 as a disk that booted on start-up. Sierra included several modifications to the AGI engine for compatibility with the IBM AT and EGA cards, which had been introduced since King's Quest I was released. The copy protection used on King's Quest I proved to be incompatible with the AT BIOS, so a different scheme was used. Color palette selection in CGA mode was changed to utilize the BIOS instead of modifying the palette register directly. The game engine was also changed to utilize the PC's timer chip instead of a CPU-based speed loop which would result in the game running too fast on the AT. It was rereleased in 1987 with EGA and Hercules support to run under DOS. It was also released on Apple IIGS version with improved soundtrack and sound effects. Sierra's hint book for the game was written by Al Lowe, the game's composer and the creator of the Leisure Suit Larry series. The manual contains a prologue short story by Annette Childs. The story covers Graham being told by the spirit of the former King Edward in the magic mirror that he must find a wife, or suffer the same fate of the kingdom as he had. Graham calls upon his prime minister Gerwain to prepare a great feast, and call all the maidens and ladies throughout the land. None of the ladies interest the king, and he is left solemn. The magic mirror activates telling him about young maiden Valanice trapped in a tower by the evil witch Hagatha. He is told he must travel to land of Kolyma to find the magic doorway that leads to the enchanted realm. A novelization of the game is included in The King's Quest Companion which expands the details of story. It was written from the perspective of Daventry's prime minister, Gerwain (mentioned in the KQ2 manual). The first and second editions of the Companion also included articles within An Encyclopedia of Daventry (Abridged), which gave backstories for various characters and locations from the game. More back history about Kolyma can be found in the chapter, \\"The World of Daventry\\" in all editions. Version history: *1.0W: AGI1 version *1.1H: AGI1 version (1985): A PCjr/Tandy/PC version of the game. *2.1 (04-10-1987): This is the version that is included in most copies of the King's Quest Collection. It has the disk-based copy protection removed. Uses AGI2. *2.2 (05-07-1987): This version is associated with the Amiga release. There are two sub-versions one uses interpreter 2.426 and the other uses 2.917. Uses AGI2. Reception King's Quest received positive reviews upon release, including an almost-perfect score of 39/40 from ASM. Remakes=Sierra remake (cancelled) In 1990 the developers at Sierra redevelop King's Quest with a new interface and up-to-date technology. The plan was to redevelop King's Quest II but due to rather disappointing sales of the 1990 remake of King's Quest I, the prospect of officially remaking and re-releasing King's Quest II was scrapped. Fan remake In 2002, AGD Interactive, then known as Tierra Entertainment, released an unofficial remake of King's Quest II under a fan license by Vivendi, known as King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones. In 2009, AGD Interactive released version 3.0, featuring redrawn backgrounds and dialogue pictures; the voice- acting was also dramatically improved and, thanks to fan feedback, many problems were attended to. The remake uses a point-and-click interface functionally identical to an advanced SCI game engine, VGA graphics and digital sound, including full speech for all characters. Notably for an unofficial, fan-made project, the game's protagonist King Graham is voiced by Josh Mandel, who also voiced the part in Sierra's official CD-ROM full-speech versions of King's Quest V and VI. In contrast to the group's remake of King's Quest I, a content-wise identical presentation upgrade, King's Quest II+ redesigns the original game by adding a rewritten plot expanding on the 1985 version (although it changes several points of the plot, 'Dracula' is now a good guy, and the 'Monk' is a bad guy, several characters removed), a number of puzzles, new characters and locations including a town, and references to the later King's Quest games. King's Quest Chapter 3 The third chapter of 2015's King's Quest, titled Once Upon a Climb, is a reimagined retelling of the rescue of Valanice from Hagatha's tower from King's Quest II.

The game was originally released for the Apple II and PC DOS, and later ported to several other computer systems. It was the first title game in the series not to feature King Graham as the player character.  Gameplay  Most of the game's various lands and locations appear in the magic map. Once the protagonist Gwydion reaches a new region, he can use the magic map to travel to a previous region. A real-time clock is displayed at the top of the screen, with certain actions occurring based on the clock. King's Quest III was markedly more difficult than its two predecessors. The player was required to type in magic spells line-by-line from a spell book that came with the game. The spells partially served as a form of copy protection, although the game already had disk-based protection. Gwydion's movements are controlled by the player using cursor buttons. In the original release version 1.01 (1986-11-08), using the AGI engine, the escape button pauses the game and there are no menus. Commands are accessed through the F keys, \\"Ctrl-\\", or manually typing; F1 displays a Help file listing all the commands. It has disk-based copy protection. The version 2.14 (1988-3-15) was included in many of the King's Quest collections over the years, with the disk based self- booting copy-protection removed. Pushing escape brings up a menu (arrow keys can be used to choose options), and the speed controls are included in the menu.  Plot = Story  In King's Quest III, the story moves away from Daventry and King Graham to the land of Llewdor, where a boy named Gwydion is being kept by the wicked wizard Manannan. According to the introduction, for as long as he could remember, 17-year-old Gwydion has been held captive by Manannan as his servant, cooking and cleaning for him in his home atop a large mountain in Llewdor. From this vantage point, and with the help of a telescope, the seemingly all-knowing wizard watches the countryside, the shoreline and vast ocean to the east and an endless desert to the west. Manannan takes a series of absences and Gwydion seizes his chance to escape. He breaks into the wizard's laboratory and reads Manannan's book of spells, then goes out into Llewdor to collect ingredients for them. After solving many puzzles to obtain the spell ingredients, Gwydion turns Manannan into a cat and is free. He also learns from an oracle that he is in fact the long-lost prince of Daventry, Prince Alexander, and that his sister Princess Rosella is going to be sacrificed to a horrible three-headed dragon that has been besieging the kingdom. After defeating Manannan, Alexander attempts to buy passage on a ship, but is instead captured by pirates. After sailing to the coast of Daventry, he manages to use another spell to put the pirates to sleep and escape, stealing their treasure in the process. Alexander traverses a series of mountains before finally reaching the outskirts of Daventry where he discovers Rosella about to be slain by the dragon. Using one of Manannan's spells, Alexander creates a thunderstorm and kills the dragon with lightning strikes. Alexander rescues his sister and the two return to Daventry where they are joyously reunited with the king and queen. The Magic Mirror, which has been clouded by a mystical darkness since the night Prince Alexander was kidnapped, is restored and King Graham decides to pass on his adventurer's cap to his children. As the game ends, King Graham tosses the cap to Alexander and Rosella who reach out to catch it. The game's title is a pun on the proverb \\"To err is human, to forgive divine\\" by Alexander Pope, whose namesake may have been given to the character Gwydion once it is later revealed who he really is in the game. The actions taken by Gwydion in this story lead directly to the events that begin King's Quest IV.  Characters  * Gwydion: Gwydion was a young lad kidnapped from his cradle not long after his birth by the evil wizard Manannan. The wizard had teleported into his homeland, cast a sleep spell on his family, and brought him to Llewdor as a slave. As he was kidnapped when he was very young, he does not remember his family. As is the tradition, Gwydion was to be killed on his eighteenth birthday; he learns this fact and decides to find a way to escape before that day comes. Using forbidden spells Gwydion learns how to understand animals and meets the Oracle, from whom he learns his true identity as Prince Alexander of Daventry. He learns he must save his sister from a three-headed dragon that is terrorizing Daventry, or lose his family forever. Gwydion finally escapes the evil wizard, crosses the ocean, defeats the dragon, and reunites with his family. Upon his return the magic mirror, which went dark upon his kidnapping, is restored. * Manannan: An old, evil wizard who had the custom of kidnapping infant boys and training them as his servants only to kill them at age eighteen. He is member of the Magicians' Guild. For many years he reigned as the absolute ruler of the land of Llewdor, and under his leadership brigands, thieves and the like prospered. Manannan made a fatal error, however, in the choosing of his final servant, a baby boy whom he named Gwydion (who later was found to actually be Alexander, Prince of Daventry and current king of the Land of the Green Isles). Gwydion was able to escape the clutches of Manannan and, learning several magic spells, turned Manannan into a cat. He had kidnapped the boy in revenge for Graham's rescue of Valanice from his sister Hagatha (King's Quest II). King Graham later encountered Manannan in Mordack's castle and captured him in a sack of peas. After the defeat of his brother Mordack at the hands of King Graham of Daventry, Manannan was never seen or heard from again and his fate remains unknown. Manannan's name is based on a wizard of Welsh myth, Manannan Mac Lir. * Graham: He is the king of Daventry. Following Alexander's kidnapping, Daventry endured terrible hardship in the form of many devastating earthquakes that destroyed many landmarks. Soon after, a vile three-headed dragon laid waste to the kingdom and began to demand the sacrifice of maidens for its bounty. For some years the dragon ravaged the land. Graham's previously good judgment and wisdom had not recovered from the shock of Alexander's kidnapping. Choosing what he felt was best for Daventry, in an attempt to protect the land, he started sending innocent girls off to be sacrificed to the fire-breathing dragon, even consenting to the sacrifice of his only daughter, Rosella. The princess later forgave him for taking her to the dragon, but his memory of tying her to the stake still sometimes disturbs his dreams. That she was rescued and survived only eases the horror a little. * Valanice: She is the queen of Daventry. The kidnapping of her baby son Alexander from his cradle was a massive blow to her, not just because of the loss, but because it reopened memories of her own kidnapping. Valanice attempted to submerge her grief through hard work‚Äîfirst by studying the histories of the world, and then by opening a school to teach the brightest children of the kingdom. She spent much time teaching Rosella how to read and the histories of the world. When the three-headed dragon demanded the sacrifice of a young maiden, she fiercely fought against the decision to comply, and when it came time to offer her daughter to the beast she refused, standing guard by Rosella's room with a drawn sword. But it was not enough, and she was forced to watch as her child was taken up the mountain.  Development and release  King's Quest III was the biggest and most ambitious game Sierra had made up to that point. The series' designer and writer Roberta Williams said, \\"My previous games, from Mystery House to King's Quest II, were all great. But they were essentially glorified treasure hunts... your object being to win the game by finding and collecting items. It was not possible to have bigger and more complex plots than that thanks to technical limitations.\\" By the mid-1980s, the new generation computer platforms such as the IBM AT, Amiga, and Macintosh were faster and sported more memory as well as standard hard disks. Thus, it was now possible to develop games of greater complexity than had been possible on 8-bit machines. Roberta Williams collaborated with a team consisting mainly of the same people that worked with her on the previous two games, but more people were involved in the production this time. Al Lowe, who made the music in King's Quest II, became the lead programmer of King's Quest III, while his wife Margaret made the music instead. This was the game on which Al Lowe cut his teeth before moving onto his own series, Leisure Suit Larry. Williams said, \\"Rosella was introduced toward the end of the game; seeing her on the screen for the first time, I suddenly saw her on her own adventures in a sequel.\\" King's Quest III was the first adventure game featuring auto-mapping, with a \\"magic map\\" found in the game that can be used to teleport to most locations that the player has visited before. This feature was unpopular among some fans who claim it made the game too easy. Hence, magic maps in future Sierra On-line games were more limited in their teleporting ability; they were never used in future King's Quest games, but were later re-introduced in Mixed-Up Mother Goose. The developers also introduced a real-time clock, with actions based on the clock. The game was released on five 5.25\\" floppy disks and three 3.5\\" disks, as Sierra's second largest game after Time Zone (six disks). It was almost 50% larger than King's Quest I or King's Quest II.Sierra Newsletter, Vol 1, No. 3, spring 1988, pp. 1‚Äì2.The Royal Scribe, King's Quest Collection, 15th Anniversary KQ3 had 104 screens, whereas the first KQ had about 80 and KQII had about 92.Inside the Chest, Sierra Newsletter, Fall/Winter 1988. King's Quest III was the first Sierra game to be DOS-based instead of using a self- booting disk, as well as the first to feature EGA and Hercules graphics support. A year later, it was rereleased with the slightly improved AGI 2.435 https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Sierra_Game_Versions#AGI2 engine, followed by another release with the 2.936 https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Sierra_Game_Versions#AGI2 engine in 1988. The Apple IIGS version had improved music and sound effects. The game's manual contains a short prologue story by Annette Childs that tells of Manannan's previous slaves and their deaths. The book also contains spells from The Sorcery of Old, needed to cast the spells in the game (these are reprinted in The King's Quest Companion). King's Quest III was the first game in which Sierra used a manual-based copy protection scheme (although technically not intended to be copy protection). Nearly all AGI games (including King's Quest III) have a disk-based copy protection, requiring the original game disk to be present in order to play the game. This was not entirely effective and unofficial versions were widespread. (This key-disk check was removed from the later-released \\"King's Quest Collection\\" versions.) However, to complete King's Quest III, the player needs to create a number of magic spells through alchemical formulas that are only available in the game's manual. Many considered the process slightly overdone; 140 of the 210 possible points in the game are obtained through simply doing what the manual says, leaving less room for real puzzles. Starting with King's Quest IV, later Sierra games would instead ask for but a few actions described in the manual. Most often it was a dialog window appearing once, requesting the player to enter word X from page Y of the manual. This was not a true form of copy protection and was actually considered a game feature (as most puzzles in the game are based on the spells), and thus the complete spell list was reprinted in many of the official guides at the time, including the Official Book of King's Quest: Coventry and Beyond and The King's Quest Companion. A novelization of the game is included in The King's Quest Companion. The novelization is written in the form of an interview between Derek Karlavaegen (\\"Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\\") and Alexander sometime after the events of the third game. This was written to be a novel-style walkthrough used to solve the game. The \\"Encyclopedia of Daventry\\" in the first and second edition offered a few more backstories and details about the various characters and objects from the game. The chapter \\"The World of Daventry\\" also included more details about the Land of Llewdor, and its inhabitants. The book also contains copies of the spells from The Sorcerery of Old, needed to beat the game.  Reception  King's Quest III sold 250,000 copies by February 1993. According to Sierra On- Line, combined sales of the King's Quest series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. Though for the most part well received, winning the Softsel Hot List Hottest Product Award in 1987, the release of this product in 1986 was quickly met with loud protests from gamers claiming that King's Quest III was not really a King's Quest. Because it focused on a young slave named Gwydion and his attempts to escape his evil master, players did not grasp the connection between Gwydion and King Graham of Daventry until they finished the game some months later.King's Quest Collection II manual, p. 4. A review in Computer Gaming World described the game as exceedingly frustrating, from the task of climbing stairs to identifying objects from their low-resolution graphics. The hint guide was highly recommended as a way to alleviate some of that frustration. The reviewer suggested gamers new to the series play King's Quest I instead, it being much easier. The \\"automatic mapping feature\\" was widely promoted with King's Quest III; however, it was not included in later King's Quest games as player feedback indicated it reduced challenge.King's Quest Collection II manual, p. 5. According to Roberta Williams, \\"KQ3 was very dark, and it utilized lots of magic and magic spells with the basic idea of finding ingredients for 'black magic' spells and then casting those spells. Certain religious groups were upset with me over that one!\\" In August 2016, King's Quest III placed 50th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list.  Fan remakes  There have been two unofficial fan remakes. Infamous Adventures created a remake, King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human in 2006. It is a slightly expanded remake offering new material, including new cutscenes, a few new characters, expanded narration or dialogue, full speech, new or modified locations, and easter eggs. Most of the original puzzles remain intact, although the spell system was streamlined. The game was made by the team because they wanted to see if they could do it, and prove they had the drive and ability to recreate the game with updated graphics and sounds. AGD Interactive released another remake, King's Quest III Redux, in 2011.

The player takes on the role of Princess Rosella, daughter of King Graham of Daventry (King's Quest I and King's Quest II) and the twin sister of Gwydion/Alexander (King's Quest III), who must save her father and a good fairy and destroy an evil witch. Critically acclaimed, it was one of the first PC games to support a sound card.  Gameplay  King's Quest IV uses the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) and Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) systems. This is the only chapter in the King's Quest series where the action takes place in real-time and within the allotted time limit, as the events of the game cover about 24 hours. Some activities must be completed during the day, while other puzzles can be solved only at night (the nightfall in the game happens either at 9 pm or at a certain point in the plot). The overall high difficulty of King's Quest III was toned down in King's Quest IV.  Plot  Picking up immediately where King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human left off, as King Graham tosses his children his adventure's cap, he suffers a massive heart attack and is left on his death bed. The devastated Princess Rosella is contacted via the Magic Mirror by the good fairy Genesta in the faraway land of Tamir who reveals the existence of a magic fruit that can heal King Graham in exchange for Rosella helping Genesta. Rosella agrees and is teleported to the fairy kingdom of Tamir. The realm's ruler, Queen Genesta, reveals that her archenemy, the evil fairy Lolotte, has stolen her talisman without which Genesta will die in twenty-four hours. Additionally, without the talisman, Genesta lacks the power to return Rosella to Daventry. Rosella agrees to undertake a quest for both the talisman and the magic fruit and goes out undercover, dressed as a peasant girl. Rosella manages to find the fruit, traversing a dangerous underground passage and swamp, but is captured in Queen Lolotte's perilous mountains and imprisoned in her castle. The witch demands that Rosella undertake three tasks for her in order for Rosella to earn her freedom and a big reward. Rosella reluctantly agrees and captures a unicorn, steals the golden hen and recovers Pandora's Box for Lolotte who intends to use the items to increase her evil power and influence. Lolotte reveals that her hideous and deformed son Edgar has fallen in love with Rosella and she intends for them to marry, trapping Rosella and condemning King Graham and Genesta to death. However, a sympathetic Edgar helps Rosella escape and she slays Lolotte with Cupid's bow. Rosella recovers the talisman, the hen and Pandora's Box and rescues the unicorn. In order to keep Pandora's Box from being used for evil again, Rosella returns it to its tomb and seals the entrance so no one else can ever enter. Rosella returns the talisman and the hen to Genesta, saving her life. As a reward for his help and kindness, Genesta transforms Edgar into a handsome young man, but Rosella rejects Edgar's marriage proposal though she expresses hope that they will meet again someday. Rosella is teleported back to Daventry where the fruit heals King Graham to the joy of his family. Although Rosella's primary quest is to retrieve the magic fruit needed to save King Graham, it is possible to return to Daventry without completing this task, but this leads to a tragic alternate ending to the game where Rosella returns to Daventry in time to witness her father passing away instead of saving his life. A second alternate ending exists where if Rosella is caught after escaping from her room, she will be forced to marry Edgar and spend the rest of her life in Tamir. Winning the game will not resolve all storylines, although that will be the goal in the sequels.  Development and release  With the SCI engine, Sierra dropped disk-based copy protection schemes in favor of requiring the user to enter a word from the manual, as the new-generation games were designed primarily to be installed and run from a hard disk. King's Quest IV was the first commercially released game for IBM PC compatibles to support sound cards instead of only the standard built-in speaker. In addition to the familiar PC speaker and Tandy sound, it could utilize AdLib , Disney Sound Source, IBM Music Feature Card, or Roland boards. The new SCI engine allowed the game's designers to incorporate an orchestrated musical score along with more complex sound effects, a previously unattainable feat. To ensure an immersive soundtrack, composer William Goldstein was hired to write the game's musical score, totaling over 75 short music pieces. The series' author Roberta Williams wrote in the notes to the King's Quest Collection Series, \\"Before King's Quest IV was released, word leaked out that Graham would have a heart attack and might die. Fans were upset enough to write in, asking to save Graham. I wanted King's Quest IV to have some pressure applied to you: a timed game, taking place over a 24-hour period, so you roam around during the day and eventually it turns to night. I don't remember other games using the same scenes at night; it looked creepy.\\" With a female protagonist and more colorful graphics than in her earlier games, she attempted to appeal more specifically to female demographics. As the game's aspect that satisfied her most, she said: \\"I like the heroine, Rosella. I guess because she's a part of me that's coming out. I really identified with her. Sometimes she's delicate, but she's strong, knows what she wants, she's not afraid to do what she has to do. She's courageous. It was fun for me to do a female character.\\" The game was simultaneously produced and published in the AGI and SCI engines. The AGI engine was used in all earlier Sierra adventure games, the SCI in all later ones. SCI supported higher-resolution graphics (320√ó200 resolution versus 160√ó200), more sophisticated animation, mouse, and sound card support. Some older features like CGA composite mode and PCjr support were removed. Memory requirements for SCI games were thus double those of AGI games (512 kB vs 256k). The new engine was designed for then-current IBM-compatible hardware (i.e. 8‚Äì16 MHz 286 or 386 machines with EGA or VGA graphics and a hard disk) and ran poorly on older 8086 computers. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show on June 4, 1988. King's Quest IV was the only native-mode SCI game to also have an AGI version (some games originally made with the AGI engine like the original King's Quest were released in updated SCI versions). This was done mostly as a fall-back measure because the SCI engine was new and unproven, and also for the large existing user base of 8086 machines. However, only a quite small number of copies were sold. It was discontinued within a few months of the game's August 1988 release. The two games are identical in gameplay, except that the SCI version was updated with some additional parser responses. The AGI version 2.0 contains the \\"beam me\\" Easter egg, which transported Rosella to a Star Trek-esque room with all of the development team present (this Easter egg is not present in any SCI version). A version identical to the AGI version was released on the Apple IIGS with improved music and effects (over the MS-DOS AGI counterpart); the IIGS port does not use the SCI engine for performance reasons.  Reception  King's Quest IV sold 100,000 copies in its first two weeks. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the King's Quest series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that King's Quest IVs sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units. GameSpot's staff wrote that the game \\"marked a dramatic increase in the series' commercial success\\". King's Quest IV was very well received by the trade press, including being awarded review scores of 309/400 from ACE, 79% from Amiga Action, 81% from Amiga Computing, 85% from Commodore User, 91% from Computer & Video Games, 85% from CU Amiga, 9/10 from Datormagazin, 90% from The Games Machine (Italia), 13/15 from Tilt, and 79% from Zzap!. It was also selected as \\"Best Adventure Game of 1988\\" by the Software Publishers Association. Scorpia of Computer Gaming World reviewed King's Quest IV, noting the beautiful graphics, but also mentioning the game ran slowly if the screen contained animations. She described the game's puzzles as \\"uneven\\", but considered the presentation as cinematic in quality. David Stanton of Compute! praised the graphics and sound of the IBM PC version, including its support of VGA and sound cards such as AdLib and Roland MT-32, and concluded that \\"King's Quest IV sets a gaming standard others will be hard-pressed to match, much less surpass,\\" describing the game's soundtrack as \\"40 minutes of the best sound available on any computer disk anywhere.\\" Page 6s John Sweeney wrote the game was \\"undoubtedly excellent\\", but personally he preferred King's Quest III. In 2009, Atomic named King's Quest IV one of the \\"50 Games to Play Before You Die\\". The magazine's Ben Hardwidge called it \\"a classic\\". IGN's Kosta Andreadis wrote in 2014, \\"The Perils of Rosella stands the test of time despite its shortcomings (and you can buy it on GOG.com), for above all providing a memorable and at times thrilling adventure, on top of being one of the first games to ever feature both a female protagonist as well as sound card support.\\"  References  External links   King's Quest IV at the Sierra Chest Category:1988 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:1980s interactive fiction Category:Amiga games Category:Apple IIGS games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:King's Quest Category:Sierra Entertainment games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games about witchcraft Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Fantasy video games ","title":"King's Quest IV"},{"id":"1870602","text":"Chinese Brazilians ( or Chin√™s-brasileiro; ) are people of Chinese ancestry who were born in or have immigrated to Brazil. The Chinese Brazilian population was estimated to be approximately 250,000 in 2007. The first Chinese people came to Brazil in 1814, when Chinese tea planters were sent from Portugal to the Royal Botanical Garden in Rio de Janeiro. Following calls for the abolition of slavery, more Afro-Brazilian slaves stopped working on plantations, so the Brazilian government was looking for a replacement for the labor force lost in the middle of the 19th century. After considering immigrants such as the Europeans, the Brazilian government decided to hire Chinese laborers, as they were more willing to take the hard task than the Europeans did. The Brazilian government started to import some Chinese laborers from Canton, California and other Latin American countries in the 1870s. Continuing the commercial contract with the Chinese government, the Brazilian government imported more Chinese laborers to Brazil in the 1880 and 1881. The earliest group of Chinese laborers started migration to Brazil, and solved the temporary labor loss in Brazil in the late 19th century. S√£o Paulo now has the largest Chinese Brazilian population, in particular in the district of Liberdade. The majority of the Chinese immigrants settle in S√£o Paulo, which 200,000 out of 350,000 Chinese Brazilians in total. Some Chinese immigrants work as merchants for international trade, and they work as lawyers, member of the parliament and the house of representatives and doctors. Chinese immigrants have integrated into the Brazilian society by building inter-cultural exchange in the communities. Besides being an area famous for its strong Japanese presence, a significant number of Taiwanese immigrants out of 70,000 in total, have settled in Liberdade, and many Chinese immigrants have come to Liberdade following the Communist revolution in 1949. Many Cantonese from Hong Kong and Portuguese-speaking Macau, including some Macanese of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent, have also settled in Brazil. These Macau immigrants can usually speak and understand Portuguese (its Creole, Macanese or Patu√°, is also spoken), allowing them to adjust more easily to life in Brazil. Today, the majority of Chinese Brazilians only speak Portuguese, although some may be bilingual, speaking Portuguese and Chinese.  History  It is known that there were Chinese in Brazil as far back as the late 18th century; Rugendas painted a depiction of Chinese Tea planters in Rio de Janeiro during the period of the Portuguese Royal family in Brazil. In 1814 John VI of Portugal brought 300 Chinese from Macau to work in the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro. Chinese people started moving to Brazil in the late 19th century when Brazil called for abolishing slavery. As a result, the number of Afro-Brazilians slaves decreased gradually, which created labor shortages. To solve the problem, the Brazilians came up with a plan of having immigrants to the country to replace the slaves. While considering having other European immigrants to replace the labor shortage, some Brazilians knew that the Europeans took longer time to adapt to Brazil before working, whereas the Chinese were able to easily adapt to the working conditions. Moreover, European immigrants were less willing to work in the field under harsh conditions (and receiving meager remuneration) while Chinese laborers were accustomed to the low pay, ‚Äúlived with less comfort than all other peoples,‚Äù and ‚Äúmore temperate.‚Äù Plantation jobs were a kind of low pay job, and hiring more Chinese with a very low wage could also cut down the cost of labor. Many Brazilian planters and the Brazilian government believed that Chinese were ‚Äúthe only colonists capable of enduring the hardships and the thousand privations peculiar to [Brazilian] rural labor.‚Äù Some Brazilians claimed that ‚Äúonly [Chinese] workers who could save Brazilian agriculture.‚Äù Therefore, the Brazilian government planned to import Chinese laborers, just like other tropical nations which had done the same since the 1840s. However, as China had known that the Chinese laborers had received harsh labor treatments in countries like Cuba and Peru, China had prohibited all other forms of immigration but the voluntary ones, and allowed importation of laborers only to countries with commercial treaties. Despite the barriers set by the Chinese government, Brazilian companies still managed to have 1,000 Chinese to work as tea planters in 1874. In 1875, the Brazilian companies tried to bring in more Chinese workers to Brazil by recruiting those in the province of Guangdong (Canton) and California. To legally import more Chinese laborers, the Brazilian government negotiated a commercial treaty with China, but China signed the commercial treaty with reluctance in Tianjin, China on September 5, 1880 with a revised contract on October 3, 1881. With the low cost of transportation that is 35 milreis per passenger, which is less than 20 U.S dollars, the new Brazilian companies tried to seek more laborers from China by connecting with the director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company called Tong King Sing. By building up a friendly trade relationship with the Tong, Brazil was able to import more Chinese laborers, however the workers were bound to a five-year contract. Despite the immediate transportation of more Chinese laborers from China to Brazil, the Chinese government continued displaying a hesitant attitude in the 1890s. Hence, the Brazilian government looked to other alternative sources of Asian labor and the Japanese became the new target. Having Chinese immigrants work in coffee and tea plantations raised controversies in Brazil while the Brazilian government sought to solve the problem of labor shortage as a result of a call to end slavery. Brazil was seeking modernity starting in the late 19th century, and their core value for progress was racial \\"whitening\\", while having an increased non-white population was thought to lead to a degeneration of society. Some Brazilians were against Chinese immigration because of perceived cultural and racial inferiority to the Europeans, based on the Social Darwinism. There was a theory about the ultimate disappearance of Chinese in the Brazilian society. Some Brazilians were also afraid of Chinese domination in Brazil after immigration as Chinese would take over the places with exotic cultures, opium, pigtails and pagan religions. Unlike the Indians and Africans who had been Christianized, many Chinese immigrants had difficulty integrating into society as they strongly held on to traditional Chinese beliefs. Some Brazilians also feared that the Chinese would not leave Brazil once they had settled down, and would congregate in certain areas and create businesse monopolies, leading to competition with domestic workers. Amidst it all, there were still some Brazilians who were pro-Chinese immigration. The Republican leader Quintino Bocayuva wrote pamphlets to defend the notion that having Chinese laborers would benefit Brazil in 1868. It was advertised in the pamphlet A crise da lavoura, outlining reasons such as that the Chinese were skilled at agricultural work, and some negative aspects of Chinese would not hurt Brazil because they were passionate about gambling, emigrated alone, inward looking and would ultimately return to China after saving up enough. Some Chinese laborers were unhappy with their work, hence they fled to Rio de Janeiro. Some Chinese laborers attained free status, and made a living through selling street foods and merchandise in the late 19th century. In the middle of the 20th century, more Chinese who lived in the US and Africa started moving to Brazil as a result of wars and persecutions, while some Chinese who lived in Hong Kong and Taiwan also chose Brazil as their new settlement. Another wave of immigration took place as well in the late 1970s when Chinese immigrants from the provinces Guangdong and Zhejiang, and from the cities of Shanghai and Beijing settled in Brazil. Even though these new immigrants possessed different levels of literacy, some literate ones worked as merchants, lawyers, doctors and government officials. Chinese Brazilians who moved to Brazil in the early years struggled immensely, as they had borrowed money from relatives for subsidies in order to start small businesses. For example, some sold Cantonese snacks like Yau Gok (Gok ai). While other Brazilians worked only eight hours a day, the Chinese immigrants worked for more than twelve hours a day. With intelligence, persistence and diligence, Chinese Brazilians started to succeed in different forms of small and big businesses. Some of the older generation with higher literacy were actively involved in the mainstream Brazilian community, as they worked as members of the house of representatives and parliament, lawyers and doctors. For the past 25 years, more Chinese have been traveling to Brazil for international trade.  20th and 21st Century Immigration = Life in S√£o Paulo  There are currently a total of around 250,000 Chinese immigrants and descendants in Brazil. About 200,000 of them reside in S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo. Chinese merchants started to expand their business after immigration, but some negative influences hindered the growth. For instance, in 2007, the Brazilian judicial system had settled down the largest shopping center and 50 stores in S√£o Paulo, and arrested six merchants. Even though there were illegal operations and smuggling among the Chinese immigrants, it was not the majority.  The Brazilian Dream  25 de Mar√ßo street in S√£o Paulo is a place with 2.5 km in length (approximately 1.55 miles) where the majority Chinese Brazilians mainly sell their merchandises to make a living. There are more than 3,000 Chinese Brazilians run the stores out of 4,000 shops in total, and the expansion took place in less than 30 years. Working in 25 de Mar√ßo street is not easy for the Chinese Brazilians as some of them started with no Portuguese language background, and they were struggling to communicate with other Brazilians except other Chinese. Some shop owners sought for business opportunities that they would not have back in homeland with children and parents left behind. The 25 de Mar√ßo street was not the safest area in S√£o Paulo and some Chinese immigrants were robbed when they started business in Brazil.  Recognition and Legacy  The Brazilian House of Representatives and the city of S√£o Paulo Parliament passed the proposal of setting August 15 as \\"Chinese Immigrants Day.\\" From the mid-19th century, Chinese migrated to Brazil for tea and coffee plantation in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which Brazil has become one of the earliest countries in the world with the knowledge of tea planting. Chinese has been a group of immigrants in Brazil striving to integrate into the Brazilian society, promoting China and Brazil‚Äôs international trade, and intercultural communication.  Dynamics, Social and Civic Engagement  As more Chinese migrated to Brazil and worked hard, Chinese immigrants has gained higher recognition in the Brazilian society while China is becoming one of the most powerful world economic power, which Brazil has established international trade with. Under the fact that S√£o Paulo is the most populated city in Brazil, the Chinese Brazilians in the community hosted cultural events like acupuncture demo, cheongsam, dragon dancing and Chinese art, which attracted different ethnic groups to watch and improved inter-cultural communications. The Chinese Brazilians has gained high recognition and respect in the communities. This has occurred because the Chinese community donated money local to charities by doing this they are contributing to the community actively. Despite the social recognition and China-Brazil diplomatic relationship, some robberies still take place. Chinese Brazilians in S√£o Paulo collaborated with the local police to discuss solutions to the problems.

(also known simply as King's Quest V) is a 1990 graphic adventure game by Sierra On-Line. Originally released in November 1990, it featured a significant improvement in graphics (achieved through the introduction of VGA into the series). It was also the first King's Quest installment to replace the typing user interface with a point-and-click user interface. The title is a spoof on the proverb \\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\\" King's Quest V sold over half million copies and won several awards. It was later released as a fully voiced \\"talkie\\" CD-ROM, done by members of the Sierra staff. By summer a Sega CD port of the game was announced, but was never released.  Plot  In the introduction to the game, a view of Castle Daventry is shown, when suddenly, a mysterious cloaked figure appears. He enchants the castle, causing a whirlwind to appear, which soon engulfs the castle and lifts it out of sight. Because he is out walking when this happens, King Graham is the only member of the royal family to be left behind. He returns to the castle to find that it has disappeared, and is soon confronted by a talking owl named Cedric. Cedric witnessed the cloaked figure's attack, and tells Graham that it was a powerful, evil wizard named Mordack who stole the castle. Cedric then brings Graham to the land of Serenia, where his master Crispin resides. Crispin is also a wizard, but a good one, who gives Graham some advice, his old wand, and a piece of white snake which allows Graham to speak with animals. Graham then starts on his journey. Later, Graham learns that Mordack is the brother of the wizard Manannan, whom Graham's son, Prince Alexander, turned into a cat in King's Quest III. Mordack has imprisoned the castle and royal family of Daventry out of revenge, and threatens to feed the royal family to Manannan unless Prince Alexander agrees to restore him to his true form as the spell's nature means that only Prince Alexander as the caster can reverse it. King Graham travels through the land of Serenia, gathering helpful items and information, and eventually makes his way to Mordack's island, and to his castle lair, to save his family from their impending doom. The owl Cedric accompanies the protagonist King Graham through the entire game to provide commentary and advice. He has to be rescued from danger at several points. The only useful thing the owl does is inadvertently saving Graham's life from a spell near the end of the game. At the end of the game, with the help of another of Mordack's prisoners, Princess Cassima, Graham is able to confront Mordack in a magical duel, using spells he learns from Mordack's own spell book against him. After Mordack transforms himself into a ring of fire, Graham slays the evil wizard by conjuring a rain storm to put the fire out. The good wizard Crispin arrives soon after and transforms the castle and royal family back to normal. At Graham's request, Crispin teleports Cassima back to her home in the Land of the Green Isles and sends the royal family back to Daventry.  Connections to other King's Quest games  Though still largely standalone, King's Quest V is one of the few where the elements of the plot itself are directly connected to events or individuals in both previous and future games. The location the game is set in, Serenia, was first visited in the earlier game Wizard and the Princess. During the game, King Graham discovers the skeleton of a man in the Serenia desert which is identified as the body of the Wanderer, the protagonist from Wizard and the Princess in the King's Quest Companion. The transformation of Manannan into a cat is a necessary task to completing King's Quest III. And this act has profound consequences for Alexander (and his family), as it is the impetus for the KQV storyline. The game's ending ties into its sequel, King's Quest VI. Cassima was introduced as a slave to the wizard Mordack. Before she is sent home at the end, Alexander mentions wanting to visit her in the Land of the Green Isles, which happens at the beginning of KQVI. And Cassima mentions her Vizier, who first introduced Mordack to her. In KQVI, we find out that Mordack and the Vizier (who is the primary antagonist of KQVI) are both part of an organization known as the Society of the Black Cloak (technically only the Vizier is confirmed to be a member, but members of the organization know of Mordack). Even the music for Cassima in Mordack's castle is enhanced and used for the love theme for Alexander and Cassima. At the end of that game, the Vizier is defeated by Alexander and Cassima and the two marry.  Versions  King's Quest V was the last in the series to feature EGA and Tandy graphics at 320√ó200: a separate EGA release contained 16-color 320√ó200 versions of the graphics, whereas the VGA release featured 320√ó200 256-color VGA graphics (and, unlike later SCI games, did not support rendering these into 16 colors at 640√ó200 resolution on EGA cards).  Floppy disk  The diskette version (EGA and VGA) requires Graham to cast spells throughout the game, requiring the user to refer to the manual as a form of copy protection. This was omitted in the CD-ROM version. The disk version has a slightly different game interface, similar to the version later used in the NES version, the main difference being that there is an additional walk option. Several of the animated characters including the rat, the ant, and the bee, have large closeup pictures of their upper torsos, that are fully animated, including arms and, for the insects, antennae. The ant, for example, even raises up the golden needle. These closeups and animations were modified or mostly cut from the CD-ROM version (which only shows closeups on the characters' faces).  CD-ROM  Released in 1992, the CD-ROM version is mastered in the High Sierra Format, unrelated to the publisher's name. This version added voice acting. There are also many script differences between the floppy and CD-ROM versions. Many of the narrative descriptions were modified, and lines were added to characters that did not have speaking roles. For example, the snake and some of the villagers are given a few quotes, whereas they did not speak at all, and ignored Graham in the floppy version. Many of the characters have close up pictures (taken from the floppy) that were given various colored backgrounds behind them, and a frame around them (though the frame cuts off some details). The snake is even given a close up picture for its new speaking parts and a few of the characters are given more lines.  NES  In order to make the Nintendo Entertainment System adaptation more family-friendly and release it to stores everywhere, Nintendo of America had to follow its Video Game Content Guidelines requiring it to tone down violence, nudity, language, and religious themes in the games it released and it was published by Konami, rather than Sierra On-Line.Nintendo's Era of Censorship One example is Graham's water- drinking scene in the desert: where the narrator's words say, \\"Ah, life-giving water. Nectar of the Gods. Graham can now feel strength and renewal flowing through him\\" in the PC version, in the NES adaptation it says, \\"Ah! The cool water felt wonderful on Graham's parched lips and his body now feels rejuvenated.\\" This was edited due to religious themes. Another example has Queen Icebella ordering the wolves to take Graham and Cedric to the dungeons for ever, instead of actually killing them. Cedric is turned to 'stone', rather than Mordack actually killing him. In the Konami release, this obviously was to censor out the threatened violence, but the threatened violence was shown in the Sierra On-Line release.  Atari ST  An Atari ST version was announced via Sierra Online's magazine: Sierra News Magazine for a Spring 1991 release but was later canceled.Staff (Spring 1991). \\"Atari ST Owners Set To Enjoy Two Brand New Products Plus Reillustrated Versions Of Two Classics In Spring '91\\", Sierra News Magazine. p. 13,22 Sierra's Srini Vasan and Sierra UK fought for continued Atari ST developmentMagpie, Johnny (Spring 1991), \\"Rumor Mill: Atari ST Owners Will Still Be Supported...\\", Sierra News Magazine. p. 46 but Sierra Online discontinued Atari ST support entirely shortly afterwards.  Reception  King's Quest V sold 250,000 copies by February 1993, and sales ultimately surpassed 500,000 copies.Roberta Williams Biography According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the King's Quest series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that King's Quest Vs sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units. Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia in 1991 praised the \\"tour de force\\" VGA graphics, sound card audio, non-typing parser and user interface, but criticized the gigantic, yet almost pointless, desert map. She concluded that the game was best for new adventurers because of its easy puzzles, and a \\"pleasant diversion\\" for more-experienced players. In 1991, Dragon gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. In April 1993 Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai called the voice acting in the CD-ROM version of the game \\"wooden\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that \\"the quality of the voice acting covers the gamut from excellent to mediocre and, in some cases, can grate on the nerves\\", but the CD version was still preferable because \\"other enhancements are excellent\\". In 2007, Adventure Gamers gave the game a three out of five stars. Allgame also gave the PC original four out of five stars, while giving its NES adaptation two-and-a-half stars. King's Quest V won the 1991 Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Fantasy Role-Playing/Adventure Program, Computer Gaming World named the game as its 1991 Adventure Game of the Year, and in 1992 named it to the magazine's Hall of Fame for games readers rated highly over time. In 1992 King's Quest V was voted \\"Best Multimedia Fantasy/Adventure Game\\" by readers of MPC World.Interaction Winter 1992, pg 49 In 1996 Computer Gaming World named King's Quest V the 94th best game ever. The editors wrote that \\"Roberta Williams horrified Sierra traditionalists by getting the parser out of the way of some of the most beautiful graphics ever.  In other games  Sierra displayed their acknowledgement at the criticisms of King's Quest V through references to the game in several of their releases: * In Space Quest IV, Cedric acts as an enemy in the Ms. Astro Chicken arcade game. * In Space Quest 6, the game mocks Cedric whenever Roger tries to tell the elevator door to open or close. * In Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist, Cedric can be seen perched atop a cactus, and then later eviscerated by vultures. * In King's Quest VI, the pawn shop features various references to the problems with KQV and other past games in the series * In Quest For Glory: Shadow of Darkness, one of the possible wrong answers to a riddle from Leshy is Cedric, to which Leshy then shudders. King's Quest V also inspired a text-based remake, King's Quest V ‚Äì The Text Adventure, and also another parody fan-game Owl's Quest: Every Owl Has It's Day starring Cedric which pokes fun of many of the situations and mannerisms of Cedric.

Written by Roberta Williams and Jane Jensen, King's Quest VI is widely recognized as the high point in the series for its landmark 3D graphic introduction movie (created by Kronos Digital Entertainment) and professional voice acting (Hollywood actor Robby Benson provided the voice for Prince Alexander, the game's protagonist). King's Quest VI was programmed in Sierra's Creative Interpreter and was the last King's Quest game to be released on floppy disk. A CD-ROM version of the game was released in 1993, including more character voices, a slightly different opening movie and more detailed artwork and animation. The name of this sequel is a pun on the common phrase \\"here today, gone tomorrow\\". This pun is related to the abrupt departure of Prince Alexander after the events of King's Quest V, where he was just rescued by King Graham along with Princess Cassima, who asked Alexander to come visit her at the end of that game. King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human also contained the word \\"heir\\" in its title and also featured Prince Alexander (then known as the slave Gwydion) as the main character. Gameplay Screenshot from the Windows version displaying the interface of the functions toolbar and inventory; on the left is the player character Prince Alexander King's Quest VI is a 2D graphic adventure game with a point- and-click interface. The player is given an icon-based toolbar at the top of the screen of selectable functions: walk, look (provides a description from the narrator of the object targeted), action and talk, respectively. It also includes the item inventory (the last selected item can be picked right away) and a game options menu. This is the second game in the series to feature this interface, which was introduced in its immediate predecessor King's Quest V as a new feature of the SCI1 version of Sierra's Creative Interpreter engine; previous titles in the series featured a text parser where players had to type commands and actions instead of selecting them on the screen. Gameplay involves solving puzzles. Those include logic puzzles and interacting with characters either by dialogue or usage of collected items. One of the puzzles requires consulting the booklet \\"Guidebook to the Land of the Green Isles\\", which is included in the game's package. Aside from providing additional background to the game's setting, this booklet serves as part of the game's copy-protection. The player will not be able to pass the puzzles on the Cliffs of Logic that guard the Isle of the Sacred Mountain without information from the booklet. The booklet also includes a poem encoding the solution to one of the puzzles in the labyrinth on the island. In the re-released edition, the guide is part of the manual released on the game CD. Solving the puzzles in the game usually requires traveling between the islands that make up the game world, which is accomplished by means of a magic map. Although a magic map had been used in earlier games of the series such as King's Quest III, its implementation in King's Quest VI was different from earlier games in that it was only used for travel between islands, which could not be reached using the walking interface.King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow review Plot The game takes place almost entirely in a fictional kingdom called the Land of the Green Isles. The kingdom comprises several islands, and is described as being largely isolated from the outside world. The player can travel between different islands after obtaining a magic map. The center of the kingdom is the Isle of the Crown, which has an Arabian Nights theme. The Isle of Wonder is inspired by Alice in Wonderland, and the Isle of the Sacred Mountain is inspired by Classical mythology. The Isle of the Beast, inspired by Beauty And The Beast, is heavily forested and scattered with magical barriers. There also are additional hidden areas. One of these is inhabited by a tribe of druids, while another gives the player the option to confront Death. The game's opening cutscene shows Prince Alexander haunted by his memories of Princess Cassima, whom he met at the end of King's Quest V when they were both rescued from the wizard Mordack. After seeing a vision of Cassima in the magical mirror that his father acquired in the first King's Quest, he sails to find her. At the beginning of the game he is shipwrecked on the shore of the Isle of the Crown, where he learns that the vizier Abdul Alhazred (named after the author of the fictional Necronomicon) has assumed control in Cassima's absence, and plans to force her to marry him. Alexander must explore the Land of the Green Isles in order to find and learn what he needs to rescue Cassima from the vizier. Multiple endings A significant aspect of KQ6 story and gameplay is the option for the player to receive different endings based on choices made during the course of the game. Partway through the game, the player has the option to pursue either the \\"short path\\", which finishes the game rather quickly, or the \\"long path\\", which contains more puzzles and leads to a more satisfying ending. Upon completing either path, the player is given a clue about what choices would have led to the other ending. In addition to the two main paths and endings, the game's endings also contain many minor variables based on optional tasks in the game that the player may or may not have performed. Almost half of the game's quests are optional, many have multiple solutions, and because of the game's open world design players can solve most in any order.

Williams began preliminary work on King's Quest VI in June, \\"laying out the basic story\\" and worked alongside Jensen throughout July and August on coming up with design ideas; after five months, Williams and Jensen finished the documentation for the design. Two key goals of the writers were to keep the game's tone consistent with its predecessors' while still making it a distinct title, and to make players connect emotionally with the game; Williams wrote the love story of Prince Alexander and Cassima specifically for this emotional attachment. Crew filming real-life actors for motion capture in a behind-the-scenes footage of King's Quest VI. Co-director and project manager Bill Skirvin and the artists created the storyboards and character sketches. John Shroades was responsible for sketching the 80 background paintings that would be used for the game. The method of motion capture was used to transcribe the movement of real-life actors shot on video to the over 2000 character actions in King's Quest VI on computer. Williams and Skirvin chose the actors and costumes for the shootings, and Michael Hutchinson led the animation team that integrated the footage into Shroades's backgrounds. The game's MIDI music was composed by Chris Braymen, who also produced the sound effects. The game's opening 3D-animated introduction was produced by Stanley Liu of Kronos Digital Entertainment, a company that did special effects for such films as Batman Returns and The Lawnmower Man. This sequence was present in all versions of the game (DOS, Windows, Amiga and Macintosh) albeit with different edits and narrations across versions. Jensen scripted the game, defining for programmers the game's responses for the player's actions and the over 6000 lines of written messages. Robert Lindsley served as the game's lead programmer. The game was coded on an updated version of the proprietary Sierra Creative Interpreter engine referred to as \\"SCI1\\". Robin Bradley served as the quality assurance tester; throughout July 1992 the game went through constant testing. Development wrapped in September, when Sierra's marketing and distribution departments began promoting and releasing the game. In an interview with The New York Times, Williams estimated King's Quest VI's budget to have been \\"about $700,000\\" and stated that the crew included over 20 people who worked for 14 months. King's Quest VI was initially scheduled for release in September 1992, but Sierra announced it would delayed until mid-October. It was then shipped on October 6 and launched on October 13 on nine floppy disks for DOS and Macintosh. The Amiga version was ported by Revolution Software. Sierra, which themselves converted their games for the Amiga prior to King's Quest VI, announced in early 1993 that they would cease releasing games for the computer; however, Revolution co- founder Charles Cecil offered Sierra for his company to make the Amiga conversion instead. The port began development in March 1993 and was released for the Amiga in December. It uses Revolution's Virtual Theatre engine instead of SCI1 due to better performance on the computer. Robby Benson voiced the protagonist Prince Alexander A CD-ROM version of King's Quest VI, released in 1993 for DOS and Microsoft Windows, featured an extended version of the opening sequence, a full voiceover of every line of text in the game, and a revised soundtrack that includes a full version of the ballad \\"Girl in the Tower\\", which was composed by Mark Seibert with lyrics by Jane Jensen and serves as the game's love theme, playing in the end credits. Sierra sent a CD with the song to various radio stations and bundled with the game a pamphlet listing these stations and suggested fans to call them and ask for the song to be played.The radio station insert pamphlet that was bundled with King's Quest VI This resulted in Sierra receiving legal threats from stations bothered by excessive requests from listeners. Sierra co-founder Ken Williams responded to the stations by jokingly stating that the stations \\"were the criminals for ignoring their customers ‚Äî something I believe no business should ever do\\". The Windows version also included higher resolution character portraits in dialogue sequences. Emmy-winning director Stuart M. Rosen directed the voice cast of King's Quest VI for the CD-ROM version, which included actor Robby Benson (voice of the Beast in Disney's Beauty and the Beast), who voiced Prince Alexander. Five additional people to the game's team were involved in the development of the CD-ROM version. The second King's Quest Collection had a number of editions in which the CD with King's Quest VI did not include the \\"Girl in the Tower\\" theme song audio CD track, so the Windows version simply crashed during the credits and the DOS version played the credits with no music. The King's Quest Collection release by Vivendi in 2006 includes the Windows version of the game, but is set up to run the MS-DOS version with text and speech in DOSBox.Buying game collections . Sierra Planet. Release=Sales According to Ken Williams, King's Quest VI sold around 400,000 copies in its first week of release and topped sales charts for DOS games upon release in September 1992, still holding the number one position in December that year. The CD-ROM version was the 5th best-selling CD-ROM game in November 1993. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the King's Quest series surpassed 3.8 million units by the end of March 1996. By November 2000, PC Data reported that King's Quest VIs sales in the United States alone had reached between 300,000 and 400,000 units. Critical reception Dragon gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"one of the best adventure games on the market\\" and writing that it has \\"enormous replay value\\". Chuck Miller of Computer Gaming World stated that the number and quality of puzzles made King's Quest VI the first Sierra adventure in which he did not miss the older games' text parser. The magazine stated that while the graphic and sound were as good as other Sierra games, the animation was especially lifelike. It concluded that the game was \\"the best of the King's Quest games to come out of Daventry, and Sierra's finest adventure to date ... [it] has all the signs of becoming a classic\\". PC Format magazine was less positive, giving the game a score of 72%. It liked the lushly drawn graphics and pleasing sound, but disliked the game for overuse of sudden death and being too limiting. Barry Brenesal of PC Magazine wrote, \\"King's Quests latest sequel may be more of the same, but that's no cause for concern. A formula that's rooted in the likes of Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm needs no excuse for its theme. And with Sierra at the design helm, it also needs no apology for its treatment.\\" Electronic Games' reviewer Russ Ceccola wrote that the game \\"will fully satisfy fans of the series, inspiring them to a higher level of creativity with its almost-hidden sections and plot elements\\" and named it the \\"finest\\" installment in the series. Writing for Compute!, Scott A. May said the game balances the story to attract all audiences and wrote that \\"those who love action will find plenty to pump their adrenaline, yet they won't be put off by the game's gentle, romantic side\\". Just Adventure reviewer Adam Rodman gave the game an A. When reviewing the CD-ROM version, Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai compared the game and series to \\"vanilla ice cream\\", but praised the \\"incomparable\\" graphics and stated that the voice acting was \\"much stronger\\" than in the previous game. He concluded that \\"King's Quest VI is a heartily inoffensive game full of light touches and not a great deal else\\"; however, \\"for plain vanilla, King's Quest VI on CD-ROM is about as good as it gets\\". Ardai later described the game as \\"best-selling though somewhat vapid ... adventures of Princess Pubescent in the Land of Cute\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that the CD version's \\"quality voice talent throughout ... audibly displays that Sierra learned from their previous error\\", and \\"a worthy heir to the King's Quest linege\\". Writing for CD-ROM Today, Neil Randall praised the CD version's addition of voice acting and the voices themselves, but expressed disappointment that it doesn't improve the game's graphical details. CU Amiga gave a positive review of the Amiga version of the game, singling out praise for the mouse control interface, the graphics, characters and the conversion from PC done by Revolution, and gave it an 89% score. In an A‚àí review, Peter Olafson of Amiga World equally praised Revolution's conversion and also commended the story. Amiga Power reviewer Jonathan Davies was less enthusiastic, comparing it unfavorably with other contemporary point- and-click games in terms of innovation, and rated it 70%; Amiga Format's Dave Golder gave a similar assessment and rated it 69%. In retrospective reviews made in the late 2000s, Allgame gave both the PC CD-ROM and Macintosh adaptations 2¬Ω stars out of five, while Adventure Gamers gave the game 4¬Ω stars out of 5. King's Quest VI is generally considered the best title in the series and is mentioned as one of the greatest games of all time. King's Quest VI was inducted into GameSpot's list of the greatest games of all time, and PC Gamer US named it the 48th best computer game ever in 1994. Adventure Gamers named it the 3rd best adventure game of all time, GamesRadar placed it as the 5th best point-and-click adventure game in 2012, and Kotaku included it in its list of the 10 adventure games \\"everyone must play\\". In 2011, Adventure Gamers named King's Quest VI the 13th-best adventure game ever released.

It is now known that M. grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not interbreed. Complex members isolated from Digitaria have been more narrowly defined as M. grisea. The remaining members of the complex isolated from rice and a variety of other hosts have been renamed Magnaporthe oryzae. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors. Members of the Magnaporthe grisea complex can also infect other agriculturally important cereals including wheat, rye, barley, and pearl millet causing diseases called blast disease or blight disease. Rice blast causes economically significant crop losses annually. Each year it is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed more than 60 million people. The fungus is known to occur in 85 countries worldwide. Hosts and symptoms Lesions on rice leaves caused by infection with M. griseaRice blast lesions on plant nodes M. grisea is an ascomycete fungus. It is an extremely effective plant pathogen as it can reproduce both sexually and asexually to produce specialized infectious structures known as appressoria that infect aerial tissues and hyphae that can infect root tissues. Rice blast has been observed on rice strains M-201, M-202, M-204, M-205, M-103, M-104, S-102, L-204, Calmochi-101, with M-201 being the most vulnerable.Rice Blast at University of California Integrated Pest Management Initial symptoms are white to gray-green lesions or spots with darker borders produced on all parts of the shoot, while older lesions are elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic borders. Lesions may enlarge and coalesce to kill the entire leaf. Symptoms are observed on all above-ground parts of the plant.Rice Blast at the Online Information Service for Non-Chemical Pest Management in the Tropics Lesions can be seen on the leaf collar, culm, culm nodes, and panicle neck node. Internodal infection of the culm occurs in a banded pattern. Nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected node (rotten neck).Rice Blast at Factsheets on Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents It also affects reproduction by causing the host to produce fewer seeds. This is caused by the disease preventing maturation of the actual grain. Disease cycle Spores of M. grisea The pathogen infects as a spore that produces lesions or spots on parts of the rice plant such as the leaf, leaf collar, panicle, culm and culm nodes. Using a structure called an appressorium, the pathogen penetrates the plant. The pathogen is able to move between the plant cells using its invasive hyphae to enter through plasmodesmata. M. grisea then sporulates from the diseased rice tissue to be dispersed as conidiospores. After overwintering in sources such as rice straw and stubble, the cycle repeats. A single cycle can be completed in about a week under favorable conditions where one lesion can generate up to thousands of spores in a single night. Disease lesions, however, can appear in three to four days after infection. With the ability to continue to produce the spores for over 20 days, rice blast lesions can be devastating to susceptible rice crops.Diagnostic Methods for Rice Blast at PaDIL Plant Biosecurity Toolbox Environment Rice blast is a significant problem in temperate regions and can be found in areas such as irrigated lowland and upland. Conditions conducive for rice blast include long periods of free moisture and/or high humidity, because leaf wetness is required for infection. Sporulation increases with high relative humidity and at , spore germination, lesion formation, and sporulation are at optimum levels. In terms of control, excessive use of nitrogen fertilization as well as drought stress increase rice susceptibility to the pathogen as the plant is placed in a weakened state and its defenses are low. Extended drain periods also favor infection as they aerate the soil, converting ammonium to nitrate and thus causing stress to rice crops, as well. Geographical distribution Wheat blast was found in the 2017-2018 rainy season in Zambia, in the Mpika district of the Muchinga Province. Management J. Sendra rice affected by Magnaporthe grisea. The fungus has been able to establish resistance to both chemical treatments and genetic resistance in some types of rice developed by plant breeders. It is thought that the fungus can achieve this by genetic change through mutation. In order to most effectively control infection by M. grisea, an integrated management program should be implemented to avoid overuse of a single control method and fight against genetic resistance. For example, eliminating crop residue could reduce the occurrence of overwintering and discourage inoculation in subsequent seasons. Another strategy would be to plant resistant rice varieties that are not as susceptible to infection by M. grisea. Knowledge of the pathogenicity of M. grisea and its need for free moisture suggest other control strategies such as regulated irrigation and a combination of chemical treatments with different modes of action. Managing the amount of water supplied to the crops limits spore mobility thus dampening the opportunity for infection. Chemical controls such as Carpropamid have been shown to prevent penetration of the appressoria into rice epidermal cells, leaving the grain unaffected. Importance Rice blast is the most important disease concerning rice crops in the world. Since rice is an important food source for much of the world, its effects have a broad range. It has been found in over 85 countries across the world and reached the United States in 1996. Every year the amount of crops lost to rice blast could feed 60 million people. Although there are some resistant strains of rice, the disease persists wherever rice is grown. The disease has never been eradicated from a region.Rice Blast at Cereal Knowledge Bank See also *Corn grey leaf spot, a similar disease in corn *Gray leaf spot, a similar disease in other grasses ReferencesFurther reading *California EPA.

It was released by United Artists and stars Richard Burton as Alexander along with a large ensemble cast. Italian composer Mario Nascimbene contributed the film score. Plot The Greek orator Demosthenes of Athens is advocating war to resist King Philip II of Macedon and his planned invasion and takeover of all the city-states of Greece. While Philip II is leading a campaign to take over Olynthus, he is informed that his spouse Olympias has borne him a son who, she claims, is \\"a god born of a god.\\" Philip is angry because he suspects that Olympias has committed adultery and that she was not impregnated by a god. However, General Parmenio advises the king to let Alexander grow up and succeed him. While growing up, Alexander receives instruction in history, mathematics, logic and other subjects from Aristotle in Mieza. Alexander is eager to rule and tells his tutor that like Achilles he would rather have a \\"short life with glory\\" than a \\"long life of obscurity.\\" Philip then decides to send Alexander to the Macedonian capital, Pella, as a regent to rule the city while Philip is away fighting wars. This is done to prevent Olympias from spreading rumors about her husband's death. Alexander uses this opportunity to rule in his own right ‚Äî he becomes neither a pawn of his mother nor his father. Alexander later joins Philip and they go on campaigns of conquest together against cities such as Athens in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. After the battle is won, Alexander demands that no Greek city-state ever bear arms against Pella and that they supply men, arms, and ships for the war against Persia. Philip II divorces Olympias, accusing her of \\"unfaithfulness\\", and marries Attalus's niece Eurydice, thereby making her the new queen. This move creates a chasm between Alexander and his father, not only because Alexander's mother has been repudiated but also because his succession hangs in the balance since some men in Philip's court see him as a bastard. Pausanias, a loyal friend of Alexander, assassinates Philip II, whereupon Alexander kills Pausanias then and there. At this juncture, Alexander claims the loyalty of all Macedonians and assumes the titles of his father. He tells the Macedonians that the Treaty of Corinth still stands. Memnon is exiled for not pledging his loyalty to Alexander. Alexander embarks on his mission to conquer the whole of Asia. Memnon, who is now in Darius III's court, advises him to retreat strategically and attack Alexander when his supplies run out. However, the lords of Persia underestimate the \\"boy\\" Alexander and resolve to fight him at the river Granicus. After the victory at the Granicus, Alexander goes to Phrygia and solves the challenge of the knot tied by King Gordius by cutting it with his sword. Before the battle in Babylon, Alexander states that the lunar eclipse which some of his men thought was a bad omen means that \\"the Persian moon will be eclipsed by the Macedonian Sun\\" with which Aristander the seer agrees. After being defeated, Darius III flees to the Caspian Gates to build a new army, but his dispirited commanders kill him. In his will, Darius tells Alexander, \\"Take my daughter, Roxane, for your wife...that our worlds may become as one.\\" Alexander then orders Persian lords who had committed regicide to be impaled upon stakes for their betrayal of their king. At a drunken revelry in Babylon, Alexander declares, \\"I am the son of God\\" (Zeus) and \\"the world is my domain....We will march to the end of the world.\\" In Athens, news reaches that Alexander is in India and is conquering there, whereupon Aeschines proclaims, \\"He has outdone the gods.\\" Alexander takes his status to heart, his arrogance and paranoia increasing to unstable proportions, but the bold young leader's conquests come to an end after he kills his close friend, Cleitus, with his spear following a drunken argument. Grief-stricken and humbled, Alexander returns to Babylon from India, losing many of his men in the process. He marries Roxane at Susa, but falls ill soon after. When asked upon his deathbed to whom he will leave his empire, Alexander whispers, \\"To the strongest.\\" Cast * Richard Burton as Alexander the Great * Fredric March as Philip II * Claire Bloom as Barsine * Danielle Darrieux as Olympias * Barry Jones as Aristotle * Harry Andrews as Darius * Stanley Baker as Attalus * Niall MacGinnis as Parmenion * Peter Cushing as Memnon * Michael Hordern as Demosthenes * Marisa de Leza as Eurydice * Gustavo Rojo as Cleitus the Black * Rub√©n Rojo as Philotas * Peter Wyngarde as Pausanias * Helmut Dantine as Nectenabus * William Squire as Aeschenes * Friedrich von Ledebur as Antipater * Virgilio Teixeira as Ptolemy * Teresa del R√≠o as Roxana * Julio Pe√±a as Arsites * Jos√© Nieto as Spithridates * Carlos Baena as Nearchus * Larry Taylor as Perdiccas * Jos√© Marco as Harpalus * Ricardo Valle as Hephaestion * Carmen Carulla as Stateira * Jes√∫s Luque as Aristander * Ramsay Ames as Drunken woman * Ellen Rossen as Amytis * Carlos Acevedo as Ochus Production Charlton Heston was sought for the title role, but turned it down, stating \\"Alexander is the easiest kind of picture to make badly\\".

During the Interregnum, England was under various forms of republican government (see Commonwealth of England; this article describes other facets of the Interregnum). Politics The politics of the period were dominated by the wishes of the Grandees (Senior Officers) of the New Model Army and their civilian supporters. They encouraged (or at least tolerated) several republican regimes. From 1649 until 1653 executive powers lay with Council of State, while legislative functions were carried out by the Rump Parliament. In 1653 the Grandees, with Oliver Cromwell in the lead, dismissed the Rump, and replaced it with a Nominated Assembly (nicknamed the Parliament of Saints and Barebone's Parliament) made up of 140 nominees, 129 from England and Wales, five from Scotland and six from Ireland. It proved to be as difficult for the executive to work with this parliament as it had with the Rump, so, after sitting for five months, members friendly to the Grandees engendered its dissolution on 12 December 1653. The Instrument of Government was adopted on 15 December 1653 and the pre-eminent Grandee Oliver Cromwell was installed as Lord Protector on the following day. The Instrument of Government granted executive power to the Lord Protector. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, it was to be held for life. It also required the calling of triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months. In January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the first Protectorate Parliament, ushering in a period of military rule by the Major Generals. The Instrument of Government was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice. However Oliver Cromwell died the next year and his nominated successor as Lord Protector, his son Richard, proved unable to govern effectively as various political parties strove to gain power. The Protectorate came to an end in May 1659 when the Grandees recalled the Rump Parliament, which authorised a Committee of Safety to replace Richard's Council of State. This ushered in a period of unstable government, which did not come to an end until February 1660 when General George Monck, the English military governor of Scotland, marched to London at the head of his troops, and oversaw the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II. Life during the Interregnum After the Parliamentarian victory in the Civil War, the Puritan views of the majority of Parliament and its supporters began to be imposed on the rest of the country. The Puritans advocated an austere lifestyle and restricted what they saw as the excesses of the previous regime. Most prominently, holidays such as Christmas and Easter were suppressed. Pastimes such as the theatre and gambling were also banned. However, some forms of art that were thought to be \\"virtuous\\", such as opera, were encouraged. These changes are often credited to Oliver Cromwell, though they were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament; and Cromwell, when he came to power, was a liberalising influence.Cromwell, Our Chief of Men by Lady Antonia Fraser, . Jews in England Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 in order to discuss the admission of Jews into England.\\"Cromwell and the Jews\\", The Oliver Cromwell Association. Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish synagogues and burial grounds was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for Jews in England improved in that they could no longer be prosecuted if caught worshipping, yet discrimination continued.  Radicals vs conservatives  Parliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the English Civil War. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the New Model Army. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.  Levellers  Led by John Lilburne, Levellers drew their main support from London and the Army. In the Agreement of the People, 1649, they asked for a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to and fair to all; and religious toleration. They wanted a more democratic society, although their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society. Levellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a Treasons Act was passed against them in 1649.  Diggers  Led by Gerrard Winstanley, Diggers wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of communism and anarchism, with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.  Religious sects  The breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete Presbyterian Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (see also English Dissenters) were Baptists, who advocated adult rebaptism; Ranters, who claimed that sin did not exist for the \\"chosen ones\\"; and Fifth Monarchy Men, who opposed all \\"earthly\\" governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a \\"government of saints\\". Despite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights. Catholics were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.  Conservatives  Conservatives were still dominant in both central government and local government. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry. Historical analysis The Interregnum was a relatively short but important period in the history of the British Isles. It saw a number of political experiments without any stable form of government emerging, largely due to the wide diversity in religious and political groups that had been allowed to flourish after the regicide of Charles I. The Puritan movement had evolved as a rejection of both real and perceived \\"Catholicisation\\" of the Church of England. When the Church of England was quickly disestablished by the Commonwealth Government, the question of what church to establish became a hotly debated subject. In the end, it was impossible to make all the political factions happy. During the Interregnum, Oliver Cromwell lost much of the support he had gained during the Civil War. Edward Sexby, previously a supporter of Cromwell's, felt disenfranchised by Cromwell's failure to abolish the aristocracy. In 1657, Silius Titus called for Cromwell's assassination in a co-authored pamphlet Killing No Murder under the pseudonym of William Allen. Sexby was captured when he returned to England and attempted to carry out the assassination described in Colonel Titus' book. Cromwell coerced Sexby into confessing authorship of the pamphlet and then imprisoned him in the Tower of London, where Sexby was driven to insanity, dying there less than a year later. High taxes required by the large standing army, kept due to the constant threats of Scottish and Irish rebellion, added to public resentment of Cromwell.

Beginning in 1868, the new Meiji government approved a series of laws that separated Japanese native kami worship, on one side, from Buddhism which had assimilated it, on the other.See Shinbutsu bunri When Buddhism was introduced from China in the Asuka period (6th century) the Japanese tried to reconcile the new beliefs with the older Shinto beliefs, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples (, tera) were attached to local Shinto shrines (, jinja) and vice versa and devoted to both kami and buddhas. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never quite fused, but remained inextricably linked to the present day through interaction. The depth of the influence from Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen in much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines seen today. The large worship halls and religious images, are themselves of Buddhist origin.See for example the article Shinto architectureTamura, page 21 The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues. The term shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and buddhas in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ry≈çbu Shint≈ç and Sann≈ç Shint≈ç.Inoue (2004:67-68) The term may have a negative connotation of bastardization and randomness.Teeuwen & Rambelli (2002:49) It is a yojijukugo phrase. Assimilation of Buddhism=Debate over the nature of Shinto There is no agreement among specialists as to the exact extent of fusion between the two religions. According to some scholars (for example Hirai Naofusa in Japan and Joseph Kitagawa in the US), Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, has existed as such continuously since its prehistory, and consists of all the peculiarly Japanese rituals and beliefs shaped by Japanese history from prehistory to the present. The term \\"Shinto\\" itself was coined in the 6th century to differentiate the previously disparate local religious practices from imported Buddhism.Kitagawa (1987:139) The opposing view of Japanese historian Toshio Kuroda. and his supporters is that Shinto as an independent religion was born only in the modern period after emerging in the Middle Ages as an offshoot of Buddhism,Breen and Teeuwen in Breen and Teeuwen (2000:4-5)Rambelli (2001) that Shinto as a distinct religion is a Meiji era invention of Japanese nationalist ideologues. (See the section The two religions after the Separation Order below.) Kuroda points out how the state formalization of kami rituals and the state ranking of shrines during the Heian period were not the emergence of Shinto as an independent religion, but an effort to explain local beliefs in Buddhist terms. He also says that, while it is true that the two characters for \\"Shinto\\" appear very early in the historical record (for example in the Nihon Shoki), this does not mean today's Shinto already existed as a religion because the same word was originally used for Taoism or even for religion in general. Indeed, according to Kuroda, many features of Shinto (for example the worshiping of mirrors and swords or the very structure of the Ise Shrine, Shinto's holiest and most important site) are typical of Taoism. The term \\"Shinto\\" in old texts therefore does not necessarily indicate something uniquely Japanese. Still according to this view, Shinto's rise as an autonomous religion was gradual and started to become evident with the emergence of Yoshida Kanetomo's Yoshida Shint≈ç. The term Shinto started to be used with today's meaning of kami worship only later during the Edo period. During the same era, Kokugaku theorists like Motoori Norinaga tried to separate it intellectually from Buddhism, preparing the ground for the final schism of the Meiji Restoration. According to the first view, then, the two religions were at the time of their first meeting already formed and independent and thereafter just coexisted with non-essential exchanges. According to the second, Buddhism, meeting local kami beliefs in Japan, actually produced today's Shinto.Sueki (2007:2)Kuroda (1981:7) Assimilation process Prince Sh≈çtoku, early proponent of Buddhism and instrumental in the defeat of the Mononobe Clan. The fusion of Buddhism with the local kami worship started as soon as the first arrived in Japan. Mononobe no Okoshi wrote, \\"The kami of our land will be offended if we worship a foreign kami.\\"Tamura, pages 26 to 33. Mononobe saw Gautama Buddha as just another kami. Foreign kami were called or , and understood to be more or less like local ones. Initially, therefore, the conflict between the two religions was political, and not religious, in nature, a struggle between the progressive Soga clan, that wanted a more international outlook for the country, and the conservative Mononobe clan, that wanted the contrary. Buddhism was not passive in the assimilation process, but was itself ready to assimilate and be assimilated. By the time it entered Japan it was already syncretic, having adapted to and amalgamated with other religions and cultures in India, China, and the Korean Peninsula.Encyclopedia of Shinto, Combinatory Kami, accessed on October 13, 2008. Quotation: \\"Buddhism was already product of a complex process of adaptation and amalgamation with other belief systems in India, China, and the Korean peninsula.\\" For example, already while in India, it had absorbed Hindu divinities like Brahma (Bonten in Japanese) and Indra (Taishakuten). When it arrived in Japan, it already had a disposition towards producing the combinatory gods that the Japanese would call . Searching for the origins of a kami in Buddhist scriptures was felt to be nothing out of the ordinary. However, if monks didn't doubt the existence of kami, they certainly saw them as inferior to their buddhas.Bernhard Scheid Hindu gods had already been treated analogously: they had been thought of as un-illuminated and prisoners of sa·πÉsƒÅra. Buddhist claims of superiority encountered resistance, and monks tried to overcome them by deliberately integrating kami into their system. Several strategies to do this were developed and deployed. The process of amalgamation is usually divided into three stages.Mark Teeuwen in Breen and Teeuwen (2000:95-96) The first articulation of the difference between Japanese religious ideas and Buddhism, and the first effort to reconcile the two is attributed to Prince Sh≈çtoku (574‚Äì622), and the first signs that the differences between the two world views were beginning to become manifest to the Japanese in general appear at the time of Emperor Tenmu (673‚Äì86). Accordingly, one of the first efforts to reconcile Shinto and Buddhism was made in the 8th century during the Nara period founding so-called , that is shrine-temples, complexes comprising both a shrine and a temple.Sat≈ç Makoto Behind the inclusion in a Shinto shrine of Buddhist religious objects was the idea that the kami were lost beings in need of liberation through Buddhism like any other sentient beings. Kami were thought to be subject to karma and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks. A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, telling him about his suffering. To improve the kami's karma through rites and the reading of sutras, Buddhist monks would build temples next to kami shrines. Such groupings had been created by the 7th century, for example at Usa Jing≈´ in Ky≈´sh≈´, where Hachiman was worshiped together with Maitreya. The building of temples at shrines produced shrine-temple complexes, which in turn accelerated the amalgamation process. As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had until then been just an open-air site became Buddhist style groupings of buildings. At the end of the same century, in what is considered the second stage of the amalgamation, the kami Hachiman was declared a dharmapala and, later, a bodhisattva. Shrines for him started to be built at temples (the so-called \\"temple-shrines\\"), marking an important step ahead in the process of amalgamation of kami and Buddhism. When the great buddha at T≈çdai-ji in Nara was built, there was also erected within the temple grounds a shrine for Hachiman ‚Äì according to the legend because of a wish expressed by the kami himself. Hachiman considered this his reward for having helped the temple find the gold and copper mines from which the metal for the great statue had come. After this, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary kami (. Honji suijaku theory The third and final stage of the fusion took place in the 9th century with the development of the theory according to which Japanese kami are emanations of buddhas, bodhisattvas or devas who mingle with human beings to lead them to the Buddhist Way. This theory was the keystone of the whole shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç edifice and therefore the foundation of Japanese religion for many centuries. Because of it, most kami changed from potentially dangerous spirits to be improved through contact with the Buddhist law to local emanations of buddhas and bodhisattvas which possess a wisdom of their own. Buddhas and kami were now indivisible twins. The status of kami however changed dramatically according to the sect. At one extreme one was Shingon Buddhism's Ry≈çbu Shint≈ç thinkers, who considered kami and buddhas equivalent in power and dignity.Scheid, Shinto im Mittelalter However, not all kami were emanations of some buddha. Some, often called , usually dangerous and angry, had no Buddhist counterpart. Among them were the tengu, or animals possessing magic, as the fox (kitsune) or . Even these unholy and inferior \\"true kami\\" however attracted the attention of Ry≈çbu Shinto thinkers, which resulted in theories which declared them to be manifestations of Vairocana and Amaterasu. On the other hand, Pure Land Buddhism was somewhat different because it at first renounced kami-worship due to the notion that kami were inferior to the buddhas. However, the largest Pure Land branch, J≈çdo Shinsh≈´, still encouraged the worship of kami despite the fact that faith in Amida Buddha should be the primary practice. Furthermore, under the influence of Rennyo and other leaders, J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ accepted the mainstream honji suijaku beliefs and the spiritual relationship between kami and the buddhas and bodhisattvas.Kenneth Doo Lee (2007), The Prince and the Monk: Shotoku Worship in Shinran's Buddhism; James C. Dobbins (1989), Jodo Shinshu: Shin Buddhism in Medieval Japan, pp. 142-143. Shinbutsu kakuri The two religions however never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity within a difficult, largely un-systematized and tense relationship.Sueki (2007:7-8) This relationship existed, rather than between two systems, between particular kami and particular buddhas. The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities. Besides shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç there was always the other side of the coin of continued separation. In fact, the term in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency that existed in Japan to keep some kami separate from Buddhism.Rambelli and Teeuwen (2002:21-22) While some kami were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same kami in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism. This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole. It must not be confused with shinbutsu bunri (\\"separation of kami and buddhas\\") or with haibutsu kishaku (\\"abolish buddhas and destroy ShƒÅkyamuni\\"), which are phenomena recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it. The practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of kami practices into Buddhism. Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and Kamo Shrines allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of kami.  Buddhism and Shinto after the Separation Order  During the Shinbutsu bunri, the attempt to separate Shinto from Buddhism, temples and shrines were forcefully separated by law with the of 1868. However, in spite of more than a century of formal separation of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist Inari shrines.Toyokawa Inari accessed on June 6, 2008 During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, shrine-temples (jing≈´-ji) were destroyed while temple-shrines (chinjusha) were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is Seiganto-ji), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still have at least a small one.Breen and Teeuwen in Breen and Teeuwen (2000:7) Prominent religious institutions in both camps still give evidence of integration of the two religions. The great Kench≈ç-ji temple, number one of the Kamakura's great Zen temples (the Five Mountain System) includes two shrines. One of the islands in the right-side pond of Tsurugaoka Hachimang≈´ in Kamakura hosts a subshrine dedicated to goddess Benzaiten, a form of Saraswati. For this reason, the sub- shrine was removed in 1868 at the time of the Shinbutsu Bunri, but rebuilt in 1956.Kamiya (2008: 18 - 19) Shinto and Buddhism still have a symbiotic relationship of interdependence, particularly concerning funeral rites (entrusted to Buddhism) and weddings (usually left to Shinto or sometimes Christianity). The separation of the two religions is therefore considered only superficial, and shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç is still an accepted practice. Still, the separation of the two religions is felt to be real by the public. Scholar Karen Smyers comments, \\"The surprise of many of my informants regarding the existence of Buddhist Inari temples shows the success of the government's attempt to create separate conceptual categories regarding sites and certain identities, although practice remains multiple and nonexclusive\\".Smyers, pag. 219 See also *Haibutsu kishaku *Shinbutsu bunri *Shinbutsu kakuri NotesReferences      * Dismantling stereotypes surrounding Japan's sacred entities by Fabio Rambelli, Japan Times, July 15, 2001 excerpted from Monumenta Nipponica, 56:2 * Category:Shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç Category:Japanese historical terms Category:Shinto in Japan Category:Buddhism in Japan Category:Religious syncretism in Japan Category:History of Shinto Category:Buddhism in the Heian period Category:Buddhism in the Nara period Category:Buddhism in the Kamakura period Category:Buddhism in the Edo period ","title":"Shinbutsu-sh≈´g≈ç"},{"id":"1870693","text":"The East Madagascar Current is an oceanic flow feature near Madagascar.

Being founded in 1899 and initially offering a single course in civil engineering, it grew to become a major technical Czech university with over 24,000 students enrolled at 8 faculties and 2 university institutes. History The Jesuits dominated university education in Moravia at the beginning of 18th century as they controlled the University of Olomouc. The focus on theology and philosophy was unwelcomed by the Moravian nobility. The nobility initiated commencement of law education at the University of Olomouc in 1679. Later in 1725 the Moravian nobility enforced establishment of the Academy of Nobility in Olomouc. Law and economy, mathematics, geometry, civil and military architecture, history and geography were lectured there. As it aimed to promote knighthood also foreign languages, dance, swordsmanship and equitation were taught there. The Academy was in Olomouc until 1847, when it was relocated to Brno, where it became bases for what was later to become the University of Technology.M. Pojsl: Olomouc - mal√© dƒõjiny mƒõsta, Olomouc, 2002 Due to extinction of the University in Olomouc, there was no institution that would provide an academic education in Moravia and only one technical school, besides German one, could not cover the lack of need, so the students mostly left to Prague, Vienna or Krak√≥w. Related to this situation the voices that called for the establishment of university, but not regional one in Olomouc but in the state capital ‚Äì Brno, grew stronger. The Moravian Germans rejected the second Czech university and thus led to the many quarrels (the settlement occurred after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1919 by the establishment of Masaryk University). In September 1899 the disputes were solved by founding the Imperial Czech Technical University of Franz Joseph in Brno. In the beginning the university was settled in Augustine Street and had to make do with 4 professors and 47 students who could study only Civil Engineering. In the following year (1900) the teaching of the field of machine engineering was started and followed by the cultural engineering (landscaping), electrical engineering and chemical engineering. After World War I it was also possible to study architecture. In 1911 the university was moved into a newly built luxurious building in Veve≈ô√≠ Street which is still used by the Faculty of Civil Engineering. In the interwar period it was connected with the German Technical University and was renamed the Brno University of Technology. The school has used the name of the University of Technology of Dr. E. Benes for a short time. After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and installing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, all Czech universities, including the Czech Technical University, were forced to close (see International Students' Day). After the end of the war in 1945, the university was restored to its pre-war state, also taking over buildings of the German Technical University in Brno which was closed. After the war the school was reopened under the older name the University of Technology of Dr. E. Benes. The school was ceased to exist in 1951; some parts were transferred to the newly established Military Technical Academy. The only faculties that provided civilian training remained Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture Faculty, both under the name College of Engineering. Already in 1956 the university activity was gradually restored under the present name Brno University of Technology. Today's appearance was more or less stabilized in 1961. After 1989 there was a reorganization of certain faculties and the emergence of many new ones. There was restored The Faculty of Chemistry (1992) and in addition to the technical fields, BUT focused on economy (Faculty of Business founded in 1992) and arts (Faculty of Fine Arts, founded in 1993). Another milestone is associated with the year 2000 when the BUT separates two faculties deployed in Zl√≠n - Faculty of Technology and Faculty of Management and Economics - and thus established the Tomas Bata University. The most recent significant organizational change is the splitting of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication and the Faculty of Information Technology which occurred in 2002. Most of the BUT buildings are now located in the area under Palacky Hill in the city district Kralovo Pole. There are the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Business, Faculty of Chemistry and a new building of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication as well as two college campuses. Faculty of Information Technology is located in a former Carthusian monastery in Bozetechova Street and in the new complex across the street. The Faculty of Civil Engineering is located in an extensively reconstructed building in the Veveri Street. Faculty of Architecture is located in the Porici Street, Faculty of Fine Arts in the Rybarska Street. BUT also uses the buildings in the Udolni Street and the third college campus in Kounicova Street. Rector's Offices are located in a newly renovated Baroque building in Antoninska Street. In the course of more than 110 years BUT has matured into an internationally recognized institution offering education in a broad spectrum of fields ranging from technical and scientific disciplines through economics to the arts.VUTBR.cz Authorities The head of the university is the rector who is represented by five prorectors in various fields of activity. Financial matters of BUT are in the hands of the bursar, communication and promotion is the business of the public relations officer in cooperation with the Unit of external relations. Important documents and guidelines are discussed and approved by the Academic Senate which consisted of an employee and a student chamber. Scientific direction of BUT determines the Scientific Council, acting as BUT experts, other universities and industry. Each of faculty is governed by dean and his vice-deans. Also, the faculties have their academic senates which deal exclusively with the laws of the faculties. Similarly, the faculties have their own scientific council. There are a number of student organizations in BUT, for historical reasons called the Student Unions. Each Faculty has its student chamber which represents students in the Academic Senate - students have the opportunity to participate in the management of their faculty. * Rectorate ‚Äî prof.

During its existence the faculty was merged with the Faculty of civil Engineering. Currently provides training in architecture and urban design and has about three hundred students.  Faculty of Chemistry (FC)  Faculty of Chemistry Teaching Chemistry at BUT dates back to 1911 when there was established Department of Chemistry at the Czech Technical University. The development was interrupted in 1951 by converting BUT to the Military Technical Academy. The restoration of the teaching of chemistry was reached in 1992. Faculty realizes bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs in chemistry and food industry.  Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication (FEEC)  Building of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication Studying at the faculty is focused on a wide range of scientific areas: control technology and robotics, biomedical engineering, power electronics and electrical engineering, electrotechnology and electronics, microelectronics, radioelectronics and teleinformatics.  Faculty of Information Technology (FIT)  Faculty of Information Technology Already in 1964 the department of automatic computers was established in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, lately the institute of informatics detached which was transformed in 2002 into an independent faculty of information technology. FIT campus is located in a former Carthusian monastery and the former estate. The faculty consists of four institutes: * Department of Computer Systems * Department of Information Systems * Department of Intelligent Systems * Department of Computer Graphics and Multimedia The faculty offers two basic levels of study - a three-year bachelor and two-year master's degree program. The third level is the doctoral degree program.  Faculty of Business and Management (FBM)  Faculty of Business and Management One of the youngest BUT faculty focuses on the economy and business fields of study. In 1992 the faculty was separated from the original Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Besides bachelor's, master's and doctoral programs in this field the faculty offers in cooperation with foreign universities postgraduate MBA studies. About 3 000 students study management, accounting, corporate finance, taxation and managerial science.  Faculty of Civil Engineering (FCE)  Faculty of Civil Engineering in Veve≈ô√≠ Street FCE is the oldest faculty of Brno University of Technology and the biggest one with its number of students ‚Äì 6 500. In 1899 the university started its activities with this branch and that faculty was the only one which survived a violent change - transformation BUT into the Military Technical Academy in 1951. Students can study in four programmes in Czech language at this faculty: * Civil Engineering * Urban Engineering * Surveying and Cartography * Architecture and one programme in English language: * Civil Engineering  Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME)  Faculty of Mechanical Engineering - before reconstruction in 2014-2018 The opening of the engineering department was in 1900 and herewith it is the second oldest faculty of the BUT. In the past there was taught energy branch from which subsequently became an independent faculty of electrical engineering. The faculty offers study of: * Engineering * Applied Sciences in Engineering * Mechanical Engineering * Production Systems * Industrial Design * Industrial Engineering * Machines and Equipment * Applied Natural Sciences * Physical and Materials Engineering * Metrology and Quality Assurance Testing  Faculty of Fine Arts (FFA)  Faculty of Fine Arts On the contrary, one of the youngest BUT faculties is the Faculty of Fine Arts. In 1993 it was founded from the institute of fine arts which was based in the faculty of architecture a year earlier. As the number of students (3 thousands) it is the smallest faculty of current BUT. Some of the study programs are: * painting * sculpture * graphics * graphic design * industrial design * conceptual tendencies * VMP (multimedia, video- performance).  University institutes = Institute of Forensic Engineering (IFE)  The aim of the institute is teaching forensic experts in master's degree programs - Venture engineering and Forensic engineering (expert engineering in transportation and real estate). It is possible to study The Forensic engineering program as a doctoral study. In preparation is the transformation of the institute to the separate department faculty with the temporary name the Faculty of Forensic Engineering.  Centre for Sports Activities (CESA)  Sports in BUT In cooperation with the Faculty of Business CESA provides courses of study in Management of Physical Culture. Students can choose from more than 40 sports like basketball, swimming, athletics, golf or diving.CESA.vutbr.cz Studies The school is a holder of the European Commission ECTS certificates (European Credit Transfer System) - Label and DS (Diploma Supplement) Label for the period 2009-2013, reflecting the appreciation of quality of the university education in keeping with the principles of the Bologna Declaration. ECTS Label supports studying abroad at universities around the world. DS Label Certificate was awarded for the correct free award of the Diploma Supplement to all graduates of the principles of the European Commission. Brno University of Technology offers its students: * 74 study programs (of which 15 are accredited in English) * Participation in major international and scientific projects * Study at foreign and partner universities * More than 40 sports in 5 own specialized sports centers * Accommodation in halls of residences for the majority of applicantsSKM.vutbr.cz * 9 libraries Study programs: * Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Forensic engineering * Information Technology * Chemistry * Economics and Management * Fine arts * Architecture Cooperation with foreign institutions: * Framework agreements with 90 universities around the world * International educational research and development programs Participation in EU programs for education: * CEEPUS * LLP / Erasmus * TEMPUS * Joint and double degree programs Lifelong learning: * Is provided by faculties in their courses * MBA education (Master of Business Administration) Lifelong Learning Institute: * provides counseling, information and organizational services * offers training and consultancy * organizes courses and seminars for seniors at the University of the Third Age  Science and Research  Research activities at the Brno University of Technology are realized in cooperation with national and international projects, programs, grants and research centers. BUT intensively cooperates with other universities and institutions, with the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and private companies. The efforts of integration of teaching and scientific research are supported by application sector with which new curricula is prepared.

The curve had a maximum permitted speed of , but the express had been travelling at more than . The train was completely derailed and smashed into a milk train and a light engine, killing 28 people.  Overview  The accident occurred at the same time as a short cut of the rival Great Western Railway was opening, and it was claimed that the driver of the crashed train was trying to show that his railway was capable of competitive speeds. It was also rumoured that passengers ‚Äì mostly rich New Yorkers travelling to London from the transatlantic port at Plymouth ‚Äì had bribed the driver to run the train as fast as possible, but there was not any evidence of this and if anything the train had lost time earlier. Conversely, it was stated that drivers often ran through Salisbury very fast to \\"get a run\\" at the following hill. The crashed train's engine was a new LSWR L12 class 4-4-0 No. 421 with a higher centre of gravity than the earlier T9 class. The most likely cause of the accident is that the driver simply did not realise the level of risk he was running, particularly as this was the first occasion on which he had taken a non-stopping train through Salisbury. Also, steam locomotives at this time, and for half a century afterwards, were not fitted with speedometers. As a result of the crash, all trains were required to stop at Salisbury station from that point onwards (the boat train at the time had no passenger stops from Plymouth to London Waterloo, although locomotives were changed at Templecombe). The speed limit on the curve east of Salisbury was also reduced to , a limit still in effect today. There is a memorial tablet to the 28 dead (including the driver, two firemen and the guard) in Salisbury Cathedral. The accident was the second in a series of three derailments due to excessive speed at night in a 16-month period. The others were at Grantham 1906 and Shrewsbury 1907. All three resulted in deaths, including the footplate crews; the cause in each case was recorded as Driver Error but there has been much speculation since. In 2006, historian Frogg Moody organised a memorial service at Salisbury Railway Station.

The site had had an exponential growth rate and according to its FAQ, as of May 2007 had amassed over five million readers since inception. The majority of the posts on the site were authored by its founding bloggers, though many posts were also authored by \\"regular contributors.\\" The site also functioned as a public forum on South Asian issues and boasted a wide range of commenters hailing from diverse geographic locations, although predominantly the United States and England. On March 15, 2012, the site announced its closure starting April 1, 2012, citing diversified evolution of blogosphere and personal engagements of its writers as reasons for shutting down. The title is a pun on the Sepoy Mutiny, or First War of Indian Independence in 1857, a violent widespread movement by sepoys against the British Raj during the latter's imperialist rule in India. Sepia, a shade of brown, was intended as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the tone of South Asian skin. Social context Sepia Mutiny discussed issues facing first and second generation immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. The goal of the site was in effect to capture the position of the Indian-American diaspora as it emigrates to foreign nations and primarily North America. Sepia Mutiny had become a focal point of discussion for Desis on the Internet in the United States and, to some extent, other parts of the South Asian diaspora. Sepia Mutiny's emergence was part of the increase in mainstream diasporic Desi writing and creative arts outside the traditional genres ‚Äî the effects of which can be seen in Indian subcontinent and spills over to the America, Canada, and the United Kingdom, given the presence of Desis. A similar trend was seen at sites like Badmash, an online comic that gained notice for its Amitabh for President campaign, South Asian magazines such as ABCDlady, as well as the greater prominence of Bollywood films in the United States. Crossovers movies such as Bride and Prejudice, Bollywood/Hollywood and Monsoon Wedding have helped the western audience understand the desi culture. The blog also addressed the growing prominence of South Asian Americans like Bobby Jindal, Russell Peters, Sanjay Gupta, Neel Kashkari and Kal Penn, among others, as they enter the mainstream of American culture. South Asians and American politics Part of the focus of Sepia Mutiny was to bring attention to the expanding involvement of South Asian Americans as a political body in the United States, especially in the 2004 and 2006 congressional and presidential elections. A lot of attention was given to the controversy surrounding Virginia United States Senate election, 2006, a scandal that erupted due to comments by former Republican Senator for Virginia, George Allen, in which he used the word macaca to refer to S.R. Sidarth, an Indian American aide working for his opponent's Senatorial campaign. Sepia Mutiny also drew attention to other public figures in America who have used racial slurs against Indians in the past such as Vice-President Joe Biden and major radio personalities in Philadelphia and New York City. The bloggers at Sepia Mutiny often focused on the emergence of Indian-Americans in the Western political structure. The site served as fertile ground for discussion regarding the actions of these politicians in the United States, ranging from Bobby Jindal to Nikki Haley to Shahid Malik. Violence against South Asians Another focus of the blog had been to highlight violence against South Asians ‚Äî a phenomenon which has become more common since the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.Hate violence  Alliance of South Asians Taking Action (ASATA) The site, however, broadened its awareness of violence beyond simple hate crimes. The recent tragedy at Virginia Tech was discussed from a South Asian perspective with posts about South Asian shooting victims Professor G. V. Loganathan and student Minal \\"Minu\\" Panchal, victims the mainstream media failed to talk in depth about. They also were one of the few media sources that addressed the recent assault of a young Indian American National Lawyer's Guild observer Sanjukta Paul during the Los Angeles May Day M√™l√©e at MacArthur Park by a member of the Los Angeles Police Department.Accidental Blogger: May Day : Up Close and Personal South Asian literature, music, and the arts In the spring and summer of 2006, a number of Sepia Mutiny posts debated the allegations of plagiarism in Kaavya Viswanathan's novel, How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life. Posts related to Viswanathan were widely cited by other blogs and the mass-media, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. The site has also highlighted South Asian authors that have come to attention in the United States and abroad, including Booker Prize winners Salman Rushdie and Kiran Desai, and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Jhumpa Lahiri. There was considerable discussion about South Asians in the music industry, ranging from recent Bollywood soundtracks to mainstream Western musicians, such as recent American Idol contestant Sanjaya Malakar. The site also provides coverage of the long history in the music industry of fusing Eastern and Western styles of music, as can be seen through the work of artists like Panjabi MC, Raghav, and Talvin Singh, and unique new niche genres such as Desi Ska and Hindu Rock. In addition Indian American film and television were highlighted on the blog. Be it mainstream releases to American audiences like Harold and Kumar, Salaam Bombay, and the Elements Trilogy, or lesser known work such as the cult-classic American Desi, Sepia Mutiny bloggers covered it. South Asian Americans and the Indian subcontinent In addition to being aware of issues faced by South Asians outside of India, Sepia Mutiny was also cognizant of current events within the subcontinent as well. Many posts discuss current events in India, including controversial topics such as terrorism, communal tensions, AIDS, and even the rapid evolution of the Bollywood film industry. Sepia Mutiny's comprehensive international awareness served to highlight that the changing South Asian culture in the Western world is often mirrored by reciprocal evolution on the Indian subcontinent itself.

Techniques  The procedure involves running a surgical-grade cord through the fistula tract so that the cord creates a loop that joins up outside the fistula. The cord provides a path that allows the fistula to drain continuously while it is healing, rather than allowing the exterior of the wound to close over. Keeping the fistula tract open can help prevent the trapping of pus or other infectious material in the wound. The procedure was mentioned by Hippocrates. Setons can be tied tightly or loosely and with different materials, depending on the anatomical location of the fistulae and what may be medically required. A seton might be tied loosely as a palliative measure to avoid septic and painful exacerbations, or as temporary measure before surgical excision as in fistulotomy or fistulectomy. In some types of fistulae, a seton may be tied with more tension and tightened periodically. In this case, the seton loop will slowly cut through tissue inside the loop while scarring behind the loop, essentially \\"pulling out\\" the fistula without surgery.

It is a yojijukugo phrase.  Background before 1868  Until the end of the Edo period, in 1868, Shinto and Buddhism were intimately connected in what was called shinbutsu-sh≈´g≈ç (Á•û‰ªèÁøíÂêà), to the point that the same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. However, the tendency to oppose Buddhism as a foreign import and to uphold Shinto as the native religion can be seen already during the early modern era, partly as a nationalistic reaction.. In a broad sense, the term shinbutsu bunri indicates the effects of the anti-Buddhist movement that, from the middle of the Edo period onwards, accompanied the spread of Confucianism, the growth of studies of ancient Japanese literature and culture (kokugaku), and the rise of Shinto-based nationalism, All these movements had reasons to oppose Buddhism. Policy of the Meiji government In a narrower sense, shinbutsu bunri refers to the policy of separating Shinto and Buddhism pursued by the new Meiji government with the of 1868. This order triggered the haibutsu kishaku, a violent anti-Buddhist movement that caused the forcible closure of thousands of temples, the confiscation of their land, the forced return of many monks to lay life or their transformation into Shinto priests, and the destruction of numerous books, statues and other Buddhist artefacts.. Even bronze bells were melted down to make cannons. However, the process of separation stalled by 1873, the government's intervention in support of the order was relaxed, and even today the separation is still only partially complete: many major Buddhist temples retain small shrines dedicated to tutelary Shinto kami, and some Buddhist figures, such as the goddess Kannon, are revered in Shinto shrines.. The policy failed in its short-term aims and was ultimately abandoned, but it was successful in the long term in creating a new religious status quo in which Shinto and Buddhism are perceived as different and independent.  Details of the policy  The new government that seized power in 1868 saw shinbutsu bunri as a way to reduce the immense wealth and power of the Buddhist sects. At the same time, it was supposed to give Shinto, and especially its cult of the Emperor, time to grow into an effective vehicle for nationalism. A first order issued by the Jinguji Muka in April 1868 ordered the defrocking of shas≈ç and bett≈ç (shrine monks performing Buddhist rites at Shinto shrines). A few days later, the Daij≈çkan banned the application of Buddhist terminology such as gongen to Japanese kami and the veneration of Buddhist statues in shrines. Next came a ban on applying the Buddhist term Daibosatsu (Great Bodhisattva) to the syncretic kami Hachiman at the Iwashimizu Hachiman-g≈´ and Usa Hachiman-g≈´ shrines. In the final stage, all the defrocked bett≈ç and shas≈ç were told to become \\"shrine priests\\" (kannushi) and return to their shrines. Also, monks of the Nichiren sect were told not to refer to some deities as kami.  Consequences of the policy  The campaign ultimately failed to destroy the influence of Buddhism on the Japanese people, who still needed funerals, graves and ancestral rites, all services traditionally provided by Buddhism. The state's first attempt to influence religious life therefore resulted in failure. In 1873, the government admitted that the effort to elevate Shinto above Buddhism had failed. However, the government did cause the diffusion of the idea that Shinto was the true religion of the Japanese, finally revealed after remaining for a long time hidden behind Buddhism. In recent years, many historians have come to believe that the syncretism of kami and Buddhas (shinbutsu-sh≈´g≈ç) was just as authentically Japanese. The government was successful in creating the impression that Shinto and Buddhism in Japan are completely independent religions. Most Japanese today are unaware that some of their customary religious practices cannot be understood outside the context of the syncretism of kami and Buddhas. In discussing some Japanese Buddhist temples dedicated to the cult of kami Inari, Shinto scholar Karen Smyers comments: Haibutsu kishaku Although the government did not explicitly order the closing of temples, the destruction of Buddhist property or the defrocking of Buddhist priests and nuns, they were often interpreted as implying it, and the haibutsu kishaku movement soon spread across the country. The shinbutsu bunri policy was itself the direct cause of serious damage to important cultural properties. Because mixing the two religions was now forbidden, shrines and temples had to give away some of their treasures.. For example, the giant , wooden statues of guardian beings, at the entrance of the Tsurugaoka Hachiman- g≈´, a shrine in Kamakura, were objects of Buddhist worship and therefore illegal where they were, so they were sold to Jufuku-ji, where they still stand today. The shrine also had to destroy Buddhism-related buildings, for example its tah≈çt≈ç tower, its , and its . Many Buddhist temples were simply closed, for example Zenk≈ç-ji, to which the now-independent Meigetsu-in used to belong. Another consequence of the policy was the creation of so-called \\"invented traditions\\". To avoid the destruction of material illegal under the new rules, Shinto and Buddhist priests invented traditions, genealogies and other information that justified its presence. Later, awareness of their origin was often lost, causing considerable confusion among historians.

Contrary to a popular assumption, it is not a \\"continuing Methodist Church,\\" formed as a result of the merger in 1977 of Congregationalist, Methodist and Presbyterian congregations to form the Uniting Church in Australia. It was never a part of the merger negotiations with those bodies that formed the Uniting Church, though some members and ministers, unhappy with the Basis of Union, switched allegiance to the Wesleyans. Recent times The Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia saw increased growth in the 1980s, particularly in Queensland , much of this as a result of the church planting strategies of the Rev. Don Hardgrave , who also wrote the only denominational history of the church. As well as aiming at new convert growth, Wesleyan Methodists have welcomed into their membership those seeking an alternative to more liberal Protestant denominations, as well as Pentecostals looking for a church more grounded in historic Christianity. The 45th National Conference held in January 2004 reported 77 local churches, 96 ordained ministers, 2017 members and an average main Sunday service attendance of 3702 persons. From the late 1990s, the Australian church has fostered and encouraged the emergence of Wesleyan Methodist churches in New Zealand, the Solomon Islands, and Bougainville, Papua New Guinea. At the 2008 South Pacific Convention and National Conference held at Philip Island, Victoria, a new National Superintendent was appointed, Rev. Lindsay Cameron. Lindsay brought to the position a desire to see the denomination strengthened through the upholding and proclamation of the uniqueness of Wesleyan doctrinal teaching. The 2012 National Conference elected the Rev. Rex Rigby to the position of National Superintendent. He is the denomination's first indigenous leader. Theology The church is theologically conservative, Arminian in theology and typically non-charismatic.\\"The 'tongues' common in charismatic circles are viewed as psychological rather than Biblical, and the use of such are forbidden in church meetings.\\" Rowland Ward and Robert Humphreys, Religious Bodies in Australia, 3rd edition (Wantirna, Victoria: New Melbourne Press, 1995), 136. It appreciates both its revivalist and holiness heritage as well as its roots in John Wesley's Anglicanism. Along with Nazarenes and the Salvation Army, it has a strong commitment to the ordination of women, a position that in part arises out of its interpretive approach to the Bible and in part out of its revivalist heritage. Historically, the church may be seen both as a new religious movement, emerging out of the post-war context of greater engagement between Australians and Americans and at the same time as a continuation of the long-standing Holiness and Revivalist strain within Australian evangelicalism. The associated Kingsley College, Melbourne provides a ministry training program that offers four awards from Certificate IV to Graduate Certificate. Kingsley College delivers training under the auspices of Unity College Australia RTO 6330. Kingsley College has been the ministry training arm of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Australia since 1949. That training of lay people and ministerial candidates continues through Kingsley Community training centres located around Australia.

International, Transnational & Comparative Law Journal. Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 4 April 2019 History FATF was formed by the 1989 G7 Summit in Paris to combat the growing problem of money laundering. The task force was charged with studying money laundering trends, monitoring legislative, financial and law enforcement activities taken at the national and international level, reporting on compliance, and issuing recommendations and standards to combat money laundering. At the time of its formation, FATF had 16 members, which by 2016 had grown to 37. In its first year, FATF issued a report containing forty recommendations to more effectively fight money laundering. These standards were revised in 2003 to reflect evolving patterns and techniques in money laundering. The mandate of the organisation was expanded in 2001 to include terrorist financing following the September 11 terror attacks.  FATF Secretariat  The FATF Secretariat is located at the OECD headquarters in Paris. Since November 2015, the FATF Secretariat has been led by the Executive Secretary David Lewis.  FATF Recommendations=Creation and ongoing maintenance Together, the Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and eight (now nine) Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts. They set out the principles for action and allow countries a measure of flexibility in implementing these principles according to their particular circumstances and constitutional frameworks. Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures. There are multiple groups to organise the Recommendations; AML/CFT Policies and Coordination, Money Laundering and Confiscation, Terrorist Financing and Financial of Proliferation, Preventive Measures, Transparency and Beneficial Ownership of Legal Persons and Arrangements, Powers and Responsibilities of Competent Authorities and other Institutional Measures, and International Cooperation. In February 2012, the FATF codified its recommendations and Interpretive Notes into one document that maintains SR VIII (renamed Recommendation 8), and also includes new rules on weapons of mass destruction, corruption and wire transfers (Recommendation 16). =Forty recommendations on money laundering= The FATF's Forty Recommendations on money laundering of 1990 are the primary policies issued by FATF and the Nine Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF). The Recommendations are seen globally as the world standard in anti-money laundering as well many countries have made a commitment to put the Forty Recommendations in place. The Recommendations cover the criminal justice system and law enforcement, international co- operation, and the financial system and its regulation. The FATF completely revised the Forty Recommendations in 1996 and 2003. By 1996 the Recommendations had to be updated to include more than just drug-money laundering, as well as to keep up with changing techniques. The 2003 Forty Recommendations require states, among other things, to: *Implement relevant international conventions *Criminalise money laundering and enable authorities to confiscate the proceeds of money laundering *Implement customer due diligence (e.g., identity verification), record keeping and suspicious transaction reporting requirements for financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions *Establish a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports, and *Cooperate internationally in investigating and prosecuting money laundering =NINE Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing= The FATF has issued Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. In October 2001 the FATF issued the original eight Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing, following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Among the measures, Special Recommendation VIII (SR VIII) specifically targeted non-profit organisations. This was followed by the International Best Practices Combating the Abuse of Non-Profit Organisations in 2002, released one month before the U.S. Department of Treasury's Anti-Terrorist Financing Guidelines, and the Interpretive Note for SR VIII in 2006. A ninth Special Recommendation was added later. In 2003 the Recommendations, as well as the 9 Special Recommendations were adjusted for the second time. The Recommendations, and Special Recommendations were advocated by over 180 countries.  Compliance mechanism In February 2004 (Updated as of February 2009) the FATF published a reference document Methodology for Assessing Compliance with the FATF 40 Recommendations and the FATF 9 Special Recommendations. The 2009 Handbook for Countries and Assessors outlines criteria for evaluating whether FATF standards are achieved in participating countries. FATF evaluates a country‚Äôs performance based on its assessment methodology that covers: 1. technical compliance, which is about legal and institutional framework and the powers and procedures of the competent authorities, and 2. effectiveness assessment, which is about the extent to which the legal and institutional framework is producing the expected results.Pakistan on FATF‚Äôs grey list: what, why, and why now?, Dawn (newspaper), 10 June 2019. There are many differences between countries dealing with their legal and financial system, which is taking into consideration by the FATF. There is a set minimum of actions that meet a standard, that all countries can use regarding their own situation. This standard covers all actions that a nation should take within their regulatory systems and their criminal justice systems as well the preventive measures that should be taken by specified businesses, professions, and institutions. For non-profit organisations (NPOs) there has been a command for more financial transparency, to make sure that they do not become easier for terrorist organisations to launder money through the organisations. This hypothesis was thought of by intergovernmental organisations. These intergovernmental organisations include the World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund. NPOs are put under surveillance, especially when they are associated with \\"suspect communities\\" or if they are based or working in zones of conflict. FATF data is a key indicator of the quality of AML/CFT systems in the Basel AML Index, a money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessment tool developed by the Basel Institute on Governance. Black or greylisting of non-compliant nations  In addition to FATF's \\"Forty plus Nine\\" Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of \\"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\\" (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist. This was a list of 15 jurisdictions that, for one reason or another, FATF members believed were uncooperative with other jurisdictions in international efforts against money laundering (and, later, terrorism financing). Typically, this lack of cooperation manifested itself as an unwillingness or inability (frequently, a legal inability) to provide foreign law enforcement officials with information relating to bank account and brokerage records, and customer identification and beneficial owner information relating to such bank and brokerage accounts, shell company, and other financial vehicles commonly used in money laundering. As of October 2006, there are no Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories in the context of the NCCT initiative. However FATF issues updates as countries on High-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions list have made significant improvements in standards and cooperation. The FATF also issues updates to identify additional jurisdictions that pose Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing risks. The FATF surveyed 26 jurisdictions to check their ability and willingness to co-operate with other countries in the international fight against money laundering. The review contained the summaries of these surveys. Fifteen jurisdictions were branded ‚Äúnon-cooperative countries or territories,‚Äù because of the high number of harmful practices identified in these jurisdictions.  Categories of members  As of June 2019 there are 37 member countries of FATF. Starting with its own members, the FATF monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations; reviews money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures; and, promotes the adoption and implementation of the FATF Recommendations globally. Countries are subjected to evaluation by FATF to see that they are upholding laws and regulations enforced by FATF. Full members  FATF had 39 full members, comprising 37 member jurisdictions and two regional organisations. The FATF also works in close co-operation with a number of international and regional bodies involved in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. ; Regional organisations # # Gulf Cooperation Council ; Countries and other jurisdictions # # # # # # # # # # # # # (originally joined under the designation in 1991) # # # # # # # # # # (comprises , , and ) # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Associate members  FATF had 9 associated FATF style regional members, that have similar objectives of setting up systems to fight terrorism and money corruption:: * Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) * Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) * Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) * Eurasian Group (EAG) * Council of Europe Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (Moneyval)(formerly PC-R-EV) * Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT), formerly The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in South America (GAFISUD) * Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) * Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) * Task Force on Money Laundering in Central Africa (GABAC){{cite weburl=http://spgabac.org/  FATF regional member delegates Members of the FATF regional bodies that are not full FATF members are entitled to attend FATF meetings as individual member-delegates of the regional bodies and to intervene on policy and operational issues.

This can have detrimental effects on a country's national security through increasing risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism as well as wastage due to the implementation of inappropriate regulatory measures. The objective is to increase mitigation strategies that would enable scarce resources in fighting money laundering and terrorism financing threats. The FATF follows strict criteria to identify potential threats.  Effects of FATF  The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure. The FATF began to become a big figure shortly after the 9/11 attacks to help combat the financing of terrorist organisations. FATF makes sure funds are not easily accessible by terror organisations that are causing these crimes against humanity. FATF has helped to fight against corruption by ‚Äògrey- listing‚Äô countries that do not meet Recommended Criteria and this helps to cripple economies and states that are aiding terrorist and corrupted organisations. FATF continues to work with other monetary agencies to control terrorist finance activity and to bring an end to illegal financial organisations, terrorism and corruption. FATF has made it difficult for non- governmental organisations (NGOs) in countries to access funds to aid in relief situations due to strict FATF criteria. FATF criteria have mainly impacted NGOs that are located in Middle Eastern and terror-ridden countries. Some argue that the FATF Recommendations do not specifically set out restrictions for NGOs which often results in them going against FATF Recommendation.  FATF style regional bodies  FATF also has associated FATF style regional bodies, including: * Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) * Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) * Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) * Eurasian Group (EAG) * Council of Europe Select Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures (Moneyval)(formerly PC-R-EV) * Financial Action Task Force of Latin America (GAFILAT), formerly The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering in South America (GAFISUD) * Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) * Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF) GABAC (Central Africa) See also * Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering * Hawala * Hundi * Money laundering * Politically exposed person * Remittance * Informal value transfer system * White collar crime * Wolfsberg Group ReferencesFurther reading * Hawala, An Informal Payment System and Its Use to Finance Terrorism by Sebastian R.

Although Gas and Rodney were childhood friends of Shane McMahon, Abs had a legitimate wrestling background. They started off as a group from Greenwich, Connecticut of about ten people in early 1999, but then as the year went on the stable whittled its way down to three members. The group was closely allied with McMahon, often helping him defend the WWE European Championship throughout early 1999.

In 1934 Varela moved to Madrid, where he contacted with the group PAN (Poetas Andantes y Navegantes, literally Walking and Sailing Poets -- note that the abbreviation makes reference to Pan, a Greek god, and is also the Spanish and Galician word for bread) and with Misi√≥ns Pedag√≥xicas (Pedagogic Missions). He also joined the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de Espa√±a or PCE). After the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Varela left Spain, exiling himself first in France and then, in May 1939, in Mexico. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1941, where he made contact with other exiled Galicians and emigrants from Galicia. He would publish most of his poetry, in the Galician language, while in Argentina.

The first solution was to build the Sankey Canal which opened in 1755 and ran from the Blackbrook canal via Parr to Sankey Bridges, to the west of Warrington. It was extended to the west, to Fiddlers Ferry, five years later.Diggle, p. 17 Encouraged by the success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway which opened in 1825, in 1829 a group of local businessmen arranged for a survey for a line from Cowley Hill Colliery, north of St Helens, to Runcorn Gap on the River Mersey. At this time the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which ran to the south of St Helens, was being built and its surveyor, Charles Blacker Vignoles, was commissioned to undertake the survey; he was later appointed as the engineer. An Act of Parliament was obtained on 29 May 1830.Holt, p. 59 The original capital was ¬£120,000, one-third of which was raised from local coal owners, salt-makers and Liverpool merchants.Diggle, p. 18 These included James Muspratt, soap and alkali manufacturer, and Peter Greenall, who had interests in the brewing, coal and glass manufacturing industries.Hardie, p. 4 Peter Greenall was elected as the first chairman of a board of ten directors. At the south end of the railway, Widnes Dock was built, which led into the Mersey. This was the world's first rail-to-ship facility.Welbourn, p. 4 Because of perceived competition from the railway, the Sankey Canal was extended from Fiddlers Ferry to Runcorn Gap by what was known as the \\"New Cut\\". The railway terminated between the dock and the end of the canal and Runcorn Gap station was sited to the north of the canal.Hardie, frontispiece map. Work on the line proceeded slowly and its costs overran the estimate. It did not open until 1833 but in November 1832 a train with coal wagons ran over the track because of a wager between one of the owners and the engineer that a train would pass over it by December 1832. The line opened officially on 21 February 1833 but the dock was not completed until August 1833. The extension to the Sankey Canal opened on 24 July 1833. From Widnes Dock a single line crossed the extension to the canal by a swing bridge and then climbed steeply, so steeply that for a section trains had to be pulled by a stationary engine. Haulage by a stationary engine was also necessary for a section further north at Sutton near St Helens. The Liverpool and Manchester line was crossed by an iron bridge south of St Helens. The line was originally intended for freight but public demand led to passenger coaches being added to the rear of the trains, this service starting in September 1833. There was intense competition between the railway and the canal leading to financial difficulties for both companies; the canal company had reduced its dividends from 33.3% to 5.5% and the railway company was paying no dividend. The companies agreed to a merger, with the railway company buying out the canal company to form the St Helens Canal and Railway Company (SHCR).Diggle, p. 19 Royal assent for this was received on 21 July 1845. The company, which owned nine-second-hand tank engines and had a staff of 122, was described as being \\"ramshackle\\". It set about to improve the situation, doubling the track and easing the gradients so that the whole line could be operated by steam locomotives. The new company then set about planning branch lines and connections. There had been a plan to build northwards from St Helens towards Southport to join the Southport and Euxton branch at Rufford. However this line was built only as far as Rainford. Here it joined the Lancashire Union Railway at Gerards Bridge Junction.Holt, p. 68 The company bought land at Garston with the intention of building a dock and linking it with a line to Runcorn Gap. This opened as a single line on 1 July 1852, although the dock was not opened to shipping until 21 July 1853.Holt, pp. 61‚Äì62 On 21 May 1851 a sharp curve connection had been made on this line from the main line at what was to become known as Widnes Dock Junction. The following year a new Runcorn Gap station was opened nearer to the rapidly growing town of Widnes. The next project was to build a branch line to Warrington. This was opened on 1 February 1853, extending to a temporary station at White Cross, Warrington. In the following year it was extended to meet the Warrington and Stockport Railway. A station on this branch was opened at Cuerdley but this closed in January 1858.Holt, p. 62 The creation of these branch lines created an unusual feature on British railways, a flat crossing. In the 1860s people could travel eastwards from Runcorn Gap to Warrington and, from there, to Manchester, London and many other places. They could also travel west to Liverpool by taking a ship at Garston. By 1860 there was considerable competition between the railway companies. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) wanted to build a line between Edge Hill and Garston. Following discussions, the LNWR leased the line from Garston to Warrington with effect from 1 September 1860, paying ¬£5,000 for the first year and ¬£12,000 annually from 1861. On 29 July 1864, an act was passed which allowed SHCR to be absorbed by LNWR, and the transfer took place on 31 July 1864. Runcorn Gap station was renamed Widnes station on 1 September 1864.  Later developments  Widnes Dock Junction and the flat crossing were causing problems of congestion and the LNWR dealt with this by building a deviation line of just under to the north of the original west‚Äìeast line, crossing the line leading north to St Helens by a bridge. The deviation line was authorised on 5 July 1865 and opened on 1 November 1869. The line was connected to the St Helens and it included a new station for passengers. With the opening of the line from Weaver Junction across the Mersey on Runcorn Railway Bridge to Ditton Junction, west of Widnes, the Garston extension became part of the Liverpool-London main line. Following the merger of most of Britain's railways into four private companies in 1923, the line from St Helens to Widnes became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). Large quantities of freight were carried on the line and the passenger train from St Helen's to Ditton Junction station was nicknamed the Ditton Dodger. Following the end of the Second World War passenger traffic declined and the service provided by the Ditton Dodger ended on 16 June 1951. Freight traffic initially continued to be heavy but it declined during the 1960s. In 1969 the line north from Farnworth and Bold station was singled and in 1975 the line south of the station was also singled. The line closed to through traffic on 1 November 1981. The track has been lifted and some of the southern part of the route is occupied by Watkinson Way, a road providing an easterly bypass for Widnes and connecting the Silver Jubilee Bridge with the M62 motorway. The base of the swing bridge which carried the railway over the canal is still present in Spike Island. As of 2009, where the line runs near the St Helens Retail Park, the embankment has been reinforced and is said to be for a rail link for visitors from out of town to the new Saints RLFC stadium. It is also rumoured that the track on Robins Lane will be relaid to connect through to St Helens Junction. Work is close to completion in 2014 to reclaim the section of the railway that ran from Clock Face to Farnworth and Bold as a footpath for walkers and cyclists. Drainage and the majority of the new footpath has now been laid for the public and is already accessible. The footpath can now be enjoyed as part of the reclaimed Sutton Manor Colliery and Jaume Plensa's Dream monument, winner of Channels 4's 'The Big Art Project'.

Passengers were carried from 1831. The railway operated independently until 1845 when it became part of the Grand Junction Railway. Background Bolton was situated on the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Leigh straddled a major east-west canal route, to the west ran the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and joined to it in the center of Leigh was the Bridgewater Canal running east. The canals provided freight routes to both Liverpool and Manchester. The canals of the time were the major freight routes being faster and able to transport greater loads than the carriers using the turnpike road system. But, unfortunately, these canal routes were slow, becoming congested, and increasingly more expensive as demand from the rapidly expanding businesses in the area increased. The waterways had a virtual monopoly on the transport links which enabled them to charge exorbitant tolls. As costs rose it was no wonder that business leaders and industrialists began to look for another means of transporting their goods and products. They looked to the railway to break this monopoly, the canal companies recognised this threat to their business early on, for example, the Leeds and Liverpool canal company minutes of 21 September 1822 mention the issue, and the canal businesses started to take steps to protect their interests. Rail roads, tramroads and railways had been around for some time, mainly used to transport goods, especially coal to the canal network. There was already at least one private railway operating in the area, in 1812 Robert Daglish had constructed a railway to carry coal from Orrell Colliery in Winstanley, near Wigan to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, this railway used \\"Blenkinsop and Murrays\\" patent cog and rack steam locomotives to haul the coal wagons. A little further north the Lancaster Canal had been built in two sections joined together in 1797 by a five mile long tramroad. Inception Sometime before 1 October 1824 a committee was formed by local businessmen, including William Hulton, Benjamin Hick and Peter Rothwell to promote a railway in the area. The committee is first recorded on that date as requiring its 63 members to pay money into a bank for the \\"making of a railway or railways or tram road from Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool canal...\\" Several routes were proposed and the committee contacted the pioneering railway engineer George Stephenson for his views on the scheme. Stephenson was familiar with the area as he was in the process of surveying the route of the future Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;). Stephenson's response was to commission another engineer, Hugh Steel, to conduct a survey of the viable routes for the railway. Hugh had worked with Stephenson as a surveyor on the L&MR;, Steel was assisted in the survey by Robert Daglish. The plans for the line reflected current railway engineering practice in the north-east of England, where Stephenson came from, by including inclined planes which would require cable haulage by stationary engines. Steel's proposed line was approved by Stephenson and accepted by the committee. The committee had decided that if they tried to cross the canal at Leigh, with the ultimate aim of making a connection to the proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;), they would create so much opposition that their Parliamentary Bill could fail. There was little precedent for approving railways, there was a reluctance from local landowners to have railways on or near their property and the canal companies were very influential. The committee decided to put forth a bill they thought could pass rather than one with a much higher risk of failing. Towards the end of 1824 the Bill was presented to Parliament together with Steel's survey and an estimated construction cost of ¬£43,143 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The Bill had considerable opposition in Parliament but the Act received its assent on 31 March 1825 after clauses had been inserted refusing permission to cross the canal, effectively making the railway little more than a canal feeder. The committee could take some satisfaction in its caution as the Liverpool and Manchester Bill was lost that same year. This first Act authorised the company to raise the sum of ¬£44,000, via the sale of 440 shares in the company, valued at ¬£100. The railway was to be a single track with two rope worked inclines using stationary steam engines, to run from Lecturers Closes at Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool canal at Leigh. Construction and Opening In 1826 work began on the construction of the railway starting from Bolton levelling the ground for the line up to Chequerbent under the supervision of local engineer, Robert Daglish. The B&LR; found it needed to revise some of the clauses set out in the original Act and they prepared a second Bill in 1828. The second Act received assent on 26 March 1828. This Act enlarged the company's powers, and it authorised the raising of an additional ¬£25,000 to meet the increased costs of construction as well as specifying the track gauge for the railway as being between the inside edges of the rails, as well as between the outside edges. Sometime after this the line became a standard gauge line at . The Acts for the B&LR; also authorised branch lines at the Bolton end, to the Union Foundry on Deansgate, to William Hulton's coal yard at Great Moor Street and to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. The branch to the canal was never built and the branches to Great Moor Street and Deansgate opened for freight in 1829. The first section of track between Derby Street Bolton and William Hulton's collieries at Pendlebury Fold near Chequerbent in Westhoughton was officially opened on 1 August 1828 The official opening of the completed part of the railway (which the Manchester Guardian Newspaper reported as being from Checkerbent to the town of Bolton) was witnessed by \\"an immense concourse of people\\". They saw a procession of a \\"new locomotive engine made by Messrs. R. Stephenson and Co. of Newcastle ... to which were attached six waggons filled with people, and decorated with numerous flags and streamers; then followed a very elegant and commodious coach, intended at some future period to convey passengers on the railway. This was filled with ladies amongst whom was Mrs. Hulton. Then followed seven other wagons, decorated with flags, and crowded with passengers, including the musicians of the Bolton old band, who occupied the two last waggons, and played a variety of appropriate airs, during the procession\\". The procession started at 1215 with the locomotive drawing the thirteen waggons and the coach from Pendlebury Fold, near Hulton Park, to Top-o'th'-Pike where the stationary engine was situated. There were about 150 people on the train which travelled at about . On reaching the stationary engine the waggons were detached and \\"Mrs. Hulton, after a short address, baptised the engine by the name of the Lancashire Witch\\". She then presented a garland of flowers to the engineer, who treated it, in the newspapers view, rather unceremoniously by placing it on the furnace-pipe (presumably the chimney) where the flowers soon underwent a lamentable change. The engine was sent back to one of Mr. Hulton's collieries from whence it returned hauling six waggons containing about 2 tons of coal which it drew with great ease at about . The locomotive was again detached from its train and demonstrated some of its abilities, starting and stopping under control even from speeds estimated up to . After the demonstration the coach and waggons were attached to the rope of the stationary engine and proceeded down the inclined plane towards Bolton. The waggons were \\"occasionally moved with great celerity, and occasionally stopped by means of brakes applied to the wheels, in order to shew the command possessed over them by the engineer, in case of any accident or obstruction\\". The crowd was so large that several people were thrown onto the railway where they were \\"placed in the most imminent peril\\" and one man was reported as nearly falling under the wheels of a waggon before it could be stopped, he was reportedly severely hurt. At the bottom of the incline it was intended that the waggons should be horse-drawn to the terminus but the crowd man-handled the waggons to their destination. Upon arrival, a considerable number of gentlemen sat down to an excellent dinner at the Commercial Inn, Mr. Hulton in the chair. The coach used by the ladies during the opening was loaned by the L&MR; and another carriage was borrowed from them in December 1829 for 'an experiment in passenger carrying' but passengers weren't regularly carried until 1831. The line was completed through to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh by end of March 1830. By then the construction of the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway which provided a connection with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was already well advanced. Description of the route The line was just under in length, and was originally single track with the exception of about half a mile towards the north end of the line, there were occasional sidings or passing places. Whishaw (1842) gives a description of the line, starting from Bolton Great Moor Street the train is worked by horse-power to the bottom of the Daubhill incline. Here a stationary steam engine hauled the train up out of Bolton. Trains running down the incline are worked by gravity. The incline rises 118 feet in 1 mile 3 furlongs (about 36 m in 2.2 km). At the top of this incline the locomotive is attached and the train works to Leigh. In the other direction a stationary steam engine hauls trains (including their locomotives) up from Bag Lane through Chequerbent towards Bolton. This incline rises 243 feet but over a greater distance so the slope is less severe overall. The rope for the Chequerbent incline is made by Webster of Sunderland and is in circumference, it weighs about when new and costs ¬£2 10s per hundredweight. This rope when partially worn is transferred to the Daubhill incline. The width occupied by the railway on a level surface is and the track is ballasted with small coal. The OS map of 1849 shows the original B&LR; line running to the canal as well as the newer K&LJnR; line running over the bridge. Double track was laid in sections with the section from Pennington to Atherton Junctions opening on 31 May 1880, the section through Bag Lane on 4 July 1880 and the final section through to Bolton on 1 February 1885, south of Pennington on the former K&LJR; had been doubled when the Tyldesley Loopline opened in 1864. Stations The original passenger stations on the line all opened on 11 June 1831 when the line opened for passenger traffic, although \\"station\\" meant somewhere people could get on or off the train, the facilities would have been primitive by later standards. At Bolton, for example, the booking office was described as little more than a shed. The original stations were: *Bolton, which was renamed Bolton Great Moor Street in October 1849. This station was rebuilt in 1871 after it was virtually demolished when a runaway goods train collided with empty carriages in the station in January 1858. The station was patched up and continued to handle traffic until a larger station opened nearby in 1874. *Daubhill, which closed on 2 February 1885 when it was replaced by a new station with the same name when the line was realigned. *Chequerbent, which closed on 2 February 1885 when it was replaced by a new station with the same name when the line was realigned. *Bag Lane, which was renamed Atherton in 1847 and Atherton Bag Lane on 2 June 1924. *Leigh, which was renamed Westleigh on 1 August 1876. New stations opened in 1885 at Daubhill and Chequerbent when the line was realigned to remove the inclines and increase capacity, the track doubling took place during the same period. The new Daubhill station opened on opened on 2 February 1885 on the new alignment of the railway, it was renamed Rumworth & Daubhill on 28 April 1885. The new Chequerbent railway station, sometimes known as Chequerbent for Hulton Park, opened on opened on 2 February 1885 on the new alignment of the railway. The last station to open was Atherleigh which the London, Midland and Scottish Railway opened on 14 October 1935 as there had been new housing development in the area. Operations The Bolton and Leigh Railway (B&LR;) was the first public railway in Lancashire, being a public railway meant carrying goods either by company wagon or privately owned wagon. The B&LR; chose to follow the turnpike and canal tradition where the service was available to anyone who could pay the toll. Shortly after the line had opened its 'utility' was being reported on favourably, coal was reduced in price in the Bolton area by more than 2s per ton. Business on the line improved when the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway (K&LJR;) was constructed to link the B&LR; from its southern terminus with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;) at Kenyon. When the K&LJR; presented its bill to Parliament in 1828, MPs were more amenable towards railway companies and the canal company withdrew its opposition to the railway crossing the canal. In 1829 the K&LJR; received its royal assent to build a single-track line from the end of the Bolton and Leigh Railway near Twiss (now Twist) Lane in Westleigh to Kenyon, where a junction would be made with the L&MR; which was at an advanced stage of construction. The line crossed the Leeds and Liverpool Canal before heading south towards Kenyon. Stations were built at Bradshaw Leach and Kenyon. As soon as it opened on 3 January 1831, goods trains could access of line between Bolton and Liverpool and a few months later a passenger service to Liverpool started. Walker (1832) reports that from 1 June 1832 passenger service levels for all days except Sunday were: *Depart Liverpool at 0730 to Bolton *Depart Liverpool at 1100 to Bolton *Depart Liverpool at 1430 to Bolton *Depart Liverpool at 1715 to Bolton On Sundays there was only one departure at 1730. Journeys in the opposite direction were not described by Walker but he does report the fare as being \\"Inside, 5s; Outside, 3s6d\\". By 1834 the B&LR; had leased the running of the railway to John Hargreaves, an established carrier of Bolton. Hargreaves was granted running rights over the K&LJR; and the L&MR; so that he ran the services between Bolton and Liverpool. Hargreaves also worked goods services to Manchester. He was required to provide his own locomotive power, carriages, and wagons, except a few for ballasting which belong to the Company. Hargreaves was an established carrier on roads and canals before the railway was built and the main carrier from north west England into Scotland, the equal of Pickfords who controlled the trade to the south of Manchester. Hargreaves became a pioneer of excursions by rail, running Sunday trips from Bolton to Liverpool as early as 1841. In 1843 he ran excursions to London and two years later to Manchester. The Grand Junction Railway (GJR) terminated the Hargreaves leases on 31 December 1845. The stationary engines played a prominent role on the line for at least 15 years, an interesting example, amongst the few, of the transitional years embodying both techniques of haulage. It is believed the stationary engines remained in operation until about 1846. Cable haulage was discontinued once locomotive performance had improved sufficiently. The railway obtained two subsequent Acts, the third Act in 1831 to amend and enlarge the existing acts and authorising an additional ¬£16,500 of joint stock capital and the powers to raise an additional ¬£25,000 in loans. The fourth Act, which received royal assent in 1836 was an Act to amend and enlarge the several Acts already in force and it gave the Company power to borrow an additional ¬£60,000. One of the other purposes was the right to lease the K&LJR; for up to 25 years, as well as for the purchase of the line for the sum of ¬£44,750. In 1838 there were 86,320 passengers conveyed on the line, an average of 236.5 per day generating an annual income of ¬£6831 6s 4d. Locomotives and Rolling Stock Lancashire Witch Sans Pareil Shortly after the passing of the second Act the railway took delivery of their first steam locomotive, which had been ordered from Robert Stephenson and Company by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in January 1828. The L&MR; subsequently decided their order was premature and the locomotive was transferred to the B&LR; by mutual agreement. This was the locomotive named Lancashire Witch at the opening of the line. The Lancashire Witch had some innovative features, it was built with 45¬∞ inclined cylinders that allowed the axles to be sprung resulting in improved stability. The locomotive was also equipped an expansion valve that allowed the control of the flow of steam that entered the cylinders, which made it the first locomotive to feature expansive working. By 1831, the railway owned at least three other locomotives. Union, which was built in 1830 by Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell, along with Salamander and Veteran, which were both built by Crook and Dean. In 1832 the railway hired Timothy Hackworth's Sans Pareil at a rate of ¬£15 per month, and then bought it outright for ¬£110. In 1842 there were 14 locomotives in operation on the line: * 'Sans Pareil' built by T. Hackworth * 'Nelson' built by R. Stephenson & Co * 'Bee' built by Edward Bury * 'Union' built by Rothwell & Hick * 'Salamanda' built by W. Dean * 'Veteran' built by W. Dean * 'Clarence' built by Edward Bury * 'Utilis' built by Hargreaves * 'Victoria' built by Hargreaves * 'Wellington' built by Tayleur & Co * 'Marquis' built by Tayleur & Co * 'Pandora' built by Tayleur & Co * 'Soho' built by B. Hick & Sons * 'Castle' built by Hargreaves Sans Pareil was used on the railway until 1844, when it was sold to the Coppull Colliery, Chorley and used as a stationary engine up until 1863, when it was presented to the Patent Office Museum (now the Science Museum). The early passenger accommodation on the trains comprised two coaches, named Elephant and Castle, which provided the inside accommodation whilst the external accommodation was wooden seats in open wagons. In 1842 there were five first-class carriages each holding 24 passengers in three compartments, each carriage was 15'3\\" long with an inside width of 6'6\\". The carriages have spring buffers are painted green with the company arms on the panels, the insides are lined with blue cloth. Each carriage weighs about 3 tons and were built by Mr Cooper of Bradshawgate, Bolton, each costing ¬£400. A sixth carriage was slightly different holding twenty passengers, sixteen in two regular compartments and four in a coupe. There were also eight second- class carriages each holding 24 passengers in three compartments, the carriages are enclosed at the ends but open at the sides. In 1842 there were about 300 wagons in use on the line, all belonging to John Hargreaves, about 40 of which have iron bottoms. Later Years In 1844 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had been negotiating with the Bolton and Leigh Railway and the Kenyon and Leigh Junction Railway with a view to an amalgamation, these negotiations were made more complicated by the initial inclusion of the North Union Railway in the proposed merger and then even more complicated when the Grand Junction Railway became interested, all the lines were connected and provided through running for each other's trains. Negotiations were reaching their conclusions when the NUR shareholders rejected their part in the amalgamation. At this juncture the K&LJR; simplified the arrangements by agreeing to be purchased outright by the B&LR; (under the provisions of the 1836 Act) so the amalgamation took place on 8 August 1845 without the NUR and the B&LR; became part of an enlarged Grand Junction Railway. The GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) on 16 July 1846 when it was formed by the amalgamation of the GJR, the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, the London and Birmingham Railway and the Trent Valley Railway. Timetables are available for several of the years the line was open: *The service level on the line in 1850 when the line was under early L&NWR; ownership was 7 trains per day departing in each direction between Bolton Great Moor Street and Kenyon Junction from where there were connections to and from Liverpool, Warrington, Birmingham and London. There were only two services on Sundays. The fare between Bolton and Liverpool was now 5s in first class, 3s9d in second class and 2s4d in third. *In 1922, just prior to the grouping of railways, the L&NWR; timetable for the line showed 11 services in each direction with some additional part-line services and altered services on Saturdays and no through service on Sundays. *In 1947, at the end of the London Midland and Scottish Railway days there were 8 services in each direction, with an extra one on Saturdays. There were no Sunday services. Closure The stations at Chequerbent and Daubhill closed to passengers on 3 March 1952. All other stations and the line closed to passengers on 29 March 1954 but temporarily re-opened in five successive years to cope with Bolton Wakes Week traffic. The line closed in sections, Atherton Junction to Pennington South Junction closed to freight on 7 October 1963, and with it Atherton goods station. Chequerbent goods yard closed on 27 February 1965. With the demise of goods traffic, Crook Street Yard in Bolton closed in April 1965 and private sidings were closed by October 1967. The only coal traffic using the line in the 1960s was from Jackson's sidings in Tyldesley. Passenger traffic from the Tyldesley Loopline closed following the Beeching cuts on 5 May 1969 when all the stations on that line were closed.

It opened in 1831. The Grand Junction Railway aspired to make its long-distance route from Birmingham to Liverpool and Manchester, and acquire the W&NR; so as to use it from Warrington northwards. The permanent way needed to be strengthened for main line use. The GJR opened its line in 1837, connecting at Warrington to the W&NR; and gaining access to Liverpool and Manchester over the L&MR.; The W&NR; was the first part of the present-day West Coast Main Line to be opened. Branch from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway The Warrington and Newton Railway in 1831On 15 September 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened for business.M D Greville, Chronological List of the Railways of Lancashire, 1828 - 1939, Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, vol 105, 1953, reprint, page 189 Although this was a purely west to east line, primarily connecting the manufactories of Manchester with the great docks of Liverpool, there were already thoughts of forming a British railway network. While the L&MR; was still being built, a company to make a branch line from it to Warrington was being proposed, and the Warrington and Newton Railway was authorised by Parliament on 14 May 1829.Geoffrey Holt and Gordon Biddle, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 10: the North West, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1986, , pages 23 and 24Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 584 It was to run from a terminal at Dallum LaneDallum was the contemporary spelling of Dallam. in Warrington, to Newton (later Newton-le- Willows) on the L&MR;, a distance of a little over 4 miles. There was to be a branch at Warrington to Bank Quay, close to the River Mersey, and a northward extension at Newton to coal pits at Haydock. Authorised share capital was ¬£53,000.Brian Reed, Crewe to Carlisle, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1969, , pages 14 and 15 The junction at Newton was to face towards Liverpool.Reed, page 17 Warrington was a manufacturing town with a population of about 19,000. One of the main objects was the quick conveyance of coal from the Haydock pits near Newton to Warrington.Reed, page24 There was a lack of unity on the board over the construction, which delayed construction, and powerful landowners on the intended route of the line also made difficulties. The type of track adopted had cast iron fishbellied rails and untreated larch sleepers; the failure to apply preservative treatment resulted in early failure of the sleepers.Reed, page 16 The Liverpool-facing connection at Newton was seen to be a limitation, and in 1830, a second Act was secured, authorising a curve at Newton to connect to the L&MR; in the Manchester direction, and also to make a direct connection to the Wigan Branch Railway, which ran north from a junction at Parkside, which faced Manchester. In fact both the Warrington and Newton Railway and the Wigan Branch Railway found themselves short of funds and they were unable to build the connecting lines and spur.Reed, page 17 Opening The Warrington and Newton Railway opened between Warrington (Dallam) and a location at Newton, terminating at a point south of the L&MR; junction, at the beginning of June 1831. This was for the Haydock Park races, and passenger trains ran regularly after that.Reed, page 18, quoting research by Mr E Craven, rebutting the previous claims of opening on 25 July 1831. The Newton curve and connection to the L&MR; was completed on 25 July 1831. There were four trains each way Monday to Saturday only, although Sunday trains were put on by 1833.Reed, pages 18 and 23 The trains were worked by three locomotives, named Warrington, Newton and Vulcan.Greville, page 190 The Bank Quay branch was not completed at first, and it was probably opened about 1835, diverging from the Dallam line at Jockey Lane. Until 1837 it was used for goods and mineral traffic only; it was close to the River Mersey where shipping could berth. Grand Junction Railway The Warrington and Newton line in 1837In 1832 and 1833 the promoters of the Grand Junction Railway were considering their options. They wished to build a trunk railway connecting Birmingham with Liverpool and Manchester. If Liverpool was to be connected to the network further south, then the River Mersey would need to be crossed: the Warrington & Newton Railway could serve as the northern extremity if a crossing of the Mersey in Warrington were made. The proposed Grand Junction Railway would link Birmingham with the central point of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at Newton Junction, and Liverpool and Manchester would thereby be joined with Birmingham. This compromise lengthened the distance by rail between Birmingham and the two Lancashire towns, but the greater convenience and economy was decisive,Norman W Webster, Britain's First Trunk Line: The Grand Junction Railway, Adams and Dart, Bath, 1972, , page 22 and the necessary authorising Act was secured on 6 May 1833. The directors of the W&NR; saw that their railway was important for the Grand Junction Railway and by the end of 1833 they were demanding ¬£125 for each ¬£100 of stock as well as settlement of their debts of about ¬£20,000. Negotiation reduced this to ¬£114 6s a share, but the GJR directors expressed themselves disappointed at this unexpected difficulty. They now considered an alternative route, by-passing the W&NR; to the west. Webster says that three inclined planes (on the W&NR;) would be avoided by this means.It is not clear where these were.Webster, page 44 In fact these \\"inclined planes\\" were not so steep as some: in describing the Grand Junction route, Whishaw says \\"In the ascending planes are included only two which have gradients under the first class [steeper gradients]; these are at Burton Wood and Newton Brook, both lying between Warrington and Newton; the former being 21 chains in length, and inclining at the rate of 1 in 209; and the latter having an inclination of 1 in 85, and extending for one mile.\\"Francis Whishaw, The Railways of Great Britain and Ireland, John Weale, London, 1842, page 126 In February 1835 the W&NR; agreed to sell their line for shares at par, with the GJR adopting their outstanding debt of about ¬£22,000. The GJR undertook to pay the W&NR; shareholders 4 per cent until their main line was open throughout: the purchase price was around ¬£67,000, and the takeover was authorised by Act of 12 June 1835, effective from 1 January 1835. The GJR knew it would have to upgrade the permanent way on the W&NR; for stronger materials appropriate fro a main line railway.Grant, page 230 The Grand Junction Railway opened their line from Newton Junction to a temporary Birmingham station at Vauxhall on 4 July 1837.Webster, page 66 When the Grand Junction Railway line was completed to Warrington on 4 July 1837, the connection was made at Bank Quay and through trains used a station there. Dallam station was relegated to local passenger and goods use at that time. Connections at Newton The Newton Junction faced Liverpool, and the Parkside Junction of the Wigan Branch Railway faced away, towards Manchester, so that when through running between those lines was started, two reversals were necessary. On 4 July 1837According to Reed; Holt and Biddle, page 96, say 1 January an east curve at Newton was opened; this was also the date on which the Grand Junction made a connection with the Warrington and Newton; direct running towards Manchester was now possible. Reed says that portion working was adopted, with northbound passenger trains dividing at Newton, and portions continuing to Liverpool and Manchester respectively, but Holt and Biddle say that \\"Trains to Liverpool and Manchester did not divide at Newton, but ran independently between Warrington and the L&MR.;\\" The Newton East Curve was exceptionally sharp, and Reed attributes this to the fact that building it like that obviated the necessity of a further Act of Parliament, by avoiding a land take.Reed, pages 20 and 21 Use of the Newton curves for main-line trains to and from the south continued for Manchester trains until the opening throughout on 10 August 1842, of the Manchester to Crewe line of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway. For Liverpool trains the usage continued until the opening in April 1869 of the Runcorn Railway Bridge and the Runcorn to Weaver Junction line.Reed, page 31 The direct connection between the Warrington and Wigan lines, from what became Winwick junction to Golborne junction was first planned in 1830, but not built then for lack of money. The Grand Junction Railway managed to renew the authorisation, but again was unable to carry out the work. A third authorisation was granted on 11 July 1861 to the London and North Western Railway, and it was opened on 1 August 1864, under powers granted a third time, in 1861. Neele records that its first mention in LNWR passenger timetables was not until February 1872.George P Neele, Railway Reminiscences, McCorquodale & Co, London, 1904, page 184 Night postal trains continued to use the original route as Newton had become an established exchange point for mails.Reed, page 31Holt and Biddle, page 96Greville, page 188 West Coast Main Line The Warrington and Newton Railway was the first \\"modern\\" railway element of the present-day West Coast Main Line, from London to Glasgow. The other sections were the London and Birmingham Railway, 1837 - 1838M C Reed, London and North Western Railway: A History, 1996, by Atlantic Transport Publishers, Penryn, , pages 3 and 5, the Trent Valley Railway, 1847,Peter Lee, The Trent Valley Railway (Rugby - Stafford 1847-1966), Trent Valley Publications, Burton-upon-Trent, 1988, , page 6 the Grand Junction Railway, 1837,Webster, page 90, Winwick Jn to Golborne Jn, LNWR 1864,Reed, page 31, the Wigan branch Railway, 1832Reed, page 32, the North Union Railway, 1838,Bob Gregson, The London and North Western Railway around Preston, Atkinson Publications Ltd, Preston, 2012, , page 22 the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway, 1840,Gregson, page 22 the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, 1846,Reed, page 154 the Caledonian Railway, 1847 - 1848,David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, 1841,Grant, pages 619 and 620 the Caledonian Railway, 1949, the Polloc and Govan Railway, 1840, and the Caledonian Railway, 1879. The former W&NR; line remains in use at the present day from Bank Quay station to Newton. The West Coast Main Line diverges at Winwick Junction to take the 1867 curve. The original southern section to Dallam has closed. The Three Pigeons public house, (still extant in 2020) is adjacent to the location of the Dallam terminal. Reed says that \\"It has been surmised that the Three Pigeons, erected as a public house shortly before the railway, may have served by the good offices of the then landlord, as a booking office for the W. &. N. This seems unlikely; it is at the outer end of the whole station area, and with Warrington as it was in 1831-37 most passengers would come in at the town end from Bewsey Lane and Foundry Lane, and not along Tanner's Lane; and the station building would be of ample size to provide booking accommodation and a waiting room.\\" NotesReferencesSee also Category:Grand Junction Railway Category:Early British railway companies Category:Railway companies established in 1829 Category:Railway lines opened in 1831 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1835 Category:British companies established in 1829 Category:British companies disestablished in 1835 ","title":"Warrington and Newton Railway"},{"id":"1870867","text":"Dichelostemma capitatum Dichelostemma is a genus of North American plants closely related to the genus Brodiaea and sometimes regarded as part of that group.Jepson treatment Dichelostemma is classified in the cluster-lily subfamily within the asparagus family. in the latest Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification (2009).

In the early 1990s, he was a part of the tag team The Bad Breed with Ian Rotten. He had a short stint with World Championship Wrestling in 1991, but he was best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1993 to 1999. Bad Breed competed in ECW's tag team division in the early years of the company until the team was forced to disband after losing to The Pitbulls and engaged in a rivalry against each other that Pro Wrestling Illustrated named Feud of the Year in 1995. After an unsuccessful singles career, Rotten formed short- lived tag teams with Hack Meyers and D-Von Dudley before forming Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks with Balls Mahoney in 1997. The team lasted until Rotten departed ECW in 1999. Knighton then wrestled on the independent circuit and appeared at World Wrestling Entertainment's ECW One Night Stand pay-per-view in 2005. Professional wrestling career Rotten wrestling on the independent circuit in 2009 Training and independent circuit (1986‚Äì1993) Knighton was trained to wrestle by Ricky Lawless at a gym on Baltimore's North Avenue, receiving supplementary training from Joey Maggs. He debuted on the independent circuit at the age of 17, adopting the ring name \\"Axl Rotten\\", a portmanteau of the rockers Axl Rose and Johnny Rotten. Rotten won his first championship teaming with Lawless to win the tag team titles in Frank Cain's Star Cavalcade Wrestling during the summer of 1988. He also succeeded Lawless as the promotion's heavyweight champion when, shortly after reigning champion Ricky Lawless was murdered, he won the vacant title from The Psycho in Thomasville, Georgia on November 30, 1988. In the early 1990s, Rotten trained Ian Rotten, who formed a tag team with Axl, masquerading as his brother and taking his stage name from Cheech Marin's character in Get Out of My Room. The duo, known as The Bad Breed, wrestled primarily in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. Axl later opened his own professional wrestling promotion in Maryland called Universal Independent Wrestling. The promotion featured wrestlers such as the Bad Breed, Bam Bam Bigelow and Scotty The Body. It had a television series that aired on Saturday nights on the local ABC channel. The promotion closed in the mid-1990s. From 1991 to 1993, Axl and Ian Rotten had a run with the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF) in Texas, being featured on their daily ESPN show. While in GWF, Axl succeeded in winning both the GWF Commonwealth title and the GWF Tag Team Championship, with Ian Rotten. World Championship Wrestling (1991) Rotten holding one of his signature chairs in 2009 In 1991, Rotten had a short stint with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he feuded with P.N. News. During his time with WCW, Rotten befriended Paul E. Dangerously, the future owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling. Eastern / Extreme Championship WrestlingBad Breed (1993-1995)= In 1993, the Bad Breed were hired by Paul Heyman, the then-booker of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion as a fan favorite tag team, debuting for the promotion at Bloodfest: Day 1 on October 1 by defeating Chad Austin and Todd Shaw. They made their televised debut on the October 5 episode of Hardcore TV, losing to Badd Company. They competed in ECW's tag team division, where they unsuccessfully challenged Tony Stetson and Johnny Hotbody for the Tag Team Championship at November to Remember. They were initially allied with Terry Funk until the team were sent to United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in 1994. Bad Breed returned to ECW on the June 21 episode of Hardcore TV, where they challenged The Public Enemy for the Tag Team Championship, which Public Enemy retained as the match ended in a no contest. Bad Breed defeated Hack Myers and Rockin' Rebel at Heat Wave, and then unsuccessfully challenged Public Enemy for the World Tag Team Championship in a Baseball Brawl match at Hardcore Heaven. Bad Breed next entered a feud with The Pitbulls, to whom they lost in a match at November to Remember. On the January 17, 1995 episode of Hardcore TV, Bad Breed lost to Pitbulls in a rematch which stipulated that the losing team would be forced to break up. Both Rotten brothers blamed one another for the loss and Ian turned on Axl by hitting him with a chair after the loss, playing off real-life ill feelings, a rivalry developed that Pro Wrestling Illustrated named Feud of the Year in 1995. The former partners traded wins at Double Tables and Return of the Funker. They faced one another in a variety of hardcore matches over the next few months, including a hair versus hair match at Three Way Dance, a barbed wire baseball bat match at Hostile City Showdown and a barbed wire baseball bat barbed wire chair match at Enter Sandman, all of which Axl won. A reunion was teased between Bad Breed at Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams on June 17, where they were supposed to take on Public Enemy for the World Tag Team Championship but Bill Alfonso overruled the decision due to Bad Breed being banned from competing as a team. Their feud finally ended at Hardcore Heaven, when Axl defeated Ian in a Taipei Deathmatch. Following his feud with Ian Rotten, it was announced on the July 4 episode of Hardcore TV that Axl would receive his very first opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship against The Sandman at Heat Wave, where Rotten failed to win the title. Rotten then floundered in the mid-card, defeating J.T. Smith at November to Remember. = Teaming with D-Von Dudley (1996-1997) = Rotten lost to the debuting Rob Van Dam in RVD's first ECW match at House Party on January 5, 1996. Rotten would then team with El Puerto Rique√±o in a loss to The Headhunters at Big Apple Blizzard Blast. His failures in singles competition continued as he would lose against the likes of J.T. Smith, The Sandman and Shane Douglas in subsequent matches. Rotten began a rivalry with The Full Blooded Italians, defeating FBI member Little Guido at Hostile City Showdown. At A Matter of Respect, Rotten teamed with Hack Meyers against FBI members J.T. Smith and Little Guido in a losing effort. Rotten then formed a tag team with Meyers as they took on The Samoan Gangsta Party at Hardcore Heaven, which ended in a no contest due to interference by The Gangstas and The Eliminators. At Heat Wave, Rotten competed against Tarzan Goto in a losing effort. At The Doctor Is In, Rotten competed against D-Von Dudley in a match which ended in a no contest after interference by Dudley Brothers. Rotten left with D-Von after the match and formed a tag team with D-Von, thus turning into a villainous character for the first time in his ECW career. Beginning at Natural Born Killaz, Rotten and Dudley wrestled Dudley Brothers in a series of matches throughout the fall of 1996. Rotten defeated his former tag team partner Hack Meyers at November to Remember. Rotten and D-Von pursued the World Tag Team Championship, receiving title shots against The Gangstas on the December 10 episode of Hardcore TV and The Eliminators at House Party on January 11, 1997, but failed to win the titles. Rotten followed with a feud against Dudley Brothers member Spike Dudley, whom he defeated in matches at Winter Blowout and CyberSlam. = Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (1997-1999) = D-Von Dudley went on to form a tag team with Buh Buh Ray Dudley called Dudley Boyz at Crossing the Line Again, which broke up Rotten's team with D-Von and Rotten moved on to singles competition. Shortly after, he formed a tag team with newcomer Balls Mahoney called The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks, thus turning into a fan favorite again. The team began pursuing the World Tag Team Championship and feuded with teams such as Dudley Boyz, The Full Blooded Italians and The Gangstanators for the title. Rotten made his pay-per-view debut at November to Remember, where Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks competed against Gangstanators, FBI and Dudley Boyz in a four- way dance for the tag team titles, where they were the last team eliminated by defending champions Full Blooded Italians. Mahoney and Rotten often teamed with the likes of New Jack and Spike Dudley to feud with Dudley Boyz and The Full Blooded Italians. Mahoney and Rotten were frequent contenders for the World Tag Team Championship but came up short in their bid for the titles. They received several title shots against Chris Candido and Lance Storm for the tag team titles including one at Wrestlepalooza on May 3, 1998, but came up short in their title opportunities. Rotten was out of action due to injury in September and returned to ECW on December 4 by attacking Buh Buh Ray Dudley with a barbed wire baseball bat after a match between Dudley Boyz and The Gangstanators. Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks would then challenge Rob Van Dam and Sabu for the World Tag Team Championship on numerous occasions including the House Party event on January 16, 1999, but failed to win the title. They also entered a feud with Danny Doring and Roadkill after beating Doring and Roadkill and FBI in a three-way dance at Guilty as Charged, resulting in Mahoney and Rotten taking on Doring and Roadkill in a series of matches including one at Crossing the Line, which Mahoney and Rotten won. At CyberSlam, Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks and New Jack lost to Mr. Mustafa and the Dudley Boyz in an Ultimate Jeopardy match. At Anarchy Rulz, Rotten issued a challenge to Mike Awesome for the World Heavyweight Championship, right before the World Television Championship main event match but was confronted and attacked by Impact Players and Johnny Smith, who was the scheduled opponent for World Television Champion Rob Van Dam. Balls Mahoney and Spike Dudley made the rescue for Rotten by attacking Impact Players and Smith, resulting in Mahoney substituting for Smith and went on to lose. Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks would feud with the likes of The New Dangerous Alliance and Da Baldies during the fall of 1999. At November to Remember, the Freaks teamed with New Jack to take on Da Baldies (Spanish Angel, Tony DeVito, P.N. News and Vito LoGrasso) in a three-on-four handicap match, which they lost to Baldies. On the December 19 episode of ECW on TNN, Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks defeated Baldies members P.N. News and Vito LoGrasso in a falls count anywhere match, in which the loser of the fall would be forced to leave ECW, thus forcing Vito out of ECW. Rotten wrestled his last ECW match on December 9, in which he and New Jack defeated Tony DeVito and P.N. News. Return to the independent circuit (1999‚Äì2014) Rotten eventually left ECW in 1999 and appeared with Xtreme Pro Wrestling and the Japanese Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling promotion. Rotten then wrestled on the independent circuit throughout the early 2000s. Rotten performed at the ECW reunion event Hardcore Homecoming on June 10, 2005, reuniting with Ian Rotten in a loss to The Gangstanators. At the follow-up event, November Reign, on November 6, 2005, Rotten defeated Ian Rotten in a Taipei Death match.

He attended Southern High School, leaving in eleventh grade to pursue his ambition of becoming a professional wrestler. Knighton suffered from a spine injury in his final years that forced him out of the ring and required the use of a wheelchair. He was living in Anchorage Rehab Center in Salisbury, Maryland. Survived by longtime girlfriend Lisa Twigg  Death  Knighton was found dead by police in a McDonald's bathroom in Linthicum, Maryland on February 4, 2016. An autopsy showed that Knighton's cause of death was a heroin overdose. In July 2016, his estate was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. On October 21, 2016, it was revealed Knighton suffered from CTE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.

In English the term is also an architectural term (see Cour d'Honneur). Court of chivalry The court of chivalry was at one time also known as a \\"court of honour\\". In British law, the court of chivalry was a court held before the Earl Marshal and the Lord High Constable; since the abolition of the office of the Lord High Constable, it has been conducted by the Earl Marshal alone. It was established by a statute 13 Ric. II c.2. This court had jurisdiction to try cases concerning contracts and other matters concerning deeds and acts of war. The court of chivalry also has jurisdiction over disputes regarding heraldry and rights to use coats of arms. The court of chivalry is not a court of record, and as such has no power to enforce its decisions by fine or imprisonment; as such it became relatively disused. It is not obsolete, however, and cases have been brought before the court of chivalry as recently as 1954. Dueling A court of honor can also be a military court to investigate and issue judgments concerning acts or omissions which are considered to be unbecoming to an \\"officer and a gentleman\\", but which do not rise to the level where they are considered crimes triable under military law. A court of honor is also the name given to a tribunal of noblemen who would decide whether a grievance over a point of honor rose to the level warranting a duel, and if so set rules for its fair conduct. Scouting Many Scouting organizations use the term \\"Court of Honor\\" to refer to a meeting of Patrol Leaders in the Scout troop to plan activities with their Scout Leaders. In the Boy Scouts of America a court of honor is a formal troop ceremony usually held quarterly (and intermittently upon conferment of Eagle Scout rank) where Scouts and their families come together to receive rank advancement, merit badges, and other awards. It is also important for Scouts to participate in a court of honor because it counts towards the Second Class requirement 1a and First Class requirement 1a. It is not a regular troop meeting. In the Scout Association of Japan a formal troop advancement ceremony is held once a year where Scouts receive rank advancement, merit badges, and other awards, and Scouts in the same school year receive the same rank advancement. It is uncommon for the Scouts' family members to attend, as it is a regular troop meeting. In the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, a Court of Honor is a formal ceremony for conferment of the Eagle Scout rank medal on a Boy Scout. The National Court of Honor is a unit in the organization which determines and decides on various important conferments for Scouts and Scouters. In Scouts South Africa, a court of honor is held every 4 weeks,9th Irene Air Scouts Website explaining Court of Honor normally at the beginning of a new month. The Patrol Leaders (PLs) and a Scouter are expected to attend, they are responsible for the majority of decisions regarding troop discipline, patrol management, troop programme and such. The Troop Scouter is the only adult leader regularly attending these meetings, and has the right to veto decisions. The Troop Scouter generally only acts in an advisory role, allowing the Scouts themselves to make important decisions. The Court of Honor may invite other Scouters to hear their input.

E.1416‚Äì1898 is a type of Japanese multi-coloured woodblock printing; the technique is used primarily in ukiyo-e. It was invented in the 1760s, and perfected and popularized by the printmaker Suzuki Harunobu, who produced many nishiki-e prints between 1765 and his death five years later. Previously, most prints had been in black-and- white, coloured by hand, or coloured with the addition of one or two colour ink blocks. A nishiki-e print is created by carving a separate woodblock for every colour, and using them in a stepwise fashion. An engraver by the name of Kinroku is credited with the technical innovations that allowed so many blocks of separate colours to fit together perfectly on the page, in order to create a single complete image.

It ended with the Zanclean flood, when the Atlantic reclaimed the basin.Gautier, F., Clauzon, G., Suc, J.P., Cravatte, J., Violanti, D., 1994. Age and duration of the Messinian salinity crisis. C.R. Acad. Sci., Paris (IIA) 318, 1103‚Äì1109. Sediment samples from below the deep seafloor of the Mediterranean Sea, which include evaporite minerals, soils, and fossil plants, show that the precursor of the Strait of Gibraltar closed tight about 5.96 million years ago, sealing the Mediterranean off from the Atlantic. This resulted in a period of partial desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea, the first of several such periods during the late Miocene. After the strait closed for the last time around 5.6 Ma, the region's generally dry climate at the time dried the Mediterranean basin out nearly completely within a thousand years. This massive desiccation left a deep dry basin, reaching deep below normal sea level, with a few hypersaline pockets similar to today's Dead Sea. Then, around 5.5 Ma, less dry climatic conditions resulted in the basin receiving more freshwater from rivers, progressively filling and diluting the hypersaline lakes into larger pockets of brackish water (much like today's Caspian Sea). The Messinian Salinity Crisis ended with the Strait of Gibraltar finally reopening 5.33 Ma, when the Atlantic rapidly filled up the Mediterranean basin in what is known as the Zanclean flood. Even today, the Mediterranean is considerably saltier than the North Atlantic, owing to its near isolation by the Strait of Gibraltar and its high rate of evaporation. If the Strait of Gibraltar closes again (which is likely to happen in the near future in geological time), the Mediterranean would mostly evaporate in about a thousand years, after which continued northward movement of Africa may obliterate the Mediterranean altogether. Naming and first evidence In the 19th century, the Swiss geologist and paleontologist Karl Mayer-Eymar (1826‚Äì1907) studied fossils embedded between gypsum-bearing, brackish, and freshwater sediment layers, and identified them as having been deposited just before the end of the Miocene Epoch. In 1867, he named the period the Messinian after the city of Messina in Sicily, Italy.Mayer-Eymar, Karl (1867) Catalogue syst√©matique et descriptif des fossiles des terrains tertiaires qui se trouvent du Mus√©e f√©d√©ral de Z√ºrich (Z√ºrich, Switzerland: Librairie Schabelitz, 1867), page 13. From page 13: \\"Dans ces circonstances, je crois qu'il m'est permis comme cr√©ateur d'une classification cons√©quente et logique de proposer pour l'√©tage en question un nom qui lui convient en tous points. Ce nom est celui d'Etage messinien.\\" (In these circumstances, I think that I am permitted as the creator of a consistent and logical classification to propose for the stage in question a name that suits it in every way. That name is that of the Messinian stage.) Since then, several other salt-rich and gypsum-rich evaporite layers throughout the Mediterranean region have been dated to the same period.Kenneth J. Hsu, The Mediterranean Was a Desert, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey 1983. A Voyage of the Glomar Challenger. Confirmation and further evidence Seismic surveying of the Mediterranean basin in 1961 revealed a geological feature some below the seafloor. This feature, dubbed the M reflector, closely followed the contours of the present seafloor, suggesting that it was laid down evenly and consistently at some point in the past. The origin of this layer was largely interpreted as related to salt deposition. However, different interpretations were proposed for the age of salt and its deposition. Earlier suggestions from Denizot in 1957 and Ruggieri in 1967 proposed that this layer was of Late Miocene age, and the same Ruggieri coined the term Messinian Salinity Crisis. New and high-quality seismic data on the M-reflector were acquired in the Mediterranean Basin in 1970, published by e.g. Auzende et al. (1971). At the same time, the salt was cored during Leg 13 of the Deep Sea Drilling Program conducted from the Glomar Challenger under the supervision of co-chief scientists William B.F. Ryan and Kenneth J. Hsu. These deposits were dated and interpreted for the first time as deep-basin products of the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Cones of gypsum, which formed on the sea floor as a result of evaporation. Evaporation of one metre of seawater precipitates around 1 mm of gypsum. The scale of gypsum formation in the Sorbas basin (Yesares member). The upward-growing cones suggest precipitation on the sea floor (not within sediments). The first drilling of the Messinian salt at the deeper parts of the Mediterranean Sea came in the summer of 1970, when geologists aboard the Glomar Challenger brought up drill cores containing arroyo gravels and red and green floodplain silts; and gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt, and various other evaporite minerals that often form from drying of brine or seawater, including in a few places potash, left where the last bitter, mineral-rich waters dried up. One drill core contained a wind-blown cross-bedded deposit of deep-sea foraminiferal ooze that had dried into dust and been blown about on the hot dry abyssal plain by sandstorms, mixed with quartz sand blown in from nearby continents, and ended up in a brine lake interbedded between two layers of halite. These layers alternated with layers containing marine fossils, indicating a succession of drying and flooding periods. The massive presence of salt does not require a desiccation of the sea. The main evidence for the evaporative drawdown of the Mediterranean comes from the remains of many (now submerged) canyons that were cut into the sides of the dry Mediterranean basin by rivers flowing down to the abyssal plain. For example, the Nile cut its bed down to several hundred feet below sea level at Aswan (where Ivan S. Chumakov found marine Pliocene foraminifers in 1967), and below sea level just north of Cairo. In many places in the Mediterranean, fossilized cracks have been found where muddy sediment had dried and cracked in the sunlight and drought. In the Western Mediterranean series, the presence of pelagic oozes interbedded within the evaporites suggests that the area was repeatedly flooded and desiccated over 700,000 years. Chronology Based on palaeomagnetic datings of Messinian deposits that have since been brought above sea level by tectonic activity, the salinity crisis started at the same time over all the Mediterranean basin, at 5.96 ¬± 0.02 million years ago. This episode comprises the second part of what is called the \\"Messinian\\" age of the Miocene epoch. This age was characterised by several stages of tectonic activity and sea level fluctuations, as well as erosional and depositional events, all more or less interrelated (van Dijk et al., 1998). The Mediterranean-Atlantic strait closed tight time and time again, and the Mediterranean Sea, for the first time and then repeatedly, partially desiccated. The basin was finally isolated from the Atlantic Ocean for a longer period, between 5.59 and 5.33 million years ago, resulting in a large or smaller (depending on the scientific model applied) lowering of the Mediterranean sea level. During the initial, very dry stages (5.6‚Äì5.5 Ma), there was extensive erosion, creating several huge canyon systems (some similar in scale to the Grand Canyon) around the Mediterranean. Later stages (5.50‚Äì5.33 Ma) are marked by cyclic evaporite deposition into a large \\"lake-sea\\" basin (\\"Lago Mare\\" event). About 5.33 million years ago, at the start of the Zanclean age (at the start of the Pliocene epoch), the barrier at the Strait of Gibraltar broke one last time, re-flooding the Mediterranean basin in the Zanclean flood (Blanc, 2002;Blanc, P.-L. (2002) The opening of the Plio-Quaternary Gibraltar Strait: assessing the size of a cataclysm. Geodin. Acta, 15, 303‚Äì317. Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2009), favouring slope destabilization (Gargani et al., 2014). The basin has not desiccated since. Several cycles The amount of Messinian salts has been estimated as around (but this estimate may be reduced by 50 to 75% when more information becomes available) and more than 1 million cubic kilometres, 50 times the amount of salt normally in the Mediterranean waters. This suggests either a succession of desiccations or a long period of hypersalinity during which incoming water from the Atlantic Ocean was evaporated with the level of the Mediterranean brine being similar to that of the Atlantic. The nature of the strata points strongly to several cycles of the Mediterranean Sea completely drying and being refilled (Gargani and Rigollet, 2007), with drying periods correlating to periods of cooler global temperatures; which were therefore drier in the Mediterranean region. Each refilling was presumably caused by a seawater inlet opening, either tectonically, or by a river flowing eastwards below sea level into the \\"Mediterranean Sink\\" cutting its valley head back west until it let the sea in, similarly to a river capture. The last refilling was at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, when the Strait of Gibraltar broke wide open permanently. Upon closely examining the Hole 124 core, Kenneth J. Hsu found that: Research since then has suggested that the desiccation- flooding cycle may have repeated several times during the last 630,000 years of the Miocene epoch. This could explain the large amount of salt deposited. Recent studies, however, show that the repeated desiccation and flooding is unlikely from a geodynamic point of view.Garcia-Castellanos, D., A. Villase√±or, 2011. Messinian salinity crisis regulated by competing tectonics and erosion at the Gibraltar Arc. Nature, 2011-12-15 pdf here Link Synchronism versus diachronism‚Äîdeep water versus shallow water evaporites thumb350pxHypotheses of evaporite formation during the MSC. a: Diachronous deposition: Evaporites (pink) were deposited in landward basins first, and closer to the Atlantic as the extent of the Mediterranean Sea (dark blue) diminished towards the gateway. The light blue shows the original sea level. b: Synchronous deposition in marginal basins. Sea level drops slightly, but the whole basin is still connected to the Atlantic. Reduced inflow allows the accumulation of evaporites in shallow basins only. c: Synchronous, basin-wide deposition. Closure or restriction of the Atlantic seaway by tectonic activity (dark grey) causes evaporite deposition simultaneously across the entire basin; the basin may not need to empty completely, as salts are concentrated by evaporation. Some major questions remain concerning the beginning of the crisis in the central Mediterranean Basin. The geometric physical link between the evaporitic series identified in marginal basins accessible for field studies, such as the Tabernas basin and Sorbas basin, and the evaporitic series of the central basins has never been made. Using the concept of deposition in both shallow and deep basins during the Messinian (i.e. assuming that both Basin types existed during this period), two major groupings are evident: one that favours a synchronous deposition (image c) of the first evaporites in all the basins before the major phase of erosion (Krijgsman et al., 1999); and the other that favours a diachronous deposition (image a) of the evaporites through more than one phases of desiccation which would first have affected the marginal basins and later the central basins. Another school suggests that desiccation was synchronous, but occurred mainly in shallower basins. This model would suggest that the sea level of the whole Mediterranean basin fell at once, but only shallower basins dried out enough to deposit salt beds. See image b. As highlighted in the work of van Dijk (1992)van Dijk, J.P. (1992, d); Late Neogene fore-arc basin evolution in the Calabrian Arc (Central Mediterranean). Tectonic sequence stratigraphy and dynamic geohistory. With special reference to the geology of Central Calabria. Geologica Ultrajectina, 92, 288 pp. and van Dijk et al. (1998) the history of desiccation and erosion was complexly interacting with tectonic uplift and subsidence events, and erosional episodes. They also questioned again like some previous authors had done, whether the basins now observed as \\"deep\\" were actually also deep during the Messinian Episode and gave different names to the end-member scenarios described above. Distinguishing between these hypotheses requires the calibration of gypsum deposits. Gypsum is the first salt (calcium sulphate) to be deposited from a desiccating basin. Magnetostratigraphy offers a broad constraint on timing, but no fine detail. Therefore, cyclostratigraphy is relied upon to compare the dates of sediments. The typical case study compares the gypsum evaporites in the main Mediterranean basin with those of the Sorbas basin, a smaller basin on the flanks of the Mediterranean Sea that is now exposed in southern Spain. The relationship between these two basins is assumed to represent the relationships of the wider region. Recent work has relied on cyclostratigraphy to correlate the underlying marl beds, which appear to have given way to gypsum at exactly the same time in both basins (Krijgsman, 2001). The proponents of this hypothesis claim that cyclic variations in bed compositions are astronomically tuned, and the beds' magnitude can be calibrated to show they were contemporaneous‚Äîa strong argument. In order to refute it, it is necessary to propose an alternative mechanism for generating these cyclic bands, or for erosion to have coincidentally removed just the right amount of sediment everywhere before the gypsum was deposited. The proponents claim that the gypsum was deposited directly above the correlated marl layers, and slumped into them, giving the appearance of an unconformable contact. However, their opponents seize upon this apparent inconformity, and claim that the Sorbas Basin was exposed‚Äîtherefore eroding‚Äîwhile the Mediterranean sea was depositing evaporites. This would result in the Sorbas Basin being filled with evaporites at 5.5 million years ago (Ma), compared to the main basin at 5.96 Ma.). Recent works have highlighted a pre-evaporite phase corresponding to a prominent erosional crisis (also named \\"Messinian erosional crisis\\"; the termination of the \\"Mes-1\\" unconformity bound depositional sequence of van Dijk, 1992) responding to a major drawdown of the Mediterranean seawater. Assuming that this major drawdown corresponds to the major Messinian drawdown, they concluded that the Mediterranean bathymetry significantly decreased before the precipitation of central basins evaporites. Regarding these works, a deep water formation seems unlikely. The assumption that central basin evaporites partly deposited under a high bathymetry and before the major phase of erosion should imply the observation of a major detritic event above evaporites in the basin. Such a depositional geometry has not been observed on data. This theory corresponds to one of the end-member scenarios discussed by van Dijk et al. Causes Several possible causes of the series of Messinian crises have been considered. While there is disagreement on all fronts, the most general consensus seems to agree that climate had a role in forcing the periodic filling and emptying of the basins, and that tectonic factors must have played a part in controlling the height of the sills restricting flow between the Atlantic and Mediterranean (Gargani and Rigollet, 2007). The magnitude and extent of these effects, however, is widely open to interpretation (see, e.g., van Dijk et al. (1998).van Dijk, J.P., Barberis, A., Cantarella, G., and Massa, E. (1998); Central Mediterranean Messinian basin evolution. Tectono- eustasy or eustato-tectonics? Annales Tectonicae, 12, n. 1-2, 7-27. In any case, the causes of the closing and isolation of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean must be found in the area where the Strait of Gibraltar is now. One of the tectonic boundaries between the African Plate and the European Plate and its southern fragments such as the Iberian Plate, is there. This boundary Zone is characterised by an arc-shaped tectonic feature, the Gibraltar Arc, which includes southern Spain and northern Africa. In the present day area of the Mediterranean Sea, are three of these arc-shaped belts: the Gibraltar Arc, the Calabrian Arc, and the Aegean Arc. The kinematics and dynamics of this plate boundary and of the Gibraltar Arc during the late Miocene are strictly related to the causes of the Messinian Salinity Crisis: Tectonic reconfiguration may have closed and re-opened passages; the region where the connection with the Atlantic Ocean was situated is permeated by strike-slip faults and rotating blocks of continental crust. As faulting accommodated the regional compression caused by Africa's convergence with Eurasia, the geography of the region may have altered enough to open and close seaways. However, the precise tectonic activity behind the motion can be interpreted in a number of ways. An extensive discussion can be found in Weijermars (1988). Any model must explain a variety of features of the area: * Shortening and extension occur at the same time in close proximity; sedimentary sequences and their relations to fault activity constrain the rates of uplift and subsidence quite precisely * Fault-bounded continental blocks can often be observed to rotate * The depth and structure of the lithosphere is constrained by records of seismic activity, as well as tomography * The composition of igneous rocks varies‚Äîthis constrains the location and extent of any subduction. There are three contending geodynamic models that may fit the data, models which have been discussed in an equal way for the other arc shaped features in the Mediterranean (for a systematic review see van Dijk & Okkes, 1990): *A moving subduction zone may have caused periodic regional uplift. Changes in volcanic rocks suggest that subduction zones at the rim of the Tethys Sea may have rolled back westwards, changing the chemistry and density in magma underlying the western Mediterranean (Lonergan & White, 1997). However, this does not account for the periodic emptying and refilling of the basin. *The same features can be explained by regional delamination or the loss of a layer of the entire lithosphere. *Deblobbing, the loss of a \\"blob\\" of lithospheric mantle, and the subsequent upward motion of the overlying crust (which has lost its dense mantle \\"anchor\\") may also have caused the observed phenomena (Platt & Vissers, 1989) although the validity of the \\"deblobbing\\" hypothesis has been called into question (Jackson et al., 2004). Of these, only the first model, invoking rollback, seems to explain the rotations observed. However, it is difficult to fit it with the pressure and temperature histories of some metamorphic rocks (Platt et al., 1998). This has led to some interesting combinations of the models which at first hand looked bizarre, in attempts to approach the true state of affairs. Changes in climate must almost certainly be invoked to explain the periodic nature of the events. They occur during cool periods of Milankovic cycles, when less solar energy reached the northern hemisphere. This led to less evaporation of the North Atlantic, hence less rainfall over the Mediterranean. This would have starved the basin of water supply from rivers and allowed its desiccation. Contrary to many people's instincts, there is now a scientific consensus that global sea level fluctuations cannot have been the major cause, although it may have played a role. The lack of ice caps at the time means there was no realistic mechanism to cause significant changes in sea level‚Äîthere was nowhere for the water to go, and the morphology of ocean basins cannot change on such a short timescale. Relationship to climate The climate of the abyssal plain during the drought is unknown. There is no situation on Earth directly comparable to the dry Mediterranean, and thus it is not possible to know its climate. There is not even a consensus as to whether the Mediterranean Sea even dried out completely; it seems likeliest that at least three or four large brine lakes on the abyssal plains remained at all times. The extent of desiccation is very hard to judge, owing to the reflective seismic nature of the salt beds, and the difficulty in drilling cores, making it difficult to map their thickness. Nonetheless, one can study the forces at play in the atmosphere to arrive at a good speculation of the climate. As winds blew across the \\"Mediterranean Sink\\", they would heat or cool adiabatically with altitude. In the empty Mediterranean Basin, the summertime temperatures would probably have been extremely high even during ice age maxima. Using the dry adiabatic lapse rate of around per kilometer, the maximum possible temperature of an area below sea level would be about warmer than it would be at sea level. Under this extreme assumption, maxima would be near at the lowest points of the dry abyssal plain, permitting no permanent life but extremophiles. Further, the altitude below sea level would result in 1.45 to 1.71 atm (1102 to 1300 mmHg) air pressure, further increasing heat stress. Although it was probably quite dry in the Basin, there is no direct way to measure how much drier it would have been. One can imagine that areas not covered by the remaining brine would have been very dry. Today the evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea supplies moisture that falls in frontal storms, but without such moisture, the Mediterranean climate that we associate with Italy, Greece, and the Levant would be limited to the Iberian Peninsula and the western Maghreb. Climates throughout the central and eastern basin of the Mediterranean and surrounding regions to the north and east would have been drier even above modern sea level. The eastern Alps, the Balkans, and the Hungarian plain would also be much drier than they are today, even if the westerlies prevailed as they do now. However, the Paratethys ocean provided water to the area north of the Mediterranean basin. The Wallachian- Pontic and Hungarian basins were underwater during the Miocene, modifying the climate of what is now the Balkans and other areas north of the Mediterranean basin. The Pannonian Sea was a source of water north of the Mediterranean basin until the middle Pleistocene before becoming the Hungarian plain. Debate exists whether the waters of the Wallachian-Pontic basin (and the possibly connected Pannonian Sea) would have had access (thus bringing water) to at least the eastern Mediterranean basin at times during the Miocene. Effects=Effects on biology precipitation of the salt. The inset evokes the transit of mammals (e.g. camels and mice) from Africa to Iberia across the exposed Gibraltar Strait. Messinian salinity crisis animation The Messinian event also provided an opportunity for many African species, including antelopes, elephants and hippopotamuses, to migrate into the empty basin, close to the descending great rivers, to reach interior wetter cooler highlands such as Malta as the sea level was dropping, as such species would not have been able to cross the wide hot empty sink at maximum dryness. After the return of the sea water, they remained on the islands, where they underwent insular dwarfing during the Pleistocene, giving rise to species known from Crete (Hippopotamus creutzburgi), Cyprus (H. minor), Malta (H. melitensis) and Sicily (H. pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus survived until the end of the Pleistocene or early Holocene. But some of these species may have crossed the sea when it was flooded, washed out to sea on rafts of floating vegetation, or with some species (e.g. elephants) by swimming. Global effects The water from the Mediterranean would have been redistributed in the world ocean, raising global sea level by as much as . The Mediterranean basin also sequestered below its seabed a significant percentage of the salt from Earth's oceans; this decreased the average salinity of the world ocean and raised its freezing point.Lecture 17: Mediterranean Dehydrated geography thumbA possible palaeogeographical reconstruction of the west end of the Miocene Mediterranean.

S Sorbas basin, Spain R Rifean corridor B Betic corridor G Strait of Gibraltar M Mediterranean sea The notion of a completely waterless Mediterranean Sea has some corollaries. *At the time, the Strait of Gibraltar was not open, but other seaways (the Betic corridor to the north where the Sierra Nevada or Baetic Cordillera is now, or to the south where the Rifean corridor or corridors where the Rif Mountains are now) linked the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. These must have closed, isolating the basin from the open ocean. *The high level of salinity cannot be tolerated by many known organisms, a factor in reducing the biodiversity of much of the basin. *The basin's low altitude would have made it extremely hot during the summer through adiabatic heating, a conclusion supported by the presence of anhydrite, which is only deposited in water warmer than . *Rivers emptying into the basin would have cut their beds much deeper (at least a further in the case of the Nile, as the buried canyon under Cairo shows) and in the Rhone valley (Gargani, 2004). There is an opinion that during the Messinian, the Red Sea was connected at Suez to the Mediterranean, but was not connected with the Indian Ocean, and dried out along with the Mediterranean.https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL032494, Geophysical Research Letters, Evaporite accumulation during the Messinian Salinity Crisis: The Suez Rift case, by Julien Gargani, Isabelle Moretti, Jean Letouzey, First published: 16 January 2008, https://doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032494 Replenishment When the Strait of Gibraltar was ultimately breached, the Atlantic Ocean would have poured a vast volume of water through what would have presumably been a relatively narrow channel. This refill has been envisaged as resulting in a large waterfall higher than today's Angel Falls at , and far more powerful than either the Iguazu Falls or the Niagara Falls, but recent studies of the underground structures at the Gibraltar Strait show that the flooding channel descended in a rather gradual way to the dry Mediterranean. An enormous deposit of unsorted debris washed in by a massive catastrophic flood-wash has been found in the seabed southeast of the south corner of Sicily.

G. Wells published a popular history book in which it was suggested that the Mediterranean basin had in the past been cut off from the Atlantic. One piece of physical evidence, a deep channel past Gibraltar, had been noticed. Wells estimated that the basin had refilled roughly between 30,000 and 10,000 BC. The theory he printed was that: ** In the last glacial period, so much ocean water was taken into the ice caps that world ocean level dropped below the sill in the Strait of Gibraltar. ** Without the inflow from the Atlantic, the Mediterranean would evaporate much more water than it receives, and would evaporate down to two large lakes, one on the Balearic Abyssal Plain, the other further east. ** The east lake would receive most of the incoming river water, and may have overflowed into the west lake. ** All or some of this seabed may have had a human population, where it was watered from the incoming rivers. ** There is a long deep submerged valley running from the Mediterranean out into the Atlantic. ** (Modern research has shown that Wells' theory is incorrect. All the geological and plant-fossil evidence shows that the Mediterranean did not dry out during the last ice age. Sea levels were lower than today, resulting in a shallower Strait of Gibraltar and a reduced water exchange with the Atlantic, but there was no cut-off.) *Atlantropa, also referred to as Panropa, was a gigantic engineering and colonization project devised by the German architect Herman S√∂rgel in the 1920s and promulgated by him until his death in 1952. Its central feature was a hydroelectric dam to be built across the Strait of Gibraltar,\\"Atlantropa: A plan to dam the Mediterranean Sea.\\" 16 March 2005. Archive. Xefer.

She was named for James and Ryan Thornton, naval officers during the American Civil War, and was the second ship to bear this name. History Thornton was laid down on 3 June 1918 and launched on 2 March 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Marcia Thornton Davis; and placed in commission at Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 July 1919, Commander A. G. Stirling in command. On 26 August, Thornton sailed for Europe. Following a port call in the Azores, the destroyer reached the Strait of Gibraltar on 15 September. For the remainder of 1919, she visited a number of ports, both in the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic coast of Europe. The ship returned to Boston on 12 February 1920 and remained there until 27 March, when she weighed anchor for the Pacific. After calls at several ports on the Gulf of Mexico, the destroyer transited the Panama Canal on 30 April. She then steamed slowly up the western coast of Mexico, stopping along the way at Salina Cruz, Manzanillo and Guaymas to show the flag. On 27 May Thornton reached San Diego, California and, for the next two years, conducted operations along the California coast. On 24 May 1922, Thornton was placed out of commission and laid up at the Destroyer Base, San Diego. Thornton remained in reserve throughout the 1920s and 1930s. World War II On 25 May 1940, she was ordered recommissioned for conversion to a seaplane tender. Accordingly, she was recommissioned, in ordinary, on 24 June 1940 and moved to the San Francisco yard of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation for conversion. On 2 August 1940, Thornton was officially redesignated a seaplane tender (destroyer), AVD-11. Her alterations were completed early in 1941, and she was placed in full commission on 5 March 1941, Lieutenant Commander Wendell F. Kline in command. On 8 April, she reported for duty to Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, at San Pedro. Ten days later, the seaplane tender arrived in Pearl Harbor, and she operated in the Hawaiian Islands until August 1942. During her 16 months in the islands, she made frequent voyages to Midway, Wake Island, Palmyra and other outlying islands of the 14th Naval District. On the morning of 7 December 1941, she was moored at the Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor. Her action report for that day states that the Japanese opened their attack on Pearl Harbor at 0756 and that Thornton's crew, led by four reserve ensigns, was at action stations two minutes later. They fought back with every available weapon: four .50-cal. machine guns, three Lewis guns, three Browning automatic rifles, and twelve .30-cal., bolt-action Springfields. The combined fire of Thornton and accounted for at least one Japanese torpedo bomber and probably discouraged two more from making a run on as the oiler changed berths during the second dive-bombing attack between 0910 and 0917. Thornton suffered no casualties during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Following the Pearl Harbor attack, she was stationed at French Frigate Shoals with as aircraft rescue ships for the planes engaged in the expanded air searches. Coincidentally, the Japanese had planned to use the French Frigate Shoals as a rendezvous point for the second half of Operation K, the reconnaissance of Pearl Harbor. The Japanese subsequently cancelled the remainder of Operation K after the Japanese submarine I-123, sent to scout the area, was forced to depart.Cressman, Robert. The Official Chronology of the US Navy in World War II. Pg.99Costello, John. The Pacific War 1941-1945. Pg.281 After the victory at Midway, she resumed her runs between the outlying islands of the 14th Naval District, though the Japanese occupation had removed Wake Island from her itinerary, until August 1942. On the 25th, Thornton steamed out of Pearl Harbor, headed north, and arrived at Kodiak, Alaska, on the 30th. For the next two months, the seaplane tender cruised the icy Alaskan seas as a part of Task Force 8. She visited Kodiak, Attu, and Chernofski before departing Kodiak for Pearl Harbor on 21 October. Thornton stopped at Pearl Harbor from 30 October to 10 November, then headed for duty in the South Pacific. After short periods of duty at Suva in the Fiji Islands, Funafuti in the Ellice Islands, and at Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Islands, she moved to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, arriving on 18 July 1943. The seaplane tender remained at Espiritu Santo until 11 November, when she put to sea for Guadalcanal in the Solomons. Between 13 November and 15 November, she made a round-trip run between Guadalcanal and Espiritu Santo to escort from the latter to the former. Following duty in the Solomons and a stop at Pearl Harbor from 5 February to 8 February, Thornton returned to the west coast at Mare Island on 17 February 1944. She remained on the west coast for the next 10 months conducting normal operations and undergoing extensive repairs. On 3 December 1944, the warship departed San Pedro to return to the western Pacific. Fate From mid- December 1944 until late February 1945, Thornton was at Pearl Harbor. On the 22d, she got underway for operations to prepare for the assault on Okinawa. She stopped at Eniwetok early in March, and then moved on to Ulithi, the staging area for Okinawa. On 5 April 1945, while operating in the Ry≈´ky≈´s as part of the Search and Reconnaissance Group of the Southern Attack Force, Thornton collided with and . Her starboard side was severely damaged and open to the sea. On 14 April, she was towed into Kerama Retto. On the 29th, a board of inspection and survey recommended that Thornton be decommissioned, beached, stripped of all useful materiel as needed, and then abandoned. She was beached and decommissioned on 2 May 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 13 August 1945. In July 1957, Thornton's hull was abandoned and donated to the government of the Ryukyu Islands.

It is a U.S. National Historic Landmark, designated in 1978 for its architecture. History The house's floor plan in the shape of a Greek cross, with four equal wings extending from an octagonal core, is based on a published design by William H. Ranlett, The Architect (New York) 1847, Vol. I, Plate 32, published again in Godey's Lady's Book, January 1850; the Godey's Lady's Book engravings were framed and kept in the house.

Hairston. The builder Peter Wilson HairstonPeter Wilson Hairston Papers, University Libraries, University of North Carolina a white Superior Court judge in North Carolina, who had inherited Cooleemee from his grandfather, was a central figure in Henry Wiencek's telling of the family's story. The house is built from approximately 300,000 bricks made on site. Cooleemee Plantation was founded by Colonel Jesse A. Pearson who took part in the capture of approximately 600 tribal Creek Indians during the War of 1812. The Indians known as \\"Kulimi\\", a tribe of the Creek nation, were from the village of \\"Cooleeme\\" near the junction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers. The Creek word means \\"the place where the white oaks grow\\". Upon his return in 1814, he named his existing plantation \\"Cooleemee Hill\\". In 1817, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and four-time state legislator, Peter Hairston, purchased the Cooleemee Hill Plantation for $8 per acre - $20,000 total. In addition to the plantation house, in 1860 there were twenty-three slave dwellings at Cooleemee. The principal crop at Cooleemee was tobacco.In 1860 the census-taker estimated 60,000 pounds of tobacco on the plantation, according to the National Historic Landmark summary listing. In 1997, the Hairston family, who still owned the house, donated a conservation easement to The LandTrust for Central North Carolina, which helped preserve the house and property against development. At that time, the plantation included of farmland (down from at its peak), surrounded by a two-mile (3 km) stretch of the Yadkin River supporting more than 200 species of bird. Cooleemee Plantation was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978. and Family In 1999, Henry Wiencek published The Hairstons: An American Family In Black And White, which told the story of the Hairston family, which continues to own Cooleemee, and of the plantation and its history over the past 150 years. This family, with black and white branches due to slavery, have continued to hold reunions at Cooleemee that honor their family's history and roots in the region. Wiencek, in the course of his preparation for this book, witnessed what he considered to be extraordinary interactions between members of the Hairston Family. In the course of his research, Wiencek learned that the Hairstons were not only the largest slaveholding family in the South, but also slave traders. Public sale of Hairston lands, Forsyth County, North Carolina, 1888 Peter Wilson Hairston, the latest Hairston to own the property at the end of the 20th century, published a book in 1986 accounting the history of the family's enslaved people, which helped other research into the family and the property. Hairston died in February 2007 in the same bed in which he was born. Archaeology About 175 arrowheads that were found on the western side of the Yadkin River at Cooleemee Plantation were classified by Dr. Joffre L. Coe of the University of North Carolina, and Dr. James Bingham, former President of the North Carolina Archaeological Society. The arrowheads which were from different peoples and of different times were dated from approximately 7000 BCE to the 18th century. Several specimens exist which date from 8000 to 8500 years old with the eldest, a Hardaway Point, being dated at 9000 years old.

H. 1991 Root-knot Nematodes: Meloidogyne species and races. In: Manual of Agricultural Nematology, W. R. Nickle. (Ed). Marcel Dekker, New York. pp 281 ‚Äì 286. Meloidogyne occurs in 23 of 43 crops listed as having plant-parasitic nematodes of major importance, ranging from field crops, through pasture and grasses, to horticultural, ornamental and vegetable crops. If root-knot nematodes become established in deep-rooted, perennial crops, control is difficult and options are limited. Meloidogyne spp. were first reported in cassava by Neal in 1889.Neal, J.

Early-season infection leads to worse damage.Makumbi-kidza, N. N., Speijer and Sikora R. A. 2000. Effects of Meloidogyne incognita on Growth and Storage- Root Formation of Cassava (Manihot esculenta). J Nematol.; 32(4S): 475‚Äì477. In most crops, nematode damage reduces plant health and growth; in cassava, though, nematode damage sometimes leads to increased aerial growth as the plants try to compensate. This possibly enables the plant to maintain a reasonable level of production. Therefore, aerial correlations to nematode density can be positive, negative or not at all.Gapasin, R.M. 1980. Reaction of golden yellow cassava to Meloidogyne spp. Inoculation. Annals of Tropical Research 2:49-53. . Vegetable crops grown in warm climates can experience severe losses from root-knot nematodes, and are often routinely treated with a chemical nematicide. Root-knot nematode damage results in poor growth, a decline in quality and yield of the crop and reduced resistance to other stresses (e.g. drought, other diseases). A high level of damage can lead to total crop loss. Nematode-damaged roots do not use water and fertilisers as effectively, leading to additional losses for the grower. In cassava, it has been suggested that levels of Meloidogyne spp. that are sufficient to cause injury rarely occur naturally. However, with changing farming systems, in a disease complex or weakened by other factors, nematode damage is likely to be associated with other problems.Theberge, R. L. (eds). 1985. Common African Pests and Diseases of cassava, Yam, Sweet Potato and Cocoyam. International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Ibadan, Nigeria 107 p. Root-knot galls Control Root-knot nematodes can be controlled with biocontrol agents Paecilomyces lilacinus, Pasteuria penetrans and Juglone. Life cycle All nematodes pass through an embryonic stage, four juvenile stages (J1‚ÄìJ4) and an adult stage. Juvenile Meloidogynes parasites hatch from eggs as vermiform, second-stage juveniles (J2), the first moult having occurred within the egg. Newly hatched juveniles have a short free-living stage in the soil, in the rhizosphere of the host plants. They may reinvade the host plants of their parent or migrate through the soil to find a new host root. J2 larvae do not feed during the free-living stage, but use lipids stored in the gut. An excellent model system for the study of the parasitic behaviour of plant- parasitic nematodes has been developed using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model host. The Arabidopsis roots are initially small and transparent, enabling every detail to be seen. Invasion and migration in the root was studied using M. incognita.Wyss, U., Grundler, F.M.W. & Munch, A. 1992 The parasitic behaviour of second stage juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. Nematologica, 38, 98 - 111. Briefly, second stage juveniles invade in the root elongation region and migrate in the root until they became sedentary. Signals from the J2 promote parenchyma cells near the head of the J2 to become multinucleateHussey, R. S. & Grundler, F. M. W. 1998 Nematode parasitism of plants. In: The Physiology and Biochemistry of free- living and plant-parasitic nematodes. Perry, R. N. & Wright, D. J. (Eds), CABI Publishing, UK. pp 213 ‚Äì 243. to form feeding cells, generally known as giant cells, from which the J2 and later the adults feed. Concomitant with giant cell formation, the surrounding root tissue gives rise to a gall in which the developing juvenile is embedded. Juveniles first feed from the giant cells about 24 hours after becoming sedentary. After further feeding, the J2s undergo morphological changes and become saccate. Without further feeding, they moult three times and eventually become adults. In females, which are close to spherical, feeding resumes and the reproductive system develops. The life span of an adult female may extend to three months, and many hundreds of eggs can be produced. Females can continue egg laying after harvest of aerial parts of the plant and the survival stage between crops is generally within the egg. The length of the life cycle is temperature-dependent.Madulu, J. & Trudgill, D. L. 1994 Influence of temperature on Meloidogyne javanica. Nematologica, 40, 230 - 243.Trudgill, D. L. 1995 An assessment of the relevance of thermal time relationships to nematology. Fundamental and Applied Nematology, 18, 407 - 417. The relationship between rate of development and temperature is linear over much of the root-knot nematode life cycle, though it is possible the component stages of the life cycle, e.g. egg development, host root invasion or growth, have slightly different optima. Species within the genus Meloidogyne also have different temperature optima. In M. javanica, development occurs between 13 and 34 ¬∞C, with optimal development at about 29 ¬∞C. Gelatinous matrix Root-knot nematode females lay eggs into a gelatinous matrix produced by six rectal glands and secreted before and during egg laying.Maggenti, A. R. & Allen, M. W. 1960 The origin of the gelatinous matrix in Meloidogyne. Proceedings of the Helminthological Society of Washington, 27, 4 - 10. The matrix initially forms a canal through the outer layers of root tissue and later surrounds the eggs, providing a barrier to water loss by maintaining a high moisture level around the eggs.Wallace, H. R. 1968 The influence of soil moisture on survival and hatch of Meloidogyne javanica. Nematologica, 14, 231-242. As the gelatinous matrix ages, it becomes tanned, turning from a sticky, colourless jelly to an orange-brown substance which appears layered.Bird, A. F. 1958 The adult female cuticle and egg sac of the genus Meloidogyne Goeldi, 1887. Nematologica, 3, 205 - 212. Egg formation and development Egg formation in M. javanica has been studied in detail, and is similar to egg formation in the well studied, free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Wood, W. B. 1988 Introduction to C.elegans. In::The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, W. B. Wood (Ed), Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, New York. pp 1 ‚Äì 16. Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a phase contrast microscope following preparation of an egg mass squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting in the first stage juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg. The J1 stage of C. elegans has 558 cells, and the J1 of M. javanica likely has a similar number, since all nematodes are morphologically and anatomically similar. The egg shell has three layers, with the vitelline layer outermost, then a chitinous layer and a lipid layer innermost. Egg hatching Preceded by induced changes in eggshell permeability, hatching may involve physical and/or enzymatic processes in plant-parasitic nematodes.Norton, D. C. & Niblack, T. L. 1991 Biology and ecology of nematodes. In: Manual of Agricultural Nematology, Nickle, W. R. (Ed), Marcel Dekker, New York. pp 47 ‚Äì 68. Cyst nematodes, such as Globodera rostochiensis, may require a specific signal from the root exudates of the host to trigger hatching. Root-knot nematodes are generally unaffected by the presence of a host, but hatch freely at the appropriate temperature when water is available. However, in an egg mass or cyst, not all eggs will hatch when the conditions are optimal for their particular species, leaving some eggs to hatch at a later date. Ammonium ions have been shown to inhibit hatching and to reduce the plant-penetration ability of M. incognita juveniles that do hatch. Reproduction Root-knot nematodes exhibit a range of reproductive modes, including sexuality (amphimixis), facultative sexuality, meiotic parthenogenesis (automixis) and mitotic parthenogenesis (apomixis).

She received a B.A. in poetry and philosophy from Bard College and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Illinois. Originally a painter in the Abstract Expressionist tradition, Schneeman was uninterested in the masculine heroism of New York painters of the time and turned to performance-based work, primarily characterized by research into visual traditions, taboos, and the body of the individual in relation to social bodies. Although renowned for her work in performance and other media, Schneemann began her career as a painter, stating, \\"I'm a painter. I'm still a painter and I will die a painter. Everything that I have developed has to do with extending visual principles off the canvas.\\" Her works have been shown at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the London National Film Theatre, and many other venues. Keynote address given by Schneemann on October 23, 2008 Schneemann taught at several universities, including the California Institute of the Arts, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Hunter College, and Rutgers University. Additionally, she published widely, producing works such as C√©zanne, She Was a Great Painter (1976) and More than Meat Joy: Performance Works and Selected Writings (1997). Her works have been associated with a variety of art classifications including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, performance art, the Beat Generation, and happenings. Biography Carolee Schneemann was born and raised in Fox Chase, Pennsylvania. As a child, her friends described her in retrospect as \\"a mad pantheist\\", due to her relationship with, and respect for, nature.Montano, pg. 132. As a young adult, Schneemann often visited the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she cited her earliest connections between art and sexuality to her drawings from ages four and five, which she drew on her father's prescription tablets. Her family was generally supportive of her naturalness and freeness with her body. Schneemann attributed her father's support to the fact that he was a rural physician who had to often deal with the body in various states of health. Schneemann was awarded a full scholarship to New York's Bard College. She was the first woman from her family to attend college, but her father discouraged her from an art education. While at Bard, Schneemann began to realize the differences between male and female perceptions of each other's bodies while serving as a nude model for her boyfriend's portraits and while painting nude self- portraits.Montano, pp. 132-33. While on leave from Bard and on a separate scholarship to Columbia University, she met musician James Tenney, who was attending The Juilliard School. Her first experience with experimental film was through Stan Brakhage, Schneeman and Tenney's mutual friend. After graduating from Bard in 1962, Schneemann attended the University of Illinois for her graduate degree. Early work Schneemann began her art career as a painter in the late 1950s. Her painting work began to adopt some of the characteristics of Neo-Dada art, as she used box structures coupled with expressionist brushwork. These constructs share the heavily textural characteristics found in the work of artists such as Robert Rauschenberg. She described the atmosphere in the art community at this time as misogynistic and that female artists of the time were not aware of their bodies. These works integrated influence by artists such as post-impressionist painter Paul C√©zanne and the issues in painting brought up by the abstract expressionists. Schneemann chose to focus on expressiveness in her art rather than accessibility or stylishness. She still described herself as a formalist however, unlike other feminist artists who wanted to distance themselves from male-oriented art history. She is considered a \\"first-generation feminist artist\\", a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Rachel Rosenthal, and Judy Chicago. They were part of the feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. via Questia (subscription required) Schneemann became involved with the art movement of happenings when she organized A Journey through a Disrupted Landscape, inviting people to \\"crawl, climb, negotiate rocks, climb, walk, go through mud\\".ND, p. 114. Soon thereafter she met Allan Kaprow, the primary figure of happenings in addition to artists Red Grooms and Jim Dine. Influenced by figures such as Simone de Beauvoir, Antonin Artaud, Maya Deren, Wilhelm Reich, and Kaprow, Schneemann found herself drawn away from painting. In 1962, Schneemann moved with James Tenney from their residence in Illinois to New York City when Tenney obtained a job with Bell Laboratories as an experimental composer. Through one of Tenney's colleagues at Bell, Billy Kl√ºver, Schneemann was able to meet figures such as Claes Oldenburg, Merce Cunningham, John Cage and Robert Rauschenberg which got her involved with the Judson Memorial Church's art program. There, she participated in works such as Oldenburg's Store Days (1962), and Robert Morris's Site (1964) where she played a living version of √âdouard Manet's Olympia. She contributed to Oldenburg's happening, filmed by Stan VanDerBeek in upstate New York, Birth of the American Flag (1965). Around this time she began to self-represent her nude body in works, feeling that it needed to be seized back from the status of a cultural possession. Schneemann got to personally know many New York musicians and composers in the 1960s as well, including George Brecht, Malcolm Goldstein, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and Steve Reich.ND, p. 116. She was also highly interested in the abstract expressionists of the time, such as Willem de Kooning.ND, pg. 117. However, despite her numerous connections in the art world, Schneeman's painting-constructions did not generate interest from New York galleries and museums, though Oldenburg suggested that there would have been more interest from Europe. The first support for Schneemann's work came from poets such as Robert Kelly, David Antin, and Paul Blackburn who published some of her writings.ND, p. 118. Production on Schneemann's work Eye Body began in 1963. Schneemann created a \\"loft environment\\" filled with broken mirrors, motorized umbrellas, and rhythmic color units. To become a piece of the art herself, Schneemann covered herself in various materials including grease, chalk, and plastic. She created 36 \\"transformative-actions\\" - photographs by Icelandic artist Err√≥ of herself in her constructed environment. Included in these images is a frontal nude featuring two garden snakes crawling on Schneemann's torso. This image drew particular attention both for its \\"archaic eroticism\\" and her visible clitoris. Schneemann claimed that she did not know at the time of the symbolism of the serpent in ancient cultures in figures such as the Minoan Snake Goddess and, in fact, learned of it years later.ND, p. 121. Upon its presentation to the public in 1963, art critics found the piece to be lewd and pornographic. Artist Valie Export cites Eye Body for the way in which Schneemann portrays \\"how random fragments of her memory and personal elements of her environment are superimposed on her perception.\\" Film The 1964 piece Meat JoyMeat Joy revolved around eight partially nude figures dancing and playing with various objects and substances including wet paint, sausage, raw fish, scraps of paper, and raw chickens. It was first performed at the Festival de la Libre Expression in Paris and was later filmed and photographed as performed by her Kinetic Theater group at Judson Memorial Church. She described the piece as an \\"erotic rite\\" and an indulgent Dionysian \\"celebration of flesh as material.\\" Meat Joy is similar to the art form happenings in that they both use improvisation and focused on conception, rather than execution. Though her work of the 1960s was more performance-based, she continued to build assemblages such as the Joseph Cornell-influenced Native Beauties (1962‚Äì64), Music Box Music (1964), and Pharaoh's Daughter (1966). Her Letter to Lou Andreas Salome (1965) expressed Schneemann's philosophical interests by combining scrawlings of Nietzsche and Tolstoy with a Rauschenberg-like form. Schneeman is quoted with saying about the piece, ‚ÄúSensuality was always confused with pornography. The old patriarchal morality of proper behaviour and improper behaviour had no threshold for the pleasures of physical contact that were not explicitly about sex.‚Äù In 1964, Schneemann began production of her 18-minute film Fuses, eventually finishing it in 1967. Fuses portrayed Schneemann and her then- boyfriend James Tenney having sex as recorded by a 16 mm Bolex camera, as her cat, Kitch, observed nearby. Schneemann then altered the film by staining, burning, and directly drawing on the celluloid itself, mixing the concepts of painting and collage. The segments were edited together at varying speeds and superimposed with photographs of nature, which she juxtaposed against her and Tenney's bodies and sexual actions. Fuses was motivated by Schneemann's desire to know if a woman's depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography and classical art as well as a reaction to Stan Brakhage's Loving (1957), Cat's Cradle (1959) and Window Water Baby Moving (1959). Schneemann herself appeared in some Brakhage films, including Cat's Cradle, in which she wore an apron at Brakhage's insistence.\\"An Interview with Carolee Schneemann,\\" Wide Angle, 20(1) (1998), p20-49 Despite her friendship with Brakhage, she later described the experience of being in Cat's Cradle as \\"frightening,\\" remarking that \\"whenever I collaborated, went into a male friend's film, I always thought I would be able to hold my presence, maintain an authenticity. It was soon gone, lost in their celluloid dominance--a terrifying experience-- experiences of true dissolution.\\" She showed Fuses to her contemporaries as she worked on it in 1965 and 1966, receiving mostly positive feedback from her peers. Many critics described it as \\"narcissistic exhibitionism\\" and described it as self-indulgent. She received an especially strong reaction regarding the cunnilingus scene of the film. While Fuses is viewed as a \\"proto-feminist\\" film, Schneemann felt that it was largely neglected by feminist film historians. The film lacked the fetishism and objectification of the female body as seen in much male-oriented pornography. Two years after its completion, it won a Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Selection prize. Pop artist Andy Warhol, with whom Schneemann was acquainted, having spent time at The Factory, drolly remarked that Schneemann should have taken the film to Hollywood.ND, p. 125. Fuses became the first in Carolee Schneemann's Autobiographical Trilogy. Though her works of the 1960s such as this shared many of the same ideas with the concurrent Fluxus artists, she remained independent of any specific movement. They formed the groundwork for the feminist art movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. Schneemann performing her piece Interior Scroll, 1975. Schneemann along with Yves Klein in France, and Yayoi Kusama, Charlotte Moorman, and Yoko Ono in New York City were pioneers of performance based works of art, that often entailed nudity. Schneemann began work on the next film, Plumb Line, in her Autobiographical Trilogy in 1968. The film opens with a still shot of a man's face with a plumb line in front of it before the entire image begins to burn. Various images including Schneemann and the man appear in different quadrants of the frame while a discombobulating soundtrack consisting of music, sirens, and cat noises among other things play in the background. The sound and visuals grow more intense as the film progresses, with Schneemann narrating about a period of physical and emotional illness. The film ends with Schneemann attacking a series of projected images and a repetition of the opening segment of the film. During a showing of Plumb Line at a women's film festival, the film was booed for the image of the man at the beginning of the film. From 1973 to 1976, in her ongoing piece Up to and Including Her Limits, a naked Schneemann is suspended from a tree surgeon's harness, which is attached from the ceiling above a canvas. Using the motions of her body to make marks with a crayon, the artist maps time processes as a video monitor records the movement of the artist. She manually lowers and raises the rope in which she suspends, to reach all corners of the canvas. In this work, Schneemann addresses the male-dominated art world of Abstract Expressionism and Action painting, specifically work done by artists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Schneemann arrived at the museum when it opened with the cleaners, guards, secretaries, maintenance crew and remained until it closed. Through this practice the artist explored the political and personal implications of the museum space by enabling the place of art creation and art presentation to become one.[1] Schneemann intended to do away with performance, a fixed audience, rehearsals, improvisation, sequences, conscious intention, technical cues, and a central metaphor or theme in order to explore what is left. [2] In 1984, Schneemann completed the final video, a compilation of video footage from six performances: the Berkeley Museum, 1974; London Filmmaker's Cooperative, 1974; Artists Space, NY, 1974; Anthology Film Archives, NY, 1974; The Kitchen, NY, 1976; and the Studio Galerie, Berlin, 1976.[3] In 1975, Schneemann performed Interior Scroll in East Hampton, New York and later that year, at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado. This was a notable Fluxus-influenced piece featuring her use of text and body. In her performance, Schneemann entered wrapped in a sheet, under which she wore an apron. She disrobed and then got on a table where she outlined her body with mud. Several times, she would take \\"action poses\\", similar to those in figure drawing classes. Concurrently, she read from her book C√©zanne, She Was a Great Painter. Following this, she dropped the book and slowly extracted from her vagina, a scroll from which she read. Schneeman's speech described a parody version of an encounter where she received criticism on her films for their ‚Äúpersistence of feelings‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal clutter‚Äù. Art Historian David Hopkins suggests that this performance was a comment on both ‚Äúinternalized criticism‚Äù, and possibly ‚Äúfeminist interest‚Äù in female writing. Schneemann's feminist scroll speech, according to performance theorist Jeanie Forte, made it seem as if \\"[Schneemann]'s vagina itself is reporting [...] sexism\\". Art critic Robert C. Morgan states that it is necessary to acknowledge the period during which Interior Scroll was produced in order to understand it. He argues that by placing the source of artistic creativity at the female genitals, Schneemann is changing the masculine overtones of minimalist art and conceptual art into a feminist exploration of her body. Interior Scroll, along with Judy Chicago's Dinner Party, helped pioneer many of the ideas later popularized by the off- broadway show The Vagina Monologues. In 1978, Schneemann finished the last film, Kitch's Last Meal, in what was later called her \\"Autobiographical Trilogy\\". 1980s‚Äì2010s Schneemann said that in the 1980s her work was sometimes considered by various feminist groups to be an insufficient response to many feminist issues of the time. Her 1994 piece Mortal Coils commemorated fifteen friends and colleagues who had died over the period of two years including Hannah Wilke, John Cage, and Charlotte Moorman. The piece consisted of rotating mechanisms from which hung coiled ropes while slides of the commemorated artists were shown on the walls. From 1981 to 1988, Schneemann's piece Infinity Kisses was put on display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The wall installation consisting of 140 self-shot images, depicted Schneemann kissing her cat at various angles. In December 2001, she unveiled Terminal Velocity, which consisted of a group of photographs of people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Along with another of Schneemann's works which used the same images, Dark Pond, Schneemann sought to \\"personalize\\" the victims of the attack.Schneemann as quoted in To achieve this, she digitally enhanced and enlarged the figures in the images, isolating the figures from the surroundings. Schneemann continued to produce art later in life, including the 2007 installation Devour, which featured videos of recent wars contrasted with everyday images of United States daily life on dual screens. She was interviewed for the 2010 film !Women Art Revolution. Themes One of Schneemann's primary focuses in her work was the separation between eroticism and the politics of gender. Her cat Kitch, which was featured in works such as Fuses (1967) and Kitch's Last Meal (1978), was a major figure in Schneemann's work for almost twenty years. She used Kitch as an \\"objective\\" observer to her and Tenney's sexual activities, as she stated that she was unaffected by human mores. One of her later cats, Vesper, was featured in the photographic series Infinity Kisses (1986). In a wall-size collection of 140 photos, Schneemann documented her daily kisses with Vesper and documented \\"the artist at life\\". With numerous works foregrounding the centrality of feline companions in Schneemann's life, scholars now locate her work as significant for new accounts of human-animal relations. She listed as an aesthetic influence on herself and James Tenney the poet Charles Olson, especially to the collage Maximus at Gloucester but also in general, \\"in relationship to his concern for deep imagery, sustained metaphor, and also that he had been researching Tenney‚Äôs ancestors\\", despite his occasional sexist comments.Carolee Schneemann Speaks, New England Journal of Aesthetic Research. Posted Oct. 11, 2007. Painting Schneemann considered her photographic and body pieces to still be based in painting despite appearing otherwise on the surface. She described herself as \\"A painter who has left the canvas to activate actual space and lived time.\\" She cited her studies with painter Paul Brach as teaching her to \\"understand the stroke as an event in time\\" and to think of her performers as \\"colors in three dimensions.\\" Schneemann took the ideas found in her figurative abstract paintings of the 1950s, where she cut and destroyed layers of paint from their surfaces, and transferred them to her photographic work Eye Body.Stiles, p. 4. Art history professor Kristine Stiles asserts that Schneemann's entire oeuvre is devoted to exploring the concepts of figure- ground, relationality (both through use of her body), and similitude (through the use of cats and trees).Stiles, p. 8. Stiles asserts that the issues of sex and politics in Schneemann's work merely dictate how the art is shaped, rather than the formal concepts found behind it.Stiles, p. 11. For example, Schneemann relates the colors and movement featured in Fuses to brush strokes in painting. Her 1976 piece Up to and Including Her Limits, too, invoked the gestural brush strokes of the abstract expressionists with Scheemann swinging from ropes and scribbling with crayons onto a variety of surfaces. Feminism and the body Schneemann acknowledged that she was often labeled as a feminist icon and that she is an influential figure to female artists, but she also noted that she reached out to male artists as well. Though she was noted for being a feminist figure, her works explore issues in art and rely heavily on her broad knowledge of art history. Though works such as Eye Body were meant to explore the processes of painting and assemblage, rather than to address feminist topics, they still possess a strong female presence. In Schneemann's earlier work, she is seen as addressing issues of patriarchal hierarchies in the 1950s American gallery space. Schneemann addressed these issues through various performance pieces that sought to create agency for the female body as being both sensual and sexual, while simultaneously breaking gallery space taboos of nude performances beginning in the 1960s. Unlike much other feminist art, Schneemann's revolves around sexual expression and liberation, rather than referring to victimization or repression of women. According to artist and lecturer Johannes Birringer, Schneemann's work resists the \\"political correctness\\" of some branches of feminism as well as ideologies that some feminists claim are misogynist, such as psychoanalysis.Birringer, pp. 34-35, 44. He also asserts that Schneemann's work is difficult to classify and analyze as it combines constructivist and painterly concepts with her physical body and energy. In her 1976 book C√©zanne, She Was A Great Painter, Schneemann wrote that she used nudity in her artwork to break taboos associated with the kinetic human body and to show that \\"the life of the body is more variously expressive than a sex-negative society can admit.\\"C√©zanne, She Was A Great Painter as quoted in She also stated, \\"In some sense I made a gift of my body to other women; giving our bodies back to ourselves.\\" According to Kristine Stiles, Schneemann read several written works exploring the body's relationship with ‚Äúsexuality, culture, and freedom,‚Äù such as The Theater and Its Double by Antonin Artaud, The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, and The Sexual Revolution by Wilhelm Reich. These written works may have influenced her belief that women must represent themselves through writing about their experiences if they wished to gain equality. She preferred her term \\"art istorical\\" (without the h), so as to reject the \\"his\\" in history. Influence Much of Schneemann's work was performance-based: therefore photographs, video documentation, sketches, and artist's notes are often used to examine her work. It was not until the 1990s that Schneemann's work began to become recognized as a central part of the contemporary feminist art canon. The first prominent exhibition of her work was the modest 1996 retrospective Up To and Including Her Limits, named for her 1973 work of the same title. It was held at New York City's New Museum of Contemporary Art and was organized by senior curator Dan Cameron. Previously, these works were dismissed as narcissism or otherwise overly sexualized forms of expression. Critic Jan Avgikos wrote in 1997, \\"Prior to Schneemann, the female body in art was mute and functioned almost exclusively as a mirror of masculine desire.\\" Critics have also noted that the reaction to Schneemann's work has changed since its original performance. Nancy Princenthal notes that modern viewers of Meat Joy are still squeamish about it; however, now the reaction is also due to the biting of raw chicken or to the men hauling women over their shoulders. Schneemann's work from the late 1950s continues to influence later artists such as Matthew Barney and untold numbers of others, especially women artists. \\"Carolee's Magazine\\" printed by the Artist's Institute in New York City highlights Schneeman's visual legacy through side-by-side comparisons with newer artists. Schneemann's work on the one side is juxtaposed with a work bearing signs of Schneeman's visual style on the other.

The village lies in Lichfield District, and the council ward of Kings Bromley had a population of 1,651 at the time of the 2001 census. (although this area covers a few other small settlements in addition to the parish of Kings Bromley itself, including the villages of Hamstall Ridware and Elmhurst). The parish was in Offlow Hundred. The population as of the 2011 census was measured at 1,163. The Norman village church, which dates back to at least 1170, is named All Saints. The manor was anciently called Brom Legge, and derived its present name from the circumstances of its being the property of the Crown for nearly two centuries after the Norman conquest, previous to which it had been distinguished as the residence of the Earls of Mercia. Leofric, the husband of the famous Lady Godiva, died here in 1057. Henry III granted the manor to the Corbetts, who sold it, in 1569, to Francis Agard, of Ireland. About 1670 it was sold by Charles Agard to John Newton, of the island of Barbados, and in 1794 it was bequeathed by Sarah Newton to her cousins, John & Thomas Lane. South of Kings Bromley at Bromley Hayes is a marina on the Trent and Mersey Canal. Spelling The name of the village and parish seems to be spelled with or without the apostrophe fairly indiscriminately. Both King's Bromley and Kings Bromley are seen in official documents - the village's own website favours Kings Bromley. Sport Kings Bromley has a long-standing Football Club \\"Kings Bromley Swifts\\" which has images dating back as far as 1903. In recent years \\"The Swifts\\" have played their football in the Burton Sunday League Division 1 but were promoted to the Premier Division in 2011/2012. Home games are played at Crawley Lane opposite Kings Bromley Cricket Club on the show field.  Crime  In recent history, Kings Bromley has had a total of three raids in a single year. One of which was on national newspapers, this has led to police investigations in the matter. Despite all of this, the crime still continues, with the most recent raid on 26 March 2018.

History The first historical reference correlated with the submarine volcanoes between S√£o Miguel and Terceira occurred after two ships of the French corsair Henry Tourin sank in the spring of 1718. The last major eruption associated with this region occurred on 31 December 1720.S√©rgio Paulo √Åvila (1997), p.1 Beginning as a submarine eruption, it eventually built into a Surtseyan eruption that resulted in the formation of a circular island long and in altitude. Smoke and steam released by the eruption was visible from the islands of S√£o Miguel and Terceira. The eruption also caused multiple small earthquakes felt on those islands. Designated the Ilha Nova (New Island), it remained above sea-level for only two years, reaching a height of and diameter of . Marine erosion and ocean swells reduced and degraded the cone's size considerably, so that by 21 July 1722 the Conselho da Marinha Portugu√™s (Portuguese Marine Council) was advised the island had disappeared (Oliveira, 1943). After two centuries of disputed references to the existence of the island, on 28 July 1941 the hydrographic ship NH D. Jo√£o de Castro identified its position and cataloged the morphology of the bank. In keeping with nautical tradition, the bank inherited the discovering ship's name. Intense seismic activity in the area in 1997 suggests a small eruption may have occurred in that year. The most recent seismic events from the region occurred from 4 June 2012, when incrementally increasing tremors affected the region. A maximum seismic event was recorded from the islands of S√£o Miguel and Terceira, equivalent to levels III/IV on the Mercalli Scale. Geography The volcano remains seismically active between the islands of S√£o Miguel and Terceira, rising to within of the sea surface. The volcano has a large fumarole field approximately in area. Volcanic gases released from the fumaroles are visible on the water's surface. Two parasitic craters, both about wide, are located on the northwest flank. The younger crater displays a floor consisting of a chilled lava lake with polygonal surface fractures, while the older, less distinct crater is obscured by tephra deposits. Biome D. Jo√£o de Castro Bank showcases significant biodiversity, with approximately 220 identified species. Fish species observed near the bank include Bermuda chub (Kyphosus sectatrix), triggerfish (family Balistidae), needlefish (family Belonidae), wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri), and giant oceanic manta ray (Mobula birostris). The dominant species of aquatic flora are Sargassum seaweeds. The bank is an important fishing ground for demersal fish, such as the black seabream (Spondyliosoma cantharus) and blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus dactylopterus), as well as pelagic tuna species (Thunnus and others). On 27 July 1996, in a scientific expedition organized by the Clube Naval de Ponta Delgada, marine biology researchers from the University of the Azores completed a study identifying species localized within the bank.

The original structure was built in 1866 by the Hudson River Bridge Company but was replaced in 1901‚Äì02. A rotating swing bridge span allows large ships to proceed up the river. The New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) has identified the bridge as a critical link in its Empire Corridor passenger rail line, and has initiated a study project for bridge rehabilitation or replacement. Operation The bridge was purchased from CSX in December 2012 as part of Amtrak's Empire Corridor lease. The lease grants Amtrak ownership and control over the bridge and adjoining 100 miles of track, extending east from Hoffmans, NY to Albany- Rensselaer station, then south to MP 75, just north of Poughkeepsie, NY. A small branch extends east from Albany-Rensselaer station down the Post-Road subdivision, where Amtrak's ownership terminates just south of the Interstate 90 Berkshire Spur overpass. The Livingston Avenue Bridge is most frequently used for east-west travel in New York, as well as freight trains of CSX and CP Rail. The bridge hosts an active railroad interlocking tower and Amtrak block operators staff the tower 24 hours a day. They are responsible for directing rail traffic around Amtrak's Rensselaer Terminal and nearby trackage as well as opening and closing the bridge. Due to the deteriorated condition of the bridge, trains cross one at a time at . DOT considers the swing bridge mechanism to be unreliable and the overall bridge design inadequate for current railroad operating standards. The bridge opens for ship traffic about 400 times per year.New York State Department of Transportation, Albany, NY. \\"Livingston Avenue Bridge. Project I.D. No. 1935.49.\\" Accessed 2012-08-07. History The Hudson River Bridge Company was incorporated April 9, 1856. Work on the bridge was begun in April 1864. The earlier Green Island Bridge had opened to the north in Troy in 1835, but required the longer route of the Schenectady and Troy Railroad west from Troy. The new bridge, called the Hudson River Bridge, was to connect directly to the New York Central Railroad on the west (Albany) side of the bridge and to the Hudson River Railroad, Troy and Greenbush Railroad and Boston and Albany Railroad on the east (Rensselaer) side. The turntable bridge was 4800 feet (1500 m) long, with a clearance of 30 feet (9 m) from high water when closed. The first engine, the Augustus Schell, passed over the bridge on February 18, 1866. Passenger trains started using it on February 22. After the Maiden Lane Bridge was constructed a bit further south, the Hudson River Bridge was used mostly for freight trains and the few passenger trains that passed by Albany but did not need to stop there. The Maiden Lane Bridge was often referred to as the \\"South Bridge\\" and the Hudson River Bridge as the \\"North Bridge\\". In the winter of 1866, once travel patterns were set, Cornelius Vanderbilt, owner of the Hudson River Railroad, suddenly refused to allow any transfers from the New York Central. According to the documentary The Men Who Built America the motivation for this closure was retaliation against the owners of New York Central for negotiating a new contract in bad faith.The Men Who Built America \\"A New War Begins, S1/Ep01 2013 The New York Central board gave in, and in 1867 Vanderbilt acquired the company, and in 1869 merged it with the Hudson River Railroad to form the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. This gave the New York Central a majority of ownership in the company; in 1900 the New York Central leased the Boston and Albany. The current bridge was constructed in 1901-2 and was named the Livingston Avenue Bridge. Letter to Editor from H.F. Donnelly, Albany, June 19, 1902. At the time the original Hudson River Bridge was constructed Livingston Avenue had been named Lumber Street, as it led to the Albany Lumber District. Rehabilitation study A tour boat heading north passes through the Livingston Avenue Bridge As of 2012, DOT is evaluating whether to rehabilitate or replace the structure. The cost to replace the bridge was estimated at $50 million in 1998. Decisions about rehabilitation will include consideration of upgrading the bridge to accommodate high-speed rail traffic. Funding for construction has not yet been allocated. One matter of contention is whether the project will restore the closed public walkway over the bridge. Doing so would greatly improve pedestrian access between Albany and Rensselaer, but the bridge owner, CSX, is citing safety concerns.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation between 1999 and 2001 as a member of The Mean Street Posse.  Early life  Gasparino grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Greenwich High School, where he was a friend of Shane McMahon, the son of the chairman of the World Wrestling Federation. He went on to attend the University of Connecticut on an athletic scholarship, playing football for the Connecticut Huskies. After graduating, Gasparino spoke to McMahon in 1992 about becoming a professional wrestler, but McMahon discouraged him. Gasparino instead went into business, eventually joining Lightnin Rentals, a film production equipment hire company, in New York City.  Professional wrestling career = World Wrestling Federation (1999‚Äì2001)  The Mean Street Posse (1999‚Äì2000) = In early-1999, Shane McMahon asked Gasparino and their mutual friend Rodney Leinhardt to film a series of vignettes about their upbringing in Greenwich to promote his match with X-Pac at WrestleMania XV. The tongue-in-cheek vignettes bragged about the toughness of McMahon and his friends from the \\"mean streets\\" of Greenwich. Renamed \\"Pete Gas\\", Gasparino (along with Rodney and two other childhood friends of Shane, \\"Billy P\\" and \\"Willie Greene\\") made his live debut in the WWF on the March 22, 1999 episode of Raw, interfering in a street fight between McMahon and X-Pac. Dubbed \\"The Mean Street Posse\\", Gas and the others went on to appear in McMahon's corner at WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999, helping him defeat X-Pac. After Gas and Rodney had made several appearances with the WWF, they were offered one-year contracts. Gas left his job, becoming a full-time performer with the WWF. He was trained as a wrestler by Tom Prichard. Playing on their \\"preppy\\" image, the Posse members wrestled in argyle sweater vests and khakis. Inspired by the Socs, a gang of wealthy teenagers from the 1983 film The Outsiders, the Mean Street Posse were comedic villains: \\"the rich kids that everyone hated\\". Following WrestleMania XV, The Mean Street Posse were drawn into the feud between Shane McMahon and his father Vince, resulting in them facing Vince McMahon's \\"stooges\\", Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson in a series of matches. On the April 29, 1999 episode of Smackdown, The Mean Street Posse became members of The Corporate Ministry. On the May 10, 1999 episode of Raw, Gas and Rodney lost to Brisco and Patterson in a loser leaves town match. The television ratings for the segment the match appeared in were at that time the highest ever recorded for a WWF television program. They returned on the June 7, 1999 episode of Raw. On June 21, 1999, Gas and Rodney were joined by Joey Abs, turning The Mean Street Posse from a tag team into a stable. Unlike Gas and Rodney, Abs was not a childhood friend of Shane McMahon; instead, he was an experienced wrestler added to the group as a ringer. In July 1999, Shane McMahon and The Mean Street Posse began feuding with Test after he began dating McMahon's sister Stephanie. This culminated in a \\"love her or leave her\\" match between McMahon and Test at SummerSlam on August 22, 1999, with Test to end his relationship with Stephanie if he lost and McMahon to drop his opposition to the relationship if he lost. Test defeated McMahon despite the efforts of the Posse, who were seated at ringside. McMahon reconciled with Test on the September 9 episode of Smackdown, but the Posse refused to do likewise, resulting in them ending their alliance with McMahon after he rescued Test from an attack at their hands on the September 13, 1999 episode of Raw. After parting ways with McMahon, the Posse were briefly managed by Terri Runnels before allying with The British Bulldog. On November 14, 1999 at Survivor Series, The British Bulldog and The Mean Street Posse lost to Gangrel, Mark Henry, Steve Blackman, and Val Venis in the titular match. On December 12, 1999 at Armageddon, The Mean Street Posse took part in a tag team battle royal to become number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship. They gained an advantage by switching places with the third wrestler behind the referees' backs, thus enabling them to outnumber the other teams three to two, but nonetheless failed to win. In early 2000, the Posse repeatedly tried to defeat Crash Holly for the Hardcore Championship, attacking the champion in unlikely venues such as an airport, a circus, and his hotel room. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, the trio took part in a hardcore battle royal for the title. During the match, each member would briefly hold the title, although Hardcore Holly ultimately won the match and left as the official champion. On an episode of Sunday Night Heat later that year, Edge and Christian briefly became the managers of the Mean Street Posse. They accompanied them to ringside for the duration of their WWF World Tag Team Championship title match with the Hardy Boyz, assisting the Posse with the proviso that they would receive a title shot if the Posse was to win. The Hardy Boyz thwarted the interference of Edge and Christian, however, and retained their titles. = Developmental territories (2000‚Äì2001) = In mid-2000, Gas and the other Posse members were sent to Memphis Championship Wrestling, the WWF's developmental territory in Memphis, Tennessee, for seasoning. The trio trained in Memphis from Wednesday to Sunday then joined the rest of the roster for Raw and SmackDown tapings on Monday and Tuesday. Gas and Rodney won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship in May 2000, defeating Bull Pain and Todd Morton. They lost the championship to The Kingpins in July 2000, but regained them the following month. Their second reign ended in October 2000 when they lost to The Dupps. During his time in Memphis, Gas also wrestled for Power Pro Wrestling, another Memphis-based independent promotion affiliated with the WWF. In March 2001, he won the PPP Heavyweight Championship. The championship was abandoned later the same month when Power Pro Wrestling closed. After several months in Memphis, Gas was sent to Puerto Rico. He and the other Posse members were released by the WWF in 2001. Gas went on to briefly wrestle on the independent circuit before retiring later that year.  Retirement  After retiring from professional wrestling, Gasparino worked as a bond broker. He currently works for office supply company W.B. Mason as a sales representative and has since 2003. In his book he mentions that it is a very long commute. Gasparino broke his retirement for a single night in 2003, facing Prince Nana in a bout for the East Coast Wrestling Association in Wilmington, Delaware. In 2007, he appeared on the 15th anniversary episode of Raw, competing in a Battle Royal, where he was eliminated by Bart Gunn. In 2016, Gasparino made several appearances on The Edge and Christian Show, a sketch comedy show on the WWE Network hosted by retired wrestlers Christian and Edge. In 2017, he published his autobiography: Looking at the Lights: My Path from Fan to a Wrestling Heel.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. crime drama film set in a juvenile detention center, starring Sean Penn, Esai Morales, and Clancy Brown, Alan Ruck and Ally Sheedy in their film debuts. The film is directed by Rick Rosenthal. The original music score was composed by Bill Conti. Plot Mick O'Brien is a 16-year-old Irish-American hoodlum from Chicago. While most of Mick's crimes involve snatching purses, vandalism, and getting into brawls, he aspires to bigger and meaner things, which leads him to attempt ripping off a Puerto Rican rival, Paco Moreno. Everything goes wrong: Mick's partner and best friend Carl is killed, and Mick, while trying to escape the police, accidentally runs over and kills an eight-year-old boy who happens to be Paco's brother. Mick is sent to the Rainford Juvenile Correctional Facility rather than a state prison for adults. Most of the wardens and counselors seem to have lowered themselves to the role of zookeepers. One exception is Ramon Herrera, a former gang member who talks tough to the inmates, but holds out hope for some of them, especially Mick. Mick's cellmate is Barry Horowitz, a small, wiry, brainy Jewish kid who firebombed a bowling alley after some boys there severely beat him for flirting with their girlfriends. Their cell block is dominated by a pair of brawny sadists named \\"Viking\\" Lofgren and Warren \\"Tweety\\" Jerome, who take an immediate dislike to Mick. Mick puts up with them at first, but after he witnesses Tweety killing a small boy by throwing him off the catwalk (the small boy tried to stab Tweety in retaliation for raping him), he refuses to be intimidated by them. When Tweety and Viking go into Mick's cell to attack him, Mick beats them bloody with a pillowcase full of soda cans. His victory over Viking and Tweety earns him the respect of the block and recognition as the new \\"barn boss\\". Meanwhile, to avenge his brother's death, Paco rapes Mick's girlfriend J. C. After hearing of the rape, Mick is desperate to see her, so he and Horowitz escape the double perimeter fences during football practice through the use of a corrosive paste placed on the fences, making the fences weak enough to kick open. Mick escapes, but Horowitz falls on barbed wire and is then caught where a counselor beats him up for calling him names and escaping. Ramon believes that Mick had gone to J. C.'s house, and soon picks him up. He then takes him on a trip to a maximum- security prison to show what's in store for him, should he continue down the path of crime. After Paco's arrest upon the police finding out about the rape on J. C., he is sentenced to the same dormitory at Rainford that Mick is in. The staff are fully aware of this potential danger, but no other reform school has a vacancy. Paco attempts to provoke Mick into a fight, but Mick avoids the confrontation as he has a chance of early release if he stays out of trouble, especially after hearing about the death of recently paroled Tweety in a store stick-up. However, he also loses the respect of many of the inmates, who now want to see Paco put Mick away. Meanwhile, in an attempt to retaliate on behalf of Mick, Horowitz plants fertilizer into a radio that he has placed in Paco and Viking's cell, to create a bomb. When the charge explodes prematurely and only injures Viking, Horowitz is condemned to solitary confinement, a fate he fears more than any other. Paco's transfer is arranged, so he plans his showdown with Mick for the night before. While Herrera was on night patrol, Paco fakes a ruptured appendix so Herrera comes to his aid. Herrera is assaulted, then caged in the office. The door into the cells is then barricaded, and the entire dormitory is aroused by the brawl. Eventually, Mick comes out on top, and the film ends with him very nearly killing Paco while being encouraged by the others to do it. However, resisting at the last second, he does not do it. He then drags a beaten Paco in front of the caged Ramon and other detention officers and heads back to his cell, crying in remorse.

He gave the approval to do a screenplay. Di Lello spent about a year writing the screenplay which he says later mostly came from his imagination, with minimal research; he later did research and found it corresponded with what he had written. \\"My imagination turned out to be far more accurate than I ever anticipated,\\" he said. Solo hired Rick Rosenthal to direct. Rosenthal later said when he first read the script, \\"I got to page 90, when there'd been a little kid killed, and I said to myself, 'This is reality, but I can't do this, there's just no redeeming value in the whole thing.'... I got to the end. I accepted. Some script changes were made - I think the script was humanized.

History The company was founded in 1960 by Ing. Heinz R√∂ssler and started with a plastic Minitanks series of military vehicles. After export to the USA became successful, the model line was expanded with model trains in HO scale and the smaller N scale. TT scale was also subsequently added to the product line. The model rail product line covers many European countries including Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Spain, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands, and also the USA. In the mid 1970s, Lionel HO trains were produced by Roco and Athearn before moving production to the Far East by 1978. On July 15, 2005 Roco Modellspielwaren GmbH was declared bankrupt and taken over by the creditor Raiffeisenbank. After restructuring, a new company Modelleisenbahn GmbH was formed to consolidate the model railroad market. The Roco brand and associated logo continued to be used. To sharpen the focus on model railways, on October 1, 2007, the 'Minitank' product series was divested to the German model car manufacturer Herpa. In February 2008 Modelleisenbahn acquired Fleischmann from the owner family.mremag.com News Service Moving some production to lower cost factories like Slovakia and later Vietnam, the companies saw profitability again.

Increase in reverse bias does not allow the majority charge carriers to diffuse across the junction. However, this potential helps some minority charge carriers in crossing the junction. Since the minority charge carriers in the n-region and p-region are produced by thermally generated electron-hole pairs, these minority charge carriers are extremely temperature dependent and independent of the applied bias voltage. The applied bias voltage acts as a forward bias voltage for these minority charge carriers and a current of small magnitude flows in the external circuit in the direction opposite to that of the conventional current due to the moment of majority charge carriers. Note that the saturation current is not a constant for a given device; it varies with temperature; this variance is the dominant term in the temperature coefficient for a diode. A common rule of thumb is that it doubles for every 10¬∞C rise in temperature. (Bogart 1986, 40) References * Steadman, J. W. (1993). \\"Electronics\\" in R. C.

Bodelschwinghsche Anstalten Bethel) is a diaconal (i.e. Protestant charitable) psychiatric hospital in Bethel, formerly a town, today a neighbourhood of Bielefeld, Germany. Logo of the foundation 300x300px The healthcare foundation was established in 1867 as Evangelische Heil- und Pflegeanstalt f√ºr Epileptische (Protestant institute of healing and care for epileptics) in Gadderbaum, today a locality of Bielefeld. In 1872 Pastor Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Senior, a proponent of the inner mission within the then Evangelical State Church in Prussia became its director. He massively strengthened and extended the institution, with more premises also for the poor and at other locations, and renamed it after Bethel in 1874. The name Bethel was also started being used for the neighbourhood, which developed outside the hospital. Later Bodelschwingh's name was compounded to the institution's name. In 1910 Bodelschwingh, Senior, died and the leadership passed on to his son Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Junior, who led the institution until his death in 1946. The institution is notable for its resistance against the Nazi Germany era. In August 1933, some six months after Hitler had become Reich Chancellor, Pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, met with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and a few others to draft a new confession of faith, clarifying the grounds for resisting the Nazification of Germany.Enno Obendiek, ‚ÄûDie Theologische Erkl√§rung von Barmen 1934: Hinf√ºhrung‚Äú, in: ‚Äû‚Ä¶ den gro√üen Zwecken des Christenthums gem√§√ü‚Äú: Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992; Eine Handreichung f√ºr die Gemeinden, Wilhelm H√ºffmeier (compilator) for the Kirchenkanzlei der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp. 52‚Äì58, here p. 57\\\\. The resulting document, called the Bethel Declaration (Betheler Bekenntnis), was an early form of resistance to Hitler, a rejection of Christian anti-Judaism and racist anti-Semitism, though in practical terms it did nothing to impede the Nazis.Eberhard Bethge, Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography, Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2000, pp. 296‚Äì303. During the course of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, which ran in 1940 and 1941 and was aimed at exterminating physically and mentally disabled people, the staff at the institution were mainly in opposition to that crime of the National Socialist party. In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the gassing of all mental patients. The director of the hospital, pastor Bodelschwingh, Junior, resisted. : \\"You can put me into a concentration camp if you want, that is your affair. But as long as I am free, you do not touch one of my patients. I cannot change to fit the times or the wishes of the F√ºhrer.

In 1946 Bodelschwingh, Junior, died and Friedrich von Bodelschwingh (1902‚Äì1977), nephew of Bodelschwingh, Junior, and grandson of the Senior, started managing the part of the Bethel Institution located at Gadderbaum, serving as the general director of all the Bethel Institutions between 1959 and 1969.

A key example of this phenomenon is the spin‚Äìorbit interaction leading to shifts in an electron's atomic energy levels, due to electromagnetic interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole, its orbital motion, and the electrostatic field of the positively charged nucleus. This phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of spectral lines, which can be thought of as a Zeeman effect product of two relativistic effects: the apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic moment of the electron associated with its intrinsic spin. A similar effect, due to the relationship between angular momentum and the strong nuclear force, occurs for protons and neutrons moving inside the nucleus, leading to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus shell model. In the field of spintronics, spin‚Äìorbit effects for electrons in semiconductors and other materials are explored for technological applications. The spin‚Äìorbit interaction is one cause of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin Hall effect. For atoms, energy level split produced by the spin-orbit interaction is usually of the same order in size to the relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy and the zitterbewegung effect. The addition of these three corrections is known as the fine structure. The interaction between the magnetic field created by the electron and the magnetic moment of the nucleus is a slighter correction to the energy levels known as the hyperfine structure. In atomic energy levels Fine and hyperfine structure in hydrogen (not to scale). This section presents a relatively simple and quantitative description of the spin‚Äìorbit interaction for an electron bound to a hydrogen-like atom, up to first order in perturbation theory, using some semiclassical electrodynamics and non- relativistic quantum mechanics. This gives results that agree reasonably well with observations. A rigorous calculation of the same result would use relativistic quantum mechanics, using Dirac equation, and would include many- body interactions. Achieving an even more precise result would involve calculating small corrections from quantum electrodynamics. Energy of a magnetic moment The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by :\\\\Delta H = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B}, where Œº is the magnetic moment of the particle, and B is the magnetic field it experiences. Magnetic field We shall deal with the magnetic field first. Although in the rest frame of the nucleus, there is no magnetic field acting on the electron, there is one in the rest frame of the electron (see classical electromagnetism and special relativity). Ignoring for now that this frame is not inertial, in SI units we end up with the equation :\\\\mathbf{B} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E}}{c^2}, where v is the velocity of the electron, and E is the electric field it travels through. Here, in the non- relativistic limit, we assume that the Lorentz factor \\\\gamma \\\\backsimeq 1. Now we know that E is radial, so we can rewrite \\\\mathbf{E} =  E / r  \\\\mathbf{r} . Also we know that the momentum of the electron \\\\mathbf{p} = m_\\\\text{e} \\\\mathbf{v} . Substituting this in and changing the order of the cross product gives :\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{p}}{m_\\\\text{e} c^2} \\\\left \\\\frac{E}{r} \\\\right. Next, we express the electric field as the gradient of the electric potential \\\\mathbf{E} = - abla V. Here we make the central field approximation, that is, that the electrostatic potential is spherically symmetric, so is only a function of radius. This approximation is exact for hydrogen and hydrogen-like systems. Now we can say that :E = \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right = \\\\frac{1}{e} \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(r)}{\\\\partial r}, where U = eV is the potential energy of the electron in the central field, and e is the elementary charge. Now we remember from classical mechanics that the angular momentum of a particle \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{p}. Putting it all together, we get :\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\frac{1}{m_\\\\text{e} ec^2} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(r)}{\\\\partial r} \\\\mathbf{L}. It is important to note at this point that B is a positive number multiplied by L, meaning that the magnetic field is parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the particle, which is itself perpendicular to the particle's velocity. Spin magnetic moment of the electron The spin magnetic moment of the electron is : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_S = -g_\\\\text{s} \\\\mu_\\\\text{B} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{S}}{\\\\hbar}, where \\\\mathbf{S} is the spin angular- momentum vector, \\\\mu_\\\\text{B} is the Bohr magneton, and g_\\\\text{s} \\\\approx 2 is the electron-spin g-factor. Here \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} is a negative constant multiplied by the spin, so the spin magnetic moment is antiparallel to the spin angular momentum. The spin‚Äìorbit potential consists of two parts. The Larmor part is connected to the interaction of the spin magnetic moment of the electron with the magnetic field of the nucleus in the co-moving frame of the electron. The second contribution is related to Thomas precession. Larmor interaction energy The Larmor interaction energy is :\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{L} = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B}. Substituting in this equation expressions for the spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field, one gets :\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{L} = \\\\frac{2\\\\mu_\\\\text{B}}{\\\\hbar m_\\\\text{e} e c^2} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(r)}{\\\\partial r} \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S}. Now we have to take into account Thomas precession correction for the electron's curved trajectory. Thomas interaction energy In 1926 Llewellyn Thomas relativistically recomputed the doublet separation in the fine structure of the atom. Thomas precession rate \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}_\\\\text{T} is related to the angular frequency of the orbital motion \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} of a spinning particle as follows:L. F√∂ppl and P. J. Daniell, Zur Kinematik des Born'schen starren K√∂rpers, Nachrichten von der K√∂niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G√∂ttingen, 519 (1913).C. M√∏ller, The Theory of Relativity, (Oxford at the Claredon Press, London, 1952). : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}_\\\\text{T} = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} (\\\\gamma - 1), where \\\\gamma is the Lorentz factor of the moving particle. The Hamiltonian producing the spin precession \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}_\\\\text{T} is given by : \\\\Delta H_\\\\text{T} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Omega}_\\\\text{T} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S}. To the first order in (v/c)^2, we obtain :\\\\Delta H_\\\\text{T} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\text{B}}{\\\\hbar m_\\\\text{e} e c^2} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(r)}{\\\\partial r} \\\\mathbf{L}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S}. Total interaction energy The total spin‚Äìorbit potential in an external electrostatic potential takes the form :\\\\Delta H \\\\equiv \\\\Delta H_\\\\text{L} + \\\\Delta H_\\\\text{T} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_\\\\text{B}}{\\\\hbar m_\\\\text{e} e c^2} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(r)}{\\\\partial r} \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S}. The net effect of Thomas precession is the reduction of the Larmor interaction energy by factor 1/2, which came to be known as the Thomas half. Evaluating the energy shift Thanks to all the above approximations, we can now evaluate the detailed energy shift in this model. Note that Lz and Sz are no longer conserved quantities. In particular, we wish to find a new basis that diagonalizes both H0 (the non-perturbed Hamiltonian) and ŒîH. To find out what basis this is, we first define the total angular momentum operator :\\\\mathbf{J} = \\\\mathbf{L} + \\\\mathbf{S}. Taking the dot product of this with itself, we get :\\\\mathbf{J}^2 = \\\\mathbf{L}^2 + \\\\mathbf{S}^2 + 2\\\\, \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S} (since L and S commute), and therefore : \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{J}^2 - \\\\mathbf{L}^2 - \\\\mathbf{S}^2) It can be shown that the five operators H0, J2, L2, S2, and Jz all commute with each other and with ŒîH. Therefore, the basis we were looking for is the simultaneous eigenbasis of these five operators (i.e., the basis where all five are diagonal). Elements of this basis have the five quantum numbers: n (the \\"principal quantum number\\"), j (the \\"total angular momentum quantum number\\"), \\\\ell (the \\"orbital angular momentum quantum number\\"), s (the \\"spin quantum number\\"), and j_z (the \\"z component of total angular momentum\\"). To evaluate the energies, we note that :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{1}{r^3} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{2}{a^3 n^3\\\\; \\\\ell (\\\\ell + 1) (2\\\\ell + 1)} for hydrogenic wavefunctions (here a = \\\\hbar / (Z \\\\alpha m_\\\\text{e} c) is the Bohr radius divided by the nuclear charge Z); and :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\big(\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{J}^2 \\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{L}^2 \\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{S}^2 \\\\rangle\\\\big) = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2} \\\\big(j (j + 1) - \\\\ell (\\\\ell + 1) - s (s + 1)\\\\big). Final energy shift We can now say that :\\\\Delta E = \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} \\\\big(j(j+1) - \\\\ell(\\\\ell+1) - s(s+1)\\\\big), where :\\\\beta = \\\\beta(n,l) = Z^4 \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{4\\\\pi} g_\\\\text{s} \\\\mu_\\\\text{B}^2 \\\\frac{1}{n^3 a_0^3\\\\;\\\\ell(\\\\ell+1/2)(\\\\ell+1)}. For the exact relativistic result, see the solutions to the Dirac equation for a hydrogen-like atom. In solids A crystalline solid (semiconductor, metal etc.) is characterized by its band structure. While on the overall scale (including the core levels) the spin‚Äìorbit interaction is still a small perturbation, it may play a relatively more important role if we zoom in to bands close to the Fermi level (E_\\\\text{F}). The atomic \\\\mathbf{L} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{S} (spin‚Äìorbit) interaction, for example, splits bands that would be otherwise degenerate, and the particular form of this spin‚Äìorbit splitting (typically of the order of few to few hundred millielectronvolts) depends on the particular system. The bands of interest can be then described by various effective models, usually based on some perturbative approach. An example of how the atomic spin‚Äìorbit interaction influences the band structure of a crystal is explained in the article about Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions. In crystalline solid contained paramagnetic ions, e.g. ions with unclosed d or f atomic subshell, localized electronic states exist. In this case, atomic-like electronic levels structure is shaped by intrinsic magnetic spin‚Äìorbit interactions and interactions with crystalline electric fields. Such structure is named the fine electronic structure. For rare-earth ions the spin‚Äìorbit interactions are much stronger than the crystal electric field (CEF) interactions. The strong spin‚Äìorbit coupling makes J a relatively good quantum number, because the first excited multiplet is at least ~130 meV (1500 K) above the primary multiplet. The result is that filling it at room temperature (300 K) is negligibly small. In this case, a (2J + 1)-fold degenerated primary multiplet split by an external CEF can be treated as the basic contribution to the analysis of such systems' properties. In the case of approximate calculations for basis J,J_z\\\\rangle, to determine which is the primary multiplet, the Hund principles, known from atomic physics, are applied: * The ground state of the terms' structure has the maximal value S allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle. * The ground state has a maximal allowed L value, with maximal S. * The primary multiplet has a corresponding J = L ‚àí S when the shell is less than half full, and J = L + S, where the fill is greater. The S, L and J of the ground multiplet are determined by Hund's rules. The ground multiplet is 2J + 1 degenerated ‚Äì its degeneracy is removed by CEF interactions and magnetic interactions. CEF interactions and magnetic interactions resemble, somehow, Stark and Zeeman effect known from atomic physics. The energies and eigenfunctions of the discrete fine electronic structure are obtained by diagonalization of the (2J + 1)-dimensional matrix. The fine electronic structure can be directly detected by many different spectroscopic methods, including the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments. The case of strong cubic CEF (for 3d transition-metal ions) interactions form group of levels (e.g. T2g, A2g), which are partially split by spin‚Äìorbit interactions and (if occur) lower-symmetry CEF interactions. The energies and eigenfunctions of the discrete fine electronic structure (for the lowest term) are obtained by diagonalization of the (2L + 1)(2S + 1)-dimensional matrix. At zero temperature (T = 0 K) only the lowest state is occupied. The magnetic moment at T = 0 K is equal to the moment of the ground state. It allows the evaluation of the total, spin and orbital moments. The eigenstates and corresponding eigenfunctions \\\\Gamma_n\\\\rangle can be found from direct diagonalization of Hamiltonian matrix containing crystal field and spin‚Äìorbit interactions. Taking into consideration the thermal population of states, the thermal evolution of the single-ion properties of the compound is established. This technique is based on the equivalent operator theory defined as the CEF widened by thermodynamic and analytical calculations defined as the supplement of the CEF theory by including thermodynamic and analytical calculations. Examples of effective Hamiltonians Hole bands of a bulk (3D) zinc-blende semiconductor will be split by \\\\Delta_0 into heavy and light holes (which form a \\\\Gamma_8 quadruplet in the \\\\Gamma-point of the Brillouin zone) and a split- off band (\\\\Gamma_7 doublet). Including two conduction bands (\\\\Gamma_6 doublet in the \\\\Gamma-point), the system is described by the effective eight-band model of Kohn and Luttinger. If only top of the valence band is of interest (for example when E_\\\\text{F}\\\\ll \\\\Delta_0, Fermi level measured from the top of the valence band), the proper four-band effective model is :H_\\\\text{KL}(k_\\\\text{x},k_\\\\text{y},k_\\\\text{z})=-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left[(\\\\gamma_1+{\\\\textstyle\\\\frac52 \\\\gamma_2}) k^2 - 2\\\\gamma_2(J_\\\\text{x}^2k_\\\\text{x}^2+J_\\\\text{y}^2k_\\\\text{y}^2 +J_\\\\text{z}^2k_\\\\text{z}^2) -2\\\\gamma_3 \\\\sum_{m e n}J_mJ_nk_mk_n\\\\right] where \\\\gamma_{1,2,3} are the Luttinger parameters (analogous to the single effective mass of a one-band model of electrons) and J_{\\\\text{x},\\\\text{y},\\\\text{z}} are angular momentum 3/2 matrices (m is the free electron mass). In combination with magnetization, this type of spin‚Äìorbit interaction will distort the electronic bands depending on the magnetization direction, thereby causing magnetocrystalline anisotropy (a special type of magnetic anisotropy). If the semiconductor moreover lacks the inversion symmetry, the hole bands will exhibit cubic Dresselhaus splitting. Within the four bands (light and heavy holes), the dominant term is :H_{\\\\text{D}3}=b_{41}^{8\\\\text{v}8\\\\text{v}}[(k_\\\\text{x}k_\\\\text{y}^2-k_\\\\text{x}k_\\\\text{z}^2)J_\\\\text{x}+(k_\\\\text{y}k_\\\\text{z}^2-k_\\\\text{y}k_\\\\text{x}^2)J_\\\\text{y}+(k_\\\\text{z}k_\\\\text{x}^2-k_\\\\text{z}k_\\\\text{y}^2)J_\\\\text{z}] where the material parameter b_{41}^{8\\\\text{v}8\\\\text{v}} = -81.93 \\\\,\\\\text{meV} \\\\cdot \\\\text{nm}^3 for GaAs (see pp. 72 in Winkler's book, according to more recent data the Dresselhaus constant in GaAs is 9 eV√Ö3; the total Hamiltonian will be H_\\\\text{KL}+H_{\\\\text{D}3}). Two-dimensional electron gas in an asymmetric quantum well (or heterostructure) will feel the Rashba interaction. The appropriate two-band effective Hamiltonian is : H_0+H_\\\\text{R} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*} \\\\sigma_0 + \\\\alpha (k_\\\\text{y} \\\\sigma_\\\\text{x} - k_\\\\text{x}\\\\sigma_\\\\text{y}) where \\\\sigma_0 is the 2 √ó 2 identity matrix, \\\\sigma_{\\\\text{x},\\\\text{y}} the Pauli matrices and m^* the electron effective mass. The spin‚Äìorbit part of the Hamiltonian, H_\\\\text{R} is parametrized by \\\\alpha, sometimes called the Rashba parameter (its definition somewhat varies), which is related to the structure asymmetry. Above expressions for spin‚Äìorbit interaction couple spin matrices \\\\mathbf{J} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} to the quasi-momentum \\\\mathbf{k}, and to the vector potential \\\\mathbf{A} of an AC electric field through the Peierls substitution {\\\\mathbf{k}}=-i abla-(\\\\frac{e}{\\\\hbar c}){\\\\mathbf{A}}. They are lower order terms of the Luttinger‚ÄìKohn k¬∑p perturbation theory in powers of k. Next terms of this expansion also produce terms that couple spin operators of the electron coordinate \\\\mathbf{r}. Indeed, a cross product (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\times{\\\\mathbf{k}}) is invariant with respect to time inversion. In cubic crystals, it has a symmetry of a vector and acquires a meaning of a spin‚Äìorbit contribution {\\\\boldsymbol{r}}_{\\\\text{SO}} to the operator of coordinate. For electrons in semiconductors with a narrow gap E_{\\\\rm G} between the conduction and heavy hole bands, Yafet derived the equationE. I. Rashba and V. I.

This operator couples electron spin {\\\\mathbf{S}}=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} directly to the electric field \\\\mathbf{E} through the interaction energy -e({\\\\mathbf{r}}_{\\\\text{SO}}\\\\cdot{\\\\mathbf{E}}).  Oscillating electromagnetic field  Electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) is the coupling of the electron spin with an oscillating electric field. Similar to the electron spin resonance (ESR) in which electrons can be excited with an electromagnetic wave with the energy given by the Zeeman effect, in EDSR the resonance can be achieved if the frequency is related to the energy band split given by the spin-orbit coupling in solids. While in ESR the coupling is obtained via the magnetic part of the EM wave with the electron magnetic moment, the ESDR is the coupling of the electric part with the spin and motion of the electrons. This mechanism has been proposed for controlling the spin of electrons in quantum dots and other mesoscopic systems.

History Like the cosmetically similar Rainbow 100 and DECmate II (also introduced at that time), the PRO series used the LK201 keyboard and 400kB single-sided quad-density floppy disk drives (known as RX50The RX50 FAQ), and offered a choice of color or monochrome monitors. For DEC, none of the three would be favorably received, and the industry instead standardized on Intel 8088-based IBM PC compatibles which were all binary program compatible with each other. In some ways, the PDP-11 microprocessors were technically superior to the Intel-based chips. While the 8088 was restricted to 1MB of memory because of its 20-bit address bus, DEC microprocessors were capable of accessing 4MB with their 22-bit addressing (although direct addressing of memory was limited in both approaches to 64KB segments, limiting the size of individual code and data objects). But other factors would weigh more heavily in the competition, including DEC's corporate culture and business model, which were ill-suited to the rapidly developing consumer market for computers. BYTE in 1984 reported that Venix on the PC outperformed the same operating system on the DEC Professional and PDP-11/23. Further, although the PDP-11 was a very successful minicomputer, it lacked a wide base of affordable small business software. By comparison, many existing CP/M applications (see the Rainbow 100) were easily ported to the similar 8086/8088 chips and MS-DOS operating system. Porting existing PDP-11 software to the PRO was complicated by design decisions that rendered it partially incompatible with its parent product line. Industry critics observed that this incompatibility appeared at least in part deliberate, as DEC belatedly sought to \\"protect\\" its more- profitable mainstream PDP-11s from price competition with lower-priced PCs. The PRO was never widely accepted as an office personal computer, nor as a scientific workstation, where the market was also headed to Intel 8086, or alternately to Motorola 68000-based computers. The failure of DEC to gain a significant foothold in the high-volume PC market would be the beginning of the end of the computer hardware industry in New England, as nearly all computer companies located there were focused on minicomputers, from DEC to Data General, Wang, Prime, Computervision, and Honeywell. Technical specifications DEC \\"Fonz-11\\" (F11) Chipset The PRO-325 and -350 used the F-11 chipset (as used in LSI-11/23 systems) to create a single-board PDP-11 with up to six expansion slots of a proprietary CTI (Computing Terminal Interconnect) bus using 90-pin ZIF connectors. The PRO family used dual RX50 floppy drives for storage; the PRO-325 had only floppies, and the 350 and 380 also included an internal hard drive. Mainline PDP-11s generally used separate serial terminals as console and display devices; the PRO family used in-built bit-mapped graphics to drive a combined console and display. All other I/O devices in the PRO family were also different (in most cases, radically different) from their counterparts on other PDP-11 models. For example, while the internal bus supported direct memory access (DMA), none of the available I/O devices actually used this feature. The interrupt system was implemented using Intel PC chips of the time, which again made it very different from the PDP-11 standard interrupt architecture. For all these reasons, support of the PRO family required extensive modifications to the previously-existing operating system software, and the PRO could not run standard PDP-11 software without modification. The default PRO-3xx operating system was DEC's Professional Operating System (P/OS), a modified version of RSX-11M with a menu-driven core user interface. Industry critics complained that this user interface was awkward, slow, and inflexible, offering few advantages over the command-line based MS-DOS user interface that was coming into widespread use. Other available operating systems included DEC RT-11, VenturCom Venix, and 2.9BSD Unix. DEC \\"Jaws-11\\" (J11) Chipset Later, the Professional 380 (PRO-380) was introduced using the much faster J-11 chip set (as used in 11/73 systems). However, due to clocking issues on the motherboard, the J-11 chip ran at 10 MHz instead of 16-18 MHz, thus making the PRO-380 slower than a stock 11/73 system. The DEC Professional Series PC-38N was a PRO-380 with a real-time interface (RTI) that was used as the console for the VAX 8500 and 8550. The RTI has two serial line units: one connects to the VAX environmental monitoring module (EMM) and the other is a spare that could be used for data transfer. The RTI also has a programmable peripheral interface (PPI) consisting of three 8-bit ports for transferring data, address, and control signals between the console and the VAX console interface. Clones Like the PDP-8 and PDP-11 before it, the Professional 350 was cloned in the Soviet Union (in this case, as the Elektronika MS-0585).

It is a publicly traded company that was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange () in December 1999. It provides internet domain registration, email and office applications, cloud hosting, security and risk, and digital marketing. Founded in 1996, it was the first Australian domain name registrar. History=Beginnings Webcentral Group's history dates back to April 1996 when Eugene Falk AM OBE and Professor Peter Gerrand were appointed as Chairman and CEO, respectively, for the University of Melbourne‚Äôs new commercial subsidiary Melbourne Information Technology International Pty Ltd, which commenced operations from 1 May 1996. Professor Iain Morrison was appointed the third foundation director of the company. The company chose to trade under the business name of Melbourne IT from its earliest days. Contrary to popular mythology, the company was not set up to trade in domain names. The company's charter was to demonstrate the University's strategic leadership in working with industry and government in selected areas of IT. Its first and continuingly profitable business, up until its float on the ASX in December 1999, was its joint venture ASAC (Advanced Services Applications Centre) with Ericsson Australia. ASAC was set up to develop applications with synergies between the Internet and advanced telecommunications, particularly mobile products. ASAC was recognized by Ericsson as one of its Global Design Centres in 1997, and contributed $0.5 million in profit to Melbourne IT in the year before its float. ASAC was incorporated as an independent joint venture in December 2000, but became a casualty of Ericsson's downsizing of its global R&D; following the bursting of the Dot-com bubble in July 2000. On 21 June 1996 a front-page article in The Australian Financial Review by Charles Wright drew attention to the parlous state of commercial domain name registration in Australia, where a large backlog of Australian businesses were waiting for processing of their applications for com.au domain names by the part-time domain name administrator, Robert Elz, senior system administrator in the University of Melbourne's Computer Science Department, who declined to communicate with the media. Robert Elz had been assigned the role of administrator of the .au top- level domain by Jon Postel since 1989, an arrangement that worked quite satisfactorily through the early 1990s when the Internet was largely of interest only to tertiary educational and research institutions. The AFR article caused Melbourne University to be aware of the possible commercial value of the rights to assign domain names, but also of the damage to the University's reputation if the registration of com.au domain names was not transferred to a competent commercial organization. The Head of the Computer Science Department persuaded Mr Elz to transfer the administration of com.au names to the University's subsidiary Melbourne IT, which he did by way of a non-exclusive licence, to be reviewed after five years. Melbourne IT was awarded a grant of $100,000 by the Government of Victoria in 1996 in return for registering the backlog of over 2,000 com.au applications free to the applicants, and used this money to build its first domain name registration software platform. From October 1996 Melbourne IT began pricing its services by charging for new and renewed com.au names at 10% below the market rate set by Network Solutions for the popular .com names, and was the first domain name registrar worldwide to introduce trademark checking and money-back service assurance guarantees. It also introduced three-tiered pricing for different levels of turnaround time, during the first two years 1997-98 before eligibility decisions were sped up by online access to the Australian trademarks database and to registries of Australian business names and gazetted geographical names. Melbourne IT also moved to align to Robert Elz's rather idiosyncratic eligibility criteria (e.g., ‚Äòno name should in principle be registered if found in an English dictionary‚Äô; but exceptions had been made to this before 1996 such as news.com.au and travel.com.au, which annoyed other applicants to the rules for registering business names in Australia). In April 1999 Melbourne IT was selected by ICANN to be one of the first five registrars to register .com, .net and .org names in competition with the incumbent Network Solutions. Entry into the international domain name market from July 1999 greatly increased the company's revenues and market value, and caused the University to prepare the company for an initial public offering. On 14 December 1999 Melbourne IT was floated on the ASX, near the height of the dot- com bubble. It benefited from a cover story by finance journalist Ivor Rees in a weekend edition of the Australian Financial Review in November 1999, describing it presciently as the ‚ÄòHottest Float of the Year‚Äô. Interest in the shares was particularly strong because it was the only Australian tech stock floating that year with a track record of actual profitability. Demands for a prospectus were so high that complaints were aired in the media by members of the public unable to obtain one. The chief beneficiaries of the float were the clients of the underwriters, JB Were and CommSec, some of whom made massive stag profits when the stock peaked at $8.20 on the day of its float, compared with the IPO price of $2.20. In 2000 the Victorian Auditor-General held an investigation into whether the stock was undervalued by the underwriters when listed, but concluded that the float had been carried out properly. 2000's The University of Melbourne received a gross benefit of $93.5 million through selling 85% of its equity in the float, as well as a pre-float dividend of $1 million, but left the company with $7.5 million as working capital. The stock held up above $8 for four months following the dot-com bubble of April 2000, peaking briefly to $17 in February, but sank to $5.99 after the company released a realistic market outlook on 23 August 2000. During January to August 2000 the founding CEO Peter Gerrand founded subsidiaries in the US and Europe , and participated in the creation of auDA as the national domain name industry self-regulator. On 14 September he announced he would leave the company on 30 September for family reasons; after this announcement the stock sank by a further 10%. He was succeeded by his deputy Adrian Kloeden , and continued as a consultant to the company until after the hosting of ICANN's meeting in Melbourne in March 2001. Adrian Kloeden was succeeded as CEO by Theo Hnarakis in November 2002 . In September 2006, Melbourne IT acquired the Australian Internet hosting company, WebCentral Group (ASX:WCG) via a scheme of arrangement and delisted the WebCentral group from the ASX. Founded in 1997, WCG have 2 data centres in Brisbane, one at Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley, and another in Spring Hill at a PIPE Networks facility. Staff from Webcentral's Brisbane office also manage a large colocation area in an Equinix datacenter in Mascot, New South Wales. Dr Bruce Tonkin , who joined Melbourne IT in 1999 as Chief Technology Officer, was elected convenor of ICANN's important GNSO (Generic Names Support Organization) constituency from June 2004 to June 2007, and will serve on the ICANN Boards as the GNSO's elected representative from May 2008.

MelbourneIT also noted that many of their clients are Fortune 500 companies or associated with the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). The latter fact is particularly noteworthy given the fact that ANA had led a high-profile anti-gTLD expansion campaign following the approval of the program, and was successful in achieving multiple hearings in the U.S. congress and other anti-TLD expansion forums and press. In February, 2012, one of the first public Brand TLD ventures, StarHub, announced that it had partnered with MelbourneIT's Digital Brand Services to help apply for and manage its proposed .starhub TLD. Later that month, MelbourneIT revealed that they were currently working on 120 new gTLD applications, and that they expected to bring that number to 150 before the application window closed in just over a month. It was also announced that MelbourneIT was working as new gTLD consultants with the governments of the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales, and with ARI Registry Services, to prepare bids for .melbourne, .sydney, and .victoria.[23] The company ended up handling 148 applications, approximately a quarter of which came from Australian clients. http://icannwiki.org/MelbourneIT On 29 August 2013 Melbourne IT CEO Theo Hnarakis announced that the Syrian Electronic Army had attacked\\"Times Site Is Disrupted in Attack by Hackers\\" (Article in New York Times 27 August 2013, retrieved 2 September 2013) the New York Times Web site by tricking people managing the New York Times DNS domain as a reseller of Melbourne IT to disclose their login credentials in a targeted phishing attack.

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Life Bridgeman was the son of John Bridgeman, Bishop of Chester, and his wife Elizabeth Helyar, daughter of Reverend William Helyar. He was educated Queens' College, Cambridge and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1624. In the same year, Bridgeman became a Fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. He worked as barrister until 1632, becoming Vice-Chamberlain of Chester in 1638. In 1640, he was appointed Attorney of the Court of Wards in 1640, and Solicitor-General to Charles, the Prince of Wales. In April 1640, Bridgeman was elected Member of Parliament for Wigan in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Wigan for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He rallied to the royal cause and in 1642 assisted Lord Strange at Chester against the parliamentary forces. As a result, he was disabled from sitting in parliament on 29 August 1642.The parliamentary or constitutional history of England;: being a faithful account of all the most remarkable transactions in Parliament, from the earliest times. Collected from the journals of both Houses, the records, ..., Volume 9 He was knighted by the King in 1643. From 1644 to 1646, Bridgeman was Custos Rotulorum of Cheshire. In 1645, he was Commissioner at the Treaty of Uxbridge on behalf of the King. He compounded for his delinquency in 1646. On 30 May 1660, Bridgeman was made Serjeant-at-Law, and two days later Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The following week, on 7 June 1660, he was created a Baronet, of Great Lever, in the County of Lancaster. From 1660 to 1668, Bridgeman was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and from 1667 to 1672 Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, resigning because he refused to apply the Great Seal to the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, which he regarded as too generous to Catholics. In 1668, he was a member of the New England Company. In his final years, Bridgeman appointed metaphysical poet, theologian, and priest Thomas Traherne (c. 1637 ‚Äì 1674) as his private chaplain at Teddington and supported the publication of his writings. Bridgeman died aged 65 in Teddington, Middlesex and was buried there. Bridgeman was highly regarded in his time for his participation in the trial of the regicides of King Charles I in 1660, and for devising complex legal instruments for the conveyance of estates in land. Among Bridgeman's most enduring inventions was a device for the 22nd Earl of Arundel, which led to the creation in the Duke of Norfolk's Case, 3 Ch. Ca. 1, 22. Eng.

It was filmed in Jackson's Point, Ontario and Port Perry, Ontario. Plot Former President of the United States Monroe \\"Eagle\\" Cole retires to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, Maine, to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte. Harold \\"Handy\\" Harrison is the town's local hardware store owner and plumber. Harrison's job keeps him so busy that he has neglected his relationship with girlfriend Sally Mannis, who is on the verge of dumping him. Following the death of the town mayor, the town council decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office. Cole agrees because, if he is mayor, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his divorce settlement. As a surprise to Handy, his name has also been entered into the race. When Harrison finds out Cole is running, he decides to withdraw, until he witnesses Cole make a pass at Sally. Handy believes that, by becoming mayor, he can show Sally he is a mature decision maker and win back her heart. Tempers rise following the arrival of Cole's ex-wife and campaign spoiler Charlotte. Cole's team, led by long-time executive secretary Grace Sutherland and presidential aide Will Bullard, bring in strong support in the form of campaign strategist Bert Langdon, who is looking for excitement since Cole's retirement. As the campaigns progress, Cole and Harrison both become obsessed with winning the race at all costs, although Harrison refuses to resort to cheating. Cole realizes that in all his years of campaigning this may be his toughest as he is taking on a genuinely honest everyman. Eventually, on the night before the election, both candidates urge the voters to vote for the other candidate by saying that neither of them will vote for themselves. Harrison keeps his promise, but Cole votes for himself anyway. Upon the revelation that Cole won by one vote, his conscience gets the better of him and he concedes the match to Harrison. However, Harrison lies that he voted for himself as well, and declines office, making Cole end up as mayor. Harrison later reveals to Sally that he conceded the election because Cole needs the mayorship more than he does and that all he really wanted was to propose marriage to her, which he does. As Handy is proposing to Sally, Monroe also proposes to Grace. The film ends with Bert Langdon telling Handy that he ran an excellent campaign and offers to be his campaign manager for Governor of Maine, which Handy shows some interest in when he realizes a governor has certain authority over mayors.

Based on a $30 million budget, the film was a box office bomb. Critical response The film received generally negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 13% score, based on 144 critics, with an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's consensus states: \\"A bland comedy that squanders a talented cast.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 33 out of 100 rating, based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying that \\"Welcome to Mooseport's satirical edge is dull and pitted, the screenplay is overlong and uninteresting, the comedy is soft and shapeless, and the actors perform like they're on a sit com. There's not a whole lot to like about Welcome to Mooseport, and, considering how lively real politics can be these days, you're likely to get more entertainment from watching two hours of CSPAN.\\" William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer complimented Hackman's \\"detailed, delightful, comic performance that never quite disintegrates into caricature\\", but wrote that \\"the quality of the writing is nowhere near the standard of Hackman's performance, and the movie around him (...) too often substitutes sight gags involving geriatric nudity and fornicating canines for wit.\\" In addition, Arnold felt that Ray Romano \\"just doesn't have the stuff to bring off a role that requires a Jimmy Stewart or Tom Hanks. He's supposed to be overshadowed by his nemesis, of course, but Hackman chews him up and spits him out so effectively that the movie is glaringly lopsided.\\" However, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: \\"Whether the movie works or not depends on the charm of the actors. Hackman could charm the chrome off a trailer hitch. Romano is more of the earnest, aw- shucks, sincere, well-meaning kind of guy whose charm is inner and only peeks out occasionally. They work well together here, and Tierney does a heroic job of playing a character who doesn't know how the story will end, when everybody else, in the cast and in the audience, has an excellent idea.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * * Raymond Romano archived from the original at Moviehole.net Category:2004 films Category:American films Category:German films Category:English-language films Category:2004 romantic comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American political comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:German romantic comedy films Category:Films scored by John Debney Category:Films about elections Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States Category:Films directed by Donald Petrie Category:Films set in Maine Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Toronto ","title":"Welcome to Mooseport"},{"id":"1871172","text":"The Hereford mappa mundi The Hereford Mappa Mundi is a medieval map of the known world (), of a form deriving from the T and O pattern, dating from c. 1300. It is displayed at Hereford Cathedral in Hereford, England.Edson, Evelyn (1997) Mapping Time and Space: How Medieval Mapmakers Viewed Their World, The British Library It is the largest medieval map still known to exist. A larger mappa mundi, the Ebstorf map, was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, though photographs of it survive. The Hereford Mappa Mundi hung, with little regard, for many years on a wall of a choir aisle in the cathedral. During the troubled times of the Commonwealth the map had been laid beneath the floor of Bishop Audley's Chantry, where it remained secreted for some time. In 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the British Museum. During the Second World War, for safety reasons, the mappa mundi and other valuable manuscripts from Hereford Cathedral Library were kept elsewhere and returned to the collection in 1946. In 1988, a financial crisis in the Diocese of Hereford caused the Dean and Chapter to propose selling the mappa mundi. After much controversy, large donations from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Paul Getty and members of the public kept the map in Hereford and allowed the construction of a new library designed by Sir William Whitfield to house the map and the chained libraries of the Cathedral and of All Saints' Church. The new Library Building in the south east corner of the cathedral close opened in 1996. An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with more than 1,000 place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the Virtual Mappa project. In 1991 BR Class 31 loco No.31405 was named 'Mappa Mundi' at a ceremony at the Hereford Rail Day.  Features  Drawn on a single sheet of vellum, it measures 158 cm by 133 cm, some in diameter and is the largest medieval map known still to exist. The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the Red Sea (8) coloured red). It depicts 420 towns, 15 Biblical events, 33 animals and plants, 32 people, and five scenes from classical mythology. Jerusalem is drawn at the centre of the circle; east is on top, showing the Garden of Eden in a circle at the edge of the world (1). Great Britain is drawn at the northwestern border (bottom left, 22 & 23). Curiously, the labels for Africa and Europe are reversed, with Europe scribed in red and gold as \\"Africa\\", and vice versa. The map is based on traditional accounts and earlier maps such as the one of the Beatus of Li√©bana codex, and is very similar to the Ebstorf map, the Psalter world map, and the Sawley (erroneously for considerable time called \\"Henry of Mainz\\") map; it does not correspond to the geographical knowledge of the 14th century. Note, for example, that the Caspian Sea (5) connects to the encircling ocean (upper left). This is in spite of William of Rubruk's having reported it to be landlocked in 1255, i.e. several decades before the map's creation; see also Portolan chart. The \\"T and O\\" shape does not imply that its creators believed in a flat Earth. The spherical shape of the Earth was already known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and the idea was never entirely forgotten even in the Middle Ages, and thus the circular representation may well be considered a conventional attempt at a projection: in spite of the acceptance of a spherical Earth, only the known parts of the Northern Hemisphere were believed to be inhabitable by human beings (see antipodes), so that the circular representation remained adequate. The long river on the far right is the River Nile, too (12), and the T shape is established by the Mediterranean Sea (19-21-25) and the rivers Don (13) and Nile (16). It is the earliest known map to depict the mythical island of St Brendan's Isle, which then appeared on many other maps including Martin Behaim's Erdapfel of 1492.  Authorship  The map is signed by or attributed to one \\"Richard of Haldingham and Lafford\\", also known as Richard de Bello, \\"prebend of Lafford in Lincoln Cathedral\\". However, this attribution isn't completely agreed upon, it being suggested that the exquisite level of detail included in the map could not have been completed by one person. Some people believe that the map was originally created by Richard of Haldingham and Lafford and that at his death it passed to his younger cousin, Richard de Bello. Once it was in de Bello's possession, de Bello and his patron Richard Swindfield worked on the map. It was long believed that the mappa mundi was created, not in Hereford, but in Lincoln because the city of Lincoln was drawn in considerable detail and was represented by a cathedral (accurately) located on a hill near a river. Hereford, on the other hand, was represented only by a cathedral, a seeming afterthought drawn by a different hand when compared with other features of the map. However, recent research on the origin of the wood in the frame suggests it may in fact have been created in or around Hereford.

It was first used by Digital's VT220 ANSI/ASCII terminal and was subsequently used by the Rainbow-100, DECmate-II, and Pro-350 microcomputers and many of Digital's computer workstations such as the VAXstation and DECstation families. right The keyboard layout was new at the time, adding a set of cursor and miscellaneous keys between the main keyboard and the numeric keypad. The cursor keys were arranged in what has now become the standard \\"Inverted T\\" arrangement seen on essentially all contemporary full-sized computer keyboards. Ergonomic considerations caused the keyboard to be designed with a very low profile; it was very thin, especially when compared to the keyboard used on the VT100. The keyboard connected using a modular connector over which flowed power and asynchronous serial data. The keyboard also added a Compose key. This allowed the typing of all of the characters in the terminal's extended character set using two-stroke mnemonics to represent the characters. An umlaut, for example, √º could be typed by pressing the following sequence: * Compose * u * \\" (double quote, mnemonically like the dots above the umlaut) An LED on the keyboard indicated an ongoing compose sequence. At the time of its introduction, the differences between the new layout and the traditional Teletype Model 33 and VT100 layouts proved disruptive, but the LK201's key arrangement has become the de facto standard for all full-sized computer keyboards, differing primarily in the fact that the Compose key has been removed, and that the numeric keypad shows two double-height keys instead of one, decreasing the number pad keys from 18 to 17. Follow-on keyboards from Digital refined the design introduced with the LK201. One notable departure from the basic LK201 design was a Unix-oriented keyboard, the LK421, that omitted the added middle group of cursor and miscellaneous function keys but included a dedicated Escape Key. Many Unix users preferred a narrower, ASCII- oriented keyboard rather than the rather-wide LK201 arrangement and the Escape Key was essential for several popular Unix editors.

In the same year he came out as a writer against Roman Catholic doctrine, attacking Serenus Cressy. He was answered by John Sergeant, to whom he replied in 1666. Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury, made him his chaplain in 1668, giving him on 22 October the prebend of Yatesbury, and on 7 November the prebend of Husborn-Tarrant and Burbage.

On 11 September 1672 he was installed precentor at Salisbury, and at once accumulated B.D. and D.D. (13 September). He resumed his anti-Catholic polemics in 1674, and continued to publish on this topic at intervals till 1689. Whitby's reputation suffered by his anonymous publication, late in 1682, of The Protestant Reconciler, a plea for concessions to nonconformists, with a view to their comprehension. A fierce paper war followed, in which Lawrence Womock, David Jenner, and Samuel Thomas took part. In contemporary pamphlets Whitby, nicknamed Whigby, was unfavourably contrasted with Titus Oates; ironical letters of thanks were addressed to him, purporting to come from Anabaptists and others. The University of Oxford in convocation (21 July 1683) condemned the proposition 'that the duty of not offending a weak brother is inconsistent with all human authority of making laws concerning indifferent things,' and ordered Whitby's book to be burned by the university marshal in the schools quadrangle. Seth Ward extorted from Whitby a retractation (9 October 1683); and he issued a second part of the Protestant Reconciler, urging dissenters to conformity. In 1689 Whitby wrote in favour of taking the oaths to William and Mary. He took a small part in the Socinian controversy by publishing (1691) a Latin tract on the divinity of Christ. On 14 April 1696 he received the prebend of Taunton Regis. Whitby suffered in his later years from failing sight, and employed an amanuensis; otherwise he retained his faculties, including a tenacious memory. He was at church the day before he died; and returning home fainted and died the night following, on 24 March 1726, his eighty-eighth birthday. Works His major work was a 'Paraphrase and Commentary on the New Testament,' begun in 1688 and published in 1700; last edition, 1822. Philip Doddridge thought it preferable to any other commentary. In his commentary he opposes John Tillotson's view of hell torments. Faith he defined as mere assent to Gospel facts as true. In 1710, Whitby challenged the critical works of John Mill and defended Textus Receptus against thirty thousand textual variants in Mill's edition of the New Testament. Of this Examen variantium Lectionum Johannis MilliDaniel Whitby, Examen variantum Lectionum Johannis Milli (London 1710) use was made by Anthony Collins; it was reprinted (Leyden, 1724) by Sigebert Haverkamp. During 1710‚Äì11 Whitby was engaged in refuting the Calvinistic positions of John Edwards. In 1710 he wrote his Discourse on the Five Points (on the Five Points of Calvinism) which eventually drew Calvinist responses from English Baptist John Gill in his The Cause of God and Truth (1735) and American Congregationalist Jonathan Edwards in his Freedom of the Will (1754). Whitby is usually ranked as an Arminian, but denial of the imputation of Adam's sin carried him beyond Arminian lines. In the Bangorian controversy he wrote (1714 and 1718) in defence of Benjamin Hoadly. On the doctrine of our Lord's deity, which he had defended in 1691 and had upheld throughout his New Testament commentary (1703), he was affected by the treatise (1712) of Samuel Clarke, as shown by his later criticisms of George Bull and Daniel Waterland. A later Latin dissertation (1714) rejects the authority of the fathers as interpreters of Scripture, or as entitled to determine controversies respecting the Trinity. He had been led to this position by his antagonism (1707) to the arguments on which Henry Dodwell the elder based his rejection of the natural immortality of the soul. He made further use of it in criticisms directed (1718) against Bull and (1720‚Äì1) Waterland. The extent of his departure from conventional opinion was not revealed till the posthumous publication in April 1727 of his Last Thoughts, which he calls his 'retractation,' and which 'clearly shows his unitarianism'.Letter of 17 July 1727 by Samuel Crellius, in 'Thesaurus Epistolicus La-Crozianus,' quoted in Robert Wallace's Anti-trinitarian Biography, 1850, iii. 471. Concerning the Whitby's position in respect of the Roman Catholic Church, he published the 1674 pamphlet A discourse concerning the idolatry of the Church of Rome, which was followed by A treatise in confutation of the Latin service practised and, by the order of the Trent Council, continued in the Church of Rome, with the book and a digital version. and also by The fallibility of the Roman Church : demonstrated from the manifest error of the 2d Nicene & Trent councils : which assert that the veneration and honorary worship of images is a tradition primitive and apostolical (London, 1687)., with original manuscript and microfilm. At least from 1699 until 1702, Whitby was also a close friend and an epistolary correspondent of John Locke (1632 ‚Äì 28 October 1704), which a short time before was returned from Netherlands to the Lady Masham's country house in Essex. Views on the Millennium Whitby is considered by many to have systematised postmillennialism, even if seeds of this millennialist belief were sown long before with persons such as Augustine. Although Whitby may have been an Arminian minister, postmillennialism is now commonly associated with Calvinist and Covenantal churches, specifically Reconstructionist churches.Daniel Whitby ‚Äì Study Archive @ PreteristArchive.com Clarence Larkin wrote: See also * Textus Receptus NotesReferences *  External links  * ;Attribution Category:1638 births Category:1726 deaths Category:English theologians Category:People from Rushden Category:Arminian ministers Category:Arminian theologians ","title":"Daniel Whitby"},{"id":"1871189","text":"\\"Waterspider\\" is a science fiction short story by American writer Philip K.

It has 3,324 inhabitants (2004). Zwierzyniec is the northernmost town of the Roztocze National Park. The park comprises some of the last remaining sections of the primordial forest of Central Europe, especially spectacular stand of ancient beech trees (Bukowa Gora). It also is a rail junction, located along the Rejowiec Fabryczny - Hrebenne - Munina connection, with a branch line going westwards, to Stalowa Wola, via Bi≈Çgoraj. History The Zwierzyniec settlement was established in the 16th century by the Zamoyski family. One of the features here is an artificial lake with a number of small islands - one of them contains monuments of the hounds belonging to the Polish Queen Marysie≈Ñka Sobieska (primo voto Zamoyska). On another island the Zamoyskis built a baroque chapel, which became later the main church of the local Catholic parish. It is now known as the St John Nepomucene's parish church - renovated and expanded in the early 1960s by father Dutkowski. The access to the chapel island is now via a bridge. World War II During the occupation of Poland in World War Two, Nazi Germans set up a transit camp in Zwierzyniec for the province-wide Action Zamo≈õƒá. The camp processed 20,000-24,000 Poles, with many victims sent to death camps at Auschwitz and Majdanek. Race selections based on forcible abduction of children were conducted at Zwierzyniec. The term \\"Children of Zamojszczyzna\\" originates from this programme. The town also had a Jewish population of between 1,000 and 1,500 Jews. The first transport of Jews during the Holocaust, numbering approximately 52 Jews from Zwierzyniec, Rudka and other surrounding villages, was sent to a death camp in Be≈Ç≈ºec in September 1942. A mass extermination of the Jewish population from Zwierzyniec started on October 21, 1942.

The Dominion brand name is used under licence from Metro Inc., which discontinued the Dominion banner in the rest of Canada in late 2008 and has no other affiliation with the Newfoundland stores. History The chain began as Ayre's Supermarkets, a division of local department store chain Ayre and Sons. It was acquired by Argus Corporation via Dominion Stores Ltd. in 1963, eventually adopting the Dominion brand. Following the sale of Dominion to A&P; Canada, the Newfoundland operations were resold to local owners in 1987 and subsequently merged with two smaller local chains. The newly-amalgamated parent company was named Amalco Foods, but the combined chain's brand name remained \\"Dominion\\". Loblaw acquired the Dominion chain in Newfoundland in 1995, and soon after began implementing its own private-label products and store designs at these locations. Ultimately Dominion's traditional \\"Big D\\" logo was replaced with a derivative of the Loblaws logo, rotated to look like a D instead of an L. Renovated Dominion stores have changed the orientation of the logo to match the Loblaws logo, but Loblaws stated that it would continue to use the Dominion brand in the region. Today Dominion Memorial Market, St. John's, Newfoundland (August 2012). In all respects other than name, the majority of Dominion stores in Newfoundland operate with the same appearance and format as the company's flagship Loblaws and Atlantic Superstore supermarkets, and its newest St. John's area locations are similar in format to the Loblaw-owned Real Canadian Superstore. Since 2002, these locations have in fact been operated as part of the Atlantic Superstore unit, with nearly identical advertising campaigns, including the \\"Prices you can trust\\" slogan used by both Atlantic Superstore and Real Canadian Superstore. Nonetheless, Loblaw has not indicated any plans to discontinue its use of the Dominion banner. In the past few years, the chain has relocated or consolidated a number of locations into the \\"market\\" or superstore formats. Whereas there were roughly six locations in the early 2000s in St. John's proper (and many more in years past), there are now only three Dominion stores in the city, none built before 2000. This transition culminated with the opening of a Dominion on the site of the former Memorial Stadium in St. John's in 2007. Coincident with that opening, two medium-size locations in the east end of St. John's (older General Supermarket locations acquired in the early 1990s) were closed, while a third (Churchill Square) was converted to a SaveEasy. As a result, it is believed that all Dominion stores in the province have now been transitioned to the newer formats. Since then, SaveEasy in Churchill Square has now closed and the building is vacant. Most of the previous Newfoundland Drive / Torbay Road location is now occupied by a Coleman‚Äôs store, with a Bank of Montreal branch occupying the remaining space. In 2018, ten Dominion stores across the province were selected by the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation to operate licensed cannabis retail outlets.

Moog debuted it in 1964, and Moog's company R. A. Moog Co. (later known as Moog Music) produced numerous models from 1965 to 1980. It was the first commercial synthesizer, and is credited with creating the analog synthesizer as it is known today. By 1963, Moog had been designing and selling theremins for several years. He began developing the Moog synthesizer in response to demand for more practical and affordable electronic music equipment, guided by suggestions and requests from composers including Herb Deutsch, Richard Teitelbaum, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Wendy Carlos. The synthesizer consists of separate modules‚Äîsuch as voltage-controlled oscillators, amplifiers and filters, envelope generators, noise generators, ring modulators, triggers and mixers‚Äîwhich create and shape sounds, and can be connected via patch cords. It can be played using controllers including musical keyboards, joysticks, pedals, and ribbon controllers, or controlled with sequencers. Its oscillators can produce waveforms of different timbres, which can be modulated and filtered to produce more combinations of sounds (subtractive synthesis). Moog's principal innovation was to use voltage to control pitch via a voltage-controlled oscillator. He also introduced fundamental synthesizer concepts such as modularity and envelope generation. The Moog synthesizer was brought to the mainstream by Switched-On Bach (1968), a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos. In the late 1960s, it was adopted by rock and pop acts including the Doors, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and the Beatles. At its height of popularity, it was a staple of 1970s progressive rock, used by acts including Yes, Tangerine Dream, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In 1970, Moog Music released a portable, self-contained model, the Minimoog. Development 250x250px In the early 1960s, electronic music technology was impractical and used mainly by experimental composers to create music with little mainstream appeal. In 1963, American engineer Robert Moog, who designed and sold theremins, met composer Herb Deutsch at a New York State School Music Association trade fair. Deutsch had been making electronic music using a theremin, tape recorder, and single-pitch oscillator, a time-consuming process that involved splicing tape. Recognizing the need for more practical and sophisticated equipment, Moog and Deutsch discussed the notion of a \\"portable electronic music studio\\". Moog received a grant of $16,000 from the New York State Small Business Association and began work in Trumansburg, New York. At the time, synthesizer-like instruments filled rooms; Moog hoped to build a more compact instrument that would appeal to musicians. Learning from his experience building a prohibitively expensive guitar amplifier, he believed that practicality and affordability were the most important parameters. Previous synthesizers, such as the RCA Mark II, had created sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes. Instead, Moog used recently available silicon transistors ‚Äî specifically, a transistor with an exponential relationship between input voltage and output current. With this, he created the voltage- controlled oscillator (VCO), which generated a waveform whose pitch could be adjusted by changing the voltage. Moog designed his synthesizer around a standard of one volt per octave. Similarly, he used voltage to control loudness with voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). Moog developed a prototype with two VCOs and a VCA. As the VCOs themselves could output voltage, one could be used to modulate the output of another, creating effects such as vibrato and tremolo. According to Moog, when Deutsch saw this, he \\"went through the roof\\" and immediately began making music with the prototype, attracting the interest of passersby: \\"They would stand there, they‚Äôd listen and they‚Äôd shake their heads ... What is this weird shit coming out of the basement?\\"alt=In 1964, Moog and Deutsch demonstrated the synthesizer at the electronic music studio at the University of Toronto. After the presentation impressed the composers, Moog was invited by the Audio Engineering Society to present at their annual convention in New York that October. Though he had not planned to sell synthesizers there, some customers placed orders at the show. The choreographer Alwin Nikolais became the first person to purchase a commercially made Moog synthesizer. Moog constructed synthesizers to order. The first order for a complete Moog synthesizer, for which Moog had to design a keyboard and cabinet, came from composer Eric Siday. With no Moog books and no way to save or share settings, early users had to learn how to use the synthesizer themselves, by word of mouth, or from seminars held by Moog and Deutsch. Moog refined the synthesizer in response to requests from musicians and composers. For example, after Deutsch suggested Moog find a way to fade notes in and out, Moog invented an envelope module, using a doorbell button as a prototype. At the suggestion of composer Gustav Ciamaga, Moog developed a filter module, a means of removing frequencies from waveforms. His first filter design created a sound similar to a wah-wah pedal; he later developed the distinctive \\"ladder\\" filter, which was the only item in the synthesizer design that Moog patented, granted on October 28, 1969. Further developments were driven by suggestions from musicians including Richard Teitelbaum, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Wendy Carlos; it was Carlos who suggested the first touch-sensitive keyboard, portamento control, and filter bank, which became standard features. Moog initially avoided the word synthesizer, as it was associated with the RCA synthesizer, and instead described his invention as a \\"system\\" of \\"electronic music modules\\". The classical meaning of \\"to synthesize\\" is to assemble a whole out of parts. After many debates, Moog eventually told composer Reynold Weidenaar: \\"It‚Äôs a synthesizer and that's what it does and we're just going to have to go with it.\\" Moog used the word synthesizer in print for the first time in 1966. By the 1970s, \\"synthesizer\\" had become the standard term for such instruments. There was also debate as to the role of the keyboard in synthesizers. Some, such as composer Vladimir Ussachevsky and Moog's competitor Don Buchla, felt they were restrictive. However, Moog recognized that most customers wanted keyboards and found it helped make the instrument approachable; by including keyboards in photographs, it helped users understand that the synthesizer was for making music. Moog also developed alternative controllers, such as the ribbon controller, which allows users to control pitch similarly to moving a finger along a violin string. Most of the Moog modules were finalized by the end of the 1960s and remained mostly unchanged until Moog Music ceased trading in the 1980s. Moog had pursued the development of his synthesizer as a hobby; he stressed that he was not a businessman, and had not known what a balance sheet was. He likened the experience to riding theme park amusements: \\"You know you're not going to get hurt too badly because nobody would let you do that, but you‚Äôre not quite in control.\\"  Components  alt= The Moog synthesizer consists of separate modules - such as oscillators, amplifiers, envelope generators, filters, noise generators, ring modulators, triggers and mixers - which can be connected in a variety of ways via patch cords. The modules can also be used to control each other. The Moog does not produce sound until a workable combination of modules are connected. The synthesizer can be played using controllers including keyboards, joysticks, pedals, and ribbon controllers. The oscillators can produce different waveforms with different tones and overtones, such as a \\"bright, full, brassy\\" sawtooth wave, a thinner, flute-like triangle wave, a \\"nasal, reedy\\" pulse wave, and a \\"whistle-like\\" sine wave. These waveforms can be modulated and filtered to produce more combinations of sounds (subtractive synthesis). The oscillators were difficult to keep in tune, and small temperature changes would cause them to drift rapidly. As Moog's early customers were more interested in creating experimental music than playing conventional melodies, Moog did not consider keeping them stable a priority. The Moog's 24db low-pass filter is particularly distinctive, with a \\"rich\\", \\"juicy\\", \\"fat\\" sound. The filter, based on pairs of transistors connected by capacitors arranged in a ladder- like layout, attenuates frequencies above a level set by the user. and boosts the frequencies around the cut-off frequency. When overdriven, the filter produces a rich distortion described as \\"the Moog sound\\".  Impact  Keyboardist Keith Emerson performing with a Moog synthesizer in 1970 The Moog was much smaller than previous synthesizers, and much cheaper, at $10,000USD compared to the six-figure sums of other synthesizers. Whereas the RCA Mark II was programmed with punchcards, Moog's synthesizer could be played in real time via keyboard, making it attractive to musicians. New Scientist described it as the first commercial synthesizer. According to the authors of Analog Days, \\"Though the notion of voltage control and Moog's circuit designs were not original, Moog's innovations were in drawing the elements together, realizing that the problem of exponential conversion could be solved using transistor circuitry and building such circuits and making them work in a way that was of interest to musicians.\\" Most Moog synthesizers were owned by universities or record labels, and used to create soundtracks or jingles; by 1970, only 28 were owned by musicians. The Moog was first used by experimental composers including Richard Teitelbaum, Dick Hyman and Wendy Carlos. In 1968, Carlos released Switched-On Bach, an album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer. It won three Grammy Awards and was the first classical album certified platinum. The album is credited for popularising the Moog and demonstrating that synthesizers could be more than \\"random noise machines\\". An early use in rock music came with the 1967 Monkees album Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. In 1969, George Harrison of the Beatles released an album of Moog recordings, Electronic Sound, and that year the Moog appeared on the Beatles album Abbey Road on tracks including \\"Because\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\". Other rock bands who adopted the Moog include the Doors, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones. It was also adopted by jazz musicians including Herbie Hancock, Jan Hammer and Sun Ra. For a period, the name Moog became so associated with electronic music that it was sometimes used as a generic term for any synthesizer. Numerous novelty records were recorded with titles such as Moog Espana, Moog Power and Music to Moog By. Moog said in 1969: \\"I like the idea of my name becoming a generic term for the synthesizer, but I don't like the fact that cruddy records are being put out with my name attached.\\" He felt there were \\"maybe 25 people in the world who have the necessary competence in both physics and music\\" to play the Moog well. In the 1970s, at the height of the Moog's popularity, it became ubiquitous as part of progressive rock bands such as Yes, Tangerine Dream, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Keith Emerson was the first major rock musician to perform live with the Moog, and it became a trademark of his performances; according to Analog Days, the likes of Emerson \\"did for the keyboard what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar\\". In later decades, hip hop groups such as the Beastie Boys and rock bands including They Might Be Giants and Wilco \\"have revived an interest in the early Moog synthesizer timbres\\". The Guardian wrote that the Moog synthesizer, with its dramatically new sounds, arrived at a time in American history when, in the wake of the Vietnam War, \\"nearly everything about the old order was up for revision\\". With its ability to imitate instruments such as strings and horns, synthesizers threatened the jobs of session musicians. For a period, the Moog was banned from use in commercial work, a restriction negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). Robert Moog felt that the AFM had not realized that the synthesizer was an instrument to be learnt and mastered like any other, and instead imagined that \\"all the sounds that musicians could make somehow existed in the Moog ‚Äî all you had to do was push a button that said 'Jascha Heifetz' and out would come the most fantastic violin player\\".Interview with Bob Moog, Plug, Fall 1974,p.2. Moog features such as voltage-controlled oscillator, envelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers became standards in the synthesizer market. The ladder filter has been replicated in hardware synthesizers, as well in digital signal processors, field-programmable gate arrays, and software synthesizers. According to the Guardian, Moog's 1964 paper Voltage- Controlled Music Modules, in which he proposed the Moog synthesizer modules, invented the modern concept of the analog synthesizer.  Successors  A Minimoog In 1970, Moog Music released the Minimoog, a portable, self-contained model, and the modular systems became a secondary part of Moog's business. The Minimoog has been described as the most famous and influential synthesizer in history. After the sale of Moog Music, production of Moog synthesizers stopped in the early 1980s. The patents and other rights to Moog's modular circuits expired in the 1990s. In 2002, after Robert Moog regained the rights to the Moog brand and bought the company, Moog released the Minimoog Voyager, an updated version. In 2016, Moog released a new version of the original Minimoog.

It is common in cancer patients being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.  Types  Anemia - a reduction of the red blood cells in the body. Leukopenia - a deficiency of white blood cells, or leukocytes Neutropenia - a type of leukopenia, with a specific deficiency in neutrophils Thrombocytopenia - a deficiency of platelets Pancytopenia - When all three types of blood cells; red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, are all deficient. This is a life-threatening disorder that is a characteristic of aplastic anemia. There are also two general types of cytopenia: autoimmune and refractory. Autoimmune cytopenia - caused by an autoimmune disease when your body produces antibodies to destroy the healthy blood cells. Refractory cytopenia - caused by bone marrow not producing healthy blood cells, and can be a result of cancer.  Symptoms and signs  The symptoms of cytopenia vary depending on what type is diagnosed. The symptoms of anemia include: * Fatigue * Weakness * Shortness of breath * Poor concentration * Dizziness or feeling lightheaded * Cold hands or feet The symptoms of leukopenia include: * Frequent infections * Fever The symptoms of thrombocytopenia include: * Easily bleeding or bruising * Difficulty to stop bleeding * Internal bleeding  Causes  Cytopenias are caused by anything that promotes the body into creating antibodies to fight blood cells. This includes, but is not limited to,: * Chemotherapy * Malignant tumors * Antacids * Antibiotics * Anticonvulsants * Antimalarials * Antivirals * Cardiac drugs * Diabetes drugs * Hyperthyroid drugs * NSAIDs * Rheumatoid arthritis drugs  Treatment  The treatments for cytopenia vary depending on the type of cytopenia. The treatment for anemia is rest and a diet consisting of high iron foods. Medication can also be used such as: * Epoetin alpha - a synthetic erythropoietin that stimulates stem cells to produce red blood cells. * Darbepoetin alfa - Stimulates red blood cells but requires less daily doses and less disruption in activities. People with thrombocytopenia can be treated by avoiding skin damage such as bruising or breaking of the skin. Neutropenia patients are advised to avoid contact with people who are ill, monitor closely for signs of infection, and take antibiotics when appropriate. Growth factors are also another way to treat cytopenia. Growth factors are synthetic versions of substances involved in stimulating red and white blood cell production. These medications include: * Epoetin alfa * G-CSF * GM-CSF Bone marrow and stem cell transplantation are effective for all types of cytopenias. However, when a compatible donor cannot be found, immunosuppressive therapy is also common. Antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is mixed with cyclosporine to promote cell growth.

As well, conversion or closure of all UpClose and G-Wiz stores, as well as all but one THS Studio, was completed in 2006. InterTAN filed for bankruptcy protection (under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act) at the same time as its U.S. parent in late 2008. However, the Canadian division was not directly affected by Circuit City's liquidation process announced on January 16, 2009. Bell Canada subsequently announced an agreement to purchase the bulk of InterTAN's assets, specifically The Source.Simon Avery, \\"Bell Canada snaps up The Source \\", globeandmail.com, March 2, 2009 InterTAN, the corporate entity, was not included in the sale (rather it was itself the seller),Approval and Vesting Order (re sale to Bell), Ontario Superior Court of Justice, 9 March 2009 and is therefore now considered defunct. History InterTAN Inc. was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tandy Corporation of Fort Worth, Texas, which owned retail operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, West Germany, Canada and the United States. Its name being a shortened version of International Tandy. It had estimated annual sales of US$400 million and assets of US$250 million and accounted for 13 percent of the company's annual sales. It was decided to \\"spin off\\" the international retail operations and a separate corporation, InterTAN Inc., was created, with two subsidiaries InterTAN Canada Ltd. and InterTAN Australia Ltd.. The company became a separate entity from Tandy Corporation on 20 June 1986, with InterTAN Canada Ltd. to oversee 873 stores in Canada and 894 stores in Europe and InterTAN Australia Ltd. to oversee 350 stores in Australia.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-06-10/business/8602110424_1_tandy- corp-tandy-electronics-intertan By 1988, the company had closed unprofitable stores in many countries, including in West Germany. The French stores were bankrupt by the end of December 1993, shut down along with the Belgian stores and distribution centre. Carphone Warehouse bought the remaining British shops in 1999, one year after InterTAN had closed 69 of the 338 UK Tandy stores.http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/tandy-announces-store- closures-156224385.html In April 2001, InterTAN Australia Limited trading as Tandy Electronics was sold to Woolworths Limited for A$112.6 million with 222 stores. InterTAN was reduced to being the parent company for the Canadian consumer electronics business only. Product offerings occasionally differed from the US chain; a 1989 decision to drop the Tandy Colour Computer in Canada drew a small-scale backlashhttp://roust-it.dk/coco/LittleWonder.pdf and InterTAN often carried non-RadioShack items alongside the core Tandy line. Until June 30, 2005, InterTAN ran stores under the banner RadioShack in Canada, as it had a licensing agreement with the RadioShack Corporation until 2010 to use the American company's trademarks. However, after a purchase of InterTAN by Circuit City Stores, Inc. in 2004, the RadioShack Corporation sued to have that agreement terminated. While that lawsuit was approved in the State of Texas, it was not legally binding in Canada. InterTan filed a lawsuit in Canada stating that since the purchase by Circuit City Stores, Inc. was for only 80% of InterTAN, the latter was still a viable company and thus entitled to keep using the name RadioShack. InterTAN and RadioShack came to a temporary deal by which InterTAN is banned from using the former moniker since July 1, 2005, and as such, all corporate retail consumer electronics stores, and most dealer stores, formerly known as RadioShack are known as The Source. The matter was settled in late 2006; however, the details of the settlement were not made public. RadioShack made a token effort to re-enter the Canadian market in 2005 with nine stores, which it abandoned in January 2007. Remaining RadioShack-branded inventory began to appear in Liquidation World bins in Canada in 2007. Former InterTAN CEO Brian Levy later became an ER medical doctor. InterTAN had entered into arrangements with Rogers Communications to run a chain of stores under the Rogers Plus banner, using InterTAN's point-of- sale systems and knowledge of retail operations for the day-to-day management of the stores. This partnership was renewed as part of the Circuit City acquisition, and was set to expire in January 2007. In April 2002, InterTAN, already one of Canada's largest battery retailers with its RadioShack stores, acquired certain assets and locations of Battery Plus and merged it into its retail operations. In the first two months of 2007, InterTAN underwent drastic changes. By closing all but one THS Studio location, as well as all but one Battery Plus location, InterTAN began to focus on its core operation: The Source By Circuit City. InterTAN continued closing underperforming locations through the end of February 2007, resulting in the loss of employment for almost 100 Canadians. The positions varied from sales associates, store managers, store assistant managers, district managers, service centre managers, even regional vice presidents. Circuit City announced that they had retained Goldman Sachs to explore selling off InterTAN in Q1, 2007. Circuit City USA went bankrupt in 2009, during the Great Recession. \\"The Source\\" was sold as a going concern to Bell Canada Enterprises.

The Coudenhoves were Counts of the Holy Roman Empire since 1790 and were prominent in the Netherlands and Belgium. After the upheaval of the French Revolution, they went to Austria.

This is even more unlikely than a successful wager in the trifecta, which requires correctly picking the first three finishers in order, and as such will have a correspondingly higher payoff. Most exotic wagers in horseracing are a 1 dollar minimum. Due to the difficulty of the superfecta, some racetracks have lowered the minimum on the superfecta to 10 cents. This 10 cent bet is very popular with the fans as it permits a bettor with a small bankroll to cover many combinations and still have a chance for a large payoff. Due to the imprecise nature of the name (as opposed to other bets such as the trifecta), superfecta bets can sometimes require selecting more than four horses. For instance, the New South Wales TAB in Australia previously offered a superfecta bet on selected races requiring bettors to pick the first six finishers in the correct order, rather than four. The bet requiring the selection of four finishers in order is instead referred to by most Australian totalisators as a First Four bet (or in Western Australia as a QuartetRacing and Wagering Western Australia (2006).

The valves are hydraulically actuated, requiring little, if any, maintenance over the life of the engine. They come with dual 36mm diaphragm-type CV carburetors and a solid state digital ignition. Depending on application and tuning, The dual pin crankshaft models produce at the crankshaft (brake horsepower) ~ @ 5000 rpm and ~ @ 2750 rpm. Single pin crank models produced about and less. The 1985-1986 models produced about 78.4 bhp @ 6000 rpm and 73 ft lbs @ 4,500rpm. These engines came with either a 5 speed manual transmission (1985-1986, 1995-2007) or a 4 speed manual transmission (1987-1994 VT1100C). All years are shaft drive. Final drive ratio is similar between these transmissions (with one exception the Honda Shadow Spirit has a 14% higher final drive ratio, this lowers the RPM at highway speeds. For the lower geared bikes such as on the VT1100T the 33T on the countershaft drives the 31T on the damper shaft (Honda calls this a cross shaft.) For the VT1100T, Sabre and Areo in high gear RPM is around 3250 @ 60 mph. Honda not only put a slightly lower first gear in the VT1100T to help with an expected fully loaded touring motorcycle, but also used this lower gear in the Tourer and Sabre. Honda also placed a slightly lower 5th gear in the Aero, Tourer, Sabre to give it around 3380 RPM @ 60 mph. .8:1 compared to the .76:1 of the A.C.E. For the higher geared VT1100C (1997-2007) 36T on the countershaft drives the 29T on the damper shaft. For the VT1100C Spirit high gear RPM is around 2730 @ 60 mph. Honda said the Aero has about 5 more HP than the other VT1100's because of the exhaust system design, but compared to the ACE it weighs about 40 pounds more. Also the lower high gear ratio in the Aero gives it better passing power without downshifting but at a noticeable cost in fuel economy. The VT1100 has been used in the following Honda motorcycles with these model designations: * VT1100 - 1985-1994 (sometimes called \\"Classic\\") * VT1100C - 1997-2007 (Spirit) models * VT1100C2 - 1995-1999 American Classic Edition (ACE) and 2000-2007 Sabre models * VT1100C3 - 1998-2002 Aero models * VT1100T - 1998-2001 ACE Tourer models. The 1995-1999 VT1100C2 ACE and 1998-2000 VT1100C3 Aero models are single crank-pin models, all other 1100s are dual crankpin. The single crank pin model gave the engine a \\"loping idle\\" and more \\"rumble\\" in an attempt to mimic Harley-Davidson V-twins. It also lost about and around 5 ft lbs of torque compared to the dual pin engine. There is also more vibration with the single pin crank engine.

Schaden played recordings of classic old-time radio shows and reminisces with radio personalities about the early days of broadcasting. The program first aired on WNMP/WLTD in Evanston in 1970 and then moved to WNIB, Classical 97 in Chicago from 1975 to 2001, and since 2001 it has been heard on WDCB 90.9 FM, a public radio station in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. Born in Chicago, Schaden is a former newspaper editor and marketing executive who turned his hobby of collecting radio shows into a vocation. For his efforts in preserving and documenting radio history he was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1993, the first radio fan to receive this honor. He has often served as a consultant on topics related to broadcasting history, and he is a founding member of the Board of Directors of Chicago‚Äôs Museum of Broadcast Communications. He was the editor and publisher of the magazine Nostalgia Digest from its inception in 1974 until his retirement from publishing in 2005. The magazine is now edited and published by Funny Valentine Press. He documented the history of Chicago's WBBM in WBBM Radio: Yesterday and Today (1988), and he also wrote The Cinnamon Bear Book (1987) and Speaking of Radio: Chuck Schaden‚Äôs Conversations with the Stars of the Golden Age of Radio (2003). On October 9, 2006, he became the new host of the nationally syndicated When Radio Was! series, replacing Stan Freberg (who had hosted the show since 1995). His first show for When Radio Was! was \\"A Salute to Stan Freberg.\\" Chuck stepped down as host of this series in October 2007, with XM Satellite Radio's Greg Bell taking over the program beginning with the broadcast of October 8. Schaden stepped down as host of \\"Those Were The Days\\" in June 2009. When making the public announcement, Schaden explained that he wanted to spend more time with his family. On July 4, 2009, current host Steve Darnall took over as only the second host of the show.

FlashFXP supports both client-to-server and server-to-server (FXP) transfers, in addition to SCP/SFTP. History In the summer of 1998, Charles DeWeese (nicknamed flashd/bigstar) was hanging out with friends on Internet relay chat. Around April, a few of his friends suggested he create an fxp client because the existing fxp clients weren't very reliable. After a few weeks of tossing ideas back and forth, he decided that his next project would be an fxp client. Charles DeWeese started developing MyFXP in Visual Basic 4, but he soon realized that Visual Basic fell short in many areas. A dear friend, the author of LeapFTP, suggested that he use Borland Delphi. Therefore, DeWeese switched to Borland Delphi 4. Although the original name was MyFXP, the program was later renamed to FlashFXP, and on June 24, 1998, FlashFXP was started. Nearly a month later, on July 23, 1998, FlashFXP 1.0 was released. Version 1.2 was the first shareware version of FlashFXP. Version 2.0 was a significant milestone for FlashFXP by providing SSL/TLS support. By 2003, FlashFXP became successful. As a result, Charles DeWeese was simply unable to keep up with the development, support, and sales by himself. He later signed an exclusive deal with iniCom Networks, Inc and released version 3.0. In late 2009, FlashFXP became part of the newly formed Opensight Software, LLC, which Charles is sole owner of. Sales are fully automated via share-it, PayPal, and the FlashFXP website, although support is really provided by the developer and other people at the support forums.

(born Otto-Albert Hirschmann; April 7, 1915 ‚Äì December 10, 2012) was an economist and the author of several books on political economy and political ideology. His first major contribution was in the area of development economics.Hirschman, A. O. (1958) The Strategy of Economic Development. Yale University Press Here he emphasized the need for unbalanced growth. He argued that disequilibria should be encouraged to stimulate growth and help mobilize resources, because developing countries are short of decision making skills. Key to this was encouraging industries with many linkages to other firms. His later work was in political economy and there he advanced two schemata. The first describes the three basic possible responses to decline in firms or polities (quitting, speaking up, staying quiet) in Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970). The second describes the basic arguments made by conservatives (perversity, futility and jeopardy) in The Rhetoric of Reaction (1991). In World War II, he played a key role in rescuing refugees in occupied France. Early life and education Otto Albert Hirschman was born in 1915 into an affluent Jewish family in Berlin, Germany, the son of Carl Hirschmann, a surgeonBook review of ‚ÄúWorldly Philosopher: The Odyssey of Albert O. Hirschman‚Äù (Princeton), by Jeremy Adelman : The Gift of Doubt: Albert O. Hirschman and the power of failure by Malcolm Gladwell The New Yorker, 2013 and Hedwig Marcuse Hirschmann. He had a sister, Ursula Hirschmann. Honorary degree awarded to Albert O. Hirschman by Free University of Berlin In 1932, he started studying at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t, continued at HEC Paris, the Sorbonne, the London School of Economics and the University of Trieste, where he received his doctorate in economics in 1938. In the summer of 1936, Hirschman spent three months as a volunteer fighting on behalf of the Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War. After France surrendered to the Nazis, he worked with Varian Fry from the Emergency Rescue Committee to help many of Europe's leading artists and intellectuals to escape to the United States; Hirschman helped to lead them from occupied France to Spain through paths in the Pyrenees Mountains and then to Portugal. Career From 1941‚Äì1943 he was a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. He served in the United States Army (1943‚Äì1946) where he worked in the Office of Strategic Services. from 1946‚Äì1952 he was appointed Chief of the Western European and British Commonwealth Section of the Federal Reserve Board. From 1952‚Äì1954 he was a financial advisor to the National Planning Board of Colombia and the next 2 years made a living as a private economic counselor in Bogot√°. Thereafter he held a succession of academic appointments in economics; from 1956‚Äì1958 at Yale University, from 1958‚Äì1964 at Columbia University, and for 10 years at Harvard University (1964‚Äì1974). He worked for the Institute for Advanced Study from 1974‚Äì2012 until his death. He died at the age of 97 on December 10, 2012, some months after the passing of his wife of over seventy years, Sarah Hirschman (n√©e Chapiro). Work His first major contribution was in the area of development economics with the 1958 book The Strategy of Economic Development. Here he emphasized the need for unbalanced growth. He argued that disequilibria should be encouraged to stimulate growth and help mobilize resources, because developing countries are short of decision making skills. Key to this was encouraging industries with many linkages to other firms. In his 1967 essay The principle of the hiding hand, Hirschman helped develop the hiding hand principle. His later work was in political economy, where he advanced two schemata. In Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970) he described the three basic possible responses to decline in firms or polities (quitting, speaking up, staying quiet). The second describes the basic arguments made by conservatives (perversity, futility and jeopardy) in The Rhetoric of Reaction (1991). In The Passions and the Interests Hirschmann recounts a history of the ideas laying the intellectual groundwork for capitalism. He describes how thinkers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries embraced the sin of avarice as an important counterweight to humankind's destructive passions. Capitalism was promoted by thinkers including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith as repressing the passions for \\"harmless\\" commercial activities. Hirschman noted that terms including \\"vice\\" and \\"passion\\" gave way to \\"such bland terms\\" as \\"advantage\\" and \\"interest.\\" Hirschman described it as the book he most enjoyed writing. According to Hirschman biographer Jeremy Adelman, it reflected Hirschman's political moderation, a challenge to reductive accounts of human nature by economists as a \\"utility-maximizing machine\\" as well as Marxian or communitarian \\"nostalgia for a world that was lost to consumer avarice.\\" Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index In 1945, Hirschman proposed a market concentration index which was the square root of the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant in the market. In 1950, Orris C. Herfindahl proposed a similar index (but without the square root), apparently unaware of the prior work. Thus, it is usually referred to as the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index.

There is an active parish council.  History  Before the Norman conquest, Hurst Green was part of the parish of Salehurst which belonged to Countess Goda, however it is likely that few people lived in the area. There is a ridgeway track that runs through Hurst Green via Etchingham to Heathfield, and which was likely to have been in use during the Iron Age.MES4360 In 1744 the village green covered a triangular area from the courthouse to the village hall, including land on which some houses in Station Road now stand. \\"The Cottage\\" (MES3972) and \\"Yew Tree\\" (DES4516) are shown on a map dated 1650, and so must have stood on the edge of the village green.

Hirschman (1915‚Äì2012). The work hinges on a conceptual ultimatum that confronts consumers in the face of deteriorating quality of goods: either exit or voice. The book has been described as influential. The framework presented in the book has been applied to topics such as protest movements, migration, political parties, and interest groups, as well as to personal relationships.  Summary  The basic concept are as follows: members of an organization, whether a business, a nation or any other form of human grouping, have essentially two possible responses when they perceive that the organization is demonstrating a decrease in quality or benefit to the member: they can exit (withdraw from the relationship); or, they can voice (attempt to repair or improve the relationship through communication of the complaint, grievance or proposal for change). For example, the citizens of a country may respond to increasing political repression in two ways: emigrate or protest. Similarly, employees can choose to quit their unpleasant job, or express their concerns in an effort to improve the situation. Disgruntled customers can choose to shop elsewhere, or they ask for the manager. Exit and voice themselves represent a union between economic and political action. Exit is associated with Adam Smith's invisible hand, in which buyers and sellers are free to move silently through the market, constantly forming and destroying relationships. Voice, on the other hand, is by nature political and at times confrontational. While both exit and voice can be used to measure a decline in an organization, voice is by nature more informative in that it also provides reasons for the decline. Exit, taken alone, only provides the warning sign of decline. Exit and voice also interact in unique and sometimes unexpected ways; by providing greater opportunity for feedback and criticism, exit can be reduced; conversely, stifling of dissent leads to increased pressure for members of the organization to use the only other means available to express discontent, departure. The general principle, therefore, is that the greater the availability of exit, the less likely voice will be used. However, the interplay of loyalty can affect the cost-benefit analysis of whether to use exit or voice. Where there is loyalty to the organization (as evidenced by strong patriotism politically, or brand loyalty for consumers), exit may be reduced, especially where options to exit are not so appealing (small job market, political or financial hurdles to emigration or moving). Loyal members become especially devoted to the organization's success when their voice will be heard and when they can reform it. By understanding the relationship between exit and voice, and the interplay that loyalty has with these choices, organizations can craft the means to better address their members' concerns and issues, and thereby effect improvement. Failure to understand these competing pressures can lead to organizational decline and possible failure.  Applying the theory to membership organizations  Membership organizations, whether they be professional, community-based or business- oriented, face the perpetual challenge of knowing how engaged members are; how likely they are to remain members; and when they might cease to be members. Exit, Voice and Loyalty can be observed, reviewed and addressed as a matter of course, and in a learning organization, can result in reduced member \\"churn\\" and increased growth in member satisfaction, loyalty, referrals and growth. This usually entails some sort of survey efforts, social media inquiries, polling and individual interviews and/or group to maintain the necessary information for the organization to adapt to its members' needs. Some studies confirm Hirschman's assertion that greater exit and entry costs heighten the likelihood of voice. Particularly when examining dispute resolution in contexts with limited exit opportunities, increased entry costs make workers' voice more likely.  Applying the theory to emigration  A key application of Hirschman's scheme of exit, voice and loyalty has been emigration. Drawing on the analogy of discontent consumers buying elsewhere, \\"exit\\" translated into leaving a country and migrating to a different nation-state, while \\"voice\\" described the option of articulating discontent, which as Hirschman noted, \\"can be graduated, all the way from faint grumbling to violent protest\\". Hirschman modeled these options as mutually exclusive and postulated a seesaw mechanism: the easier available the exit option, the lower the likelihood of voice. For rulers, emigration served as a safety-valve, by which the discontent renounced on their possibility to articulate protest. \\"Latin American powerholders have long encouraged their political enemies and potential critics to remove themselves from the scene through voluntary exile. The right of asylum, so generously practiced by all Latin American republics, could almost be considered as a 'conspiracy in restraint of voice'.\\" However, not always did \\"exit subvert voice\\", as Hirschman himself acknowledged in a 1993 article.Hirschman, Albert O. (1993): Exit, Voice, and the Fate of the German Democratic Republic: An Essay in Conceptual History, in: World Politics, 45(2): 173‚Äì202 In 1989, in the GDR it was the escalating dynamic of out-migration that led those who wanted to stay to take to the streets to demand change. Exit triggered voice, and both worked in tandem. Moreover, Hirschman's scheme assumes a model of nation-states as a jigsaw puzzle of clearly delimited \\"containers\\", and migration as the process of unidirectionally moving from one container to another. The emergence of transnational migration diagnosed since the 1990s has challenged this assumption. As emigrants increasingly maintain strong social ties (loyalty) to their country of origin, including a claim to have a say in its public affairs (voice) ‚Äì Hoffmann argues ‚Äì in transnational migration exit, voice and loyalty are no longer exclusive options; the nature of migrant transnationalism is defined precisely by the overlapping and simultaneity of these categories.Hoffmann, Bert (2010): Bringing Hirschman Back In: \\"Exit\\", \\"Voice\\", and \\"Loyalty\\" in the Politics of Transnational Migration; in: The Latin Americanist, 54, 2010, 2, 57‚Äì73 An example of this phenomenon can be found regarding students from Ghana, who intended to migrate for a chance at an overall better quality of life, more career options, and a possibility of continuing their education. These students hope to 'exit' their current situation due to their lack of resources, lack of income, or lack of job opportunities. They are 'withdrawing their relationship' with their current community/home country to try and prosper somewhere new. Special problems Hirschman provides an example simplified here: Consider a publicly funded school where the quality of education declined. Quality-conscious parents would increasingly remove their child to a privately funded school, given that they are relatively indifferent to the cost. A price-conscious parent might notice that decline but lack the resources to make exit a viable option. At some point the school would know there was a problem, having had a number of students leave, but have no financial incentive to change, as the parents left who cared sufficiently about the quality to point to exactly where it had failed. The school remains locked into that state. Hirschman notes that in this and similar cases (\\"connoisseur goods\\"), a \\"tight monopoly could be preferable\\", preventing exit of quality-conscious consumers. A lack of exit would be better for the school, if not the child, by keeping an active voice among the parents. Applying the theory to political situations The exit, voice, loyalty model can be used to explain relationships between nation states and their citizens. The model predicts that when citizens have a credible exit threat and states are dependent on their citizens, states are less likely to take actions that the citizens would object to. For the case of increased taxation by the state, examples of credible exit threats include having the economic resources to flee or the ability to easily evade taxes. States are said to be dependent on their citizens if they value citizen loyalty more than they value the benefits that would result from a policy change. When both of these criteria are met, the model would predict that the state would not pursue a policy that would encourage citizens to exit or to use voice. Additionally, the choice between using voice and exiting depends on which method has the least amount of costs and most benefits. In the case of Africa in precolonial and early colonial times, citizens often chose to exit in response to unfavorable policy changes and this exiting took the form of emigrating away from a state. Even when citizens could use voice, exiting was a better option because there was a large amount of open land that could yield benefits that were similar to the benefits obtained by living within the state. However, in the last hundred years there has been a shift in strategy away from migration (exit) and towards protesting (voice) because it is no longer as easy to find open land to exit to. Loyalty is an essential force for Hirschman, shaping both voice and exit especially when it is difficult to join an organization. In the case of the newly-created Chinese middle class, which is mostly employed by the state, loyalty to the authoritarian government is very high. Their loyalty is bought through the difficulty in being admitted to their positions of relative financial prosperity and because emigration from China would result in losing significant status and income. These middle-class citizens are not completely voiceless, however, as they will protest the regime's choices through a process of remonstrations where they blame the failure of a policy on implementation by lower-level officials rather than criticize the policy directly. The regime is also aware that loyalty is bought at the price of financial stability; financial instability because of harmful policies would result in the same kinds of widespread protests that happened in 1989. Hirschman postulated that contrary to the Hotelling‚ÄìDowns analysis of political participation, those with \\"nowhere else to go\\" instead of being marginalized, their voices would become amplified. The rise of modern communications' amplifying effects has backed up Hirschman's position on voice, as seen by the rise of the Tea Party. When citizens can easily mobilize, the cost of mobilization is low for the citizens but the impact of using voice in a mobilized manner can lead to a large cost for the state. Exit can be an effective strategy for gaining greater political voice in the case of public goods In the case of Married Women's Property Acts in the mid-19th century, US states and territories expanded property rights to women in order to attract more women to move to their states and territories. In the Northeast, women were needed in large numbers to work both in industry and as servants; the ability for women to retain control of their earned wages and enter into contracts was an additional pull to encourage women to change residences. Similarly, competition for women residents among US territories in what is now the Western United States put pressure on legislatures to pass laws that would attract and retain these women in order to secure the benefits of obtaining statehood. Applying the theory to employment relations Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty analytical framework has underpinned important research within employment relations. Hirschman's insights that exit and voice are often, but not always, mutually exclusive and that loyalty will moderate a consumer's chances of voicing any misgivings are useful in explaining the link between workplace policies and outcomes. There are different forms of employee voice, including individual voice, such as employee surveys, and collective voice, typically unions, as well as combinations of them. Contrasting forms of voice have different degrees of power.Allen, M. M. C. (2014), 'Hirschman and Voice', in A. Wilkinson, J. Donaghey, T. Dundon and R. Freeman (eds), The Handbook of Research on Employee Voice, Cheltenham and New York: Edward Elgar Press, pp. 36‚Äì51. An assumption that consumers have power underpins Hirschman's original framework. For instance, Hirschman argued that, in most instances, once consumers or 'customer-members' of an organization had voiced their concerns, decision makers within the selling organization could be expected to search for the sources of those misgivings and attempt to remedy the situation. In comparison to competitive consumer markets, the employment relationship requires a different approach to power as managers have more authority than lower level employees,Hamilton, G.G. and Feenstra, R.C. (1997) 'Varieties of Hierarchies and Markets: An Introduction', in M. Orru, N.W. Biggart and G.G. Hamilton (eds) The Economic Organization of East Asian Capitalism, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, pp. 55‚Äì96. leading to important implications for how exit, voice, and loyalty are treated within the employment context. For instance, in sharp contrast to Hirschman's argument that, where exit is possible, voice is likely to be determined by 'the extent to which customer-members are willing to trade off the certainty of exit against the uncertainties of an improvement in a deteriorated product', within the context of employment, how willing employees are to trade off the uncertainties and costs of exit against the certainties of staying will strongly influence employees' decisions to quit as well as to voice their opinions. Similarly, loyalty and voice are not positively related in the employment context. In Hirschman's original formulation, consumers with higher levels of loyalty are more likely to voice their preferences to the selling organization rather than stop buying a product or service (exit). However, employees who voice their concerns may be seen as disloyal or as a disruptive influence by managersUpchurch, M., M. Richardson, Tailby, S. Danford, A. and Stewart, P. (2006) 'Employee Representation and Partnership in the Non-Union Sector: a Paradox of Intention?' Human Resource Management Journal, 16(4): 393-410. leading loyal employees to remain silent. For this and other reasons, a concept of 'neglect' needs to supplement Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty framework within the employment context.Donaghey, J., Cullinane, N., Dundon, T. and Wilkinson, A. (2011), 'Reconceptualising Employee Silence: Problems and Prognosis', Work, Employment and Society, 25(1): 51‚Äì67.Farrell, D. (1983) 'Exit, Voice, Loyalty, and Neglect as Responses to Job Dissatisfaction: a Multidimensional Scaling Study', The Academy of Management Journal, 26(4): 596‚Äì607.). Alternatively, 'toleration' is sometimes applied to situations in which employees remain with the organization, aware of problems, yet do not voice concern or grievance. According to Choi & Chung, some feel as though the competent wages given in teacher unions are responsible for fewer turnovers. Unions provide a platform for their employees to voice their concerns, and in turn, employees are able to voice how they feel rather than try to retreat from or 'exit' their union. The findings show, that the schools with greater policies for voicing concerns have lower rates of turnover. The article used a 2014 Bureau of Labor report to find that 2.5 million of teachers were covered by unions. With that number being so large, this information would be useful to those who want insight on how to keep their union workers happy. This information would also be useful for those looking for better grievance policies. According to Gunnarsd√≥ttir, middle managers in welfare positions are feeling emotional tension in their duties from having to receive and enforce organizational change. This leaves them susceptible to having their loyalty doubted. Due to this they feel like they aren't able to 'voice' their concerns. They were able to execute strategies that evenly dispersed opposing outlooks while remaining autonomous during a radical change. O'Meara, Bennett & Neihaus discuss what might \\"pull\\" staff members away from their job, one example being better wages. They also discuss what might \\"push\\" them away from their job, one example being that they are unhappy with their current work circumstances. These faculty members are leaving for a number of reasons. Money and uncomfortable working circumstances are examples. Some might not be able to tolerate new leadership, or changes in the way they are expected to work. Saifullah & Shahida suggests that both professional respect and employer-employee relation influenced the employees' loyalty, but the effect of employer-employee was larger. Having a good relationship with employees has real reactions on their loyalty. Reception According to Keith Dowding, Hirschman's book has been highly influential. Summarizing several criticisms of the book, Dowding writes that some scholars have argued that exit and voice can be used in unison (not solely as alternatives), that Hirschman does not pay attention to the ways in which collective action problems shape exit and voice choices, and that loyalty can also lead to silence rather than exit and voice. In 2019, Professor Ian Shapiro of Yale University told a class of undergraduates, graduate students, and community members, \\"if you read no other book in the social sciences before you graduate, this is certainly one of the two or three books you should definitely read.\\" Editions * Albert O.

Conspiracy An Act of Attainder was brought against the Marquess of Exeter and he was found guilty of treason by his peers in Westminster Hall, along with other supposed conspirators.J. P. D. Cooper, 'Courtenay, Henry, marquess of Exeter (1498/9-1538)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 Some sources suggest the 'conspiracy' was largely exaggerated by Thomas Cromwell, at this point Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich.Dodds, M. H., and R. Dodds. The Pilgrimage of Grace and the Exeter Conspiracy (Cambridge UP, 1915) Victorian historian J. A. Froude, however, writes that the Courtenays were 'petty sovereigns in Devonshire and Cornwall', which may go some way to explaining the true nature of the conspiracy. Yet there is no evidence to suggest that Courtenay ever had the means to or intended to muster any kind of rebellion against the King, the charges brought against him were based on the correspondence he had with Reginald Pole, who was both a Catholic Cardinal and a possible Yorkist claimant to the English throne, and the testimony of Geoffrey Pole, Reginald's brother. Aftermath The king, with Reginald Pole himself out of his reach, took revenge on Pole's family for engaging in treason by word against the king. The leading family members and even Pole's mother, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, were executed, and all their properties seized. The action destroyed the Pole family.Ronald Fritze, ed., 'Historical Dictionary of Tudor England, 1485-1603 (1991) pp. 191-92. Sir Geoffrey Pole was arrested in August 1538; he had been corresponding with Reginald, and the investigation of Henry Courtenay, Marquess of Exeter (Henry VIII's first cousin and the Reginald Pole's second cousin) had turned up his name; he had appealed to Thomas Cromwell, who had him arrested and interrogated. Under interrogation, Sir Geoffrey said that Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu (his eldest brother), and Exeter had been parties to his correspondence with Reginald. Montagu, Exeter, Sir Edward Neville and Lady Salisbury were arrested in November 1538, together with Henry Pole and other family members, on charges of treason, although Cromwell had previously written that they had \\"little offended save that he [Reginald Pole] is of their kin\\". They were committed to the Tower of London. Convictions In November 1538, Sir Edward Neville was executed for treason. In January 1539, Sir Geoffrey was pardoned, and Montagu and Exeter were tried and executed for treason, while Reginald Pole was attainted in absentia. In May 1539, Montagu, Exeter, Lady Salisbury, and others were also attainted, as her father had been; this meant that they lost their lands ‚Äì mostly in the South of England, conveniently located to assist any invasion ‚Äì and titles, and those still alive in the Tower were also sentenced to death, so could be executed at the King's will. As part of the evidence given in support of the Bill of Attainder, Cromwell produced a tunic bearing the Five Wounds of Christ, symbolising Lady Salisbury's support of Roman Catholicism and the rule of Reginald and Mary; the supposed discovery, six months after her house and effects had been searched when she was arrested, is likely to be a fabrication. In 1539, Sir Nicholas Carew, formerly something of a favourite of the king, fell out with him and was arrested and executed. At his trial it was alleged he had conspired for Exeter. Margaret Pole, as the Countess of Salisbury was now called, was held in the Tower of London for two and a half years under severe conditions; she, her grandson (Montagu's son), and Exeter's son were held together and supported by the King. In 1540, Cromwell himself fell from favour and was himself executed and attainted. Margaret Pole was finally executed in 1541 (her execution was dreadfully botched and horrifying even for those brutal times), protesting her innocence until the last ‚Äì a highly publicised case which was considered a grave miscarriage of justice both at the time and later. Reginald Pole is known to have said that he would \\"...never fear to call himself the son of a martyr\\". Some 350 years later, in 1886, Margaret was beatified by Pope Leo XIII.

Rio Claro is the largest town in southeastern Trinidad, in Trinidad and Tobago. Rio Claro lies east of Princes Town, west of Mayaro and northwest of Guayaguayare. It serves as the major commercial centre for southeastern Trinidad. It lies in a primarily agricultural area. It is the seat of the Rio Claro‚ÄìMayaro Regional Corporation.  History  The town was named for a small stream, which was named Rio Claro by Spanish surveyors in the 1770s. A \\"rest house\\" was built there in 1850 when a road was cut from Mission (now Princes Town) to Mayaro. As cacao planters settled the area, the village on the banks of the Rio Claro came to be called by that name. When the Trinidad Government Railway extended its line to this village in 1914, the name Rio Claro was formalised.  Schools  Rio Claro currently has two secondary schools and 9 primary schools.  Hunting and outdoor sports  The area is well known for its extensive yet accessible forests. The early lumber industry (circa 1930's) left many small trails, some of which were eventually paved over. This infrastructure development enabled not only the local farming populace but many avid hunters and fishermen access to these areas. Well into the 21st century the area is known throughout Trinidad as having exceptionally fruitful hunting (small game animals such as agouti, lappe and armadillo) and fishing grounds.  Farming and cuisine  A large proportion of the area's residents still practice farming and hunting; however this is not a subsistence lifestyle by any means. The residents have incorporated many of the modern goods and cooking styles with the more traditional methods and ingredients, resulting in a unique array of dishes that is regularly eaten in homes everyday. Ground provisions, freshwater fish and small game animals (commonly referred to as \\"wild meat\\") are dominant in the cuisine in this area. Navet, a village in the Rio Claro area is famous for its dasheen plantations. Poultry, canned and other preserved goods are accompaniments to these meals. Food in this area is generally prepared with generous use of spices, seasonings and pepper ‚Äì great pride is taken in ensuring that all ingredients (where possible) are cleaned. Cooking itself is a family affair, a group activity that allows for bonding and strengthening of relationships. One must not overlook that some of the tastiest doubles were sold in Rio Claro and that these vendors have won national competitions. Overall this way of life, often viewed as being \\"hard\\" by outsiders, is what makes the residents in the area enjoy a slightly higher standard of living than other communities, as the food expenditure is less here than in other towns and villages. The area's farms are well suited to grow a wide range of crops ‚Äì the many small streams, ponds, hills and trails allow this to be possible. Crop rotation is still popular among many of the traditional cocoa, citrus, banana and coffee farmers although within the last ten years there has been a heavy investment in \\"new\\" crops such as various ground provisions (e.g.: yams, tubers, cassava), seasonings and fruits. A proportion of the harvest is sold within the southeastern corner of the island but a larger proportion is sold to export firms which export the produce to major West Indian centers in the North America.  Lumber  For many years the Rio Claro area sustained a profitable trade in Caribbean tropical hardwoods. The area is rich in natural growths of hardwoods mahogany, cedar, appamatte, teak and mora ‚Äì all of these are commercially harvested by the many small independent timberjacks in the area. Softer tropical timber is also harvested and sold to the many sawmills in the area (there are at least three fully operational mills) for use in the island's manufacturing and export industry. The area is populated by many skilled carpenters and woodworkers who have learnt their trade from their forefathers. The result is some of the highest quality furniture, wood sculpting and displays of carpentry that can be found not only in Trinidad but in the Caribbean region. Starting from the early 1990s many of the stakeholders began a grassroots movement to conserve their forests (without governmental assistance). Harvested growths were replanted with new saplings (usually cedar, mahogany and teak) with the result that the industry is very much alive and strong in this part of the island.  Bars  Rio Claro is known for the many bars/rum-shops ‚Äì an offshoot of having been one of the last towns before reaching the oil rich fields of Guayaguayare in the 1970s. There are more bars in this little town than in any other. In one square kilometer off the center of Rio Claro there are 26 bars, and all of them are patronized. Many of the older 'watering holes' have receded with its original owners. Many of the bars are integrated into the communities themselves. They act as meeting places for the strong village councils in the area as well as hosts for the many small club teams. Weekends usually see an eruption of various village cricket, football and card tournaments, often with major money prizes at stake. The bars also function in the capacity of meeting areas during weddings, funerals and general holiday gatherings; indeed the high population density of these establishments makes them a convenient and affordable manner for local (and traditional) entertainment.

The council is also the principal body with responsibility for responding to complaints about Australian newspapers, magazines and associated digital outlets. Regulation of broadcast media in Australia is conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The APC was only established after the Federal Government began preparation of legislation to create a government authority to ensure accountability in 1975. In accordance with its constitution, the council pursues its goals by: * considering and dealing with complaints and concerns about material in newspapers, magazines and journals, published either in print or on the internet; * encouraging and supporting initiatives to address the causes for reader's complaints and concerns; * keeping under review, and where appropriate, challenging developments which may adversely affect the dissemination of information of public interest and may consequently threaten the public's right to know; * making representations to governments, public inquiries and other forums as appropriate on matters concerning freedom of speech and access to information; * undertaking research and consultation on developments in public policy affecting freedom of speech, and promoting; * promoting an understanding of the roles and activities of the council through forums and consultations; and encouraging feedback for Council's consideration The council is funded by its publisher members in the newspaper and magazine industries. It relies on publishers and editors to respect the council's standards and decisions, to adhere voluntarily to standards of good practice and to publish adjudications the result from complaints made against them. It has no legal or legislative power to fine or penalise the press. Functions The council's standards of good media practice are contained in its Statements of Principles, Specific Standards and Advisory Guidelines. The standards are applied by the council when considering complaints and are used as the basis for statements by Council representatives about good media practice, whether addressing practitioners within the industry, journalism students or the broader community. The council also undertakes research and convenes conferences and seminars on aspects of media standards. The council's Statement of General Principles was substantially revised in 2014. The council's mandate to consider complaints extends to all print publications and related digital outlets, such as websites, of publishers which are \\"constituent bodies\\" of the council. These publications comprise about 90 percent of all print and online outlets in Australia representing some 850 mastheads. The council also issues statements on policy matters within its areas of interest, including through submissions to parliamentary committees, commissions and other public bodies. It also undertakes research and convenes or participates in conferences and seminars on policy issues. Members The Australian Press Council has 26 members, comprising: * an independent chair and 10 \\"public members\\", who have no affiliations with a media organisation; * eleven nominees of media organisations which are \\"constituent bodies\\" of the council; * four independent journalist members, who are not employed by a media organisation. The chair is chosen by the council and has always been a judge or a university professor. The public members and independent journalist members are appointed by the council on the nomination of the chair. The nominees of publishers are chosen by the media organisations which have agreed to support the council and be subject to its complaints system. It meets quarterly, usually in Sydney or elsewhere in Australia from time to time. It is headed on administrative and other matters by an Executive Director. The current chair of the Press Council is Neville Stevens (effective 22 January 2018). The inaugural chairman was Sir Frank Kitto. He was followed by Geoffrey Sawer, Hal Wootten, David Flint, Dennis Pearce, Ken McKinnon, Julian Disney and David Weisbrot. In 1979, during the run-up to the South Australian state election, the News Limited owned The News campaigned against the Australian Labor Party in South Australia. A successful complaint was heard in relation to which the News Limited representatives alleged contained irregular procedures, leading the News to withdraw from the council in 1980. News re-joined the Press Council in 1987, but, as the single most important source of funding, its relationship with the body has been fraught. [see Criticisms by News Corp, below] The media union, now known as the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA), withdrew from the Press Council for nineteen years. It was not a member between 1986 and 2005. In 2012, Seven West Media, publisher of The West Australian, withdrew from the Press Council and set up its own complaints body, the Independent Media Council, to handle complaints against its print and publications and websites. The company cited its unwillingness to fund a substantially strengthened Press Council.  Complaints  The council receives more than 700 complaints each year. About three-quarters of those which are fully pursued by the complainant result in a correction, apology or some other form of action being taken. Where the complaint is resolved through a formal adjudication, the relevant publisher is required to publish the adjudication promptly and with due prominence. Reform The council has in the past been criticised for being unable to censure its members in anything more than a minor manner when standards are breached and for being a \\"toothless tiger\\" as a result of being funded by the publishers whose work it is meant to evaluate. The chairman of Australian Consolidated Press, Kerry Packer described the council as \\"window dressing\\" at a 1991 parliamentary inquiry into the print media. A former chair of the council, Professor Dennis Pearce, told the Finkelstein Media Inquiry that the authority was overly influenced by concerns of losing its sponsors and that the industry was reluctant to fund its own watchdog. Another former chairman, Ken McKinnon supported calls for the APC to have a stronger role and be better resourced, instead of statutory regulation. The Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown has described the APC as a \\"hollow vessel\\" and supports reform towards a statutory body with better funding. In the wake of the Finkelstein Media Inquiry, publishers agreed on a major strengthening of the Press Council. Funding was raised from $0.8 million to $1.6 million in 2012-13 and $1.8 million in the following year. News Corp Australia, Fairfax Media, the media union (MEAA) and the other publisher members of the council agreed to specific funding commitments for the three years, with subsequent commitments to be agreed at least two to three years in advance. Under the new arrangements, publisher members are required to give four years‚Äô notice of withdrawal from the council and will remain part of the council throughout that period. Their obligations to provide funding and comply with council processes became legally binding. The then chair of the Press Council, Prof Julian Disney, said at that time: ‚ÄúThe publishers‚Äô commitments are very welcome and will greatly strengthen the Council‚Äôs resources and effectiveness. Now that continued membership and greatly-improved funding have been guaranteed for the next three years, the Council can implement a sustained program to fulfill its responsibilities across print and online media‚Ä¶. The package substantially addresses key concerns expressed by the Finkelstein Inquiry about the Council‚Äôs capacity to strengthen its independence and effectiveness.\\" Since 2010, the Council has undergone a major transformation; doubling its budget, increasing its membership and staff, and moving to new premises in Sydney. As well as boosting its work on standards of practice, it has strengthened its processes for handling complaints and for ensuring that adjudications are prominently published by member organisations. A number of online-only publications have joined the Press Council, including Crikey, Mumbrella, and Ninemsn. In August 2011, the APC released new Specific Standards on Coverage of Suicide. The standards stress the importance of the discussion of suicide in helping to improve public understanding of the causes and warning signs of suicide and act as a deterrent. However they say that reporting of methods should not be published, care must be taken not to spark ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù suicides, and details of suicide hotlines and helplines should be included in the relevant news reports. In July 2014, the APC released new Specific Standards on Contacting Patients. The aim of these Standards is to facilitate media contact with people in hospitals and residential care facilities, while also ensuring respect for the health, dignity and privacy of those people and their families and for the general provision of care on the premises. In particular, the Standards aim to: * prevent unreasonable exclusion of journalists from hospitals; * promote a co-operative approach between journalists and hospitals; * prevent inappropriate contact by journalists with a patient who is in a vulnerable position; and * prevent undue intrusion by journalists on other patients and hospital staff. In March 2016, the APC released a new Advisory Guideline on Family and Domestic Violence Reporting. The Advisory Guideline is not intended to constrain or discourage news coverage or forthright debate about family violence. However, editors and journalists routinely exercise judgment about which events to cover; what information to collect and from whom; what material to include and what may be excluded in the interests of space and concision; and how to frame the story. The purpose of the Advisory Guideline is to help guide those considerations and consider the issues of safety, responsibilities, cultural sensitivities, context and content, and sources of assistance. Criticisms by News Corp in 2014 Beginning in August 2014, The Australian newspaper, owned by News Corp Australia, published a series of more than 20 articles and editorials highly critical of the Press Council‚Äôs activities and leadership. The newspaper accused the Council of overstepping its mandate and issuing questionable adjudications. In an editorial published on 9 August 2014, the newspaper said it had ‚Äúlost confidence in APC chairman Julian Disney and deplores the direction in which he has taken the council‚Äù. The editorial continued: ‚ÄúThe APC has become erratic in its rulings, unmoored from its foundations, ponderous and serpentine in its procedures, side-tracked by its chairman‚Äôs peculiar tastes and political predilections and ineffective as a body that promotes good practice.‚Äù In a subsequent article in Crikey on 11 August 2014, David Salter, the former Executive Producer of the ABC TV Program Media Watch, noted that ‚ÄúThe Australian has turned its particular brand of venom on Julian Disney, chair of the Press Council‚Äù. Salter wrote: ‚ÄúSelf- regulation, at least in the ethical fantasyland of News Corp, is only a worthwhile system of media accountability so long as it doesn‚Äôt inquire into the abuse of a newspaper‚Äôs power to pursue vendettas and parade its own paranoia‚Ä¶. More importantly, this whole unpleasant episode demonstrates the hypocrisies that underpin the media self-regulation construct in Australia. In response to the perceived threats of the Finkelstein Inquiry and the Convergence Review, newspaper proprietors rushed to ‚Äòstrengthen‚Äô the Press Council's authority and increase its funding. Now we have proof that this was all window dressing. If the APC's processes and findings don't suit a powerful member such as News Corp, it refuses to play by the rules and trashes the chair's reputation. Self-regulation is no regulation at all.‚Äù In an interview on ABC Radio‚Äôs Media Report program, Julian Disney said: ‚ÄúThere's always, over the years, been tensions way back to the start of the Council, not only with News Corp but with Fairfax from time to time. News pulled out only four years into the life of the Council, when the Chair was a High Court judge. So these tensions come and go, and I think they're felt more strongly in some parts of an organisation than others, and sometimes there are other pressures.‚Äù The Press Council pointed out factual inaccuracies in The Australian's criticisms, and an alleged lack of balance and fairness in the series of attack articles. At a Council meeting on 28 August 2014, a resolution re-affirming support for Julian Disney was passed and made public. The resolution, passed by 19 votes to nil, with one abstention, read in part: ‚ÄúThe Press Council reaffirms its confidence in the Chair and rejects the recent misrepresentations made by The Australian about the Chair and the Council. It also deplores the breach by The Australian of obligations of confidentiality during the Council‚Äôs complaint processes. The Council will continue to work with News Corp to resolve any legitimate concerns.‚Äù  David Weisbrot's chairmanship  After taking over as chair in March 2015, Professor David Weisbrot spent much of his time meeting with member publishers, editors, leading journalists, officials of the MEAA, media and communications academics, and members of the NGOs, peak associations, and community groups with which the council regularly interacts. During his tenure as chair, the Press Council: * organised an international conference on press freedom to help mark the council's 40 anniversary; * developed the council's first-ever strategic plan; * developed the council's first-ever reconciliation action plan; * reached out to the Indigenous press and the multicultural press, gaining membership from these communities for the first time; * worked to increase the council's membership from among online- only publications, including a number of major international publishers; * emphasised and energised the council's role as a strong public defender of free speech, press freedom and open and transparent government; * revamped and refreshed the council's Press Freedom Medals awards, to make them more relevant to the industry and the society; * introduced a customised Resolve IT system for handling, tracking and reporting on complaints; * appointed two women as chairs of adjudication panels, and one of them as a Vice-Chair, to ensure greater diversity in the management of the council's affairs; * reviewed and revised the council's many older advisory guidelines; * developed a new Advisory Guideline on Reporting Family Violence; * made significant progress on the development of an Advisory Guideline on Reporting on Children; * entered into a closer collaboration with Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia (JERAA) to award annual prizes to journalism students; * produced a set of teaching materials about media ethics that are now widely used in Australian journalism schools; * developed closer ties to other press councils in the region, especially New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste; * developed closer ties to other press councils internationally, such as those in South Africa and Canada, as well as through the Alliance of Independent Press Councils of Europe (A1PCE); and * developed a positive presence on social media, using it to promote the council's work, highlight adjudication decisions and provide notice of awards and scholarship programs. In a major address to the Melbourne Press Club on 6 August 2015, Professor Weisbrot stated: ‚ÄúWhatever benefits those procedural refinements may deliver, they are likely to pale in comparison with the benefits that will come from cultural change and a belief that the maintenance of high standards in the industry must be a shared enterprise. As I mentioned at the outset, for most of its history the Press Council has been perceived as the ‚Äòwatchdog‚Äô or the ‚Äòcop on the beat‚Äô - in other words, its presence might tend to discourage poor journalistic practice by putting the fear of God into publishers and practitioners, giving the public an opportunity to bring complaints, and then whacking those unfortunate few whose alleged transgressions happened to be complained about. And publishers and journalists who pride themselves on their professionalism clearly do not relish the experience of having to publish a negative adjudication. But focusing on a particular breach of the Council‚Äôs Standards in the past and then publicising it probably channels too much energy, attention and resources on the aberrant cases - the roughly 40 cases in any particular year that go all the way from initial receipt to final adjudication. And since it‚Äôs such a relatively small number, most journalists, editors and publishers may feel that those aberrant cases have nothing to do with them. What we need to do instead is to create a different culture: one that is collegial and intelligent, that continually learns from experience‚Ä¶. We urgently need to move away from the system of punishing individual transgressions in our industry and feeling that such action alone maintains high standards across the entire profession. While the need to identify and sanction poor practice will remain, there are much better strategies for achieving industry-wide improvement, and reassuring the community that this is the case.‚Äù Professor Weisbrot resigned as chair effective 18 July 2017. The council's two vice-chairs, the John Doyle and Julie Kinross, took over the position jointly while a replacement for Professor Weisbrot was being recruited. The Australian Press Council appointed Neville Stevens as its new chair effective 22 January 2018. Stevens has wide experience chairing panels and reviews in the private and public sectors and is a distinguished former public servant who headed two major Australian government departments, one of them dealing with telecommunications, media and broadcasting.

The name literally translates as residential learning for the knowledge of rishis (sages). The Saylorsburg campus was established in 1986, and the Coimbatore center in 1990. The goal at the time of formation was to emulate academic institutions with the focus on study of Advaita Vedanta, the Vedas, and other ancient Sanskrit texts, in contrast to the practice of yoga and meditation taught by other similar institutions. Since then the institutes have added teaching of hatha yoga, ayurveda, astrology, meditation and other traditional Indian disciplines to the curriculum. Courses range in duration from a single-weekend to three years, and instruction is in English, though advanced students study the original texts in Sanskrit. The centers run an outreach program called All India Movement (AIM) for seva (service) and a publication house that produces books on Vedanta, Hinduism, Hindu philosophy and literature, Paninian grammar, Indian history and related subjects. Several students and sanyassis (renunciates) who have studied at the centres, have gone on to spread Dayananda's teachings elsewhere and some have established ashrams of their own.

In Oxford colleges, a vicegerent is often someone appointed by the Master of a college to assume their powers and responsibilities during a period of absence. Usage= Catholic Church  In the Catholic Church, the Vicegerent is an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Rome, who is granted the personal title of archbishop and serves as the chief assistant to the Cardinal Vicar of Rome. Church of England Early in 1535, closely following the passing of Parliament's Act of Supremacy formally creating the Church of England, King Henry VIII appointed his chief minister Thomas Cromwell \\"Vice-Gerent in spirituals\\", effectively acting as the king's deputy in church matters and taking precedence over the two archbishops; this was a necessary step as Cromwell, as an unordained layman, otherwise had no jurisdiction within the Church. The office was not continued after Cromwell's execution in 1540. Cromwell's earlier appointment, that of Vicar General, had different responsibilities: under this title he directed the royal commissions into monastic affairs. Southeast Asia Patih or Pepatih is a regent title equivalent to vicegerent which was traditionally used among Austronesian polities of insular Southeast Asia, in particular those of Java and the Malay world. In the first place it denoted the chief minister of a kingdom or (in the case of Java) a traditional regency. Lesser ministers could also be known by the title. In some cases the headmen of local communities could be termed Patih, for example on 16th-century Java and in Banjarmasin in southeastern Kalimantan.A.

Only two classes of the 2-6-6-6 type were built. One was the \\"Allegheny\\" class, built by the Lima Locomotive Works. The name comes from the locomotive's first service with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway beginning in 1941, where it was used to haul loaded coal trains over the Allegheny Mountains. The other was the \\"Blue Ridge\\" class for the Virginian Railway. These were some of the most powerful reciprocating steam locomotives ever built, at 7,500 HP (which was only exceeded by the PRR Q2), and one of the heaviest at 386 tons for the locomotive itself plus 215 tons for the loaded tender. Other equivalent classifications are: UIC classification: 1CC3 (also known as German classification and Italian classification) French classification: 130+033 Turkish classification: 34+36 Swiss classification: 3/4+3/6 The UIC classification is refined to (1'C)C3' for Mallet locomotives.  History  Two classes of 2-6-6-6 locomotives were built; the sixty H-8 \\"Allegheny\\" class locomotives for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) between 1941 and 1948,Drury (1993) pp. 83, 88 and the eight AG \\"Blue Ridge\\" class locomotives for the Virginian Railway in 1945.Drury (1993) pp. 417‚Äì419 (The locomotives were Series AG on the Virginian, which was thought to be an abbreviation for Allegheny, but that referred to their being Articulated, Series G.) All were built by the Lima Locomotive Works. The \\"Allegheny\\" name refers to the C&O; locomotives' job of hauling coal trains over the Allegheny Mountains. C&O-1601;'s power output is 7,500 hp. Though it was apparent to many knowledgeable people in the railroad industry that reciprocating piston driven steam locomotives might soon be replaced by diesel power, Lima and C&O; set out to build the ultimate in high power steam locomotives and they succeeded. No diesel engine ever surpassed the output of these giants, which were among the heaviest steam locomotives ever constructed. The three-axle trailing truck supporting the firebox was unusual, carrying over 190,000 lbs, allowing the huge firebox needed for the high power. As it turned out, steam locomotives continued in service for almost another 20 years. Gene Huddleston's book, \\"C&O; Power\\", reports tests of the C&O; with a dynamometer car indicating momentary readings of with readings between at about . The state of calibration of the dynamometer car is not known. The calculated starting tractive effort was only , but no one has published a higher dynamometer horsepower for any steam locomotive. The locomotive was built to power coal trains on the 0.57% eastward climb from White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia to Alleghany, Virginia. With one at the front and another at the back, 11,500-ton coal trains left Hinton, WV and were at full throttle from White Sulphur Springs to the top of the grade at Alleghany. C&O;'s 2-6-6-6s also handled coal trains from West Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. Huddleston says that 23 locomotives were equipped with steam piping for heating passenger trains. Multiple unit operation in the diesel era removed the need to pack the highest horsepower in a single unit. The H-8's 80,000+ pound axle load demanded heavy rail and track structure. One H-8, the 1642, suffered a crown sheet failure and subsequent boiler explosion at Hinton, WV in June, 1953. The force of the explosion rocketed the boiler endwise off the running gear, killing all three crew. While these locomotives had two sources of water for the boiler, a steam turbine pump-fed Worthington hot pump and one injector, it is not known whether any were defective at the time of dispatch. According to the family of the locomotive's engineer, Wilbur H. Anderson, of Hinton, previous crews had complained of a faulty water level gauge. Anderson's widow, Georgia Anderson, was given $10,000 in compensation by the C&O.;  Preservation  There are only two surviving Alleghenies. Upon retirement in 1956, 1601 was donated to The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan where it has been on display indoors since. 1604 was initially sent to C&O;'s scrap lines behind their diesel shops at Russell, Kentucky. It was then donated to the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke circa 1969 where it was displayed next to N&W; 1218\\\\. On November 4th, 1985, it was partially damaged by a flood, which washed away the ground under it and nearly turned the locomotive over. In 1987, parent company Norfolk Southern did a cosmetic overhaul on it at their Roanoke Shops before it was sent to Baltimore to be displayed as the centerpiece of the then Mount Clare Junction shopping center which was adjacent to the B&O; Railroad Museum. In 1989, the shopping center donated it to the museum, where it presently resides. In popular culture The 2-6-6-6 has inspired the creation of the animated character \\"Sam\\", who was recently added as a locomotive to the animated children's show, Thomas And Friends.

It was provisionally adopted by a large group of key stakeholders in September 2003. These stakeholders include key government departments, including those responsible for labour, education, provincial and local government, water service, justice, policing, prosecution, social development, and education. The lead department is the Department of Labour. It was previously known as the Child Labour Action Programme, but was renamed in February 2006 because of the negative connotation attached to the abbreviation CLAP.Child Labour Programme of Action, Phase 2. The first phase was from 2004 to March 2008 and referred to as the CLPA-1. Many departments and other stakeholders have been implementing aspects of the Child Labour Programme of Action since 2004. However, the Minister of Labour plans to submit it for formal cabinet approval only once a costing study has been done. This study aims at calculating the additional cost to government of key elements of this programme. In September 2007 key stakeholders adopted the national plan for the second five-year-phase of implementation, April 2008 to March 2013. This is referred to as CLPA-2. The programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour (TECL) was, regarding its activities in South Africa during its first phase (2004‚Äì2008), essentially an executing agency for key elements of the Child Labour Programme of Action.  Background  The South African Constitution provides that children under 18 have a right to be protected from work that is exploitative, hazardous, inappropriate for their age, detrimental to their schooling, or detrimental to their social, physical, mental, spiritual, or moral development. The term 'work' is not limited to work in economic activities (e.g. paid employment) but includes chores or household activities in the child's household (such as collecting wood and fuel), where such work is exploitative, hazardous, inappropriate for their age, or detrimental to their development. The term 'child labour' as used in the Child Labour Programme of Action covers all these forms of child work. The labour department estimates that there were about one million of South Africa's children who are working as child labourers.Media statement, Department of Labour. South Africa has ratified the ILO Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (C138). This Convention requires ratifying states to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to progressively raise the minimum age for admission to employment or work. South Africa also assisted in drafting the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (C182), which it ratified in 2000. In terms of this convention South Africa must take time-bound measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour (WFCL). These include forms of bonded labour, commercial sexual exploitation of children, trafficking of children, and the use of children by others in illegal activities, including drug trafficking. Since 1996 the Government of South Africa has been involved in a process towards the formulation of appropriate policies and a national action programme to combat child labour. The Department of Labour is the lead department in the process. The South African Government has a wide range of existing programmes that are directly and indirectly improving the situation of children. Many are aimed at addressing poverty, for example, the public works programmes, the provision of basic infrastructure, access to basic services and the roll out of social grants that benefit children. The programmes are funded for the most part from the government budget. The Child Labour Programme of Action is intended to complement and strengthen the existing programmes where they are not adequately preventing child labour. The first step in the development of the South African programme was the establishment of a reliable and credible database on child work in the country. In 1999, Statistics South Africa conducted the first national household-based survey of child work in South Africa, the Survey of Activities of Young People (SAYP). In addition to the SAYP, as part of the development of the Child Labour programme of Action, all known qualitative research conducted within South Africa on areas relevant to this policy was reviewed. This review was used, in particular, to inform those elements of the policy that deal with forms of work and employment that survey methodologies cannot address and was published as Discussion document towards a National Child Labour Action Programme.Available from the Department of Labour website. The SAYP and review of qualitative research confirmed that South Africa does not seem to have as serious a problem in regard to child labour as some other countries. In particular, the extent of child labour in the formal sectors of the economy is limited. However, the SAYP also confirmed that there indeed are children in the country who are doing unacceptable amounts of work, or work of an unacceptable nature. South Africa clearly needs to address these if it is to fulfill its commitment in terms of the Constitution and international conventions. Addressing the problems sooner rather than later should also help to avoid their multiplying and becoming more serious and difficult to address in the future.  National consultations that led towards the Child Labour Programme of Action  Following the process of gathering information, the Government of South Africa began formulating appropriate policies and a national action programme to combat child labour. This was done through a process of extensive consultation with the South African public and engagement with key stakeholders. Stakeholders consulted included government departments, organised labour, organised business and relevant non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The consultation process included focus groups with affected children, who were asked about their experiences and subsequently asked for their opinion on proposed policy measures aimed at addressing their specific circumstances. Exercises were also conducted with children in grade seven in schools throughout the country. The consultative process has culminated in the drafting of a national CLAP for South Africa. The process of developing the Child Labour Programme of Action was overseen and guided by an inter-sectoral National Steering Committee involving key departments, employers' and workers organisations, NGOs and the community constituency of South Africa's NEDLAC (National Economic Development & Labour Council). The National Steering Committee was coordinated and chaired by the Department of Labour.  Guiding principles  The following principles were applied in the drafting of the Child Labour Programme of Action: *Need for prioritisation: Because of limited resources the programme identified the forms of child work that should be prioritised. These were identified primarily on the basis of the number of children involved and the degree of harm of particular forms of work. The country also needed to take action first, and urgently, on the worst forms of child labour identified in the Convention. *Learn from others where appropriate: South Africa has developed an indigenous programme that suits the local context, but has borrowed, where appropriate, best practices from other countries. It has also learnt from the mistakes of others. *The programme of action must be as realistic as possible, and take into account existing financial and human capacity and the extent to which capacity can be further developed within the time and resources available. *The programme must be sustainable. To achieve sustainability, it must be able to be funded from government funds after a possible initial injection of donor funds which the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has undertaken to help government access to assist with once-off expenditures that can kick-start ongoing, sustainable activities. *The programme must build on and fit in with existing programmes of government. The Child Labour Programme of Action identifies a wide range of activities falling within the mandates of a wide range of government departments and agencies. For each activity, the programme identifies the lead department as well as other departments and agencies, including non-governmental agencies, which would be involved. The views of the government agencies involved were canvassed during the formulation of the programme, and modifications introduced where necessary. Treasury's budget officers were also consulted to ensure that the proposals would mesh with budgetary plans. The majority of the activities making up the Child Labour Programme of Action already forms part of government policy. In these cases the programme confirms that these activities contribute to addressing child labour. Where appropriate, it proposes that implementation be strengthened. In some cases, the programme suggests a variation of an existing programme or policy which will allow it to combat child labour more effectively. Neither of the above two types of proposals will involve significant expenditure or other resources from government. In a few cases, the Child Labour Programme of Action proposes new activities, some of which will necessitate new expenditures. These are clearly identified in the programme document. For each activity ‚Äì whether existing, a variation of existing, or new ‚Äì the programme identifies whether once-off and ongoing costs will be minimal, moderate or significant. The Department of Labour will undertake a costing exercise regarding at least those items identified as being moderately or significantly costly.  Key elements  *Targeting the rollout of government and other stakeholders' programmes and policies on poverty, employment, labour and social matters more effectively in areas where the work that children do has serious negative effects on them; *Promoting new legislative measure against worst forms of child labour; *Strengthening of national capacity to enforce legislative measures; *Increasing public awareness and social mobilisation against the worst forms of child labour. Large-scale projects with significant financial demands and substantial human resource requirements have been avoided since they will not be realistic or sustainable. In a few cases, however, action steps have been included which may have significant cost implications. The most important of these is the proposed extension of the qualifying age for the Child Support Grant by 2006 from 13 years to the end of the school year the child turns 15 so as to avoid the current contradiction with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act prohibiting child work below that age, as well as the provisions on compulsory schooling. The programme also proposes a further roll out of the child support grant up to the age of 17 by 2008. This will encourage children to remain in school and so help to avoid children's engagement in hazardous works activities and other WFCL.

Biography  Bust of Cesare Battisti by Adolfo Wildt at the Bolzano Victory Monument He was born the son of a merchant at Trento, a city with a predominantly Italian- speaking population, which at the time was part of the Cisleithanian crown land of Tyrol in Austria-Hungary. Battisti attended the University of Florence, where he became a follower the Italian irredentism movement, aiming at the unification of his Trentino homeland with the Kingdom of Italy, though contrary to activists like Ettore Tolomei and Gabriele d'Annunzio he did not claim the predominantly German-speaking areas of South Tyrol up to the Brenner Pass. In 1899, he married Ernesta Bittanti in a civil ceremony. The couple had three sons. A journalist by profession and a member of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria, he was elected as a representative to the Tyrolean Landtag assembly at Innsbruck as well as to the Austrian Imperial Council (Reichsrat) at Vienna in 1911, where he vainly tried to obtain a status of autonomy for the Trentino region. Disgruntled by Austro-Hungarian attitudes to minorities in their empire, Battisti agreed to construct a military guide for the Italians to Austrian provinces that bordered Italy.Mark Thompson (2008) The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915-1919, Faber and Faber, London p98 When Austria-Hungary mobilised in August 1914, Battisti fled with his family to the Kingdom of Italy, where he held public meetings demanding Italy join the Triple Entente forces against Austria.Mark Thompson (2008) The White War: Life and Death on the Italian Front, 1915-1919, Faber and Faber, London p99 With Italy's entry into World War I following the 1915 London Pact, though still an Austrian citizen, Battisti fought against the Austro-Hungarian Army in the Alpini Corps at the Italian Front. Execution photo Battisti is remembered at Via Cesare Battisti near Piazza Venezia in Rome After the Battle of Asiago, he and his 2nd Lt Fabio Filzi were captured by the Austrian forces on 10 July 1916 and faced a court-martial in his hometown Trento at the Castello del Buonconsiglio, charged with high treason. Though Battisti officially enjoyed parliamentary immunity, he was sentenced to death by strangulation. He requested a military execution by firing squad so as to not dishonor the Italian Army uniform, but the judge denied his request and instead procured for him some shabby civilian clothes. Dressed in these, he was executed (hanged and garrotted) the same day, the brutality of which was increased by the fact that executioner botched the job so that Battisti actually was hanged twice. The smiling execution squad posed with his body for photographs, which when later published did severe damage to Austria's reputation. The author Karl Kraus applied a picture as frontispiece of his 1922 play Die letzten Tage der Menschheit (The Last Days of Mankind). Battisti is considered a national hero in Italy and several memorials were dedicated to him in Rome as well as in his hometown Trento and at the Bolzano Victory Monument. Both Trento and Bolzano had been under Austrian control until 1918.

Description Glassy-winged sharpshooter underside These sharpshooters are about in length. Their color is dark brown to black with black-and-yellow undersides, with yellow eyes, and the upper parts of the head and back are speckled with ivory or yellowish spots. The wings are transparent with reddish veins.APHIS. 2002. Glassy-winged Sharpshooter and Pierce's Disease in California They have piercing, sucking mouthparts and rows of fine spines on their hind legs. Distribution It is native to North America (northeastern Mexico), but it was accidentally introduced into Southern California in the early 1990s, probably with ornamental or agricultural stock. There it has become an agricultural pest especially to viticulture. Glassy-winged sharpshooters usually lay a mass of eggs on the underside of leaves, and they cover them with powdery white protective secretions kept in dry form (called \\"brochosomes\\") on the wings. After the nymphs hatch, the remaining egg mass leaves a brown mark on the leaf's surface. The nymphs feed within the vascular system of the small stems on the plant where the eggs were deposited. After several molts, the nymphs become adult glassy-winged sharpshooters. The glassy-winged sharpshooter feeds on a wide variety of plants. Scientists estimate the host plants for this sharpshooter include over 70 different plant species. Among the hosts are grapes, citrus trees, almonds, stone fruit, and oleanders. Because of the large number of hosts, glassy-winged sharpshooter populations are able to flourish in both agricultural and urban areas. They feed on a plant by inserting their needle-like mouth parts into the plant's xylem. While feeding, sharpshooters squirt small droplets of waste from the anus (filtered xylem fluid, basically water with trace solutes, especially carbohydrates), often called \\"leafhopper rain.\\" These droplets are messy and, when the water evaporates, leave a residue that gives plants and fruit a whitewashed appearance. Their feeding method, along with their voracious appetite for so many different hosts, makes glassy-winged sharpshooters an effective vector for the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium. Once the sharpshooter feeds on an infected plant, X. fastidiosa colonizes it by forming a biofilm on its mouth- parts. The sharpshooter then transmits the disease to additional plants while feeding. A plant that is not affected by any of the diseases caused by X. fastidiosa becomes a reservoir, holding the bacterium for other sharpshooters to pick up and carry to other plants. X. fastidiosa is linked to many plant diseases, including phoney peach disease in the southern United States, oleander leaf scorch and Pierce's disease in California, and citrus X disease in Brazil. Management Successful efforts using integrated pest management (IPM) of the glassy-winged sharpshooter include the use of insecticides, parasitoids (especially wasps in the family Mymaridae), and the impact of naturally occurring pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi. One of the newly discovered pathogens is a virus specific to sharpshooters. The leafhopper-infecting virus, Homalodisca coagulata virus-1 (HoCV-1, Dicistroviridae), has been shown to increase leafhopper mortality. The virus occurs in nature and is spread most readily at high population densities through contact among infected individuals, contact with virus-contaminated surfaces, and/or as an aerosol in leafhopper excreta. One of the most successful biocontrol efforts has been the mass rearing and release of four different leafhopper parasitoids (in the mymarid genus Gonatocerus), which have been very successful in reducing the number of eggs that survive. The traditional means of insect management, such as scouting and land owner reports of leafhopper presence, followed by highly focused insecticide treatments, have also been of great value in reducing leafhopper numbers; all of these impacts have produced a system wherein reasonable, environmentally sound management of this insect pest is being maintained.

Joseph Martin, Jr. (1740‚Äì1808) was a brigadier general in the Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War, in which Martin's frontier diplomacy with the Cherokee people is credited with not only averting Indian attacks on the Scotch-Irish American and English American settlers who helped win the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, but with also helping to keep the Indians' position neutral and from siding with the British troops during those crucial battles. Historians agree that the settlers' success at these two battles signaled the turning of the tide of the Revolutionary War‚Äîin favor of the Americans. Martin was born in Caroline County, Virginia, and later lived at Albemarle County and then at Henry County, Virginia, at his plantation, Belmont, on Leatherwood Creek in Martinsville, not far from the plantation of his friend Governor Patrick Henry, Leatherwood Plantation. General Martin held many positions during his public life. As a very young man he first tried his hand at farming, next he worked for three years as an overseer on the huge plantation of his local Virginia kin, next he was a longhunter, and an explorer on the frontier for friend Patrick Henry, then an early pioneer and builder of Martin's Station in the \\"wild west,\\" a surveyor of the KY/NC and TN/VA borders, an Indian agent/Indian fighter for Patrick Henry, a member at peace treaties with the Indians, and along with Dr. Thomas Walker, Joseph Martin named the Cumberland region and the Cumberland River, he served as a member of the legislatures of Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina, he was lifelong friends with Gen. Thomas Sumter, he was also friends and brothers-in-law with Col. Benjamin Cleveland (both married Graves sisters), he was unsuccessfully nominated by Patrick Henry to the position of the first governor of the Southwest Territory, was the holder of some 80,000 acres across the Southeastern U.S. at one point. The city of Martinsville, Virginia, was named in his honor during his lifetime. Early life Historic marker for Martinsville, Virginia, named for Joseph Martin The son of planter Capt. Joseph Martin Sr. and his wife Susannah Chiles, great-granddaughter of Colonel John Page, Joseph Martin Jr. was raised in a Virginia gentry family in Caroline and Albemarle Counties. His father, Joseph Martin Sr., was the son of wealthy British merchant William Martin in Bristol, England, who sent his son to Virginia as supercargo aboard his ship the Brice. Martin Sr. wrote to his English father that he planned to marry the daughter of a common Virginia colonist. Even though she was from the Chiles family and was a descendant of Virginia's Col. John Page, to Martin's wealthy father back in England all American colonists were inferior to the English. William Martin of Bristol was himself Lord Mayor of Bristol and owner of a ship building company, a glass manufacturing plant, importer and exporter with the new world; including tobacco. The father wrote back disinheriting young Joseph Martin Sr., who never returned to England. Joseph Martin Sr. was \\"a perfect Englishman\\", recalled his grandson later, \\"large and athletic; bold, daring, self-willed and supercilious. And in him was depicted, as my father has told me, the most complete form of the aristocracy of the British government.\\" Capt. Martin arrived in Albemarle County in 1745, one of the original patentees. Joseph Martin Sr. left some 300 acres of his landholdings to son Joseph Jr. at his death in 1762. Nearby neighbors Dr. Thomas Walker, Peter Jefferson, James Madison, and the Lewis and Clark clans and kin including Lewis, Carr, Waller, Dabney, Hammock, Hughes, etc. But Joseph Martin Jr., the son of the English immigrant, was not cut out for a Virginia gentry planter's life. \\"Gambling was a favorite pastime.\\" Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, in his accounts of his father's life in the, \\"Lyman Draper Manuscript Collection,\\" writes that although his father gambled, he was not much of a drinker and let his son in on his secret; Martin sometimes pretended to over-drink so he might appear to be drunk in order that fellow gamblers would let down their guard. As a youth, Joseph Martin ran off from an apprenticeship during the French and Indian War of 1756, and joined the army at Fort Pitt, where he served alongside another Virginia youth, Thomas Sumter. Following his early army service, Martin lit out for the rigors of the frontier, where he dressed in buckskin and was an early real estate speculator, trapper and fur trader and Indian fighter. But this time on the frontier was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... some of which were written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to paint a picture of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many things in his lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that he was far from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer. Among Martin's earliest excursions on the frontier was one made on behalf of family friend Dr. Thomas Walker. Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, describes the naming of the area and the river in a letter to historian Lyman Draper, \\"A treaty with the Cherokees was held at Fort Chiswell, Virginia on New River, then a frontier. On the return of the chiefs home, Dr.[Thomas] Walker, a gentleman of distinction, and my father, [General] Joseph Martin, accompanied them. The Indians being guides, they passed through the place now called Cumberland Gap, where they discovered a fine spring. They still had a little rum remaining, and they drank to the health of the Duke of Cumberland. This gave rise to the name of Cumberland Mountain and Cumberland River.\\" In 1769, Martin journeyed to Powell's Valley to attempt a settlement, a full ahead of any previous settlement. Martin and his party ‚Äì which included his brother Brice and Mordecai Hord ‚Äì had hoped to secure the granted to Dr. Walker and themselves. Martin's Creek in the region where Joseph Martin attempted his settlement is today named for him. (Martin's Station, as the settlement was known, became a well-known stopover for westward-bound settlers for many years.A Short History of Martin's Station, Wilderness Road State Park, martinsstation.com ) The settlement ultimately failed, which some historians have blamed on the inability of the Loyal Company to defend its title to the tract. But in the foray to Powell's Valley, Martin had established his credentials as a hard-bitten explorer. Daniel Boone and his party of explorers were stunned in 1769 when, upon their arrival in Powell's Valley, they discovered that Martin and his 20-man party had beaten them there. It was beyond the farthest reaches that Boone and his long hunters had explored. Following Martin's feat, the Albemarle County native became a force to be reckoned with in exploration circles, even though Martin's settlement was soon broken up by the Cherokees, who pushed back against the westernmost settlement yet attempted. By 1775, when North Carolina merchant Richard Henderson purchased an immense tract of land from the Cherokees to found the short-lived Transylvania colony, in what is today Kentucky, Henderson turned to Martin as his agent in Powell's Valley. It was one of several such roles that the explorer, accustomed to trapping, longhunting and traveling in the Appalachian wilderness inhabited by the Cherokee, would hold over the years. Martin's Station General Joseph Martin, Jr. (1740‚Äì1808), born Caroline County, Virginia, died Henry County, Virginia. Memorial to General Joseph Martin and settlers at Martin's Station, Virginia. Photograph courtesy of dmott9. Martin's Station stood along the Wilderness Trail near Rose Hill, Virginia. The first fort was built in 1769, but Martin's party were attacked by the local Native Americans. He returned a few years later in 1775 and built a new \\"Martin's station\\". Again he was attacked by the Indians and had to leave. Moving closer to the Cumberland Gap, he built another new \\"Martin's Station\\", his third, in 1783. The small fort provided protection plus supplies for hunters and immigrant families moving into Kentucky. He was able to finally sell his fort and lands in Powell County, Kentucky in 1788, and moved back to the town in Henry County, Virginia, that would soon be renamed in his honor: Martinsville. A \\"fourth\\" Martin's Station was recently constructed at the Wilderness Road State Park. \\"Builders of the hand-hewn log replica, constructed in 2002, used only the kinds of tools that Martin would have used in the wild frontier in the later 1700s. Workers carted logs into the construction site with oxen and then used ropes and horses to set those logs in place. At times, reenactors came on the scene and made the construction yet more authentic by staging spontaneous Indian attacks.\\"Tennis, Joe.

In 1774 he came to Henry County, established himself at Belle Monte on Leatherwood Creek, for nine years sat for his district in the general assembly, and in 1793 was made a brigadier general of state militia. He was a brawny, picturesque man, more than six feet tall and the father of 18 children; wore buckled knee breeches and a great beard, braided and thrust inside his shirt.\\" Martin first married Sarah Lucas in Orange County, Virginia. After her death in Henry County, Martin married Susannah Graves, a descendant of Captain Thomas Graves. Susannah Graves, of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, the wife of Joseph Martin, and her second cousin Mary Graves, who was married to Benjamin Cleveland, Susannah Graves was the daughter of William Graves and Mary unk, Mary was the daughter of Joseph Graves and Sarah Bunyard. Both are direct descendants of Thomas Graves and Anna Davenport, common ancestor, is Capt. Thomas Graves. [Ref; Wills of Joseph Graves and Thomas Graves]. While married to Sarah Lucas and then to Susannah Graves, Martin was simultaneously married to his half-Cherokee wife, Elizabeth Ward, the daughter of Nancy Ward, a power within the Cherokee tribes, and her husband, English trapper Bryan Ward. The polygamous relationship, justified by Martin as common practice among frontiersmen operating among the tribes, caused considerable consternation to General Martin's son, Col. William Martin. Joseph Martin and Betsy Ward had two children. (Joseph Martin's son by his Cherokee wife was educated in Virginia schools, but afterwards elected to return to the Cherokee.) On November 3, 1777, Martin was commissioned by Governor Patrick Henry as Agent and Superintendent for Indian Affairs for the State of Virginia. (Martin served in the same capacity with the state of North Carolina from 1783 to 1789.) Gov. Henry instructed Martin that he was \\"to reside at some place in that Nation in order to negotiate and direct all things relating to the Commonwealth and which concern the interest thereof, using your best endeavors from time to time to preserve peace with that Nation and to cultivate their present good Disposition.\\" It was an appointment Martin would continue to hold until 1789.An Unsung Hero of the Virginia Frontier, Dr. William Allen Pusey, The Filson Club, February 3, 1936, geocities.com During his time on the frontier, Martin became acquainted at an early age with two other Revolutionary War patriots and frontiersmen: Benjamin Cleveland, who was his brother-in-law, [They were not related, just lifetime friends. Susannah Graves, the wife of Joseph Martin and Mary Graves the wife of Benjamin Cleveland were second cousins, common ancestor Capt. Thomas Graves. <\\\\ref> Wills of Joseph Graves, Thomas Graves and Benjamin Graves. Grace S. Green] Cleveland having married the sister of Susannah Graves; and Thomas Sumter, who had been a companion of Martin's during his early adventures on the frontier. Both men were fellow Virginia natives who struck out for the wilds, and both were ardent patriots. During the Revolutionary War it was the efforts of Joseph Martin (then a Major) that helped prevent the Overhill Cherokee from launching widespread attacks on American colonists, which Loyalist agents had attempted to incite. Following the British capture of Savannah and Augusta, Georgia in 1778‚Äì1779, English goods made their way to the Cherokee on the Savannah River, prompting some tribesmen to rejoin the English cause. Martin's diplomacy with the Cherokees in 1780‚Äì81, wrote the American Historical Association, enabled the Continental Army to achieve victory over the English at the Battle of Kings Mountain, thus hastening the end of the conflict. On the eve of the Battle of Guilford Court House, in February 1781, General Nathanael Greene wrote Martin and seven other officers ‚Äì including John Sevier, Arthur Campbell, and William Christian ‚Äì appointing them agents to treat with the Cherokees and Chicasaws \\"to afford the Said Tribes of Indians every mark of our good disposition towards them.\\" Foremost in Greene's thinking, apparently, was keeping the Indians on the sidelines as the Continental Army and its militia forces fought the British in the last days of the war. Greene was probably mindful of previous British attempts at sending large quantities of ammunition, weapons, horses, cash and goods to their Indian allies through their Florida redoubts. At the same time ‚Äì and complicating Martin's legacy ‚Äì Martin and his sons were prime movers behind the settlement of Tennessee by removing obdurate Cherokees from the territory. By the end of the Revolution, Martin's place as chief colonial Indian agent seemed secure. In January 1780, Virginia governor Thomas Jefferson directed Martin to negotiate with the Cherokees to secure land around a new fort being overseen by General George Rogers Clark at the mouth of the Ohio River (Fort Jefferson). In the fall of 1783, the State of Virginia built a new fort at the Cumberland Gap, replacing an older fort which was adjudged to lie within the boundaries of North Carolina. The new Virginia fort was designed as the primary residence for Martin while he was in the region on official business. And in 1784, Thomas Jefferson directed Martin to use his connections with the Cherokees to negotiate for more land between the Carolinas and the Mississippi to establish American sovereignty over the region. Later, in a twist overlooked by most historians, Martin corresponded with Alexander McGillivray, the leader of the Creek Indians, who had Loyalist sentiments. In 1788 a letter from Martin to McGillivray was intercepted in which Martin professed to be interested in settling abroad. When the letter was discovered, the North Carolina General Assembly launched an investigation into Martin's conduct. But he was later exonerated when it turned out that he was acting as a spy on Patrick Henry's instructions to ferret out the nature of McGillivray's ties to the Spanish, who were then active in Florida. Payroll of Continental Army forces in Washington County, Virginia, handwritten by Capt. Joseph Martin Jr., 1777 \\"General Martin's conduct so far as I could discern in that affair was really praise-worthy,\\" Henry wrote to United States Senator from Virginia Richard Henry Lee. \\"He [Martin] frequently gave me Intelligence of Creek Indian affairs, and of the intercourse between other Indians and the Spaniards that was interesting. General Martin and Governor Patrick Henry kept a long- running correspondence through the years, some of which concerned real estate speculation. Other letters recounted Martin's dealings with the Indian tribes, as well as settlement efforts in Tennessee. As late as 1790, Patrick Henry wrote Joseph Martin concerning a real estate investment, holding out that the hope, Henry noted, that Martin might finally capitalize on his long service to Virginia. \\"After all the Hazards you have run,\\" Henry wrote, \\"that you have not acquired so much property as many others would have done in your situation, I was desirous to throw something in your way by which some fine lands would have been offered to you in our purchase.\\" Career as an Indian agent Henry Lee discussing Powell Valley, ca 1791 Ultimately, General Martin lost his appointment as chief Indian agent. Martin's \\"manner of treating with the Indians necessarily prevented his appointment,\\" Senator Richard Henry Lee informed Patrick Henry in September 1789. \\"At present no such office as a standing Indian agent is appointed. The Government of the Western Territory is charged with such affairs.\\" In some quarters Martin was seen as too lenient with the Indians, especially after an incident in 1786 when several young Cherokee warriors were said to have murdered two white settlers near Clinch Mountain. The killings set off calls for retribution within the secessionist State of Franklin, and Martin found himself trying to mediate the dispute, and calm the settlers, while trying to prevent the angry Cherokees from joining with the Creeks. Martin did little to disguise his contempt for the authorities of the State of Franklin, who, Martin wrote Henry, \\"immediately marched into the above mentioned Town, where they killed one Young [Indian] woman, and Shot Several others.\\" But Martin himself had not hesitated to wield military power against the Cherokees, especially when they killed several colonists at the instigation of Loyalist and English agents during the Revolution. In 1781, following a running battle between Indian forces and those of the colonists, Colonel Arthur Campbell, Lieutenant Colonel John Sevier and Martin addressed a letter to the Indian chiefs, warning them about their actions. \\"You know you began the war,\\" the bulletin began, \\"by listening to the bad councils of the King of England and the falsehoods told you by his agents.\\" Further hostilities, the three colonial leaders warned, would result in a military campaign against the Indian villages. Seven years later, in 1788, Martin again fought the Overmountain Cherokee, as well as the Chickamauga Cherokee, in a battle at Lookout Mountain, during the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars. But having eventually struck a hard-won peace with the tribes, Martin bridled at the actions of the State of Franklin. Henry empathized with Martin, writing the General in May 1785 that \\"the disorderly behavior of the Franklin people, as they call themselves, gives me concern. If they will not be subservient to the Rules and Regulations respecting Indian affairs, which prevail in all the States, they must expect none of the advantages of the Union.\\" \\"Partisans of the State in N[orth] Carolina afterwards found him obnoxious to their views,\\" former Governor Henry wrote Virginia Senator William Grayson in urging Martin's reappointment in 1789, \\"and as I believe often endangered his Life For his duty called him to discourage their Disorderly conduct [and] thwart their favorite Schemes.\\" Henry then commended Martin for his efforts to impose restraints upon the actions of the State of Franklin settlers, whose \\"frequent Butcherys of Indians & Refinement in cruelty sufficiently characterize these people who are Mr Martins decided Foes.\\" Happy While United, bronze medals struck by State of Virginia in 1780, carried by Martin for distribution to Cherokee allies of Virginia colonists fighting British rule Martin's attempts to restrain the State of Franklin settlers from a more-belligerent course made Martin unacceptable in some quarters, where he was seen as too 'soft' on the tribesmen. Martin also became controversial in some quarters after the Treaty of Hopewell in 1785, when Martin, Andrew Pickens and Benjamin Hawkins, acting as government agents, concluded treaties with the Cherokees and the Choctaws. The Cherokee treaty particularly engendered later enmity from the Indian signatories, as well as the colonial state governments. The Indians saw the treaty as a thinly-veiled land grab, and the state governments saw the treaty as an attempt to encroach on local government authority, and attempts were made in Congress to void it. \\"No action of Martin's life brought down on him more condemnation than this [the Hopewell Treaty],\\" wrote historian Stephen B. Weeks of the incident. Consequently, his appointment as agent was not renewed, despite Henry's repeated entreaties to political allies for Martin's reinstatement. (In a 1789 letter to Senator William Grayson, Henry reminded his political ally that Martin had been so effective in his Indian dealings during the Revolutionary War that British agents had offered rewards to their Indian allies for Martin's scalp.) But the forces allied against Martin overwhelmed Henry's defense, and in 1789, his career as Indian agent finished, General Martin sold his large holdings in the Powell's Valley and near Cumberland Gap and returned to his lands in Henry County next door to Henry's to spend the rest of his life. A year later, in 1790, when the governorship of the Southwest Territory opened up, Patrick Henry suggested Gen. Martin, along with George Mason, for the job, but both were passed over in favor of William Blount. Letter from George Washington to Georgia Governor George Walton expressing Washington's disapproval of Martin's performance as agent for the Cherokee, 1789 Later Judgments on Martin's career as an Indian agent have been mixed. Writing in 1894, Theodore Roosevelt called Martin \\"a firm friend of the red race, [who] had earnestly striven to secure justice for them.\\" Legislative service In his peripatetic life on the frontier, Martin was called upon to serve in the legislatures of several states. He served as a member of the North Carolina Convention called to approve the United States Constitution, and served several times in the North Carolina General Assembly. Martin was subsequently elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, until he finally chose to retire because of advanced age. (In 1787 the North Carolina assembly chose Martin as Brigadier General of the Washington District.) During his time in the Virginia legislature, Martin was one of the primary supporters of James Madison's Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. During his military service in Georgia, Martin was elected to the Georgia legislature in 1783. Martin was also initially a member of the Watauga Association, which supported the founding of the State of Franklin. Martin subsequently resigned his membership when he saw that it might compromise his role as Indian agent. In 1799, Martin and his old friend Major John Redd of Henry County served as the two county representatives on the Virginia commission relating to the Alien and Sedition Acts. Family life, legacy, and descendants Gen. Joseph Martin, Jr.'s first wife was Sarah Lucas. They were both born in Virginia and together had seven children, including Revolutionary War officer, Col. William L. Martin, who eventually moved to Smith County, in Middle Tennessee. After Sarah Lucas Martin's death, Joseph Martin, Jr. married Susannah Graves in Henry County, Virginia. They had 11 children, all of whom were born in Virginia, including: Col. Joseph Martin of Henry County, Va. He was one of five of Gen. Martin's sons who served in the War of 1812. Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Patrick Henry Martin. He was a young, trained lawyer, and died a bachelor on his trip home after the war. He was named in honor of Gen. Martin's friend and neighbor, Governor Patrick Henry. Gen. Martin's son, Capt. Lewis Graves Martin, also a veteran of the War of 1812, moved from Henry County, Virginia to Rutherford/Cannon County in Middle Tennessee, in 1816, where he married Belinda Rucker (daughter of Gideon Rucker, Sr. & Joyce Reade; both of whom were born in Va. and moved to Middle Tennessee). They had a large family before Belinda's death in the late 1830s. Capt. Lewis G. Martin remarried and removed to Missouri in 1840. Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Thomas Martin. He also moved to Middle Tennessee where he married Georgia Carr (daughter of Dabney Carr). Alexander Martin, another son and veteran of the War of 1812, also moved to Middle Tennessee. He married Elizabeth Carr (daughter of John Fyndall Carr, also a Tennessean from Virginia), and after some years, moved to Missouri. Another son of Gen. Martin and Susannah Graves was Esq. Judge John C. Martin, who also moved to Middle Tennessee in the days following the War of 1812, where he became a judge and chairman of the Cannon County courts, and served five terms as county executive. He was also responsible for the construction of the original Cannon County court house, erected in 1830. He married Sophia Rucker, sister to his brother Lewis' wife, Belinda. Other children of Gen. Martin include: George Martin (1763 - 1799), Martha Martin Cleveland, Elizabeth Martin Waller (1768 - 1805), Brice Martin (1770 - 1856), Jesse Martin (1786 - 1836), and Susan Martin King (1799 - 1867). Gen. Martin also had two children with his half-Cherokee, common law wife (\\"frontier wife\\"), Elizabeth Ward, daughter of frontiersman Bryant Ward and his wife Nancy, \\"the beloved woman of the Cherokee.\\" One of their children may have been Nancy Martin Hildebrand (1778 - 1837). The Native Indian connection of two members of the Martin family has created some confusion for some Martin genealogy researchers; Gen. Joseph Martin's brother, Capt. John \\"Jack\\" Calvin Martin, Sr., of his N.C. Rock House Plantation, a.k.a. Rock Castle Plantation, is often confused with his brother Gen. Joseph Martin. Capt. John \\"Jack\\" Martin, Sr. moved from Virginia to N.C. with his brother William Martin, Sr.. In N.C. Capt. John \\"Jack\\" Martin, Sr. married a Miss Emory, who was half Native American. She died early in their marriage. Her widower, \\"Jack,\\" then married her sister, a second Miss Emory. This same Capt. John \\"Jack\\" Martin, Sr. and his Emory wife were the parents of a John Calvin Martin, Jr. who served as a judge on the supreme court of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, although he was only 1/4 Cherokee. This Oklahoma judge was the older cousin of the Tennessee judge of the same name; the son of Gen. Joseph Martin and wife Susannah Graves, as mentioned earlier; Esq. Judge, John C. Martin of Tennessee. There were two Martin cousins with the same name who both served as judges. Although they were born many miles and many years apart, their identities are sometimes confused by modern researchers looking at the names alone. Another brother of Gen. Joseph Martin, William Martin, Sr., was the father of Gen. William \\"Buck\\" Martin, Jr., who served in the War of 1812 on Andrew Jackson's staff. Gen. Martin, after helping adjudicate the western boundary line between North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia as far as the Cumberland Mountains, retired to his plantation Belmont on Leatherwood Creek, which he had purchased in 1796 from Benjamin Harrison V of Berkeley Plantation, which was originally built by a Capt. John Martin who was possibly the great-uncle of General Joseph Martin. General Joseph Martin died at his plantation on December 18, 1808, and was buried there in the family cemetery.The Martin Family Cemetery on Belmont(e) Plantation, geocities.com Buried in the family graveyard are three other Joseph Martins: Colonel Joseph Martin, son of the general, his son Joseph, and his grandson Joseph, who lived at Greenwood plantation.Col. William Martin, son of General Joseph Martin Initially known as Henry Courthouse, the town of Martinsville, Virginia, was later renamed in honor of this early soldier, planter, pioneer, and real estate speculator. For many years afterwards, General Martin remained an obscure figure, until Lyman Draper began collecting reminiscences about him, including those of Major John Redd, a prominent Henry County planter who served under Martin, and who also wrote about his early recollections of General Nathanael Greene, George Rogers Clark, Daniel Boone, Col. Benjamin Cleveland, Dr. John Walker, and other early prominent Virginia figures. Martin's descendants include his second eldest son Col. William Martin, Tennessee pioneer, and member of the South Carolina and Georgia legislatures; son Col. Joseph Martin, member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Virginia State Senate and the Virginia Constitutional Convention 1829‚Äì1830; daughter Martha Martin, who was the 1st wife of William Cleveland, son of John (Preacher John) Cleveland, Jr., brother of Benjamin Cleveland, hero of the Battle of King's Mountain; William Cleveland was a nephew of Benjamin Cleveland; son Major Brice Martin, Tennessee pioneer and surveyor in 1801 of the disputed boundary between Virginia and Tennessee;. Other descendants: Dr. Jesse Martin Shackelford, founder of Martinsville's Shackelford Hospital, later Martinsville Memorial; Judge Nicholas H. Hairston of Roanoke.; United States Senator from Virginia Thomas Staples Martin from Charlottesville, Virginia.; Judge John Dillard of the North Carolina Supreme Court; American theologian and Biblical Greek scholar Archibald Thomas Robertson.; Alabama Governors Joshua L. Martin, Gabriel Moore, John A. Winston, and Charles Henderson; as well as Alfred M. Scales, Confederate General in the Civil War, and subsequently Governor of North Carolina. Also descended from Martin was Henry Smith Pritchett, an educator born in Missouri who served as president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Toby's freedom General Joseph Martin, Jr. owned a slave named 'Toby' from the time Toby was about 25 years old, and in his letters to historian Lyman Draper, Martin's son Col. William Martin told Draper that Toby, \\"a bright mulatto, a little under middle stature, of great physical powers, as well as mental\\" had served his father for many years and had distinguished himself in several battles. It was General Martin's intention, noted his son, that Toby be freed at Joseph Martin's death, but the General died intestate. Taking note of the General's affection for his longtime servant, as well as the Martin's family members' sentiments toward Martin's constant companion, the family elected \\"by mutual consent\\" to leave Toby out of the inventory of General Martin's estate, and Toby \\"has ever since been free, and has made himself a good estate.\\" In his letter to Draper, Col. William Martin calls the freed slave \\"my fine old brother Toby.\\" Recent monument On June 27‚Äì29, 2008, 200 descendants of General Joseph Martin gathered in the city named for him to unveil a monument in his honor, at the Gen. Joseph Martin, Jr. Bicentennial Celebration. See also Greenwood, built by Col.

Background Following the Battle of Shanghai of 1937, the cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe pushed for a quick and diplomatic settlement to the war in China, and not an expensive and long-term occupation. Furthermore, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters was not keen to permit a repeat of the political experimentation undertaken by the Kwangtung Army in the establishment of Manchukuo, and pressured the Japanese Central China Area Army to establish a collaborationist local government to handle the details of local administration for the Shanghai metropolitan area. In November 1937, a number of well-known residents were approached to take over provisional civilian administration of the city. Eventually, the Japanese were able to secure the assistance of Fu Xiao'an, the wealthy director of the Chinese Bank of Commerce and head of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Fu was a personal and political enemy of Nationalist general Chiang Kai-shek and had been imprisoned by the Kuomintang in 1927 for refusing to lend Chiang money. After his release from prison, he fled to Japanese-held Manchuria, and lived several years under Japanese protection, nursing his hatred for Chiang.Henriot, In the Shadow of the Rising Sun: Shanghai under Japanese Occupation, pp 145-167 However, Fu was unwilling to head the new government himself, and recommended Su Xiwen, a professor of religious philosophy and political science at the Chizhi University in Jiangwan. Su was a graduate of Waseda University in Tokyo and was known for his conservative political views. Su was also known for his views on Buddhist- Daoist syncretism, which influenced the name of the new administration--the \\"Great Way\\" referring to Eastern philosophy's concept of the Tao--and its flag: the yin-yang symbol of Daoism on a yellow background. (The colors yellow, gold, and saffron are often associated with Buddhism.)Wakeman, The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941, pp 9-12 History The new government quickly made efforts to restore the city's public services and established a police force under the command of Zhang Songlin, former commander of the Jiangsu provincial police, to maintain public order. Funding was provided by a tax levied on all imports and exports through the Japanese front lines into and out of Shanghai, and Su was assisted by a number of experts provided by the South Manchurian Railroad Company. Su promised to purge the city of both communist and Kuomintang elements. However, neither Su nor his Great Way Government were regarded seriously by Japanese political agents, who looked with dismay and contempt at the assortment of criminals, religious cultists, and narcotics dealers who gravitated to leading positions in the new administration. The promised public works failed to materialize as Su's cronies siphoned off funds, and the propaganda value of the new administration quickly deteriorated. In December 1937, the Japanese brought in a tough northern Chinese collaborator named Wang Zihui to oversee operations as a temporary measure. After Liang Hongzhi established the Reformed Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing in March 1938, the Japanese Central China Area Army organized a number of public rallies and ceremonies in support. In less than a month, the Reformed Government asserted its authority over the Great Way Government by establishing a Supervisory Yamen to take over the functions of the Shanghai municipal administration. Su Xiwen formally recognized the Reform Government and adopting its flag on May 3, 1938. Under the Reformed Government, Su Xiwen continued as head of the Supervisory Yamen until he was replaced by Fu Xiao'an as mayor on October 16, 1938.

He is remembered as the leader of the Penruddock uprising in 1655. The Sealed Knot had planned an insurrection for March 1655. There were plans to seize Salisbury, Newcastle, York and Winchester and to instigate smaller uprisings in Nottinghamshire and Cheshire. As the New Model Army garrison in Winchester was reinforced shortly before the uprising, plans to attack it were abandoned. No men answered the call in Cheshire, but elsewhere risings did take place. Due to a lack of support, however, the Royalists disbanded without a fight at all the locations except Salisbury. Penruddock, along with Sir Joseph Wagstaffe and Hugh Grove, organised and led the Royalist uprising in the West. On 11 March, Penruddock, with between three hundred and four hundred other Cavaliers, took Salisbury and raised the Royal Standard. The next morning, leading his followers out of Salisbury, Penruddock headed westwards through Blandford, Sherborne and Yeovil, hoping to pick up more supporters. By 14 March, his group had reached South Molton in Devon, where, after a three-hour street fight, it was defeated by a single New Model Army troop of horse under Captain Unton Crook. Crook captured Penruddock and the other ringleaders, while most of the other Royalists either fled or were killed. For his part in the rebellion, Penruddock, along with Hugh Grove and Francis Jones, was beheaded at Exeter in May 1655. Some of the other Royalists who took part were also executed, while seventy were shipped to the West Indies and sold as indentured labour. Wagstaffe escaped. Penruddock was married to Arundel Freke, the daughter of John Freke, Esq., of Shrewton, Dorset. They had two sons, George and Thomas, and four daughters, Elizabeth, Joan, Mary, and Anne. Penruddock succeeded his father, Sir John Penruddocke of Compton Chamberlayne, in 1648. His elder son, George, died in 1664, and he was thus succeeded in his estates by his younger son, Thomas Penruddocke (c. 1648‚Äì1695), later member of parliament for Wilton.

A pantomime cartoon carries no caption. In some cases, dialogue may appear in speech balloons, following the common convention of comic strips. As the name implies--\\"gag\\" being a show business term for a comedic idea--these cartoons are most often intended to provoke laughter. Popular magazines that have featured gag cartoons include Punch, The New Yorker and Playboy. Some publications, such as Humorama, have used cartoons as the main focus of the magazine, rather than articles and fiction. Captions Captions are usually concise, to fit on a single line. Gag cartoons of the 1930s and earlier occasionally had lengthy captions, sometimes featuring dialogue between two characters depicted in the drawing; over time, cartoon captions became shorter. Media In the mid-1950s, gag cartoonists found a new market with the introduction of highly popular studio cards in college bookstores. Single-panel cartoons have been published on various products, such as coffee mugs and cocktail napkins. Traditionally, newspapers and magazines printed cartoons in black and white, but this changed in the 1950s when Playboy began to feature full-page, full- color cartoons in every issue. There are numerous collections of cartoons in both paperback and hardcover, notably The New Yorker collections.

He is the god of meeting. Pushan was responsible for marriages, journeys, roads, and the feeding of cattle. He was a psychopomp (soul guide), conducting souls to the other world. He protected travelers from bandits and wild beasts, and protected men from being exploited by other men. He was a supportive guide, a \\"good\\" god, leading his adherents towards rich pastures and wealth. He carried a golden lance, a symbol of activity. Etymology Traditionally, the name of the deity is said to be derived from Sanskrit verb, p≈´·π£yati, which means \\"to cause to thrive\\". This, however, is probably a folk etymology. Many modern scholars consider Pushan to be derived from the reconstructed Proto-Indo- European god *P√©h‚ÇÇus≈çn, which would thereby make Pushan a cognate of the Greek god Pan. The connection between Pan and Pushan was first proposed by the German scholar Hermann Collitz in 1924.H. Collitz, \\"Wodan, Hermes und Pushan,\\" Festskrift till√§gnad Hugo Pipping p»ß hans sextio»ßrsdag den 5 November 1924 1924, pp 574‚Äì587. In the Vedas Ten hymns in the Rigveda are dedicated to P≈´·π£an (including one jointly to Soma and P≈´·π£an and another to Indra and P≈´·π£an).Rigveda I.42, I.138, II.40 (to Soma and P≈´·π£an), VI.53, VI.54, VI.55, VI.56, VI.57 (to Indra and P≈´·π£an), VI.58 and X.26. Links direct to the 1896 English translation by Ralph T. H. Griffith on sacred-texts.com, which also hosts a Sanskrit version of each hymn. Some of these hymns appeal to him to guard livestock and find lost livestock. His chariot is pulled by goats. Sometimes he is described as driving the Sun in its course across the sky. He seems to represent the sun as a guardian of flocks and herds. Pushan is also regarded as Kavi, who in turn became an epiphet of a number of gods and further a title signifying \\"king\\". According to a narrative found in the Taittiriya Samhita, Rudra was excluded from the Daksha yajna, an important sacrifice in honor of various deities. He, in anger, pierced the sacrifice with an arrow and Pushan broke his teeth as he attempted to eat a part of the oblation. The later versions of this narrative are found in the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Puranas. In these versions, Rudra (or Shiva) was angry because his father-in-law, Daksha, the sacrificer, did not invite him. Shiva, in anger, kicked Pushan and knocked out his teeth as he was eating the oblation. In the Puranic versions, Virabhadra, created by Shiva from a lock of his matted hair, knocked out Pushan's teeth. In the Puranas In the Puranas, Pushan is described as one of the twelve Adityas (Aditi's sons). Aditi's other eleven sons as narrated in Puranas are Surya, Aryama, Tvashta, Savita, Bhaga, Dhata, Vidhata, Varuna, Mitra, Indra and Vishnu (in the form of Vamanadeva).

The rising There were plans to seize Salisbury, Newcastle, York and Winchester and instigate smaller uprisings in Nottinghamshire and Cheshire. The New Model Army garrison in Winchester was reinforced shortly before the uprising so plans to attack it were abandoned. No men answered the call in Cheshire, but risings did take place in the other places. However, at all of the locations except Salisbury, the Royalists disbanded without a fight due to lack of support. The York uprising, the rendezvous point for which was on Marston Moor, was notable for the presence of the Earl of Rochester who had travelled from the exiled court of Charles II to take part. The rising was put down by Colonel Robert Lilburne, Governor of York, and on its failure Rochester fled the country. Colonel John Penruddock along with Sir Joseph Wagstaffe organised and led the Royalist uprising in the West. On 11 March Penruddock, with between 300 and 400 other Cavaliers, took Salisbury and raised the Royal standard. The next morning he led his followers out of Salisbury, heading west through Blandford, Sherborne and Yeovil in the hope of picking up more supporters, but a single troop of horse of the New Model Army under Captain Unton Croke defeated them after a three-hour street fight in South Molton in Devon on 14 March. Most of the Royalists either fled or were killed but Croke captured Penruddock and the other ringleaders. Oliver Cromwell appointed the judge Sir Hugh Wyndham to the commission of oyer and terminer charged with dealing with the Penruddock uprising. Trials Trials of the leading insurgents for high treason were held at Exeter on 18 April 1655. The first was against Penruddock, Hugh Grove, Richard Reeves of Kimpton, gent, brothers Robert and George Duke of Stuckton, gents, Francis Jones of Beddington, gent, Francis Bennett of Killington, gent, Thomas Fitzjames of Hanley, gent, Edward Davy of London, gent, and Thomas Poulton of Pewsey, innkeeper, all of whom were convicted except Bennett. The second bill named Edward Willis, innkeeper of New Sarum, Nicholas Mussell of Steeple Langford, yeoman, William Jenkins of Fordingbridge, gent, Thomas Hillard of Upton, yeoman, William Stroud of Wincanton, gent, Robert Harris of Stanford, cordwainer, John Bibby of Compton Chamberlain, gent, and John Cooke of Potterne, along with John Haynes, \\"the Sherriffe of Wilts' trumpeter who went along from Salisbury\\". All were found guilty, Jenkins having pleaded guilty.Cobbett's State Trials, Bagshaw, 1810, pp. 790-791 The third bill named four men who claimed they had received articles of surrender from Captain Crooke: brothers Henry and Joseph Collier of Steeple Langford, William Wake of Blandford, gent (the father of future Archbishop William Wake), Sykes, N. William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1957, p.8 and Christopher Haviland of Longton, labourer. It was argued that they had instead simply been promised \\"fair quarter\\", upon which they confessed the indictment. Also arraigned were James Horsington, gent and John Giles, yeoman, of New Sarum, who it was claimed had been held in Salisbury jail for robbery and had been freed by the insurgents, Abraham Wilson, cutler, Richard Browne, Nicholas Broadgate of Blandford Forum, yeoman, and another trumpeter, a Dutchman called Hans Styver. Broadgate was acquitted, and the rest found guilty. A further man, Marcellus Rivers, gentleman, of Benstead, received a \\"no true bill\\" verdict. Sir William Clarke commented that although Grove, a gentleman with an annual income of 400 pounds, was a \\"dareing and resolute person\\", the most unrepentant were Reeves and Hilliard, \\"the most ancient of them\\", who openly admitted their actions and said that \\"they owed not obedience but to Charles Stuart\\". Ten men (Penruddock, Groves, Reeves, Davy, Poulton, Willis, Hillard, Haynes, Horsington, and Giles) were executed at Exeter - Cromwell commuted the usual sentence to beheading in the case of Penruddock and Groves, and hanging in the case of the remainder.Oliver, The History of Exeter, 1821, p.101 The others, including those claiming to have been given articles by Crooke, were said to have been reprieved and pardoned, such as Wake, who after a time in Exeter jail was released and went on to live until 1705. Up to seventy insurgents still held in Salisbury, of a range of social classes and occupations, were subsequently transported to Barbados as indentured labourers. They were transported aboard the John of London to be sold for fifteen hundred and fifty pounds of sugar each. They arrived in Barbados on the 7 May 1656, where they were sold as the goods and chattels of Martin Noell, MP, Major Thomas Alderne of London, and Captain Henry Hatsell of Plymouth. The prisoners included the previously-acquitted Nicholas Broadgate and Marcellus Rivers, who along with another transportee called Oxenbridge Foyle or Fowell, was in 1659 was to submit a petition to Parliament in pamphlet form complaining about the prisoners' barbaric treatment at the hands of the planters who had bought them. Rivers added that one man, a Mr. Diamond of Tiverton - probably the William Deyman of Tiverton, gent, recorded as a prisoner at Exeter with Penruddock - had been transported despite being 76 years old and merely having expressed a wish to join the rebels. Although it is unknown whether Foyle returned to England, Rivers certainly returned at the Restoration, submitting a further petition that Martin Noell as being responsible for his deportation should be excluded from the general amnesty extended to Parliamentarians.

Spilling also works as a promoter, wrestling coach and television producer. Professional wrestling career=Early career Alex Spilling began wrestling for the NWA UK Hammerlock promotion in 1995 under the tutelage of owner Andre Baker. After several years with the promotion, Spilling became an assistant trainer under Justin Richards and Doug Williams where he trained many of the Hammerlock roster such as Mad Dog Mcphie, Jonny Storm and Jody Fleisch, among others. Spilling later fell out with Baker and left to work for the brand-new UWA. During his time in the UWA, Spilling formed a tag team with fellow ex-Hammerlock wrestler Guy Thunder and developed much of his in-ring ability and mic skills as well as creating his heel persona, Alex Shane.Capital City Pro Wrestling results (July 5th 2000) Chris Ryan imitates the original UWA Alex Shane gimmick. From Geocities.com. Retrieved 24/11/06. Archived 2009-10-25. Frontier Wrestling Alliance In 1999, Alex Shane was taken under the wing of Dino Scarlo and Jody Fleisch. During this time, Shane joined the newly revived Frontier Wrestling Alliance promotion. He worked the company's second show and later became the British Heavyweight Champion. Shane opened his own wrestling school, Capital City Pro Wrestling. CCPW became the official London home of the FWA, and Shane became further involved in the company by helping to run the first-ever FWA London show in Barking, Essex in 2001. During this time, Shane also made appearances in a newly formed promotion known as Universal Championship Wrestling, it was here Shane was repackaged as LX Blade,\\"All In To Coventry For The Wrestling\\" (October 5, 2000). Skydome Coventry News website. Retrieved 24/11/06. The character was abandoned when the promotion folded after just two shows. While promoting his CCPW venture, Shane appeared as a guest on the talkSPORT radio show hosted by Tommy Boyd. Shane soon became a regular co-host and helped the show become the UK's first fully fledged national wrestling radio show. During his time on the radio show in 2001, Shane returned to the FWA under his most successful persona \\"The Showstealer\\". Alex Shane later replaced Boyd with a brand new show: Wrestle-Talk. TalkSPORT cancelled the show in December 2002 as it felt wrestling was not part of the image they wished to promote. In October 2002, Shane teamed with Ulf Herman to defeat the UK Pitbulls and win the FWA Tag Team Championship. End of the Showstealer On 6 June \\"NGW 2nd Anniversary Show\\", Nathan Cruz faced Alex Shane for the rights of the name \\"Showstealer\\". The match was a variant of Last Man Standing, and resulted in Shane losing his nickname to the new \\"Showstealer\\", Nathan Cruz. In 2007, Shane's return to in-ring competition was announced by his facing Martin Stone, but he was forced to withdraw from the match for medical reasons. Promoting Alex Shane would continue his career in wrestling promoting, presenting the International Showdown event at the Coventry Skydome. In its sequel, Universal Uproar, Shane gained a pinfall over three-time WWE champion and 'Hardcore Legend' Mick Foley in an elimination tag-match. In March 2006, Shane was announced as the new head of European Marketing and promotion for Ring of Honor. In August, he promoted the group's first overseas tour, and it was also the company's biggest grossing weekend. In April 2007, Shane promoted a 16-man tournament called \\"King of Europe Cup\\". In June 2008, Alex promoted a four-day UK tour for TNA, in which he returned to the ring in a surprise one shot deal for the International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom promotion in South England to face Martin Stone. Billed as his last match before leaving for India, Shane lost to Stone after almost 30 minutes in an exciting contest which left Shane showing no signs of ring rust. At the end of 2008, Shane reportedly signed Indian bodybuilder and TV star Varinder Singh Ghuman to bring him to the UK and train to wrestle. Shane has said in interviews that he plans to use Singh as a spring board to bring wrestling to India. In early 2009, Shane made a shocking return to IPW:UK, winning the annual \\"Extreme Measures\\" tournament. He also won the IPW:UK title from Lestyn Rees on 18 April, although claiming to still be retired. Shane then went on to work as the creative and promotions director of the new FWA from August 2009 until September 2011. After only 18 months, Shane helped take the company from the Broxbourne Civic Hall to the London Excel Center and the world-famous Birmingham NEC. In April 2012, Alex worked with Jamie Hadley to present BritWres-Fest 2012 in London for the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.

Shane also began producing Lucha Libre AAA for worldwide TV and NGW British Wrestling Weekly, currently aired in 36 countries globally under his Trident Vision Media company. The company, known as TVM, also works heavily in producing YouTube content with WrestleTalk TV, the WhatCulture.com wrestling show 'WCPW Loaded'. Commentary Alex Shane was the colour commentator for What Culture Pro Wrestling (WCPW) (later Defiant Pro Wrestling). He favoured the heels during matches, in keeping with his heel persona when he was an active wrestler. He also plays the heel role on AAA Lucha Libre and does a more play-by-play straight commentator role for the NGW British Wrestling Weekly program, which he also produces. Shane is also the co-host and commentator of ITV's new 'World of Sport Wrestling' re-vamp, alongside WWE Hall of Famer Jim Ross. The 2 hours special aired over Christmas 2016 on ITV 1.

A staunch secessionist, he was mortally wounded during the Battle of Gettysburg while leading his brigade's attack on Union forces not far from Cemetery Ridge. Early life William Barksdale was born in Smyrna, Tennessee, the son of William Barksdale and Nancy Hervey Lester Barksdale. He was the older brother of Ethelbert Barksdale, who would serve in both the antebellum U.S. Congress and then the Confederate States Congress during the Civil War. He was of English ancestry which came to America during the 1600s. Barksdale graduated from the University of Nashville and practiced law in Mississippi from the age of 21, but gave up his practice to become the editor of the Columbus [Mississippi] Democrat, a pro-slavery newspaper. He enlisted in the 2nd Mississippi Infantry Regiment and served in the Mexican War as a captain and quartermaster, but often participated in the infantry fighting as well. After the war, he entered the U.S. House of Representatives and achieved national prominence as a States' rights Democrat, serving from March 4, 1853, to January 12, 1861. He was considered to be one of the most ferocious of all the \\"Fire-Eaters\\" in the House. He allegedly stood by the side of Representative Preston S. Brooks as Brooks attacked Massachusetts abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner in the Senate chamber with a cane, although he was not one of the members that the House tried to censure after the incident. Before the start of the Civil War, Barksdale inadvertently helped stop one of the most notorious incidents of violence in U.S. legislative history. On February 5, 1858, a brawl between pro and anti-slavery legislators started on the House floor. During the melee, Barksdale swung at Illinois congressman Elihu Washburne, and Washburne's brother Cadwallader, who was a congressman from Wisconsin, grabbed at Barskdale such that it knocked his wig off, and an embarrassed Barksdale put it back on backwards, causing both sides to break out laughing and stopping the fight. Civil War After the state of Mississippi seceded just before the start of the Civil War, Barksdale resigned from Congress to become adjutant general, and then quartermaster general, of the Mississippi Militia, at the rank of brigadier general, with date of rank March 1, 1861. On May 1, he was appointed colonel in the Confederate States Army of the 13th Mississippi Infantry, a regiment that he led in the First Battle of Bull Run that summer, and the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October. The following spring, he took his regiment to the Virginia Peninsula and fought in the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles. When his brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Richard Griffith, was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862, Barksdale assumed command of the brigade and led it in an heroic, but bloody and futile, charge at the Battle of Malvern Hill. The brigade became known as \\"Barksdale's Mississippi Brigade.\\" He was promoted to brigadier general on August 12, 1862. In the Northern Virginia Campaign, Barksdale's Brigade was stationed at Harpers Ferry, and thus did not participate in the Second Battle of Bull Run. In the Maryland Campaign, his brigade was assigned to the division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws in Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. It was one of the brigades that attacked Maryland Heights, leading to the surrender of the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry. At the subsequent Battle of Antietam, McLaws's Division defended the West Woods against the assault by Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's division, saving the Confederate left flank. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Barksdale's Brigade defended the waterfront of the city from Union forces attempting to cross the Rappahannock River, sniping at infantry and engineer forces from buildings that had been turned into rubble by Union artillery.Warner, p. 16. General Barksdale's cenotaph in Greenwood Cemetery, Jackson, Mississippi. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Barksdale's Brigade was one of the few units in James Longstreet's Corps that was present at the battle; most of the corps was detached for duty in Suffolk, Virginia. Once again, Barksdale's brigade defended the heights above Fredericksburg, this time against his previous adversary, Sedgwick, whose VI Corps was over ten times the size of his brigade. Sedgwick's assault was successful and Barksdale pulled back after delaying the Union force, but he was able to rally his brigade and retake the lost ground the next day. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Barksdale's Brigade arrived with McLaws's Division after the first day of battle, July 1, 1863. The plan from General Robert E. Lee was for Longstreet's Corps to maneuver into position and attack northeast, up the Emmitsburg Road, to roll up the Union left flank. Barksdale's sector of the attack placed him directly at the tip of the salient in the Union line anchored at the Peach Orchard, defended by the Union III Corps. At about 5:30 p.m., Barksdale's Brigade burst from the woods and started an irresistible assault, which has been described as one of the most breathtaking spectacles of the Civil War. A Union colonel was quoted as saying, \\"It was the grandest charge that was ever made by mortal man.\\"Clark, p. 102. Although he ordered his subordinate commanders to walk during the charge, Barksdale himself rode on horseback \\"in front, leading the way, hat off, his wispy hair shining so that it reminded [a Confederate staff officer] of 'the white plume of Navarre'.\\"Pfanz, pp. 320-21. The Confederates smashed the brigade manning the Peach Orchard line, wounding and capturing the Union brigade commander himself. Some of Barksdale's regiments turned to the north and shattered Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division. Others of his regiments went straight ahead. By the time his men had gone as far as Plum Run, a mile into the assault, they were counterattacked by a brigade under Colonel George L. Willard. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. He told his aide, W.R.

His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital (the Joseph Hummelbaugh farmhouse). Barksdale's remains were interred in the Barksdale family plot of Greenwood Cemetery, Jackson, Mississippi with no marker, but he has cenotaphs in both Greenwood Cemetery and in Friendship Cemetery, Columbus, Mississippi. In popular media Barksdale is portrayed in the film Gettysburg and in the prequel, Gods and Generals, by Lester Kinsolving, who is a relative of Barksdale. Barksdale is also featured in the 2011 History Channel film Gettysburg. The streets in the Potomac Crossing subdivision in Leesburg, Virginia, are named (in part) after the regimental commanders of the Battle of Ball's Bluff (October 21, 1861). Barksdale Drive was named for Col. Barksdale and is the primary east-west conduit in the development, running just short of a mile to either end of the neighborhood.

The population of the town is 186,116 (2014 estimate).Statistical Institute √áanakkale is the finishing point every year for an organised swim across the Dardanelles from Eceabat. This event emulates the swim in 1810 by Lord Byron, who was himself emulating the legendary swim by Leander in the story of Hero and Leander. The city is the nearest major town to the site of ancient Troy. The wooden horse from the 2004 movie Troy is exhibited on the seafront. Name √áanakkale is the name for a site earlier known as Kale-I-Sultaniye, which was adopted as the official term for the town in 1890, though current a century earlier. √áanakkale was an Ottoman fortress called Kale-i Sultaniye () or Sultaniye kalesi (Fortress of the Sultan). From the late 17th century it also became known for its fine-glazed pottery, √áanakkale ceramics, compared by one traveler to Delftware hence the later name √áanak kalesi 'pot fortress'. The Greek Byzantine name for √áanakkale ⁄Ü€åŸÜ⁄© ŸÇŸÑŸá was ŒîŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒ≠ŒªŒªŒπŒ±, Dardanellia,R√©gis Darques, Salonique au XXe si√®cle: De la cit√© ottomane √† la m√©tropole grecque, editions CNRS 2000 p.299. from which the English name Dardanelles is derived. From around 1920, the British began to call √áanakkale Chanak and Kale Sultanie in their reporting. Legends Ancient Abydos, where the story of Hero and Leander takes place, is to the north of √áanakkale. History Kƒ±z√∂ld√ºn Tumulus is the oldest known tumulus of Hellespontine Phrygia presented in √áanakkale Archaeological Museum The Trojan horse that appeared in the 2004 film, now on display in √áanakkale. Ancient city of Troy is inside the province of √áanakkale √áanakkale Clocktower at the city center The first inhabitants of the area, which hosted many civilizations, lived on the Biga Peninsula in the Last Chalcolithic Age c. 6000 years ago. However, very little is known about the identity and lifestyle of these early settlers. According to some excavations and research, the earliest settlements in the region were established at Kumtepe. It is supposed that Kumkale was established in 4000 BC and Troy between 3500‚Äì3000 BC. Aeolian Greeks settled on the land in the 8th century BC and established trade colonies in the region called Aeolis. The region came under the control of the Lydians in the 7th century BC and under the control of the Persians in the 6th century BC. Aeolis went under the control of the Ancient Macedonian army as Alexander the Great defeated the Persians by the Granicus River of the region in the Battle of the Granicus on his way to Asia. The region came under the reign of the Kingdom of Pergamon in the 2nd century BC. √áanakkale itself was built as a fortress in 1462 by Mehmed II Fatih, who gave it the name Kale-I Sultaniye, since one of the Sultan's sons had collaborated in its construction. Sited on a bay at the narrowest point of the strait, it, together with another nearby fort, Kilid Bahr, provided an excellent position for controlling traffic through the Dardanelles. The two forts were quickly called in the travel literature \\"The Castles\\", and a town developed to the north-east, settled by Armenian refugees and Spanish Jews. From the Renaissance period onwards, after their expulsion from Spain, Jewish refugees settled in √áanakkale and formed a sizeable community which thrived by supplying Mediterranean shipping in the region with provisions and acting as consular agents for many European nations. Down to the late 19th century they retained Spanish as a mother-tongue. Some 1,805 Jews were registered there in 1890, out of a population of 10,862, the rest being Muslims (3,551), Orthodox Greeks (2,577), Armenians (956) and assorted foreigners (2,173).,J.M.Cook, The Troad:An Archaeological and Topological Survey, Clarendon Press Oxford 1973 p.53, and n.3. The western part of the Biga Peninsula where ancient Troy is situated was called Troas. Alexandria Troas, an important settlement of the region, was a free trade port and a rich trade center during Roman times. Later in the 2nd century AD, the region was attacked by Goths from Thrace. During the 7th and 8th centuries, in order to attack Constantinople the Arabs passed the strait a few times and came up to Sestos. At the beginning of the 14th century the Karasids dominated the Anatolian part of the strait. During the first half of that century Demirhan Bey from Karasids attempted to dominate the region. The Ottomans gained control of Gallipoli in 1367. In 1915, during the First World War, British Empire and France attempted to secure the waterway through the Straits and ultimately capture Constantinople. Known as The Gallipoli Campaign, or the Dardanelles Campaign, in Turkey it is referred to as the Battle of √áanakkale (), during March 1915 when the Royal Navy failed to force the Dardanelles and suffered severe losses. During a series of operations, HMS Triumph, HMS Ocean, HMS Goliath, HMS Irresistible and the French battleship Bouvet were all sunk. The French submarine Q84 Joule and the Australian submarine AE2 were also destroyed and several other important ships were crippled too. Most of the damage was inflicted by mines, though a German U-Boat and Turkish small craft contributed too. As of 1920, the city was estimated to have a population of approximately 22,000. An active port city, it was a stopping point for vessels traveling through the strait, as it had been in the ancient past. It was described as lacking quality accommodations and resources for those passing through by the British who visited the region. Exported goods from the city included wine, hides, pottery, ceramic tiles and grain.

There are 13 high schools and a college within the boundaries of the city. √áanakkale Onsekiz Mart University has 12 faculties, 4 institutes, 9 4-year colleges, 14 vocational schools and serves more than 52,000 students in the all area. 30 percent of the city population are college graduates. Transportation √áanakkale has one airport, which is 3 km from the city centre, serving since 1995. Anadolu Jet, a trademark of Turkish Airlines, and Borajet have daily flights from Istanbul and Ankara. √áanakkale is linked to north, east, and south by paved highways. Buses run to Istanbul and Izmir. Climate √áanakkale has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool and rainy winters. Snow falls ordinarily every winter.

He was also a lawyer, judge, and a Confederate general in the American Civil War. Early life Kershaw was born on January 5th, 1822, at his family's plantation in Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina. Admitted to the bar in 1843, he married Lucretia Ann Douglas in Camden in 1844, and was a member of the South Carolina Senate in 1852‚Äì1856. Kershaw saw battle during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but fell deathly ill and was given leave to return home. Civil War At the start of the Civil War, Kershaw commanded the 2nd South Carolina Infantry Regiment. He was present at Morris Island in April 1861 during the Battle of Fort Sumter, and then in July 1861 at the First Battle of Manassas in Virginia as part of Brig. Gen. Milledge Bonham's brigade. During the battle, Kershaw's regiment along with the 8th South Carolina was detached from Bonham and sent to help drive back the Union assault on Henry House Hill. Afterwards, Kershaw gained the ire of Confederate general P.G.T. Beauregard by failing to file a proper report of the battle and instead writing a lengthy article in a Charleston newspaper which gave the impression that he and the 2nd South Carolina singlehandedly defeated the Union army. Beauregard, who had difficult professional relationships with many military and political officials, called him \\"that militia idiot\\". The disparaging remarks of Beauregard toward himself and other officers were duly noted. The capable and competent Kershaw had filed a military report of the battle, while the purpose of the newspaper article was to aid recruitment of South Carolina soldiers by showing how a single man, company or brigade could make a significant difference and lead the way to Confederate victory. Due in part to his military success, Kershaw was transferred to the West in the fall. In December when Milledge Bonham resigned his commission to take a seat in the Confederate Congress, Kershaw was honored with command of Bonham's former brigade. He was commissioned brigadier general on 13 February 1862 and commanded a brigade in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign, at the close of which he continued with Lee and took part in the Northern Virginia Campaign and Maryland Campaign. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, he succeeded Brig. Gen. T. R. R. Cobb upon the latter's death on 13 December 1862 and repulsed the last two attacks made by the Federals on Marye's Heights. The following year he was engaged in the Battle of Gettysburg and then was transferred with Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's corps to the West, where he took part in the charge that destroyed the Federal right wing at Chickamauga. After the relief of McLaws following the battle of Knoxville Kershaw was given the command of the division and promoted to major general on 2 June 1864. When Longstreet returned to Virginia, he commanded a division in the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor, and was engaged in the Shenandoah campaign of 1864 against Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan. After the evacuation of Richmond, his troops formed part of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's corps, which was captured on 6 April 1865 at the Battle of Sayler's Creek. Postbellum career At the close of the war he returned to South Carolina and in 1865 was chosen president of the State Senate. He was judge of the Circuit Court from 1877 to 1893, when he stepped down for health reasons. In 1894, he was appointed postmaster of Camden, an office that he held until his death in the same year. Joseph B. Kershaw was also Grand Master of the Freemasons of South Carolina. He died in Camden and is buried there in the Quaker Cemetery.Eicher, p. 331. AncestryChildren Joseph Brevard Kershaw (5 January 1822 Camden ‚Äì 13 April 1894 Camden) married in 1844 in Camden to Lucretia Ann Douglas (27 August 1825 Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina, USA - 28 April 1902 Camden), youngest of the four surviving daughters of the esteemed James Kennedy Douglas (23 October 1780 Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland - 13 November 1860 Camden) by his wife Mary Lucretia Martin (21 February 1785 - 29 March 1852 Camden).

St Patrick's Purgatory is an ancient pilgrimage site on Station Island in Lough Derg, County Donegal, Ireland. According to legend, the site dates from the fifth century, when Christ showed Saint Patrick a cave, sometimes referred to as a pit or a well, on Station Island that was an entrance to Purgatory.Bieler, Ludwig. \\"St. Patrick's Purgatory: Contributions towards an Historical Topography.‚Äù The Irish Ecclesiastical Record 93 (1960): 137‚Äì44. Its importance in medieval times is clear from the fact that it is mentioned in texts from as early as 1185 and shown on maps from all over Europe as early as the fifteenth century. It is the only Irish site designated on Martin Behaim's world map of 1492.Leslie, Shane, ed. Saint Patrick‚Äôs Purgatory: A Record from History and Literature. London: Burns, Oates & Washbourne, 1932 Location View of Station Island from the shore of Lough Derg, County Donegal, Ireland In the nineteenth century there was some confusion about the actual site of St Patrick's Purgatory‚Äîwhether it was on Station Island or Saints Island on Lough Derg, County Donegal. For instance the early nineteenth-century Ordnance Survey maps of Ireland (1837‚Äì42) locate the Purgatory on Saints Island.View the historic 6\\" color map. However, its location on Station Island is a tradition that continues unbroken from the Middle Ages. It is clearly indicated on documents dating from that time, and it appears as \\"Caverna Purgatory\\" on the detailed map of Station Island in Sir James Ware's De Hibernia (1654) and Fr. Thomas Carve's book, Lyra Hibernica (1666).http://www.italicapress.com/index411.html#BuildingsPast Foundation Legend maintains that St. Patrick had grown discouraged by the doubts of his potential converts, who told him they would not believe his teachings until they had substantial proof. St. Patrick prayed that God would help him relate the Word of God and convert the Irish people, and in return, God revealed to him a pit in the ground, which he called Purgatory; by showing this place to the people, they would believe all that he said. By witnessing Purgatory, the people would finally know the reality of the joys of heaven and the torments of hell.Gardiner, Eileen. Visions of Heaven and Hell before Dante. New York: Italica Press, 1989, 135‚Äì36. (http://www.worldcat.org/title/visions-of-heaven- and-hell-before-dante/oclc/18741120) Given the sparsity of any documentation for fifth-century Ireland, it is not surprising that there is no proof that St. Patrick ever visited Lough Derg. And while this is the legend, it is a rather late legend dating probably from the twelfth century.Haren, Michael, and Yolande de Pontfarcy, eds. The Medieval Pilgrimage to St Patrick‚Äôs Purgatory, Lough Derg and the European Tradition. (Enniskillen: Clogher Historical Society, 1988), pp. 8‚Äì9. There is however a much more firmly established tradition regarding St. Dabheog or Dabheoc, a local abbot who presided over, and possibly established, the monastery on the site during the lifetime of Patrick.Harbison, Peter. Pilgrimage in Ireland: The Monuments and the People. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1995. His name has been associated from these early centuries with several places in the area, for instance: St. Dabheoc's Chair on the south bank of Lough Derg, the townland of Seedavoc (St. Dabheoc's Seat), and a mountain in that townland, Seavadog Mountain. One of the islands in Lough Derg was also named after him: St. Dabheoc's Island, which may have been Saints Island or another island entirely.http://www.italicapress.com/index407.html#Dabheoc Cave Chapel, bell tower and penitential beds on Station Island. The bell tower stands on a mound that is the site of the original cave. Although the cave has been closed since 25 October 1632, several descriptions by early pilgrims survive. They referred to it as a cave or cellar or as an enclosed pit. The entrance, which was kept closed and locked, was quite narrow: about 0.6 m (2 ft) wide and 0.9 m (3 ft) high. Once inside there was a short descent of about six steps. The cave was divided into two parts: the first was about 3 m (9 ft) long, probably with banked sides and only high enough to kneel in; after a turn there was another niche about 1.5 m (5 ft) long.http://www.italicapress.com/index411.html#BuildingsPast Since the site has never been excavated, we can only rely at this point on these descriptions of the cave. However based on other archaeological excavations it seems clear that this was probably an ancient structure. Some have suggested a souterrain, a place for storing crops and animals. However, the size of the cave would make this seem very unlikely. A much more plausible suggestion is that it was one of the ancient sweat houses,http://www.irishmegaliths.org.uk/sweathouses.htm which were actually still in use in Ireland into the twentieth century. From modern practice we know that people would enter these small enclosed places to inhale medicinal smoke produced by burning various plants. The name \\"purgatorium\\" could possibly have been used here originally with its Latin meaning as a place for cleansing and purging‚Äîmuch like a modern sauna; especially since the modern notion of \\"purgatory\\" as a place for punishment in the afterlife did not come into common use until the thirteenth century.Le Goff, Jacques. The Birth of Purgatory. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984). The cave would then have been a place that people went to for physical or spiritual healing, even before it became associated with St. Patrick in the twelfth century as a place for strictly spiritual healing. Monastery and its functions 'Patrick the Pilgrim' statue near the dock for the ferry to Station Island A monastery probably existed on the islands in Lough Derg from the fifth century and it probably included anchorites who lived in beehive cells‚Äîwhich may be preserved in some form in the penitential beds that can still be seen on Station Island. Around 1130 the monastery was given to Augustinian Canons Regular by the authority of the cathedral in Armagh, under Saint Malachy.Gardiner, Eileen. The Pilgrim's Way to St. Patrick's Purgatory. (New York: Italica Press, 2010), p. 139. The monastery on Saints Island offered hospitality to pilgrims, who would visit in a spirit of penance and prayer. It also served as a place where pilgrims could prepare themselves for visiting the Purgatory. Documents report that pilgrims who did want to visit the Purgatory would arrive with letters of permission from a bishop, either from their own region or from Armagh.Gardiner, pp. 24, 35. They would then spend fifteen days fasting and praying to prepare themselves for the visit to Station Island, a short boat ride away. At the end of the fifteen days, pilgrims would confess their sins, receive communion and undergo a few final rituals before being locked in the cave for twenty-four hours. The next morning the prior would open the door, and if the pilgrim were found alive, he would be brought back to Saints Island for another fifteen days of prayer and fasting.Gardiner, p. 39. From the time of St. Dabheoc, it appears that this region attracted pilgrims from far and wide. By the twelfth century they came from all over continental Europe, most likely sailing from England and landing at Dublin or Drogheda. From those ports they would make their way by foot, stopping at monasteries along the way on what would probably be a two-week journey across the Irish countryside to their destination.Gardiner, pp. 39‚Äì40. In this period many sinners and criminals were sent on pilgrimage to atone for their deeds and seek forgiveness. St. Patrick's Purgatory would be a likely destination for these penitential pilgrims, or exiles, since communities of anchorites were often considered to have special power to absolve them.Gardiner, pp. 21‚Äì23. Route to Lough Derg Based on the description left by the fifteenth-century pilgrim, Guillebert of Lannoy, it is possible to trace the medieval pilgrimage route, reported in 1430, from Drogheda to Kells along the Boyne River, most likely stopping at Mellifont, Slane and Donaghmore, staying at monasteries, as was the usual custom for medieval travelers of any type. From there he headed northwest toward Enniskillen, which he calls Rousseaumoustier. Here a duke lends him a boat so that he and his companions could travel up Lough Erne, most likely stopping at Devenish, Inishmacsaint and White Island. Along this route he would have also passed by the important monastery of Drumlane.Gardiner, Pilgrim's Way, pp. 34-37. 1497 At the 31st Irish Conference of Medievalists (2017) it has been presented a new hypothesis for the historical reconstruction of the so-called first \\"closure\\" of the pilgrimage which is thought to have occurred in the late 15th century. The Acta Sanctorum contains a document in which the closure is attributed to the denunciation of a Dutch monk, who had been to Lough Derg and subsequently traveled to the Vatican, where he accused the pilgrimage's organizers (including the bishop and the prior) of simony. According to P. Taviani that document is a fake, forged by someone who never had been to Lough Derg and who imagined St. Patrick Purgatory to be akin to St Patrick's Well in Orvieto (Italy). The Pope would never have ordered the closure of the pilgrimage, and in fact this never happened. The true story is that in 1497 it was Cathal √ìg Mac Maghnusa (at the time active as a bishop of the Diocese of Clogher), encouraged by the Guardian of the Franciscan Observant Donegal Abbey, who wanted to radically change the course of the pilgrimage. The promise of a journey to the underworld could no longer be sustained. To ensure the survival of the pilgrimage, it was necessary to turn it into an event purely concerned with penitence. In order to overcome any potential opposition to this radical change, a fictitious Papal order was conceived.Paolo Taviani, \\"La distruzione\\", in Il Purgatorio di San Patrizio. Documenti letterari e testimonianze di pellegrinaggio (secc. XII-XVI), Firenze: SISMEL - Le Edizioni del Galluzzo (Quaderni di Hagiographica, 13), 2018, pp. 497-521; (http://www.sismel.it/tidetails.asp?hdntiid=1605). The monastery was then dissolved in 1632, although the local lord apparently allowed the monks to remain. By 1710 the Franciscans were present on the island in the summer to administer to the needs of the pilgrims. They built a church, St. Mary of the Angels, on Station Island in 1763.Gardiner, p. 150. In 1785, administration of Station Island came into the hands of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher.Gardiner, p. 139. Shane Leslie gave freehold of the island to the diocese in 1960, and was made a Knight Commander of St Gregory by Pope John XXIII in recognition. Modern pilgrimage There is no evidence that the pilgrimage to St. Patrick's Purgatory was ever interrupted for any period of time and, more than fifteen hundred years on, it continues in the present times.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53109414 Every year the main pilgrimage season begins in late May/early June and ends mid-August, on the 15th, the feast of the Assumption of Mary. It is a three-day pilgrimage open to pilgrims of all religions, or none, who must be at least fifteen years of age, in good health and able to walk and kneel unaided. Pilgrims, who should begin fasting at the previous midnight, assemble at the Visitor Centre on the shore of Lough Derg early in the day (between about 10 am and 1 pm). From there a boat ferries them on the brief trip out to Station Island. Once on the island they are assigned a dormitory room, and barefoot they begin a specified and almost continuous cycle of prayer and liturgies.Gardiner, pp. 153‚Äì54. These prayers ‚Äî the Our Father (or Lord's Prayer), the Hail Mary and the Apostles' Creed (all included in a booklet they receive)‚Äî are carried out at designated 'stations' on the island, including six 'beds' that are the remains of ancient cells or beehive huts, named for famous ‚Äì principally Irish ‚Äì saints. These are thought to be the remains of early monastic cells. Pilgrims spend the first night in the island's basilica in prayer, and only on the second night can they finally sleep in the dormitory. Each day on the island the pilgrims have one simple meal of dry toast, oatcakes and black tea or coffee. On the third morning they are ferried back to the mainland, where they will continue their fast until midnight. There are also other programs throughout the year, including Quiet Days, Family Days, and One-Day Retreats. The site is under the stewardship of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher. The staff includes people who can help with both spiritual and practical concerns. Facilities include a kitchen, laundry, first-aid station and book/gift shop.

A fascinating account of a visit to Lough Derg by Catalan pilgrim Ramon de Perell√≥s in 1397 is given in Haren and de Pontfarcy's book.,pp. 99‚Äì119. along with several other pilgrims' accounts. A more detailed description of 'the cave' of St Patrick's Purgatory was provided by the accomplished seventeenth-century Irish historian, Sir James Ware, in his work De Hibernia (1654, 2nd ed. 1658) from which the map originates. Station Island is a long poem written by S√©amus Heaney about his experience of the pilgrimage. Other well-known poets, such as Denis Devlin and Patrick Kavanagh wrote works on St. Patrick's Purgatory as well. \\"The Lough Derg Pilgrim\\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/father-butler-the- lough-dearg-pilgrim/oclc/65662793 by the Irish writer William Carleton recounts his experience there, which led him to abandon thoughts of becoming a Roman Catholic priest; he converted to the Church of Ireland. Pete McCarthy's visit in 1998 is described in McCarthy's Bar. Froissart's Chronicles mentions it in Book Four, Froissart Revisits England. Rabelais's Gargantua bawdily refers to it as \\"Saint Patrick's hole\\". 'The Pilgrim', by William Butler Yeats is centred on the pilgrimage to Station Island. Pilgrims Since the records were destroyed in 1632, we have no way of knowing exactly how many people made the pilgrimage each year in those days. However, since that time, records are available; and we know, for example, that in 1700, 5,000 pilgrims were recorded for the season; by 1826 the number of pilgrims grew to 15,000, and to 30,000 by 1846, just before the onset of the Great Famine. From 1871 to 1903 approximately 3,000 pilgrims visited annually; and from 1908 to 1921, the number averaged over 8,000. From 1929 to the end of the century the number never fell below 10,000 pilgrims, and in many years was twice, and sometimes thrice, that number. In 2011, 8,000 people completed the pilgrimage.http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.ie/2009/08/bishop-duffy-welcomes- increase-in.html Notable pilgrims include: * Georgius Ungarus, also George Crissaphan or George Grissaphan (Krizsaf√°n fia Gy√∂rgy, in Hungarian), knight in the army of Louis I of Hungaryhttp://www.italicapress.com/index410.html#IndividualAccounts * Malatesta Ungaro, Italian condottiero * Laurence Rathold of P√°szth√≥ or Laurentius Tar (Tar L≈ërinc, in Hungarian), a courtier in the court of Sigismund of Luxembourg, king of Hungary ‚Äì the report of his pilgrimage: \\"memoriale super visitatione Domini Laurencii Ratholdi militis et baronis Ungariae factum de purgatorio sancti Patricii in insula Hiberniae\\" (in Hungarian ) * Jan I van Brederode, a vazal of count William VI of Holland visit the island site in 1399 * Guillebert de Lannoy, a chamberlain to the duke of Burgundy and knight of the Golden Fleece, made the pilgrimage in 1430. * Francesco Chiericati, papal nuncio, visited the site in 1522 * Mary McAleese ‚Äì President of Ireland * Frank Duff ‚Äì Founder of the Legion of Mary * Seamus Heaney ‚Äì Poet There are thirty-three pilgrims to St. Patrick's Purgatory between c. 1146 and 1517 who can be identified by name.

He also was a lawyer, legislator, and judge on the Georgia Supreme Court. He commanded the \\"Benning's Brigade\\" during the American Civil War. Following the Confederacy's defeat at the end of the war, he returned to his native Georgia, where he lived out the rest of his life. Fort Benning is named after him. Early life and education Benning was born on a slave labor camp in Columbia County, Georgia owned by his parents Pleasant Moon and Malinda Meriwether White Benning, the third of eleven children. He attended Franklin College (now the University of Georgia), graduating in 1834. While a student, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. After college, he moved to Columbus, Georgia, which would be his home for the rest of his life. He was admitted to the bar at the age of 21. Career Benning was active in Southern U.S. politics and an ardent secessionist, bitterly opposing abolition and the emancipation of slaves. In a letter to Howell Cobb written in July 1849, he stated that a Southern Confederacy would not be enough because it might itself eventually become divided into northern and southern regions as slavery waned in some of the states, and he called for a Southern \\"consolidated Republic\\" that \\"will put slavery under the control of those most interested in it.\\" In 1851, he was nominated for the US Congress as a Southern rights Democrat but was not elected. In 1853, he was elected an associate justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, where he was noted for an opinion that held that a state supreme court is not bound by the decisions of the US Supreme Court on constitutional questions but that the two courts must be held to be \\"coordinate and co- equal.\\"Hewitt, pp. 100-01. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln to the US presidency in 1860 on a platform opposing the expansion of slavery into the territories, Benning took an active part in the state convention that voted to secede from the Union, representing Muscogee County. In March 1861, the southern states that had seceded appointed special commissioners to travel to the other slaveholding Southern states that had yet to secede. Benning was the commissioner from Georgia to the Virginian secession convention in which he tried to persuade Virginian politicians to vote to join Georgia in seceding from the Union. In a February 1861 speech to the Virginian secession convention, Benning gave his reasoning for the urging of secession from the Union, appealing to ethnic prejudices and pro-slavery sentiments to present his case and saying that were the slave states to remain in the Union their slaves would ultimately end up being freed by the anti-slavery Republican Party. He stated that he would rather be stricken with illness and starvation than see African Americans liberated from slavery and be given equality as citizens: American Civil War Although he was considered for a cabinet position in the government of the newly-established Confederacy, he chose to join the Confederate army instead and became the colonel of the 17th Georgia Infantry, a regiment that he raised himself in Columbus on August 29, 1861. The regiment became part of Robert Toombs's brigade in the right wing of the Army of Northern Virginia, under General Robert E. Lee.Eicher, pp. 128-29. As a newly minted army officer, Benning immediately ran into political difficulty. He questioned the legality of the Confederate government's Conscription Act and spoke against it openly as a violation of states' rights. Refusing to obey certain orders, he came close to being court-martialed, but influence from his friend, Colonel T. R. R. Cobb, defused the situation. The first significant action he saw was at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, Benning's brigade was a crucial part in the defense of the Confederate right flank, guarding \\"Burnside's Bridge\\" across Antietam Creek all morning against repeated Union assaults. His courage in battle was no longer questioned by his superiors, and he became known as the \\"Old Rock\\" to his men. He was promoted to brigadier general on April 23, 1863, with date of rank of January 17, 1863. For most of the rest of the war, Benning continued as a brigade commander (\\"Benning's Brigade\\") in the division of the aggressive John Bell Hood of Texas. He missed the Confederate victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville because his brigade was stationed in southern Virginia along with the rest of Lieutenant General James Longstreet's First Corps. However, it returned for active combat in the Battle of Gettysburg. There, on July 2, 1863, Benning led his brigade in a furious assault against the Union position in the Devil's Den, driving out the defenders at no small cost to themselves. That September, Longstreet's Corps was sent west to assist General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. On the second day of the bloody Battle of Chickamauga, Benning participated in Longstreet's massive charge against a gap in the Union line even as his horse was shot out from under him. He mounted another horse, which was also killed. Finally, he cut loose a horse from a nearby artillery battery and rode into combat bareback. During a surprise Union counterattack against his brigade, many of his men fled, and Benning ran off to Longstreet to report the calamity. Riding an old artillery horse and whipping it with a piece of rope, Benning was \\"greatly excited and the very picture of despair,\\" as was reported by Longstreet after the war. Benning said, \\"General, I am ruined; my brigade was suddenly attacked and every man killed; not one is to be found. Please give me orders where I can do some fighting.\\" Longstreet responded impassively, \\"Nonsense, General, you are not so badly hurt. Look about you. I know you will find at least one man, and with him on his feet report your brigade to me, and you two shall have a place in the fighting line.\\" Longstreet's reply humiliated Benning but instilled enough determination in him to return to find his brigade and prevail in the battle.Cozzens, pp. 410-11. This interchange is also reported in Freeman, Vol. 2, p. 219, n. 53, but is incorrectly ascribed to Second Manassas. The original source is Sorrel, p. 203. The Benning's Brigade fought at the Battle of Wauhatchie outside Chattanooga, Tennessee, and joined Longstreet's Corps in its unsuccessful Knoxville Campaign in late 1863. Returning to Virginia, the brigade fought against Union Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant in the 1864 Overland Campaign, where Benning was severely wounded in the left shoulder during the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5. That wound kept him out of the remainder of the campaign and much of the subsequent Siege of Petersburg, but he was able to return in time for the waning days of that lengthy campaign. His brigade withstood strong Union assaults against its entrenchments but was forced to withdraw along with the rest of Lee's army in the retreat to Appomattox Court House in early April 1865. Benning, heartbroken, was one of the final officers to lead his men to the surrender ceremony. Later life and death Benning in his later life After the war, Benning returned to Columbus to resume the practice of law. He found that his house had been burned; all of his savings had disappeared; and he had to support, along with his own family, the widow, and children of his wife's brother, who had been killed in the war. In 1875, Benning had a stroke, termed apoplexy at the time, on his way to court and died in Columbus. He is buried in Linwood Cemetery. Personal life On September 12, 1839, Benning married Mary Howard Jones of Columbus, Georgia. Mary was the daughter of the Honorable Seaborn Jones, a prominent attorney, former Georgia Secretary of State, and United States Representative. Henry and Mary were married for twenty-nine years. Years before Margaret Mitchell published her Civil War novel, Gone with the Wind, she wrote an article in the Atlanta Constitution (December 20, 1925) in which she referenced the Benning family and their experiences during the war. Regarding Mary Benning, Ms. Mitchell wrote, \\"She was a tiny woman, frail and slight, but possessed of unusual endurance and a lion‚Äôs heart. The battles she fought at home were those of nearly every Southern woman, but her burdens were heavier than most. Left in complete charge of a large plantation, this little woman, who was the mother of ten children, was as brave a soldier at home as ever her husband was on the Virginia battlefields. She saw to it that the crops were gathered, the children fed and clothed, and the Negroes cared for. To her fell the work of superintending the weaving and spinning of enough cloth, not only to clothe her own children and servants, but also Confederate soldiers. While her husband was away she buried her aged father, whose end was hastened by the war.\\" Following her research and article on the Bennings, Mitchell wrote her novel of the Civil War, and many of her descriptions of the Bennings are reflected in the lives of the O'Haras and others. Shortly after the Civil War, Mary Benning died suddenly on June 28, 1868. Henry's firstborn son, Seaborn Jones Benning, died of consumption on December 12, 1874. As a widower, Henry Benning suffered a stroke and died on July 10, 1875. The couple had a total of ten children, including an infant son who died within hours of birth and three daughters (Sarah Elizabeth, Caroline Matilda and Anna Malinda) who died of childhood diseases. Five Benning daughters (Mary Howard, Augusta Jones, Louisa Vivian, Anna Caroline, and Sarah Jones) survived their parents. While all of Benning's daughters were accomplished women, it is noteworthy that Louisa Vivian was married to Samuel Spencer. Spencer served as a young cavalryman during the Civil War and rode under the command of General Nathan Bedford Forrest. After the war, Spencer attained great prominence as a railroad tycoon, and he is known today as the \\"Father of the Southern Railroad System.\\" Dameron, J. David.

The Malayatoor Church attracts many devotees from not just India, but from all over the world. St. Thomas the Apostle was the one who took initiative to begin Christian community in Kerala later found. The church here has been designated by the Vatican as one among the eight International shrines in the world. It is believed that St. Thomas held prayer at the place where church is situated when he landed in Kerala. The hilltop church is located 15 km away from the town of Kalady. Malayatoor and Kodanad villages are located on the opposite banks of the Periyar river with unspoiled and rustic views of the surroundings. History St. Thomas is believed to have landed at Kodungallur (Cranganore) in Kerala in AD 50. In AD 62, St. Thomas returns to Malankara coast via Malayatur where he establishes ‚Äòthe half church‚Äô (a small Christian community dependent on the Church of Maliamkara). Oral tradition says that while travelling through Malayattor, faced with hostile natives, he fled to the hilltop where he said to have remained in prayer and that he left his footprint on one of the rocks. According to beliefs, during prayer, he touched a rock, upon which blood poured from it. The chief festival is on the first Sunday after Easter. It is traditionally believed that St. Thomas used to make the Sign of the Cross on the rock, kiss it and pray at Kurisumudi. The story has it that a miraculous golden cross appeared at that particular spot. Pilgrims going up the hill to call out incessantly \\"Ponnum Kurishu Muthappo, Ponmala Kayattom\\", meaning \\"O Patriarch of the Golden Cross! Climb we shall, this golden hill!\\" This Shrine was promoted to Archdiocesan status by Major Archbishop Mar Varkey Cardinal Vithayathil on 4 September 1998. There is also a very ancient Church in the name of St Thomas (Estd. 900) at Malayattoor on the bank of Periyar River which serves as the parish Church at present. The annual festival of this church is known as 'Malayatoor Perunal' and it is celebrated in the months of March‚ÄìApril. Kurisumudi Kurishumudi (Hill of the holy cross) is a mountain at Malayattoor, has its fame as a place visited by St. Thomas, one of the Apostles of Jesus Christ. Jesus gave a mandate to his Apostles to go out to the whole world and to proclaim the Good News. Thomas set out to India and landed at Kodungalloor in AD 52. A hostile reception was given and his life was in danger. He was forced to flee to the top of the mountain and had spent days in the abode of God. In deep anguish and agony, St. Thomas prayed to the Lord and he made a sign of the cross on the rock. The Mother of Our Lord, Blessed Mary, appeared to console and strengthens him. He descended from the top hill and continued his journey to Mylapoore in Tamil Nadu. Later on the hunters went to the mountain for hunting. While they stayed in the night they saw a glittering sign of cross on the rock. Out of curiosity they struck there with their rude weapons. To their surprise blood gushed out. They ran to the valley and told the locals. They went to the mountain and while they prayed there they got many miracles. This is the humble beginning of Pilgrimage to Kurishumudi File:Malayattoor Ponnum kurishu.jpgPonnum Kurishu File:Kurishumudi church, Malayattoor.jpgKurishumudi church File:Malayattoor Church.jpgST. Thomas Church, Kurishumudi Golden Cross Kurishumudi is where one can find the Golden Cross believed to have formed when St. Thomas knelt on a rock and signed a cross with his finger. He remained there praying for a long time, and ultimately a golden cross appeared on the spot. Footprints of St Thomas One of the most curious sights at the mountain was the permanent footprint and the marks of knees of St. Thomas imprinted on the rock. At present, the natural footprint is not there but instead there is a man-made footprint (A replica) made by the Church. The ancient chapel struck by the elephants An ancient chapel at Kurishumudi, was attacked by tuskers in the past when it used to be surrounded by thick jungle. Deep tusk marks can still be found on the back wall of the chapel. The miraculous water spring A well, situated near the ancient chapel at the top of the mount is believed to be the spot from where St. Thomas quenched his thirst during his time of prayer. Feeling thirsty, he struck the rock from which fresh water started flowing. Pilgrims consider the water in the well to possess divine power to heal ailments. With its recent recognition by Vatican as an international pilgrim centre, this famous shrine at Malayattoor dedicated to St. Thomas would be extending its healing touch and spiritual bliss to more visitors and for those who come to enjoy its serenity.

Early life Wright, known by the nickname \\"Rans\\", was born in Louisville, Georgia. He read law under the tutelage of Governor and Senator Herschel V. Johnson, who later became his brother-in-law, and was admitted to the bar. He became prominent politically, although he ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia legislature and for the United States Congress. He was a presidential elector for Millard Fillmore in 1856, a supporter of Bell and Everett in 1860, and a Georgia commissioner to Maryland in 1861. Civil War At the start of the Civil War, Wright enlisted as a private in Georgia Militia, but he was commissioned colonel of the 3rd Georgia Infantry on May 18, 1861, and served in North Carolina and Georgia until the summer of 1862 and won a victory for the Confederacy at the Battle of South Mills in North Carolina in April 1862. In May, Wright traveled with his regiment to Virginia and fought in the Battle of Seven Pines as part of Brig. Gen Albert G. Blanchard's brigade. Blanchard was removed from command afterwards due to poor performance and Wright replaced him, being promoted to brigadier general. Wright's Georgians made a distinguished record in the Army of Northern Virginia from the Seven Days Battles to the Siege of Petersburg. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Antietam in 1862 and at Chancellorsville in 1863. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Wright's brigade, part of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Corps, breached the Union defenses on Cemetery Ridge on July 2, 1863. His command drove off the Union force and captured twenty artillery pieces, before being forced to retire through lack of support.Edward Porter Alexander, Memoirs of a Confederate. (New York, Charles Scribner & Sons, 1907), pp. 401- 402 As of November 26, 1864, Wright was named major general on a temporary commission (which was not made permanent) and ordered to Georgia, where he exercised command until the end of the war. Postbellum career In 1863, Wright had been elected to the Georgia State Senate and president of that body in absentia. Resuming his law practice after the termination of hostilities, he purchased the Augusta Chronicle & Sentinel newspaper in 1866, and, in 1871, was defeated for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate. The following year, General Wright was a delegate to both the state and national Democratic conventions and was elected to the United States House of Representatives, but died at Augusta, Georgia, before taking his seat. At a special election to fill the vacancy, Alexander Stephens was elected his successor. General Wright is buried in Magnolia Cemetery (formerly City Cemetery), Augusta.

He served in the 1862‚Äì63 campaigns of the Army of Northern Virginia as a regimental and later brigade commander. His career was fatally damaged by a disastrous infantry assault at the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg. General Robert E. Lee removed Iverson from his army and sent him to cavalry duty in Georgia. During the Atlanta Campaign, he achieved a notable success in a cavalry action near Macon, Georgia, capturing Union Army Maj. Gen. George Stoneman and hundreds of his men. Early years Iverson was born in Clinton, Jones County, Georgia. He was the son of Alfred Iverson Sr., United States Senator for Georgia and a fierce proponent of secession, and Caroline Goode Holt. The senator decided on a military career for his son and enrolled him in the Tuskegee Military Institute.Tagg, p. 295. Iverson's career as a soldier began at the age of 17, when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began. His father raised and equipped a regiment of Georgia volunteers and young Iverson left Tuskegee to become a second lieutenant in the regiment. He left the service, in July 1848, to become a lawyer and contractor. In 1855, his Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War experience gained him a commission as a first lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment. In that role he served in efforts to suppress the violence known as Bleeding Kansas. Civil War=Early assignments At the start of the Civil War, Iverson resigned from the U.S. Army and received a commission from his father's old friend, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, as colonel of the 20th North Carolina Infantry, a unit he played a strong role in recruiting. His regiment was initially stationed in North Carolina, but was called to the Virginia Peninsula in June 1862, for the Seven Days Battles. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Gaines's Mill, in the division commanded by Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill, by leading the only successful regiment of the five that were assigned to capture a Union artillery battery. Iverson was severely wounded in the charge and his regiment took heavy casualties. Unfortunately for Iverson and the Confederacy, this battle would turn out to be the high point of his military career. Iverson recovered in time to rejoin the Army of Northern Virginia in the Maryland Campaign. In the Battle of South Mountain, his entire brigade was forced to retreat after their brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Samuel Garland, was mortally wounded. Iverson's regiment ran away at the Battle of Antietam a few days later, although he was able to rally them to return to the battle. After the battle, Iverson was promoted to brigadier general on November 1, 1862, and given command of the brigade; causing the more senior Colonel Duncan K. McRae, who had been in temporary command, to resign from the Army. His first assignment commanding his new brigade was at the Battle of Fredericksburg, but he was assigned to the reserve and saw no action. Conflict soon resulted, however. When he attempted to name a new colonel for the 20th North Carolina, a personal friend from outside of the regiment, 26 of his officers signed a letter of protest against the action. Iverson attempted to arrest all 26 officers, but eventually cooled off. His friend was not placed as the new colonel, but Iverson petulantly refused all winter to promote any of the other candidates for the position.Tagg, p. 296. At Chancellorsville, Iverson's brigade participated in Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's famous flanking march, suffering heavy casualties (including Iverson himself, wounded in the groin by a spent shell), but managed to get less credit and notice than two other brigades in the line. Returning to the rear to get support for his flank, many of his officers concluded that he was shirking. His reasonable performance at Gaines's Mill the previous year forgotten, rumors swirled that he had achieved his command only by family political influence. Gettysburg The nadir of Iverson's career was at the Battle of Gettysburg, where on July 1, 1863, his brigade of North Carolinians unknowingly marched into an ambush to the northwest of town. The division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes began its attack from Oak Hill with the brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and Iverson. The attack fell apart for multiple reasons. Rodes acted somewhat hastily, seeing limited Union forces at his front, but not that reinforcements were arriving from the town.Pfanz, p. 165. Douglas Southall Freeman faulted Rodes for selecting two brigade commanders \\"who had not distinguished themselves in the battles of May\\" [i.e., Chancellorsville].Freeman, vol. 3, p. 83. Because of a misunderstanding, O'Neal used only three of his four regiments and he attacked on a narrow front at a place different from where Rodes had carefully indicated. Although the two brigades were meant to attack in support of each other, there is confusion about who was supposed to move first.Martin, pp. 220, 224; Sears, p. 196. O'Neal's ineffective attack was repulsed, leaving Iverson's flank exposed. But the most significant problem was that the two brigade commanders chose not to lead their brigades in person, remaining behind their advance.Coddington, pp. 289-90; Martin, pp. 226, 237; Pfanz, p. 178. After the battle there were rumors among the North Carolinians that Iverson was too drunk to lead, but his battle report indicated that he deliberately chose to remain behind and historians present no evidence that alcohol was involved in his decision.Pfanz, p. 177; Sears, p. 201; Martin, p. 227. In the words of the historian of the 23rd North Carolina, \\"unwarned, unled as a brigade, went forward Iverson's deserted band to its doom.\\"Sears, p. 199. As O'Neal's men fell back, Iverson's 1,350 men began to drift left toward a stone wall behind which veteran regiments of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter's Union brigade were hidden. As the Confederates approached within 50 to 100 yards of the wall, the Union soldiers opened fire, hitting at least 500 men, felling them almost in parade-ground alignment. Most of the survivors of three of Iverson's regiments were captured by a Union countercharge.Coddington, pp. 289-90; Martin, pp. 227-29, 236; Pfanz, pp. 172-73; Sears, p. 172. From Iverson's vantage point, it seemed as if his brigade was surrendering, and he exclaimed to Rodes that his men were \\"cowards\\". Many of his men lay prone in battle formation while others waved white handkerchiefs. He did not realize that the former were dead or wounded and the latter surrounded and trapped under heavy fire. Upon reaching the front after conferring with Rodes, Iverson may have suffered a nervous breakdown, overwhelmed by the fate his men had suffered, possibly as many as 900 casualties, one of the most significant brigade losses at Gettysburg.Martin, p. 236. (The men were later buried in shallow graves on this spot on Oak Ridge, which is known to locals as Iverson's Pits, and is a favorite site for believers in the supernatural.) Iverson was \\"unfit for command\\" for the rest of the battle.Coddington, p. 290; Martin, p. 238; Sears, p. 201. He commanded fragments of his brigade attached to the brigade of Brig. Gen. Stephen Dodson Ramseur.Tagg, p. 297. During the retreat from Gettysburg, Iverson's brigade fought credibly against Union cavalry in Hagerstown, Maryland, but Gen. Robert E. Lee wanted nothing more to do with the tarnished officer.Hewitt, p. 143. At Williamsport, Maryland, Lee assigned Iverson as temporary provost marshal, which removed him from combat command, reassigning his men to another brigade.Freeman, vol. 3, pp. 198-201. Georgia and North Carolina He was removed altogether from the Army of Northern Virginia in October 1863, ordered back to Georgia to replace Maj. Gen. Henry R. Jackson in command of the state forces, headquartered at Rome. He spent several months reorganizing the Georgia troops in preparation for the defense of the state against Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. In 1864, Iverson commanded a cavalry brigade in Maj. Gen. William T. Martin's division, Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps, during the Atlanta Campaign. On July 29, near Macon, Iverson's 1,300 cavalrymen defeated about 2,300 under Maj. Gen. George Stoneman, taking about 200 prisoners. During Iverson's pursuit, he and his men captured an additional 500 at Sunshine Church on July 31, including Stoneman.Castel, p. 442; Hewitt, p. 143. Iverson was on duty in North Carolina at the end of the war. As commander in Greensboro he watched his garrison slip away until it was unable to stop fugitive soldiers from plundering part of the city.Bradley, p. 153. Postbellum career Grave of Alfred Iverson Jr., Oakland Cemetery, Atlanta, Georgia After the war, Iverson engaged in business at Macon, moving to Florida in 1877 to farm oranges. He died in Atlanta, Georgia, and is buried there in Oakland Cemetery. See also * List of American Civil War Generals (Confederate) NotesReferences * Bradley, Mark L.

Bowden, \\"Solomon Meredith\\" in Dictionary of North Carolina Biography (1991), available at https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/meredith-solomon One of the commanders of the Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac, Meredith led the brigade in the Battle of Gettysburg. Although he never fully recovered from the wounds he received that day, he became a prize winning farmer and cattleman at home and hosted veterans of his unit. Early and family life Solomon Meredith was born in Guilford County, North Carolina, the youngest of twelve children born to David and Mary Farrington Meredith.Hinshaw, p. 595. Meredith's grandfather, James Meredith, fought at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse during the American Revolutionary War. The Merediths were Quaker, and educated young Solomon at home. He was nicknamed \\"Long Sol\\" for his towering 6' 7\\" body. In 1836 Meredith married Anna Hannah, a daughter of Samuel Hannah, who would later become the 6th Indiana State Treasurer. Although their daughter Mary died as a child, their three sons survived to adulthood. The eldest, Lt. Samuel H. Meredith, served under his father and would die at home in 1864 of wounds received at the 1862 battle of Gainesville; Captain David M. Meredith of the 15th Indiana won a brevet promotion to Major and died in Alabama in 1867; Henry Clay Meredith (1843-1882) would survive and inherit the farm.https://www.tina.ancestralsites.com/wayne_co/m/solomon-meredith.php Although born a Quaker, Meredith became a Methodist. He was also a Freemason and member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.NCbio Career In 1829, aged 19, Solomon left North Carolina (where Quakers faced increasing persecution for helping slaves escape) and walked to Wayne County, Indiana, where he found work chopping wood and working on a farm. He later clerked in a general store in Centerville, then opened a store in Milton, before moving to Cambridge City, the Wayne county seat.Gaff, p. 19. He owned a sprawling farm, \\"Oakland,\\" near Cambridge City.Young, p. 270. In 1834, Meredith won election as the Sheriff of Wayne County, and served for two years before winning election (and re-election) to the Indiana House of Representatives as a fervent Whig. During this time, Wayne County was important in the Underground Railroad, although leading businessman (and Guildford County, North Carolina emigrant) Levi Coffin would move to Cincinnati in 1847. Meredith represented Wayne County in the Indiana House until 1849, when newly elected Whig President Zachary Taylor appointed him U.S. Marshall for Indiana. He served four years, then again won election to represent Wayne County in the Indiana house, this time as a member of the new Republican Party.NCpedia bio While a legislator, Meredith supported education, as well as internal improvement projects. He supported the Whitewater Canal and worked with his brother in law John S. Newman to raise funds for the Indiana Central Railroad (ultimately acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad), and later became president of the Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad Company.Biographical and Genealogical History of Wayne, Fayette, Union and Franklin Counties, Indiana, Volume 1, The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago, 1899 at https://www.tina.ancestralsites.com/wayne_co/m/solomon-meredith.php Civil War When the Civil War erupted in early 1861, Meredith recruited hundreds of men from his county and organized them into a volunteer regiment of infantry. Governor Oliver P. Morton appointed Meredith as the first colonel of the newly named 19th Indiana, despite his lack of previous military experience. The regiment traveled by train to Washington, D.C., where it would eventually join the Army of the Potomac and be brigaded with three Wisconsin regiments in what became famous as the Iron Brigade.Nolan, p. 20. Meredith and his Hoosiers fought their first engagement during the Northern Virginia Campaign at Brawner's Farm, where his horse was shot from under him, crushing him and breaking several ribs.Gaff, p. 158. During the Maryland Campaign, Meredith took part in the Battle of South Mountain, but then abruptly reported himself unfit for duty due to the lingering effects of his injuries at Brawner's Farm and fatigue resulting from to the long march up from Virginia. He went to Washington to rest and recuperate while his replacement, Lt. Col. Alois O. Bachman, was killed while leading a charge near the Cornfield at Antietam.Gaff, pp. 186-87, 191-92; Nolan, p. 141. As far as Brig. Gen.John Gibbon was concerned, he deserved to be stripped of his command for this. A month later, Gibbon was promoted to Maj. Gen. and given the 2nd Division, I Corps to command, then recommending either Colonel Lysander Cutler of the 6th Wisconsin or Colonel Lucius Fairchild of the 2nd Wisconsin to take over the Iron Brigade. However, Major General Joseph Hooker (who had commanded the I Corps at Antietam and was recovering from a wound sustained in that battle) was visited by Meredith requesting promotion to brigadier general. Regardless of the Antietam fiasco and Gibbon's disdain for him, he had powerful political connections in the form of Indiana Governor Oliver Morton. This was enough to convince Hooker, who submitted his request to Washington.Gaff, pp. 191-92. In November, Meredith thus took the field wearing the stars of a brigadier general while John Gibbon fumed and cursed Hooker as a man who had sacrificed his principles for political gain. Meredith led the brigade in combat for the first time at Fredericksburg, where he drew the ire of division commander Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday, who temporarily replaced Meredith with Col. Lysander Cutler.Nolan, pp. 183-84. In the spring of 1863, Meredith's brigade participated in the Chancellorsville Campaign, but saw relatively little combat.Nolan, pp. 211-23; Gaff, pp. 236-38. That would change in July, when the Iron Brigade suffered significant casualties during the first day's fighting at Gettysburg in Herbst's Woods and on Seminary Ridge. They were one of the first infantry brigades to reach the field and in the morning they routed the shocked (and exhausted) brigade of Brig. Gen. James J. Archer and captured Archer. However, in the afternoon the brigade was ravaged by a flanking maneuver by the 11th North Carolina and a frontal assault by the 26th North Carolina, of Confederate Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew's brigade.Gaff, pp. 259-265. Meredith was wounded when he was struck in the head by shrapnel, fracturing his skull and giving him a severe concussion. The blow killed his horse, which then fell on him, breaking his ribs and injuring his right leg.Gaff, p. 263. He was disabled and unfit for any further field command. Meredith performed administrative duty for the rest of the war, commanding garrisons protecting Union river ports along the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois, and Paducah, Kentucky. While still on Army duty in mid-1864, Meredith unsuccessfully ran against George Julian for the United States House of Representatives.Gaff, p. 318. Openly feuding with his opponent, Meredith beat Julian unconscious with a whip, but used his political influence to have charges of assault and battery dropped. Postbellum life With the war over in 1865, Meredith mustered out from the volunteer army with the brevet rank of major general and returned home to Indiana. Although he never completely recovered from the wounds he received at Gettysburg, Meredith resumed farming and became the local tax assessor in 1866-1867. From 1867 to 1869, he became the surveyor general of the Montana Territory. He then retired to his farm and raised prize-winning long-horn cattle, sheep, and horses. After the general's death, his son Henry Clay Meredith and daughter-in-law Virginia Claypool Meredith ran the farm and raised Meredith's herd. Death and legacy Solomon Meredith died on his farm in 1875. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Cambridge City, Indiana. The Grand Army of the Republic Post in Richmond, Indiana, was later named in his honor. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Union) NotesReferences * Gaff, Alan D.

In 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated and the U.S. Senate confirmed Robinson's appointment to the brevet grade of major general in the regular army. He was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for valor in action in 1864 near Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia, where he lost a leg. When he retired from the U.S. Army on May 6, 1869, he was placed on the retired list as a full rank major general, USA. After his army service, he was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1873 to 1874 and served two terms as the president of the Grand Army of the Republic. Early life and career Robinson was born on April 10, 1817 in Binghamton, New York... He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, July 1, 1835. He was expelled from the academy on March 14, 1838 (for insubordination), and went on to study law. After a year as a civilian, he rejoined the army in October 1839 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment.. Robinson traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas, in September 1845 to join Gen. Winfield Scott and the Army of Occupation as a regimental and brigade quartermaster. In June 1846, Robinson was promoted to first lieutenant and served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, fighting with distinction in the Battle of Monterey. He also was in action at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He served as regimental or brigade quartermaster between March 28, 1847 and September 1, 1847 and between January 27, 1849 and August 12, 1850. Robinson was commissioned as a captain on August 12, 1850 and then served in various garrisons. He led troops in several engagements against hostile Indians in Texas in 1853-54. In 1856, Robinson went into combat again, serving in Florida during the Third Seminole War, where he furthered his military record of bravery and efficient services. He led a series of expeditions against the Seminoles in the Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp. At the close of the Seminole War, he was assigned command of Fort Bridger and sent to the Utah Territory. In 1857‚Äì58, he served at Camp Floyd during the Utah War. Camp Floyd had the largest concentration of US Troops at any post prior to the Civil War. While stationed in the desolate Utah Territory he and others petitioned the Freemason's Grand Lodge of Missouri to establish a Masonic Lodge in the Utah Territory. It was granted the March 6, 1859, Rocky Mountain #205 under dispensation from Missouri, and Captain Robinson became the first Worshipful Master of the first Masonic Lodge in Utah. In the late 1850s, he was ordered back east to assume command of Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, Maryland was a border state, remaining loyal to the Union despite being a slave state. Secessionists planned to seize Fort McHenry, but Robinson made it appear that reinforcements were imminent for his small 60-man garrison, and was able to retain control of the fort. Robinson was soon sent to Detroit as an army recruiting officer, and for a short time, assisted Governor William Dennison in raising troops in Columbus, Ohio. In September 1861, he was appointed as colonel of the 1st Michigan Volunteer Infantry, a regiment he helped recruit. That autumn, he was also promoted to major of the 2nd U.S. Infantry in the regular army, concurrent with his assignment in the volunteer army. Within a few months, he was commanding a brigade of volunteers at Newport News, Virginia in preparation for the Peninsula Campaign. With his vast combat experience and with the growing need in the expanding army for senior officers, he was promoted again by President Lincoln on April 30, 1862, to rank from April 28, 1862, to brigadier general of volunteers. He was transferred soon afterwards to the Army of the Potomac, where he assumed command of a brigade in the division of Philip Kearny in the III Corps. He served with distinction during the Peninsula Campaign, particularly at the Seven Days Battles. General Kearny lavishly praised Robinson in his official report. Robinson also fought that year during the Northern Virginia Campaign at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was wounded at Broad Run, Virginia on August 27, 1862. He missed the Maryland Campaign as his brigade was not present. He next fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. He was transferred to command of second division I Corps in time to participate in Chancellorsville in 1863. During the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, Robinson commanded a division in the I Corps north of the borough of Gettysburg. He and his men fought well on July 1, but eventually had to retire through the streets of the town under the pressure of overwhelming numbers. For his valor and meritorious performance at Gettysburg, he was brevetted as a lieutenant colonel in the regular army. He was again brevetted, this time to colonel in the regular army, for his efforts during the Mine Run Campaign and the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness. In the latter battle, Robinson commanded the 2nd Division in the reorganized V Corps, which was composed of his old division plus a brigade of Maryland troops. Robinson presided over the court-martial of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley for his conduct at Gettysburg. After the war he received a Medal of Honor for his actions during a preliminary action to the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the fight at Alsop's farm at Laurel Hill, Virginia, on May 8, 1864. According to the official citation, Robinson \\"placed himself at the head of the leading brigade in a charge upon the enemy's breastworks; was severely wounded\\".. On December 12, 1864, President Lincoln nominated Robinson for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers to rank from June 27, 1864 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865. However, having been shot through the left knee and permanently disabled following its amputation at the thigh, Robinson never returned to field duty after Alsop's Farm. He performed administrative duty as a district commander in the Department of the East for the rest of the war. Postbellum Robinson remained in the army following the cessation of hostilities and was assigned command of the Freedmen's Bureau in Federally occupied North Carolina. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Robinson for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on May 4, 1866. In July 1866, he was promoted to full colonel in the regular army. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Robinson for appointment to the brevet grade of major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866. Robinson was mustered out of the volunteer army on September 1, 1866. In 1867, Robinson was assigned to command of the Military Department of the South. The following year, he was again reassigned, this time to lead the Department of the Lakes. Robinson retired from the U.S. Army on May 6, 1869, receiving a commission to the full grade of major general in the regular army on the date of his retirement. Robinson, as with many leading political and social figures of his day, was a Freemason, becoming a member of Binghamton Lodge #177 and rising through its ranks. Robinson, long a popular figure in New York, was elected the Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1872, serving under Republican Governor John A. Dix. Robinson was active in veterans affairs, and became the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1877 to 1879. A decade later, he was elected as president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. He was also a member of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In his elder years, Robinson lost his eyesight and became totally blind. He died at home on February 18, 1897 at the age of 79 and was buried at Spring Forest Cemetery in Binghamton, Broome County, New York.

The highway runs through rural parts of three counties in the Lower Peninsula. The southern end runs along the Michigan Meridian and parallel to the Tittabawassee River. Prior to 1962, M-30's southern terminus was at a junction with M-46 in Merrill. Since then, the segment south of US Highway 10 (US 10) was returned to local control and decommissioned. In May 2009, M-30 was extended southerly from US 10 to M-20, restoring some of the highway decommissioned in the 1960s to M-30. Route description M-30 is a rural, two-lane highway. M-30 follows Meridian Road starting at an intersection with M-20 (Isabella Road) outside of Midland. From this intersection, the highway runs north along the Michigan Meridian through forest lands to a crossing of the Tittabawassee River near Sanford. M-30 passes through the community and crosses the US 10 freeway near the location where the latter crosses a narrow section of Sanford Lake. The road continues north running parallel to the lake along the meridian to a point near Edenville. There, the highway turns westerly along Curtis Road and then back northerly on Midland Road to a crossing of the Tittabawassee and Wixom Lake. Past the river and lake crossings, M-30 angles to the northeast to return to the Michigan Meridian. The area adjacent to the lake is farm land, but continuing north, the highway returns to the woodlands of the Au Sable State Forest. M-30 intersects M-61 at Wooden Shoe Village near Smallwood Lake. The highway continues to parallel the Tittabawassee River, crossing several of its smaller tributaries, until a point south of the Gladwin‚ÄìOgemaw County county line. The trunkline passes through a small unnamed, unincorporated community northwest of Hockaday near Indian and Elk lakes as the road turns to the northeast between the lakes in the area. M-30 crosses the county line near Edwards and continues northward. The highway turns to the northeast as it approaches West Branch, crossing under Interstate 75 (I-75) without an interchange. M-30 ends at Business Loop I-75/M-55 on the west side of West Branch. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains M-30 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). MDOT calculates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. For 2009, the highest traffic levels were observed on the section north of US 10 at 7,579 vehicles per day. The lowest AADT levels were the 2,952 vehicles between the M-61 junction and the Gladwin‚ÄìOgemaw county line. The survey did not include the section south of US 10. No segment has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-30 was first designated by July 1, 1919. The original routing only ran from Winegars to West Branch. South of Winegars, the roadway is a portion of M-18. An extension of M-18 in 1928 or 1929 south of Beaverton led to the redesignation and extension of M-30 south through Edenville and Sanford to end at M-46. M-30 was completely paved as the last of gravel roadway were completed between Sanford and the Midland‚ÄìSaginaw county line in 1961. The next year, when M-30 was truncated to end at the US 10 freeway in Sanford, the remaining portion south of US 10 was turned over to county control. On May 13, 2009, the Midland County Road Commission (MCRC) and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) signed a Memorandum of Understanding that transferred control of Meridian Road south of US 10 to M-20. The roadway transferred included a newly constructed bridge over the Tittabawassee River and other segments of roadway rebuilt by the MCRC. On May 20, 2020, the bridge carrying M-30 over Wixom Lake collapsed after two dams on the Tittabawassee River failed, leading to severe flooding.

Fleet Company in Lynchburg, Va. Phospho soda consisted mostly of monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate and dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate. Phospho soda is often taken in a double dose (the usual 45ml dose, followed by a second 45ml dose 6 hours later), to prepare for colonoscopy. It is still used outside the US. An amount of Phospho soda (normally 1.5 fluid ounce or 45 ml) is usually mixed with water or other clear liquids such as ginger ale. This preparation usually results in a bowel movement anywhere from 30 minutes to 6 hours after it is taken. Phospho soda is also available in various flavors to make it more palatable. Safety issues The use of Phospho soda has been known to lead to acute phosphate nephropathy. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), \\"Acute phosphate nephropathy is a form of acute kidney injury that is associated with deposits of calcium-phosphate crystals in the renal tubules that may result in permanent renal function impairment. Acute phosphate nephropathy is a rare, serious adverse event that has been associated with the use of OSPs [oral sodium phosphates]. The occurrence of these events was previously described in an Information for Healthcare Professionals sheet and an FDA Science Paper issued in May 2006. Additional cases of acute phosphate nephropathy have been reported to FDA and described in the literature since these were issued.\\" https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm103354.htm Fleet‚Äôs Phospho-soda products have been linked to kidney damage since the 1990s. On December 11, 2008, the FDA issued a Safety Alert stating that \\"FDA has become aware of reports of acute phosphate nephropathy, a type of acute kidney injury, associated with the use of oral sodium phosphate products (OSP) for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy or other procedures. These products include the prescription products, Visicol and OsmoPrep, and OSPs available over-the-counter without a prescription as laxatives (e.g., Fleet Phospho- soda). In some cases when used for bowel cleansing, these serious adverse events have occurred in patients without identifiable factors that would put them at risk for developing acute kidney injury ... The agency is equally concerned about the risks associated with the use of OSP products that are available over-the-counter (OTC), for example, Fleet Phospho-soda, when used at higher doses for bowel cleansing.\\" Recall Following FDA's Alert, C.B. Fleet recalled its Fleet Phospho-Soda Products. Use as a laxative Phospho soda can be used for a general laxative, but is not recommended. The dosage then is best cut in half and used only once instead of twice. Phospho soda works by drawing liquid from the body into the colon, therefore it can cause severe dehydration, especially if not used properly. Usage in this context is highly recommended to be performed only with a doctor's knowledge and consent. Use as preparation for colonoscopy When Phospho soda is used as preparation for colonoscopy, 1.5 fluid ounces (45ml), mixed with an equal amount of water or any clear liquid and followed by 8 oz of water, is taken, followed by a second dose 6 hours later (3 oz total). It will cause very loose, eventually watery stools, usually starting within an hour or so and lasting several hours. A 2007 study showed that in patients with decreased renal function, Phospho soda may worsen renal impairment compared to polyethylene glycol-based laxatives. In patients without kidney problems, no difference was observed. Litigation Since late 2004, there has been a great deal of litigation in both state and federal courts alleging renal injury following the use of Fleet Phospho-Soda. On June 23, 2009, the United States Judicial Panel on Multi District Litigation consolidated all federal Oral Sodium Phosphate Solution lawsuits to the Northern District of Ohio, before the Honorable Ann Aldrich.

Early life and career Hays was born in Franklin, Pennsylvania, the son of Samuel Hays, a member of Congress and general in the Pennsylvania militia. He studied at Allegheny College and then transferred to the United States Military Academy in his senior year, graduating in 1844, ranking 20th out of 25 cadets. Among his classmates were future Civil War generals Alfred Pleasonton and Winfield S. Hancock. He became a close personal friend of Ulysses S. Grant, who had graduated the year before. Hays was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Infantry. He served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and won special distinction in an engagement near Atlixco. In April 1848, he resigned his commission in the army and returned to Pennsylvania. He settled in Venango County, where he engaged in the manufacture of iron from 1848‚Äì50 before briefly leaving for the California gold fields to seek his fortune. Failing that, he returned home and became an assistant construction engineer for the railroad until 1854. From 1854 through 1860, Hays was a civil engineer for the city of Pittsburgh, helping plan several bridge building projects. Civil War At the beginning of the Civil War, Hays re-entered the service as colonel of the 63rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, also holding the rank of captain in the 16th U.S. Infantry in the regular army to date from May 14, 1861. His men knew him to be \\"as brave as a lion.\\"Tagg, p. 53. During the Peninsula Campaign, he was attached with his regiment to the first brigade of Kearny's division of Heintzelman's III Corps. He fought in the battles of Yorktown, Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Savage's Station, and Malvern Hill. At the close of the Seven Days Battles, he was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel in the regular army for gallantry in action, as Hays had directed a bayonet charge with his regiment into the enemy lines to cover the retreat of his brigade. Hays briefly went on sick leave a month later, suffering from partial blindness and paralysis of his left arm, injuries incurred from battle. Hays resumed command of the 63rd Pennsylvania during the Northern Virginia Campaign in August and again led a charge in the Second Battle of Bull Run, receiving a painful wound that shattered his leg. While recovering, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers, September 29, 1862. Early in 1863 Hays was made a brigade commander in XXII Corps in the defenses of Washington, D.C. His brigade, composed largely of troops surrendered after the Battle of Harpers Ferry, was added to the Army of the Potomac as the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, II Corps. General Alexander Hays (c. 1914) by J. Otto Schweizer, Gettysburg Battlefield, Gettysburg, PA. Due to his seniority, after the reassignment of William H. French, Hays was assigned command of the third Division during the Gettysburg Campaign. (Col. George L. Willard took command of Hays's brigade.) During the Battle of Gettysburg, Hays's division defended the right of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. The division held firm in the repulse of the Confederate attack on July 3, 1863, even counterattacking the left flank of the Confederate attacking force. Hays's passion and flair for the dramatic led to a notable incident as Confederate prisoners were being rounded up: \\"When the smoke cleared, Hays, who was unhurt but had had two horses shot out from under him, kissed his aide in the exhilaration of the moment, grabbed a captured Rebel battle flag and riding down the division's line dragged it in the dirt ...\\" For his efforts at Gettysburg, Hays gained the brevet rank of colonel in the regular army. Later returning to divisional command before the Bristoe Campaign, he was engaged at Auburn and Mine Run. Hays's last major engagement as a division commander was at Morton's Ford on the Rapidan River in Virginia on February 6, 1864. A demonstration in force by II Corps became a bloody fiasco with Hays's division suffering 252 casualties. Stories about Hays being drunk on duty arose from that defeat by Confederates of Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's corps.Mahood, pp. 142‚Äì48. When the Army of the Potomac was reorganized in early 1864 under his friend Grant's guidance, Hays was placed in command of the 2nd Brigade of Birney's 3rd Division of the II Corps. Hays was unhappy at losing division command but was happy to serve once more under Birney, with whom he had campaigned in III Corps.Mahood, pp. 150‚Äì52. During the Overland Campaign, Hays was killed in action near the junction of the Brock and Plank Roads in the Wilderness, being struck in the head by a Mini√© ball. He was buried in Allegheny Cemetery (Section 8, Lot 149) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a campaign stop in Pittsburgh during his run for the presidency, Ulysses S. Grant visited Hays's grave and wept openly., citing period Pittsburgh newspapers. Honors Post #3 of the Grand Army of the Republic in Pittsburgh was named for General Alexander Hays, as was Fort Hays and the city of Hays in Kansas. Alexander Hays Road in Bristow, Virginia, is named for him. The road is in New Bristow Village in Bristow, Virginia, adjacent to the Bristoe Station Battlefield.

Hobart Ward, was a career United States Army soldier who fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and served in the New York state militia. He also served as a Union general during the American Civil War. During the Civil War he was wounded several times, and noted for both his performance in the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg and for his misconduct in the 1864 Battle of the Wilderness. After the war Ward worked in New York's Superior Court, and was also remembered for his death when he was hit by a train. Early life Ward was born in New York City to a family of military veterans. His grandfather John Ward had fought in the American Revolutionary War and had suffered a disabling wound, as had his father, James Ward, during the War of 1812. Hobart Ward was educated at Trinity College and enlisted at the age of 18 in the 7th U.S. Infantry. He was promoted several times over the next four years, reaching the rank of Sergeant Major. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Ward saw considerable combat action during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, fighting in the siege of Fort Brown and being wounded at the Battle of Monterrey. He recovered in time to participate in the capture of Veracruz. Ward returned to his native New York and served as assistant commissary general from 1851 until 1855, when he became the state's commissary general, a post he held until 1859. Civil War service Responding to President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms at the outbreak of the Civil War, Ward recruited the 38th New York Infantry and was appointed its first colonel. He led his regiment at the July 1861 First Battle of Bull Run, becoming acting commander of Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's brigade when the latter was wounded in battle. He next saw action in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign in Brig. Gen. David B. Birney's brigade of III Corps. Ward continued to perform well during the Northern Virginia Campaign, seeing more action at Second Bull Run and Chantilly. For his efforts, he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on October 4, 1862, and assigned command of what had been Birney's brigade in the III Corps of the Army of the Potomac. (Birney had succeeded Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny, who had been killed leading his division at Chantilly.) Ward commanded the brigade at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Gettysburg During the Gettysburg Campaign, Ward's brigade was assigned on July 2 by Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles to hold a large area from the Wheatfield Road to Devil's Den. Stretched thin with little reserves, Ward's brigade nevertheless held their ground stubbornly. Regiments were moved to threatened points of the line, especially the left flank. Finally it was driven back by determined Confederate attacks. Ward became temporary commander of the division when Birney assumed corps command following the wounding of General Sickles. Col. Hiram Berdan took command of Ward's brigade. Ward lost 781 officers and men out of 2,188 present, a loss of 35.7%.Gottfried, p. 194. Ward suffered a wound on July 2 but did not relinquish command.Eicher, p. 553. Late 1863 and 1864 Ward was again wounded later that summer in fights at Kelly's Ford and Wapping Heights. During the Overland Campaign in the spring of 1864, he was assigned a brigade of Birney's 3rd Division, II Corps, one of the divisions in III Corps before the army reorganization of March 1864. Ward was wounded in the head at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Removed from command on May 12 by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock for \\"misbehavior and intoxication in the presence of the enemy during the battle of the Wilderness,\\" Ward was arrested on June 12. Despite these charges, he was nevertheless honorably mustered out on July 18, 1864.Warner, p. 538; Eicher, p. 553. Postbellum career After the war, he was a civil employee of New York City, serving as a clerk in the Superior Court from 1871 to 1896. Death At the age of eighty, Ward died in Monroe, New York, after being struck by a passing Erie Railroad train. Following a funeral in Brooklyn, his body was brought back to Monroe and buried in the city's Community Cemetery.

It is located in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of the state. Along its route, M-42 begins in Manton and ends north of Lake City, some apart. The highway used to run much farther. Former termini included the Traverse City area from 1919 until 1940 and Mesick from 1940 until 2007.  Route description  M-42 cosigned with Bus. US 131 just west of the interchange with US 131 at Manton M-42 is a rural, two-lane highway connecting Manton and Lake City. It runs through wooded terrain on gently rolling hills. Between the western terminus at Michigan Avenue and the US Highway 131 (US 131) freeway in Manton, M-42 runs concurrently Bus. US 131 along Seventh Street. It runs east along Seventh Street to a folded diamond interchange at exit 191 on US 131 east of downtown. Continuing east, it is known as North Road until it crosses the Wexford‚ÄìMissaukee county line at Seeley Road approximately east of the freeway. Here the road name changes to Mike and Tony Road before M-42 curves southeasterly crossing Morrisy Creek on West Walker Road. East of the unincorporated community of Arlene the highway turns ninety degrees to the south off Walker Road before angling southeasterly skirting the edge of some hills near Dyer Lake just west of M-66. The road turns back due east between Al Moses Road and M-66, where it ends north of Lake City. No section of the trunkline is part of the National Highway System.  History  M-42 is an original state trunkline dating back to the 1919 signage of the highway system in Michigan. The original highway routing started at M-13 in Manton and ran due west to Mesick. From there the highway turned north and met M-11 at Chums Corners. M-11/M-42 ran concurrently northward into the City of Traverse City where M-42 ended. By May 1929, M-42 was extended east to connect to Lake City. The highway was further extended before 1936 up the Old Mission Peninsula north of Traverse City. In the latter half of 1940, the M-37 designation replaced M-42 north of Mesick through Traverse City to Old Mission. The last sections of highway were paved in late 1951 and early 1952. In 2007, the stretch of M-42 between M-37 and US 131 along 16 Road was transferred to the Wexford County Road Commission. This change shortened the highway from to . The section of transferred highway in Wexford County was labeled as \\"flexible pavements\\" on the 2006 MDOT Truck Operators Map. This classification meant truck traffic on the roadway was subject to weight and load restrictions during spring.

Life and career Aurora Theater (Lawrence, Kansas) advertising a Vitagraph picture with John Bunny and Flora Finch Finch was born into a music hall and travelling theatrical family in London and was taken to the United States as a young child. She kept up the family tradition and worked in theatre and the vaudeville circuit right up until her 30s. She had her first film roles at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company starting in 1908. There she worked with Fatty Arbuckle, Mack Sennett (with whom she was romantically involved for a short time) and Charlie Chaplin amongst others. With Bessie Love in The Great Adventure (1918) Starting in 1910 at Vitagraph, she was paired with John Bunny for the first of 160 very popular shorts made between 1910 and 1915. These shorts, known as \\"Bunnygraphs\\", \\"Bunnyfinches\\", and \\"Bunnyfinchgraphs\\", established Finch and Bunny as the first popular comedy team in films. The duo became a short-lived trio, when Mabel Normand arrived at the studio. After Bunny's death in 1915 she continued to make comedy shorts, but with less success. She started her own production company in 1916, and released a film with the company the following year, but was never able to regain her popularity. One of her best- known roles in the later silent years was Aunt Susan in Paul Leni's The Cat and the Canary (1927). In Postal Inspector (1936) She found film work in the sound era, but only in small supporting parts. The Scarlet Letter (1934) gave her one of her more substantial roles in sound films, and she had a cameo in one of Laurel and Hardy's best-known films Way Out West (1937). Her last film was The Women (1939). Most of her films are now lost. Flora Finch died at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles from blood poisoning. She was taken to the hospital after a streptococcus infection followed an accidental cut to her arm. The infection spread beyond control and the actress lapsed into a coma from bronchial pneumonia. At the time of her death, she was working as a stock player at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios.

In Europe, where many cities have histories (and roads) hundreds of years'-long, necessitated that panel vans were (and still are) typically smaller than those elsewhere, and are built on either a bespoke chassis or the chassis of a subcompact car. In Australia, panel vans were a development of the ute (a small pickup truck based on a passenger car chassis, e.g. Chevrolet El Camino), often using the longer wheelbase of the station wagon chassis.  Origins  It is not known when the first panel van entered production, but it had become an established type of vehicle by the end of the 1920s. The panel van body style has experienced separate evolutions in America, Europe and Australia, as a result of the separate evolutions of the passenger car platforms (upon which the panel van is based) in each region. North America A panel van is often known as a delivery in North America. It's an older term that usually only applies to station wagon-based vehicles (sedan deliveries/delivery wagons) such as the Chevrolet Delray and Ford Courier,https://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/3761321826 or pickup- based vans (panel deliveries).https://www.flickr.com/photos/autohistorian/16133236350 Large, boxy unibody vans based on truck platforms (such as the Ford Transit,https://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit-cargo-van/?gnav=header- all-vehicles Ram ProMaster,https://www.ramtrucks.com/ram-promaster.html and Chevrolet Expresshttps://www.chevrolet.com/commercial/express-cargo-van) as well as smaller unibody vans (like the Ford Transit Connecthttps://www.ford.com/commercial-trucks/transit-connect-cargo- van/?gnav=header-all-vehicles and Ram Promaster Cityhttps://www.ramtrucks.com/ram-promaster-city.html) are usually referred to as cargo vans or just panel vans. Larger vehicles built on a chassis cab with a custom cargo box are usually called box trucks or moving vans. In the late 1920s, Ford produced \\"Town Car Delivery\\" and \\"Wood Panel Delivery\\" as part of the Ford Model A model range. Later Plymouth produced a sedan delivery from 1935 until 1941. Pontiac produced deliveries until 1953 in the U.S. and until 1958 in Canada based on the Pontiac Pathfinder. Sedan delivery models were usually produced in small quantities of 200 or less, for example 449 Canadian Pontiac sedan deliveries were built in 1958. From 1959 on, the sedan delivery was no longer practical; it was phased out in 1960 as a Chevrolet model, so the requisite Chevrolet body was no longer available.1960‚Äì61 Chevrolet Full- Line Truck brochures With the growing sales of the Volkswagen Type 2 and the introduction of compact vans, sedan deliveries faded from the scene. Chevrolet dropped the body type after 1960, while Ford moved it to the Falcon line-up until 1965. In the 1970s, Chevrolet and Ford offered subcompact sedan deliveries with the Chevrolet Vega Panel Express and the Ford Pinto Panel Wagon. The Vega Panel Express was introduced in September 1970 and it was Chevy's first sedan delivery in ten years since the final full-size model was offered in 1960. The Vega Panel Express body style accounted for less than 2% of the total Chevrolet Vegas produced during the 1971 through 1975 model years. First year sales of the Vega Panel Express peaked at 7,800 units and after leveling off to 4,000 units per year, only 1,525 were sold in 1975.h-body.org The Pontiac Astre Panel, Pontiac's version of the Vega Panel Express, was available in Canada in the 1973‚Äì75 model years and in the US for 1975. The Pinto Panel Wagon was introduced in 1976 and was offered in both a commercial and a \\"factory customized\\" Pinto Cruising Wagon version that featured a round porthole style window on each side. The Ford Courier name, previously used for Ford sedan delivery vans, began to be used with Ford's import pickup truck line. In 2002, Chrysler showed a concept car edition of a panel van based on the PT Cruiser at the North American International Auto Show, but it was not manufactured. In 2007 Chevrolet released a panel van version of the HHR, marketed as the HHR Panel. The small cargo vans currently sold by American manufacturers are from their overseas divisions, for example the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Ram ProMaster City. Europe European panel vans of the 20th century include the Citro√´n 2CV Fourgonnette, Citro√´n H Van, Citro√´n C15, Ford Escort, Morris Minor, Renault Estafette, SEAT Inca and more recently the Renault Kangoo and the Opel Combo. From the 1950s onwards, a larger alternative to the panel van was the van (based on a commercial vehicle chassis instead of a passenger car chassis), such as the Volkswagen Type 2, the DKW van and the first-generation Ford Transit in 1965. In the United Kingdom, panel vans benefit from having lower taxes than station wagons and do not have the speed restrictions which apply to larger vans. This has given rise to some anomalies. Authorities and dealers are not always certain on what qualifies as a car-derived van. SUVs and crossovers are also popularly turned into light commercial vehicles without rear seats. Examples of panel vans from the last 30 years are the Renault Kangoo (1997), the Fiat Dobl√≤ (2001), Opel Combo (2001), Ford Transit Connect (2002) or the Volkswagen Caddy (2004). They are also purpose-designed to be utilitarian base model MPVs / people carriers, for a range of such vehicles. Since the 1980s, most manufacturers have offered light van versions of their small hatchbacks, sharing bodywork with the regular passenger version. These versions have the rear seats removed and may have blanked rear windows, depending on local regulations. As of 2019, the market consists of the following models and many more: * Citro√´n Berlingo * Dacia Dokker * Fiat Fiorino * Fiat Dobl√≤ * Ford Fiesta Sport Van * Ford Transit Courier * Ford Transit Custom * Mercedes-Benz Citan * Nissan NV200 * Opel/Vauxhall Combo * Peugeot Partner * Renault Kangoo * Toyota ProAce City * Volkswagen Caddy Australia The first Holden panel van produced in Australia was the FJ Holden, which was released in December 1953, although many manufacturers offered panel vans in their range prior to this.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/248559792https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/117228097https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/117198825https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/244885752https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/198235846https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/169584951https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/244599199https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/243462300 As per many Australian panel vans, it was based on the ute model, with additional body work at the rear. In May 1961, Ford Australia released a panel van version of the XK Falcon, marketed as the \\"sedan delivery\\" body style. The first panel van by Chrysler Valiant was part of the CL Valiant model range and was introduced in April 1977. Painters, electricians, general labourers and film crews would often use panel vans, due to the extra cargo area and customisable interior in a relatively compact vehicle. Australian police forces also used panel vans as police vans (nicknamed \\"divvy vans\\" or \\"paddywagons\\"). Early Australian panel vans used swing-down and -up tailgates and a standard roof height, due to their origins of the ute body style. Some later models offered horizontally opening rear doors (nicknamed \\"barn doors\\") and a higher roofline for increased cargo area. By the early 1970s, at a time when the American panelvan was in decline, panel vans had become Australian cultural icons. The most popular model was the Holden Sandman, which was marketed towards young men, in particular targeting the surfing lifestyle. The first Sandman was built in small numbers in 1974 for the HQ model range, however the model's popularity greatly increased with the following HJ generation, which was released in October 1974. In the 1979 movie Mad Max, a modified 1975 HJ Sandman model appeared as one of the vehicles driven by the lead character (played by Mel Gibson). Ford's equivalent of the Sandman was the Surferoo model, which was introduced into the XB Falcon model range in 1973, which was not a successful model. The Surfaroo was replaced by the more popular Sundowner model, which was introduced into the XC Falcon range in 1977. In 1976, Chrysler released a similar model called the Drifter, which was part of the Chrysler CL Valiant. The Drifter was not a success and ceased production in 1978. Younger drivers were especially attracted to panel vans, for reasons such as the ease with which a mattress could be installed within the cargo bay. Consequently, panel vans also attracted nicknames such as \\"sin bins,\\" and \\"shaggin' wagons\\". This kind of activity was frequently carried out at the local drive-in theatre. During the 1970s it also became fashionable to decorate the exterior sides with murals, often painted with intricate detail. Along with the Volkswagen Kombi, panel vans were very popular with surfers, as it was convenient to sleep in the cargo bay while carrying surfboards on the roof. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture ‚Äì order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The final Sandman model was during the Holden HZ series and featured a choice of V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, which would cost in excess of 50% more than a basic HZ panel van, Holden would include a velvet mattress with Holden logo embroidered. The Sandman ute was phased out in October 1979, followed by the Sandman panel van prior to the end of the HZ series. Panel vans in general were declining in popularity during the 1980s. Holden's last panel van was the WB model, which ceased production in 1984. Subsequently, Ford became the sole manufacturer of them until 1999 when production of last entry in the history of the Australian panel van, the XH Falcon, ceased. In 2000, Holden unveiled a Sandman show car based on their Holden VU Ute of the time. This Sandman was never released, however from 2003 to 2005 an optional canopy in the same style was sold as panel vans, however they still retained the rear window and firewall of the ute they were originally based on, preventing movement between the cargo bay and the passenger cab, as offered by traditional panel vans.

Enrolling just over 1,000 students, the school is organized in three academic divisions, including the Alliance Theological Seminary, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Graduate and Professional Programs. Nyack offers both on- campus and online courses as part of its undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs. The college plans to close its Nyack location and consolidate to its New York presence at its Manhattan campus beginning September 2020. History AB Simpson, founder of Nyack College and the Christian and Missionary Alliance Originally known as the Missionary Training Institute, the school was founded in 1882 in New York City by Dr. A.B. Simpson. Simpson resigned from a prestigious New York City pastorate to develop an interdenominational fellowship devoted to serving unreached people. Simpson's view was shared by many of his contemporaries, including mainline church leaders, laborers, and theological scholars. The Missionary Training Institute was later granted a charter by the New York Board of Regents and the school's curriculum was registered by the State Education Department in 1944. In 1953, the school was authorized to confer the Bachelor of Science degree and, in 1961, the Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1960, the corporation was authorized to conduct a post-baccalaureate program as the forerunner of the Alliance Theological Seminary. Nyack first received school accreditation in 1962 from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1963, the school became a member of the American Council on Education. After more than a decade of nomadic address changes for the Institute‚Äîincluding Eighth Avenue and 44th Street in Manhattan (now John's Pizzeria)‚Äî28 acres of land were purchased in Rockland County, New York. In 1897, the school relocated to the village of South Nyack and became widely known as a Bible college and institute for ministry preparation. The seminary was established in 1960 as the Jaffray School of Missions, a graduate program of the college. The Jaffray School of Missions emphasized the interdisciplinary encounter between theology and the social sciences. In 1974, the Jaffray program was redesigned to include the preparation of students for ministry in North America and abroad. The name of the seminary was subsequently changed to the Alliance School of Theology and Missions. In September 1979, the Alliance School of Theology and Missions became Alliance Theological Seminary, which is recognized by the Christian and Missionary Alliance as the denomination's official seminary in the United States. The students of 1894‚Äì95 (when Nyack College was called the Missionary Training Institute) The school changed its name to Nyack College in 1972 and began offering professional degree programs like education and business in the early 1970s. In 1997 the school returned to Manhattan with a branch campus. Steady growth in enrollment at the leased space in Lower Manhattan at 361 Broadway prompted a search in 2008 for a new permanent home for the New York City campus, an initiative that became known as The Miracle in Manhattan. In 2012, Nyack College and Alliance Theological Seminary signed a 20-year lease with a two-year option to purchase the on eight floors of the structure at 2 Washington Street in historic Battery Park. Classes began in the new facility in fall 2013. On November 7, 2018 the college announced plans to close its Nyack campus and consolidate its New York operations in its Manhattan-based campus by fall 2019. The Nyack campus was scheduled to close at the end of the 2018-19 academic year, however delays in housing have pushed that out to September 2020. The college has multiple debts totaling in excess of $70 million, mainly stemming from the purchase of the Manhattan campus. The closure of the Rockland campus is an attempt to curb the school's operation costs. Administration and organization Dr. Michael Scales, President of Nyack College (2015) The college is led by an executive team with the top three officers ‚Äî President, Provost, and Executive Vice President ‚Äî who collectively have 84 years of service with the institution.

At Nyack, 53% of the instructional faculty members are Asian, black or Hispanic; the college has an even divide between male and female staff. The Chronicle of Higher Education has named Nyack College a ‚ÄúGreat College to Work For‚Äù for five consecutive years. The college has also received high marks in the areas of work/life balance, respect and appreciation, compensation and benefits, and diversity. In addition, U.S. News and World Report designated the college \\"Best Ethnic Diversity for North Regional Universities.\\" Academics Nyack offers undergraduate, graduate, and seminary programs and is divided into seven individual schools: *The School of Business and Leadership *The School of Education *The School of Human Services *The School of Music *The College of Arts and Sciences *The College of Bible and Christian Ministry *Alliance Theological Seminary Undergraduate degrees in 41 majors include Associate in Arts, Associate in Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Sacred Music.

Noel Douglas Sickles (January 24, 1910 - October 3, 1982) was an American commercial illustrator and cartoonist, best known for the comic strip Scorchy Smith. Sickles was born in Chillicothe, Ohio. Largely self-taught, his career began as a political cartoonist for the Ohio State Journal in the late 1920s. At that time he met and shared a studio with cartoonist Milton Caniff, then working for the Columbus Dispatch. Sickles followed Caniff, creator of the Terry and the Pirates comic strip, to New York City in 1933, where both men initially worked as staff artists for the Associated Press. Scorchy Smith Noel Sickles' Scorchy Smith (October 2. 1936) Sickles was assigned to the action/adventure comic Scorchy Smith, whose creator, John Terry, was suffering from tuberculosis. Loosely modeled on Charles Lindbergh, Scorchy was a pilot-for-hire who flew into numerous high- octane globe-trotting adventures. The series, which started in 1930, was heavily influenced by Roy Crane‚Äôs adventure strip Wash Tubbs. Sickles initially illustrated the strip as a ghost artist, but he signed his own name after Terry's 1934 death. Sickles' artwork was much admired and proved highly influential to other comic strip artists. His compositions were cinematic in style, and he had a brisk, impressionistic style of inking that he referred to as ‚Äúchiaroscuro.‚Äù Sickles also was adept in his application of the shading medium Zipatone. Sickles and Caniff worked together for two years, sometimes writing and drawing each other's strips. Caniff acknowledged being heavily influenced by Sickles. Magazine illustration Sickles asked the newspaper syndicate for a salary raise in 1936, and when he was turned down, he quit, becoming a successful commercial illustrator. He also ghosted the daily strip The Adventures of Patsy, but otherwise the rest of his career was devoted to magazine illustration. For Life, he illustrated the original publications of The Old Man and the Sea and The Bridges at Toko-Ri. Awards and reprints He received the National Cartoonists Society's Advertising and Illustration Award for 1960 and 1962. His Scorchy Smith strips were reprinted in Famous Funnies and in two collections published by Nostalgia Press in the 1970s. The end of his run was reprinted in Big Fun Comics (published by American Comic Archive) which also published Bert Christman's run on the strip. In 2008 IDW Publishing published Scorchy Smith and the Art of Noel Sickles, which reprints the complete 1933‚Äì36 run of Scorchy Smith by Sickles. He received the Inkpot Award in 1976.Inkpot Award In 1983, Sickles was posthumously inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame. Death Sickles died in Tucson, Arizona October 3, 1982. Sickles was interred in Grandview Cemetery, Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio.

TCP was introduced in 1918. The brand name comes from its original chemical name, which was trichlorophenylmethyliodosalicyl (not to be confused with trichlorophenol, a common fungicide). Trichlorophenylmethyliodosalicyl was replaced as the active ingredient by a mixture of phenol and halogenated phenols in the 1950s. The liquid form of TCP is one of the best-known brands of antiseptic in the UK, and its distinctively strong medicinal odour can be identified by many as a generic antiseptic smell. Omega Pharma acquired the rights to TCP from Pfizer in 2004.According to a spokesperson for Pfizer in South Africa, as reported by Liz Clark, Daily News, March 6, 2006 Edition 1, Durban, South Africa Since its reintroduction it no longer contains the same amount of phenol. Also Sodium salicylate, an anti-inflammatory and pain compound, has been removed entirely from the new formulation http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/303079/new-antiseptic-tcp-not-the-same-as- the-original-you-grew-up-with Forms As of October 2013, TCP was available in , , and bottles as a clear yellow liquid. A TCP throat lozenge is also available. TCP was available formerly as an ointment, TCP Original Antiseptic Ointment 30 g. A spray plaster was or is available under the TCP brand. Uses The instructions on the TCP bottle state that TCP can be used for sore throats, mouth ulcers, cuts, grazes, bites and stings, boils, spots and pimples. It can also be used as a mouthwash when diluted, and can also be used as a general disinfectant. Harmful effects Published advice states that TCP should not be swallowed, and recommends drinking plenty of water if 30ml or more of TCP is swallowed, and seeking medical advice if discomfort persists.Medicines.org.uk: TCP Phenolic compounds such as those in TCP are harmful to cats.Ashleigh Veterinary Centre: disinfectants Ingredients TCP Liquid's active ingredients are halogenated phenols and phenol. (One source says each millilitre () of TCP antiseptic contains, Chlorinated Phenols ; Phenol ; Iodinated Phenols ; Sodium Salicylate .) It also contains glycerol, concentrated phosphoric acid, Quinoline Yellow WS and water. Formerly, when the product was manufactured by Unicliffe Ltd, the bottle label's list of ingredients stated, referring to the solution of halogenated phenolic bodies, \\"with partial elimination of the ionisable halides\\". In popular culture TCP was referred to numerous times in a running gag in Episode 2 of Series 2 of the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave, alluding to its distinctive and long- lasting odour. TCP was mentioned as an ingredient in a tonic in the film The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It (1977). In the 1963 Ian Fleming story Agent 007 in New York, James Bond laments the fact that one of his lovers always gargles with TCP after their trysts. TCP is used as the subject of a song by the same name on The Boys' 1978 album Alternative Chartbusters written by Honest John Plain. TCP is mentioned in the song \\"Obsessions\\" by Suede. In the Black Mirror episode Metalhead (series 4 episode 5), a broken bottle of TCP is seen being pulled out of a backpack in advance of minor surgery. A bottle of TCP is also briefly seen in the film Shallow Grave (1994) in the scene following Ewan McGregor's character Alex being beaten up. It was also referenced in TV sitcom ‚Äò‚ÄôOnly Fools and Horses‚Äô‚Äô where lead character Del Boy is said to have treated a stab wound with ‚ÄúTCP and a flannel‚Äù, owing to his fear of hospitals.

Outside of the ring, Annis has been a mentor to several young wrestlers and has been a trainer at wrestling schools. Among his trainees are Jack Evans, Pete Wilson and his younger cousin Matt Hart. Annis is also a cat lover and breeder of Persian cats which he has used sometimes in storylines and brought with him to matches.  Early life  Annis is the oldest male grandchild of Stu and Helen Hart and the second oldest overall. His mother is of Greek descent through her maternal grandmother and Irish through her maternal grandfather. His maternal grandfather was of Scots-Irish, English and Scottish descent. On his father's side he is part Italian. Annis grew up with three siblings, two sisters named Annie and Angela, as well as a younger brother named Matthew who died of Necrotizing fasciitis in 1996. Annis is the cousin of fellow professional wrestlers Natalya Neidhart, Mike Hart, Matt Hart, Harry Smith, Bruce Hart Jr. and Torrin Hart as well as wrestling personalities Lindsay Hart and Georgia Smith.  Professional wrestling career  Hart debuted in July 1995 at Rockyford, Alberta, where he teamed up with his brother, Matthew, and defeated his cousin, Harry Smith, and TJ Wilson. In the Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling promotion, Hart teamed with Smith, Wilson and Jack Evans. In 2000, he wrestled for and was a key creative figure in the Matrats promotion. At the age of 16, he wrestled in the opening match of a World Wrestling Federation house show in Calgary, teaming with his cousin, Harry Smith, against Andrew Picarnic and T.J. Wilson (Tyson Kidd) as a tribute to his brother, Matthew, who had recently died.  World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998‚Äì2002)  In 1998, Hart became the youngest person ever to be signed to a World Wrestling Federation developmental contract, and was sent to train with Dory Funk, Jr. at the \\"Funkin' Conservatory\\". However, he was later released by the WWF, due to alleged attitude problems.  Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003‚Äì2004)  On September 20, 2003, Teddy wrestled for Ring of Honor in Philadelphia on their September event Glory by Honor II, where he defeated partner and friend, TJ Wilson. Backstage, however, the Special K faction confronted Hart, and mocked him for not being a good high-flying wrestler. On November 1, 2003, Hart competed at a Ring of Honor show in Elizabeth, New Jersey as part of a Scramble Cage match. After losing the match, he began to perform moonsaults and executed a shooting star press from the top of the cage rather than selling the moves he had taken. Hart then vomited at ringside. His actions attracted the ire of many wrestlers, as he endangered some wrestlers by performing moves on them which they were not anticipating. Hart attributes his actions to a concussion suffered during the match, and has since only wrestled at two ROH shows, At Our Best, on March 13, 2004 and \\"Final Battle 2009\\" against Jack Evans. Hart made several appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. In August 2003, he defeated Jonny Storm and then lost to Juventud Guerrera in the course of the Super X Cup Tournament. He returned in March 2004 as a member of Team Canada, and represented them as its original captain in the second America's X-Cup, where Hart defeated Mr. √Åguila in the first match.

Geography and climate Andora is also situated in the western part of the Italian Riviera between Capo Mele in the east and Capo Mimosa in the west. This coastal area is called the Riviera delle Palme (Riviera of Palms), which is centred on Savona. To the west is the Riviera dei Fiore (Riviera of Flowers), which stretches from the French border to Cervo. Andora had a population of 7,638 in 2008 ISTAT date which swells to almost 10 times this in the summer months.Sito Ufficiale della Provincia di Savona - Comuni The original town is on a low hill by the left bank of the River Merula where it flows into the sea. Marina di Andora is the development which spread along the coastline from the Middle Ages onwards, first as a fishing and boatbuilding center, then in the last 50 years as a tourist resort. It is from Savona, the main town in the province, from Imperia, from Sanremo and from Genoa. The territory forms part of the Mountain Community of Ingauna. Some of the parishes belonging to Andora include Conna, Colla Micheri, San Bartolomeo, San Pietro, Stellanello and Rollo.Andora History The first settlement here dates back to the 8th century BC with the Phocaeans escaping from Asia Minor. During the Roman Empire, Castrum Andorae underwent substantial development due to its strategic location on the Via Julia Augusta. After the invasion by the Goths in 951 it formed part of the Marca Alemanica and from 1091 passed to Bonifacio di Vasto. From 1125 the Clavesana family took over and constructed a defensive fortification, mainly to control the means of communication, and enhanced the town with towers, churches and town walls. Due to war the family had to sell the territory and its castle in 1252 to the Republic of Genoa initiating a period of five centuries of peace.Riviera Ligure delle Palme In this period olive trees were grown and olive oil produced, fishing was practiced and boat building begun. At the end of the 18th century the area became under the control of Napoleon Bonaparte in the new department of Montenotte. It later fell to the rule of Sardinia and then Italy.Comunit√† Montana Ingauna, Guide Gallery, 1990 From a population of 1,940 in 1861 it grew to 3,328 in 1961 to 6,068 in 1981 and by 2001 had reached 6,767. Main sights There is a historical nucleus on a hill inland around the remains of the Clavesana Castle which was once home to the governor of Genoa. Just opposite is the chapel of St Nicholas and ruins of some medeviel houses. The church of St James and St. Phillip, which is based on the cathedral in Albenga, was built in local stone with columns and pillars in late Romanesque style. A little further down the hill is the castle tower which was built between 1220 and 1240 and still remains intact. A bridge on the River Merula with 10 arches is called the Roman Bridge but it was actually built in the Middle Ages on the site of a pre-existing older structure. The San Giovanni Battista St. John the Baptist church, on the right bank of the river near the mediaeval bridge, dates back to the 15th century in the parish of the same name. The complex of old houses further up the hill, Borgata Confredi, was built to house the workers of the olive terraces nearby. From San Giovanni you can still walk along the track of the mediaeval road to Cervo. In the centre of Marina di Andora you can still see the bastion built in the 11th century as a defence against the Saracens; it now houses a pizzeria. On the way to Laigueglia is the Capo Mele Lighthouse. From Cervo, the main site of Andora is the St.James Church. From Cervo there are views of the church and the whole city. A bridge on the Merule River reaches the San Giovanni town which is the most historically city of Andora. Tourism and recreation Andora is a holiday resort thanks to the long sandy beach and the historical hinterland. Since 1986 Andora has held the Bandiera Blu award for clean waters and beaches.¬ª Regione: luned√¨ cerimonia di premiazione per le bandiere blu Accommodations include hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and camp sites.

HFA is not a recognised diagnosis by the American Psychological Association (DSM-5) or the World Health Organisation (ICD-10). Characterization High- functioning autism is characterized by features similar to those of Asperger syndrome. The defining characteristic recognized by psychologists is a significant delay in the development of early speech and language skills, before the age of three years. The diagnostic criteria of Asperger syndrome exclude a general language delay.Asperger's Disorder ‚Äì Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV- TR) American Psychiatric Association (2000) Further differences in features between people with high-functioning autism and those with Asperger syndrome include the following:T. Attwood, Is There a Difference Between Asperger's Syndrome and High Functioning Autism? * People with HFA have a lower verbal reasoning ability * Better visual/spatial skills (higher performance IQ) than people with Asperger syndrome * Less deviating locomotion (e.g. clumsiness) than people with Asperger syndrome * People with HFA more often have problems functioning independently * Curiosity and interest for many different things, in contrast to people with Asperger syndrome * People with Asperger syndrome are better at empathizing with another * The male to female ratio of 4:1 for HFA is much smaller than that of Asperger syndrome Individuals with autism spectrum disorders, including high-functioning autism, risk developing symptoms of anxiety. While anxiety is one of the most commonly occurring mental health symptoms, children and adolescents with high functioning autism are at an even greater risk of developing symptoms. There are other comorbidities, the presence of one or more disorders in addition to the primary disorder, associated with high-functioning autism. Some of these include bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In particular the link between HFA and OCD, has been studied; both have abnormalities associated with serotonin. Observable comorbidities associated with HFA include ADHD and Tourette syndrome. HFA does not cause nor include intellectual disabilities. This characteristic distinguishes HFA from low- functioning autism; between 40 and 55% of individuals with autism also have an intellectual disability. An association between HFA and criminal behavior is not completely characterized. Several studies have shown that the features associated with HFA may increase the probability of engaging in criminal behavior. While there is still a great deal of research that needs to be done in this area, recent studies on the correlation between HFA and criminal actions suggest that there is a need to understand the attributes of HFA that may lead to violent behavior. There have been several case studies that link the lack of empathy and social na√Øvet√© associated with HFA to criminal actions. Cause Although little is known about the biological basis of autism, studies have revealed structural abnormalities in specific brain regions. Regions identified in the \\"social\\" brain include the amygdala, superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus area and orbitofrontal cortex. Further abnormalities have been observed in the caudate nucleus, believed to be involved in restrictive behaviors, as well as in a significant increase in the amount of cortical grey matter and atypical connectivity between brain regions. There is a mistaken belief that some vaccinations, such as the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, may cause autism. This was based on a research study published by Andrew Wakefield, which has been determined as fraudulent and retracted. The results of this study caused some parents to take their children off vaccines clinically proven to prevent diseases that can cause intellectual disabilities or death. The claim that some vaccinations cause autism has not been proven; multiple large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in Japan, the United States, and other countries do not support this link. Diagnosis HFA is not a recognised diagnosis by the American Psychological Association (DSM-5) or the World Health Organisation (ICD-10). HFA is often, however, used in clinical settings to describe a set of symptoms related to an autism spectrum disorder whereby they exhibit standard autism indicators although have an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 70 or greater. Treatment While there exists no single treatment or medicine for people with autism, there exists several strategies to help lessen the symptoms and effects of the condition. Augmentative and alternative communication  Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is used for autistic patients who cannot communicate orally. Patients who have problems speaking may be taught to use other forms of communication, such as body language, computers, interactive devices, and pictures. The picture exchange communication system (PECS) is a commonly used form of augmentative and alternative communication with children and adults who cannot communicate well orally. Patients are taught how to link pictures and symbols to their feelings, desires and observation, and may be able to link sentences together with the vocabulary that they form. Speech-language therapy Speech-language therapy can help those with autism who need to develop or improve communication skills. According to the organization Autism Speaks, ‚Äúspeech-language therapy is designed to coordinate the mechanics of speech with the meaning and social use of speech‚Äù. People with autism may have issues with communication, or speaking spoken words. Speech-language Pathologists (SLP) may teach someone how to communicate more effectively with others or work on starting to develop speech patterns. The SLP will create a plan that focuses on what the child needs. Occupational therapy Occupational therapy helps autistic children and adults learn everyday skills that help them with daily tasks, such as personal hygiene and movement. These skills are then integrated into their home, school, and work environments. Therapists will oftentimes help patients learn to adapt their environment to their skill level. This type of therapy could help autistic people become more engaged in their environment. An occupational therapist will create a plan based on the patient's‚Äô needs and desires and work with them to achieve their set goals. Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) is considered the most effective therapy for autism spectrum disorders by the American Academy of Pediatrics. ABA focuses on teaching adaptive behaviors like social skills, play skills, or communication skills and diminishing problematic behaviors like eloping or self-injury by creating a specialized plan that uses behavioral therapy techniques, such as positive or negative reinforcement, to encourage or discourage certain behaviors over-time. Sensory integration therapy Sensory integration therapy helps people with autism adapt to different kinds of sensory stimuli. Many with autism can be oversensitive to certain stimuli, such as lights or sounds, causing them to overreact. Others may not react to certain stimuli, such as someone speaking to them. Many types of therapy activities involve a form of play, such as using swings, toys and trampolines to help engage the patients with sensory stimuli. Therapists will create a plan that focuses on the type of stimulation the person needs integration with.  Medication  There are no medications specifically designed to treat autism. Medication is usually used for symptoms associated with autism, such as depression, anxiety, or behavioral problems. Medicines are usually used after other alternative forms of treatment have failed.  Criticism of functioning labels  Many autistic rights activists disagree with the categorisation of individuals into \\"high-functioning autism\\" and \\"low- functioning autism\\", stating that the \\"low-functioning\\" label causes people to put low expectations on a child and view them as lesser. Furthermore, critics of functioning labels state that an individual's functioning can fluctuate from day to day, and categories do not take this into consideration. Additionally, individuals with \\"medium-functioning autism\\" are typically left out of the discussion entirely, and due to the non-linear nature of the autistic spectrum, individuals can be high-functioning in some areas while at the same time being medium or low functioning in other areas.

When the plate is driven as an antenna by an applied radio frequency current, the slot radiates electromagnetic waves in a way similar to a dipole antenna. The shape and size of the slot, as well as the driving frequency, determine the radiation pattern. Slot antennas are usually used at UHF and microwave frequencies at which wavelengths are small enough that the plate and slot are conveniently small. At these frequencies, the radio waves are often conducted by a waveguide, and the antenna consists of slots in the waveguide; this is called a slotted waveguide antenna. Multiple slots act as a directive array antenna and can emit a narrow fan- shaped beam of microwaves. They are used in standard laboratory microwave sources used for research, UHF television transmitting antennas, antennas on missiles and aircraft, sector antennas for cellular base stations, and particularly marine radar antennas. A slot antenna's main advantages are its size, design simplicity, and convenient adaptation to mass production using either waveguide or PC board technology. Structure Slotted array UHF television broadcasting antenna As shown by H. G. Booker in 1946, from Babinet's principle in optics a slot in a metal plate or waveguide has the same radiation pattern as a driven rod antenna whose rod is the same shape as the slot, with the exception that the electric field and magnetic field directions are interchanged; the antenna is a magnetic dipole instead of an electric dipole; the magnetic field is parallel to the long axis of the slot and the electric field is perpendicular. Thus the radiation pattern of a slot can be calculated by the same well-known equations used for rod element antennas like the dipole. The waves are linearly polarized perpendicular to the slot axis. Slots up to a wavelength long have a single main lobe with maximum radiation perpendicular to the surface. Antennas consisting of multiple parallel slots in a waveguide are widely used array antennas. They have a radiation pattern similar to a corresponding linear array of dipole antennas, with the exception that the slot can only radiate into the space on one side of the waveguide surface, 180¬∞ of the surrounding space. There are two widely used types: *Longitudinal slotted waveguide antenna - The slots' axis is parallel to the axis of the waveguide. This has a radiation pattern similar to a collinear dipole antenna, and is usually mounted vertically. The radiation pattern is almost omnidirectional in the horizontal plane perpendicular to the antenna over the 180¬∞ azimuth in front of the slot, but narrow in the vertical plane, with the vertical gain increasing approximately 3 dB with each doubling of the number of slots. The radiation is horizontally polarized. It is used for vertical omnidirectional transmitting antennas for UHF television stations. For broadcasting, a cylindrical or semicircular waveguide is sometimes used with several columns of slots cut in different sides to give an omnidirectional 360¬∞ radiation pattern. *Transverse slotted waveguide antenna - The slots are almost perpendicular to the axis of the waveguide but skewed at a small angle, with alternate slots skewed at opposite angles. This radiates a dipole pattern in the plane perpendicular to the antenna, and a very sharp beam in the plane of the antenna. Its largest use is for microwave marine radar antennas. The antenna is mounted horizontally on a mechanical drive that rotates the antenna about a vertical axis, scanning the antenna's vertical fan-shaped beam 360¬∞ around the water surface surrounding the ship out to the horizon with each revolution. The wide vertical spread of the beam ensures that even in bad weather when the ship and the antenna axis is being rocked over a wide angle by waves the radar beam will not miss the surface. History The slot antenna was invented in 1938 by Alan Blumlein, while working for EMI. He invented it in order to produce a practical type of antenna for VHF television broadcasting that would have horizontal polarization, an omnidirectional horizontal radiation pattern and a narrow vertical radiation pattern. Prior to its use in surface search radar, such systems used a parabolic segment reflector. The slotted waveguide antenna was the result of collaborative radar research carried on by McGill University and the National Research Council of Canada during World War II. The co-inventors, W.H. Watson and E.W. Guptill of McGill, were granted a United States patent for the device, described as a \\"directive antenna for microwaves\\", in 1951. Slotted waveguide antenna for 2.4 GHz. Other uses In a related application, so-called leaky waveguides are also used in the determination of railcar positions in certain rapid transit applications. They are used primarily to determine the precise position of the train when it is being brought to a halt at a station, so that the doorway positions will align correctly with queuing points on the platform or with a second set of safety doors should such be provided.

On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Verneuil d'Avre et d'Iton.Arr√™t√© pr√©fectoral 3 August 2016 In August 1424, during the Hundred Years' War the battle of Verneuil was fought just to the north of the town. An English army of 9,000 men beat a joint Franco-Scottish army of 15,000 men and as a result gained control of Normandy and Aquitaine and destroyed Scottish participation in the war. The town was recaptured in 1449.  Main sights  There are several landmarks in Verneuil-sur-Avre that are worthy of interest: Tower of St Mary Magdalene Church * the ' (St Mary Magdalene Church, built between the 12th and 16th centuries), which was labelled a ‚Äúmonument historique‚Äù (national heritage site) in 1862, has become the emblem of the city. Its tower is a well-known example of the late-gothic style (called Flamboyant Gothic Style, literally ‚Äúflaming‚Äù). The tower culminates at 56 metres (approximately 61 yards), and is visible from the entire surrounding countryside and, in winter, from as far away as the Chartres Cathedral. This building has been compared to the Tour du Beurre (‚ÄúTower of Butter‚Äù) of the Rouen Cathedral and the lantern-tower of the Abbaye Saint-Ouen de Rouen (St Ouen Church), also in Rouen, despite being smaller. This tower is known to be one of the sources of inspiration for the Tribune Tower in Chicago, a 141-metre-high skyscraper built in 1925 (approximately 154 yards). * the Eglise Notre-Dame (Notre-Dame Church, 12th-20th centuries) * the Tour Grise (Grey Tower, 13th century) was erected by the French king Philip Augustus.

Dunn was licensed as a minister of the Church of Scotland in 1964. He was chaplain to overseas students at Edinburgh University in 1968-70. In 1970, Dunn became a lecturer in divinity at the University of Nottingham, and was promoted to reader (i.e. senior lecturer) in 1979. Whilst at Nottingham, he served as a Methodist local preacher. He became professor of divinity at Durham University in 1982, and in 1990 became Lightfoot Professor of Divinity at Durham. He retired in 2003, and was succeeded as Lightfoot Professor of Divinity by John M. G. Barclay. For 2002, Dunn was the President of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas, an international body for New Testament study. Only three other British scholars had been made President of the body in the preceding 25 years. In 2006 he became a Fellow of the British Academy. In 2005 a festschrift was published dedicated to Dunn, comprising articles by 27 New Testament scholars, examining early Christian communities and their beliefs about the Holy Spirit in Christianity. In 2009 another festschrift was dedicated to Dunn for his 70th birthday, consisting of two forewords by N. T. Wright and Richard B. Hays and 17 articles all written by his former students who went on to have successful careers in either academic and ministerial fields around the world.

Grand Rapdis: Baker Academic, 2020, pp. 1-23. Richard N. Longenecker, . Eerdmans, 2011. Dunn took up Sanders' project of redefining Palestinian Judaism in order to correct the Christian view of Judaism as a religion of works-righteousness. One of the most important differences to Sanders is that Dunn perceives a fundamental coherence and consistency to Paul's thought. He furthermore criticizes Sanders' understanding of the term justification, arguing that Sanders' understanding suffers from an \\"individualizing exegesis\\".

The urban river begins in the historical Rancho Las Cienegas, then passes into the historical Rancho La Ballona, while flowing through Culver City and suburbaninzed Del Rey before merging with the ocean at Santa Monica Bay between Marina del Rey and suburban Playa del Rey. History Duck hunting on the Ballona lowlands, 1890. During the Pre- Columbian era, Tongva people existed as hunters and gatherers in small villages throughout the Ballona Creek watershed and other parts of the Los Angeles basin. Native American culture and land management practice was disrupted by the arrival of Spanish explorers.Castillo, E. D. (1994). \\"Gender status decline, resistance, and accommodation among female neophytes in the missions of California: A San Gabriel case study\\". American Indian Culture and Research Journal. 18 (1): 67‚Äì93. Retrieved 18 August 2013. http://aisc.metapress.com/content/u861u35618852412/ In 1769, the Tongva met their first Europeans when Portola expedition came through on its way north. Continuing west after crossing the Los Angeles River, diarist Fray Juan Crespi noted that the party \\"came across a grove of very large alders...from which flows a stream of water...The water flowed afterwards in a deep channel towards the southwest\\". Researchers identified the place as the headwaters of Ballona Creek. The explorers made camp nearby on August 3. Around 1820, a mestizo rancher named Augustine Machado began grazing his cattle on the Ballona wetlands and claimed a fourteen-thousand acre Mexican land grant that stretched from modern-day Culver City to Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California. Ballona Creek and Lagoon are named for the Ballona or Paseo de las Carretas land grant, dated November 27, 1839. The Machado and Talamantes families, co-grantees of the rancho, heralded from Baiona in northern Spain. After the land grant claims were lost, the area then experienced rapid growth, with open land being transformed into agricultural use. Watershed and course Map of Ballona Creek watershed, 2010. The Ballona Creek watershed totals about . Its land use consists of 64% residential, 8% commercial, 4% industrial, and 17% open space. The major tributaries to the Ballona Creek and Estuary include Centinela Creek, Sepulveda Canyon Channel and Benedict Canyon Channel; most of the creek's minor tributaries have been destroyed by development or paved over and flow into Ballona Creek as a network of underground storm drains. At the time of Spanish settlement, the Los Angeles River turned to the west just south of present-day Bunker Hill, joining Ballona Creek just to the west of its current channel. However, during a major flood in 1825, the Los Angeles River's course changed to its present channel, and Ballona Creek became a completely distinct waterway. Much of the above- ground section of the creek was lined with concrete as part of the flood- control project undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers following the Los Angeles Flood of 1938. Ballona Creek Watershed climate can be characterized as Mediterranean with average annual rainfall of approximately 15 inches per year over most of the developed portions of the watershed. The flow rate in the Creek varies considerably from a trickle flow of about per second during dry weather to per second during a 50-year storm event. Ballona Wetlands and Del Rey Lagoon are connected to the Ballona Estuary through tide gates.

Although much of the wetland was drained and developed, a portion remains protected. The State of California owns 600 acres of the former wetlands; the CDFW (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) owns 540 acres, and the State Lands Commission owns 60 acres, including a newly created freshwater marsh. Much of these preserved lands are designated as the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve and despite historic degradation, conditions are improving. Wetland flora includes pickleweed, marsh heather, saltgrass, salt marsh dodder, arrowgrass, glasswort, alongside a mix of native and naturalized upland plant species including coyote bush, brome, Lewis primrose, iceplant, goldenbush, oxalis, laurel sumac, and ryegrass. Bird species of special interest observed in the reserve include nesting pairs of Belding's Savannah sparrow (Passerculus rostratus/sandwichensis beldingi) and foraging use by California least terns (Sterna antillarum browni).  Pollution  The urbanization of the watershed, and associated with it the pollution of urban runoff and stormwater, has degraded the water quality in Ballona Creek and its Estuary. Ballona Creek is listed by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board impaired for fecal coliform, heavy metals, and pesticides. Dry weather urban runoff and storm water, both conveyed by storm drains, are the primary sources of pollution in the riverine coastal estuary. Culture Many national, historical, archeological and cultural landmarks, tourist attractions, educational institutions, businesses and industries exist in Ballona Creek Watershed. With year-round Mediterranean climate, the area attracts immigrants and visitors from all over the world making Ballona Creek Watershed a vibrant melting pot of culture. A bike path that extends almost seven miles from National Boulevard in Culver City to the end of Ballona Creek Estuary provides opportunities for recreation in the area. Ballona Creek Estuary and Ballona Wetlands provide habitat to many species of waterfowl, shorebirds, and waders. In popular culture In the 1997 movie Volcano, Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) dropped a 20-story apartment building in a controlled demolition in order to divert a flowing river of lava into Ballona Creek and thus into the Pacific Ocean.

Both the danza and its cousin the contradanza are sequence dances, performed to a pattern, usually of squares, to music that was instrumental. Neither the contradanza nor the danza were sung genres; this is a contrast to, for example, the habanera, which was a sung genre. There is some dispute as to whether the danza was in any sense a different dance from the contradanza, or whether it was just a simplification of the name.L√©on, Argeliers. 1974. \\"De la contradanza al danz√≥n\\". In Fern√°ndez, Mar√≠a Antonia (ed) Bailes populares cubanos. La Habana Through the first part of the 19th century the dance and its music became steadily more creolized. The music and the dance is creolized because composers were consciously trying to integrate African and European ideas because many of the people themselves were creoles, that is, born in the Caribbean; accepting their islands as their true and only homeland. Some well-known composers of danzas are Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez,\\"Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez\\" . Puerto Rico Encyclopedia \\"The Father of Puerto Rican Danza\\",\\"Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez\\" The Home of Puerto Rican Danza and Juan Morel Campos, considered by many to have raised the genre to its highest level.\\"Juan Morel Campos\\" Puerto Rico Encyclopedia. Retrieved May 7, 2010. Others are Cuban Ignacio Cervantes, and Cura√ßaoan Jan Gerard Palm.  Danza in Puerto Rico  Danza is a form of music that can be varied in its expression. The Puerto Rican national anthem, La Borinque√±a, was originally a danza that was later altered to fit a more anthem-like style. Danzas can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight-measure paseo followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the bombardino and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm.La Danza The first part of the romantic danza, the paseo, had 8 measures of music without a fixed rhythm (a snare drumroll may be played as background), when the couples circled the room elegantly, giving the lady the opportunity to display her beauty. The second part, called the merengue, grew from the original 16 measures to 34, in 1854. Here the couples held each other in a proper stance and executed turns that looked very much like a waltz. While the origins of the danza are murky, it probably arose around 1840 as a sort of reaction against the highly codified contradanza and, according to Cuban sources, was strongly influenced by Cuban immigrants and their habanera music. The first danzas were immature, youthful songs condemned by the authorities, who occasionally tried ineffectively to ban the genre. In Puerto Rico, the genre continued evolving until it was taken up by the young pianist Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez, who had just arrived from his studies in Paris, and took it to a new artistic level. His disciple, Juan Morel Campos, adopted it also and developed it further to its maximum expression, composing more than 300 danzas, most of them masterpieces of an exquisite beauty. The danza that evolved was inspired mostly by women and romance and their titles reflected that change.

J. Wittmann, P. S. Mellor, and M. Baylis. ‚ÄúUsing Climate Data to Map the Potential Distribution of Culicoides Imicola (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in Europe.‚Äù Revue Scientifique Et Technique De LOIE 20, no. 3 (January 2001): 731‚Äì40. https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.20.3.1306. This particular species has been recorded in Africa, Asia and Europe. African midges feed on animal blood, including horse, cattle, and sheep. Unlike other species within the Culicoides genus, this species prefers drier habitats for egg laying but retains a preference for moist soil to support larvae growth. Other suspected BTV vectors are Culicoides (Culicoides) pulicaris and species in the Culicoides (Avaritia) obsoletus complex. Description There are many species in the family, and it is difficult to physically distinguish between them. This has historically been a source of confusion in studies involving C. imicola. Male Males are characterized by spicules on their genitalia, which has a normal average of 45 spicules.Meiswinkel, R. Afrotropical Culicoides: Biosystematics of the Imicola Group. Subgenus Avaritia (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), Ch. 3-5, 2013. However, variation is significant, as their quantity has been recorded to range from 8 to 145 spicules. Spicules are needle-like projections from the genitalia. Culicoides cornutus, a close relative of C. imicola Distribution Historically, Culicoides imicola has been found in Africa and southwestern Asia, but their distribution has been increasing, as human activity has catalyzed this spread.Meiswinkel, R. Afrotropical Culicoides: Biosystematics of the Imicola Group. Subgenus Avaritia (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), Ch. 2, 2013. Because of the connection between cattle and C. imicola, C.imicola can be found where cattle are densely populated. Coupled with irrigation in farms which provides damper more habitable soil, C.imicola population has been able to rise. Habitat Unlike other species of Culicoides, C. imicola has been shown to prefer drier environments in multiple studies.Conte, A., M. Goffredo, C. Ippoliti, and R. Meiswinkel. ‚ÄúInfluence of Biotic and Abiotic Factors on the Distribution and Abundance of Culicoides Imicola and the Obsoletus Complex in Italy.‚Äù Veterinary Parasitology 150, no. 4 (2007): 333‚Äì44. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2007.09.021. A likely reason is that C. imicola pupa are especially prone to drowning, so their eggs are often laid in surfaces free of running water. However, the larvae need moist soil, so there tends to be a trade-off between dry and wet areas. Altitude and terrain In a study done in Sicily, C. imicola do not inhabit undulating or high- altitude areas.Conte, A., A. Giovannini, L. Savini, M. Goffredo, P. Calistri, and R. Meiswinkel. ‚ÄúThe Effect of Climate on the Presence of Culicoides Imicola in Italy.‚Äù Journal of Veterinary Medicine, Series B 50, no. 3 (2003): 139‚Äì47. https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0450.2003.00632.x. They instead prefer lower altitude flattish regions at around 200 meters. This is because in steeply undulating topographic areas, rapid desiccation leads to drying of soil, which prevents proper larval development. Further examination has shown that the biggest determining factor in their distribution is not altitude but a suitable climate and nutritious soil. Taxonomy Culicoides imicola'Culicoides bolitinos, once thought to be the same species as C. imicola, has now been recognized as a separate but closely related species. Some important taxonomic differences are: different margins in cell R5, different color and size of apex of vein M2, and different palp lengths, along with other sexual differences. Life history There are 4 main stages of development: egg, larvae, pupa, and imago. Eggs are laid in batches and darken quickly once laid. The life cycle of C. imicola depends largely on the temperature at which pregnant females lay their eggs.Veronesi, E., G.j. Venter, K. Labuschagne, P.s. Mellor, and S. Carpenter. ‚ÄúLife-History Parameters of Culicoides (Avaritia) Imicola Kieffer in the Laboratory at Different Rearing Temperatures.‚Äù Veterinary Parasitology 163, no. 4 (2009): 370‚Äì73. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.04.031. In laboratory-tested flies, it was found that at 20 ¬∞C it takes up to 2 months to go from egg- laying to adulthood, up to 21 days at 25 ¬∞C, and up to 16 days at 28 ¬∞C. However, at higher temperatures there were fewer hatchings and higher variability in fecundity.Nevill, Errol Matson. Biological Studies on Some South African Culicoides Species (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and the Morphology of Their Immature Stages, 2014. It is also interesting to note that more males emerge from pupae than females, although the exact reasons are unknown. Some possible explanations are that the female larvae have higher mortality rates, or that the sex ratio is temperature dependent. Food resources C. imicola, like most other biting midges, feed on animal blood. In Africa, C. imicola is known to feed on horse, cattle, and sheep.Puente, Josu√© Mart√≠nez-De La, Jordi Figuerola, and Ram√≥n Soriguer. ‚ÄúFur or Feather? Feeding Preferences of Species of Culicoides Biting Midges in Europe.‚Äù Trends in Parasitology 31, no. 1 (2015): 16‚Äì22. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2014.11.002. Nonetheless, their feeding preferences haven't been studied extensively in Europe but should be similar to those in Africa. Activity Culicoides species vary significantly in their activities in different contexts.Walker, Alan R. ‚ÄúSeasonal Fluctuations of Culicoides Species (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in Kenya.‚Äù Bulletin of Entomological Research 67, no. 2 (1977): 217‚Äì33. https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007485300011032. In a study done in Kenya, Culicoides imicola effectively ceases all activity at wind speeds above three meters per second. And, like most Culicoides, Culicoides imicola is also known to be nocturnal and tend to be more active during cooler temperatures. Interaction with humans C. imicola and humans usually do not interact directly, but they do so through their capabilities as disease vectors for many farm animals such as cows, horses, and sheep. Cattle drives have thus been identified as a man-made mechanism for the spread of infectious disease vectors, such as C. imicola. These vectors rely on cattle dung, and their introduction into different areas has led to C. imicola and viral spread across the world. Bluetongue virus Bluetongue virus C. imicola is the main vector for BTV (bluetongue virus), with other Cullicoides species being secondary vectors. The periodic burst of C. imicola population has correlated with outbreaks of BTV, which often occur cyclically. As much as 90% of all BTV cases in the Mediterranean Basin has been linked to C. imicola, which is possibly due to its dry and hot summers that allow rapid larval maturation, which in turn leads to multiple generations hatching within a single season. Other viruses C. imicola is also known to be the only field vector for the African horse sickness (AHS).Mellor, P. S., J. Boorman, and M. Baylis. ‚ÄúCulicoides Biting Midges: Their Role as Arbovirus Vectors.‚Äù Annual Review of Entomology 45, no. 1 (2000): 307‚Äì40. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ento.45.1.307. In the past, AHS has only occurred periodically, no more than two years at a time. However, there has been occasions where it has persisted for over 5 years. The year-round presence of C. imicola in the face of climate change has been identified as the possible source of longer durations of AHS. Climate importance Culicoides imicola rangeTraditionally, Culicoides imicola has been found in subtropical Asia and Africa. However, due to climate change, they have spread all the way to Europe and as far as Sweden. The increase in temperature has positively impacted C. imicola distribution, which has raised concern in the spread of disease across central Europe as the flies make their way northward.  Europe  The expansion of C. imicola out of its traditional Old World region of Africa and Asia may be a risk for significant spread orbivirus in the near future. Already, it is well distributed in Spain, Portugal, and several Greek islands; all of these area tend to be much warmer than their northern European counterparts. If temperatures continue to increase or stay roughly the same, the spread of these viral vectors will need to be properly prepared for and countered. Other species affecting Europe include C. obsoletus, C. pulicaris, C. nubeculosus and C. schultzei. Adult survival and dispersal C. imicola acclimated to different temperatures were found to have different survival capabilities in low temperatures but were about the same at high temperatures.Verhoef, F, Gert J Venter, and Christopher W Weldon. ‚ÄúThermal Limits of Two Biting Midges, Culicoides Imicola Kieffer and C. Bolitinos Meiswinkel (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae).‚Äù Parasites & Vectors 7, no. 1 (2014): 384. https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-384. Flies acclimated at 24 ¬∞C survived better at lower temperatures (-6 ¬∞C) while those at 29 ¬∞C did not get past -3 ¬∞C. However, there was no significant difference at higher temperature because once 42 ¬∞C was reached there was near total fatality. Due to the profound survival effect attributed to temperature, climate change altered the distribution and abundance of C. imicola. Future research Much is left to be understood about C. imicola. Because of the many closely related species in the family, it is important to properly identify each individually as to prevent confounding different species together. Their thermal limits in larvae stages is also of interest, as that could further explain their distribution across the world. Additionally, because of the difficulty in laboratory conditions in matching field conditions, more research is needed to study how their life cycle plays out.

It is one of the oldest societies in the University and was instrumental in founding the Glasgow University Union in 1890, along with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society, Comunn Oiseanach Oilthigh Ghlaschu, and Glasgow University Athletic Club. It retains close ties with the Glasgow University Union. In 1936, the society arranged an excursion to Hamburg, Berlin and London. Activities The University of Glasgow Medico-Chirurgical Society, AKA MedChir, is one of Glasgow University‚Äôs longest running societies and has been making Thursday nights fun since 1802. MedChir are responsible for organising the biggest and best social nights, educational events and sports for Glasgow University Medical Students. MedChir also raise money for a different charity each year. Previous year's chosen charities have been SeeMe, a mental health organisation looking to end the stigma surrounding mental health. The chosen charity for 2016‚Äì2017 is Children's Hospice Association Scotland (C.H.A.S.). MedChir organise major social events, with the highlights being the Annual Medical School Ball, the Revue (all-medic talent competition, won by Emeli Sand√© during her time at Glasgow Medical School), Field Trip and Beer Olympics. They also offer talks from the most prestigious speakers in their fields, events for students to practice their clinical skills and hold joint evenings with the Royal College of General Practitioners and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. MedChir members participate in the Scottish and Northern Irish Medics Sports tournament (SNIMS) every year, hosting and winning the event in November 2016 (with Edinburgh University finishing bottom), bringing their unbeaten run into their sixth year. Additionally, 'Surgo' has been MedChir‚Äôs in-house publication since 1935 and it provides a light-hearted look at medic life as well as anything else that catches the editorial team‚Äôs eyes. MedChir has its own medics Football, Rugby, Netball, Badminton, Squash, Basketball, Ultimate Frisbee and Hockey clubs. After many years of trialling different sports, members of the society still felt unsatisfied with the ping-pong shaped hole that remained in their hearts. In 2018, it was announced that this hole would be filled thanks to the founding of the MedChir Table Tennis club by Daniel Dolan (Alumni Representative), Conor Beatty (5th Year Representative) and Patrick Hart (Intercalated Year Representative). The Club competed for the first time in the 2018 SNIMS competition held in Dundee. The MedChir rugby team won the West of Scotland cup in December 2018, defeating Birkmyre RFC convincingly.

A foundation species can occupy any trophic level in a food web (i.e., they can be primary producers, herbivores or predators). The term was coined by Paul K. Dayton in 1972,Dayton, P. K. 1972. Toward an understanding of community resilience and the potential effects of enrichments to the benthos at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. pp. 81‚Äì96 in Proceedings of the Colloquium on Conservation Problems Allen Press, Lawrence, Kansas. who applied it to certain members of marine invertebrate and algae communities. It was clear from studies in several locations that there were a small handful of species whose activities had a disproportionate effect on the rest of the marine community and they were therefore key to the resilience of the community. Dayton‚Äôs view was that focusing on foundation species would allow for a simplified approach to more rapidly understand how a community as a whole would react to disturbances, such as pollution, instead of attempting the extremely difficult task of tracking the responses of all community members simultaneously. The term has since been applied to range of organisms in ecosystems around the world, in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Aaron Ellison et al. introduced the term to terrestrial ecology by applying the term foundation species to tree species that define and structure certain forest ecosystems through their influences on associated organisms and modulation of ecosystem processes.  Examples and outcomes of foundation species loss  A study conducted at the McKenzie Flats of the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, a semiarid biome transition zone, observed the result of loss of a variety of different dominant and codominant foundation species of plants on the growth of other species. This transition zone consists of two Chihuahuan Desert species, black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), and a shortgrass steppe species, blue grama (Bouteloua gracillis). Each species dominates an area with a specific soil environment. Black grama dominates sandy soils, while blue grama dominates in soils with high clay content, and creosote bush dominates fine-textured soil with surface gravel. This study noted that responses to the loss of foundation species is dependent on a variety of different factors from the ability of a species to recover to the climate conditions of the ecosystem to the patterns in dominance and explored the possible reasons for the outcomes of the study. The results indicated that in areas with just one dominant foundation species, its loss caused a shift in dominance to a mixed dominant community. For example, the creosote bush dominated shrubland saw a shift in dominance to 32% by other shrubs, 26% by perennial grasses, and 22% by perennial forbs following the removal of creosote bush. Another finding was that regardless of the community type and the species removed, the loss of foundation species resulted in an overall increase in black grama supporting the notion that the outcome is greatly affected by recovery ability of species removed or loss. Another study observed the effects of loss of foundation eastern hemlocks (Tsuga canadensis) in a forest ecosystem. Eastern hemlocks are a foundation species in eastern North American forests, but have been threatened by the accidental introduction of woolly adelgid. This study observed the effects that a loss in eastern hemlocks would have on the populations of arthropods, such as ants, beetles, and spiders, since these species are known indicators of environmental change. The results found that in areas of hemlock removal, there was an overall increase and influx of arthropod species. Researchers suggested that this was due to an increase in open habitats from the loss of the hemlocks. The results of this hemlock study corroborated with those from the previous McKenzie Flats study discussed in that the loss of foundation species led to a proliferation of species diversity in the affected area. These results seem to contradict a long- standing belief that foundation species play a vital role in communities and ecosystems by creating habitats for organisms, suggesting that in some circumstances they bottleneck species diversity. Foundation species play a vital role in structuring a community; however, this can be in a variety of different ways. The presence of a foundation species has the ability to either reduce or increase species diversity depending on its particular role in a specific ecosystem. The studies discussed highlighted examples in which foundation species limited species diversity in similar and differing taxa (the McKenzie Flats and eastern hemlock studies, respectively); however, there are many other examples in which removal of foundation species could decrease species diversity within the same or differing taxa.

It was the second oldest university of the Netherlands, founded shortly after Leiden University. History Also known as Academia Franekerensis or the University of Friesland, it was the stopover for many Puritans, such as Peter Stuyvesant, escaping the persecutions of Bishop Laud on their way to, eventually, the American Continent. It consisted of departments of Theology, Law, Medicine, Philosophy, Mathematics and Physics. Initially the university had an excellent reputation, attracting students from far and wide, but from 1700 its fortune changed. The university was disbanded by Napoleon in 1811, along with the Universities of Harderwijk and Utrecht. After the end of the French r√©gime, the university was not restored. Instead, an Athenaeum illustre was founded, which did not have the right to issue doctoral degrees. In 1843, the Athenaeum itself was disbanded because of a lack of students. Today, Franeker has no institute of higher education, although postgraduate students from the University of Groningen are permitted to defend their thesis in the Franeker Martinikerk, provided they are Frisian or their thesis subject has a connection to Friesland.

It is one of the largest botanical gardens in the world with an extensive collection of living plants in addition to a herbarium of over 3 million specimens. The current garden was established in 1958 after it moved from the centre of Brussels; the former site is now the Botanical Garden of Brussels. Researchers at the garden conduct research particularly on Belgian and African plants. The Botanic Garden contains about 18,000 plant species‚Äîabout 6% of all known plant species of the world. Half are in greenhouses, the other half, including cultivated and indigenous plants, are outdoors. The gardens are grouped around the castle and lake of the Bouchout domain. The mission statement of the Meise Botanic Garden specifies the increasing and spreading \\"the knowledge of plants\\" and contributions to \\"the conservation of biodiversity.\\" The Botanic Garden was property of the Belgian federal government, but after several years of negotiations it was eventually transferred to the Flemish Community (Flanders) effective 1 January 2014. The French Community still has its own employees and representation in the board of directors. The plants, library, etc. remain property of the federal State but given as commodate to the Flemish Community. History=Establishment in Brussels Le Botanique in Brussels was the main orangery of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium The first botanic garden in Brussels belonged to the Ecole Centrale du D√©partement de la Dyle that was created during the French rule of Belgium at the end of the 18th century. Due to their costs, those French schools were soon dropped and some municipalities, including the City of Brussels, took over the garden that was about to be abandoned. In 1815, Belgium became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Around the same period, the maintenance costs of the garden were regarded as too high by the city administration. A group of local bourgeois decided to create a new kind of botanical garden in Brussels. At the time the bourgeoisie was the new leading-class and since companies were popular financing method the garden was created as a company. The creators thought it would be their contribution to the city's reputation. Although it was rooted on a private enterprise, it was also supposed to be a national institution dedicated to science. Giant waterlilies in the Victoria house The Balat greenhouse Both the City and the Home Office supported it financially. But, the Independence of Belgium (1830-1831) was detrimental to the Dutch-born institution: it was regarded as orangist, as a mere playground for the local elites, and as not useful for the country's agriculture, among other critiques. From then on, the garden would have to battle to survive. The state and the city did not want to support it anymore unless it proved useful to the whole country, so the Garden was obliged to develop its commercial activities. It sold plants by the thousands, and created several money- consuming attractions and events for the local √©lite, like aquaria, a dance room, fairs, a fish nursery, concerts etc. In the 1860s, the aging buildings required renovation. The board of the Society of Horticulture tried to raise the money, but the costs were just too high for the company. In 1870, the Belgian Government took over the company. The National Botanic Garden was created in the very same year. Barth√©lemy Dumortier (1797-1878), a Belgian politician and botanist, had played a major role in this process. He wanted a ‚ÄúBelgian Kew‚Äù to be created in the capital of Belgium, that is to say a botanical garden dedicated to taxonomy. That is why, some months before the garden was bought by the state, the Belgian Government had purchased the famous von Martius Herbarium that was held in Munich. So, in 1870, Belgium had a great herbarium and an appropriate building. This was the dawn of a new era for Belgian botany. Move to Meise In 1927, just after the death of Empress Charlotte, it was proposed to set up the National Botanical Garden at the Bouchout Domain. It took until 1937 before the final decision was made and major constructions were started. To the southeast of Bouchout Castle, the \\"Palace of the Plants\\" was built, which consists of a number of greenhouses. Farther to the southwest of the castle, the Victorian Balat greenhouse was placed. This greenhouse was designed in 1853 by Alfonse Balat and transported from its original location at the Botanical Garden of Brussels. During the Second World War, Bouchout Castle was occupied by the German forces and the domain was altered into a fortress. Next to the Palace of Plants, six barracks were placed and concrete defenses were erected. The court of honour of Bouchout Castle was used to store ammunition, while artillery defenses were placed at the borders of the domain. The last German soldiers left Bouchout domain at 3 September 1944. Just a few days later, the Allied Forces arrived; they used it as a training location, while stationing about 200 vehicles at the domain. At 29 November 1944, a bomb exploded at the western part of the park, destroying the windows of Bouchout Castle. A second bomb exploded on 2 December at the nearby Hoogvorst Castle, causing its complete destruction.

He is currently signed with All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is a member of SoCal Uncensored. He is best known for his work in Ring of Honor (ROH) under the ring name Frankie Kazarian where he is a three-time ROH World Tag Team Champion and one time ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champion. He is also known for his work with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), under the ring names Kazarian, Suicide, and Kaz. Kazarian also wrestled in the independent promotion Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, where he won the PWG World Championship in 2003 and 2004. Also, he is the inaugural PWG World Champion when he won the Bad Ass Mother tournament. Kazarian is also a five-time TNA X Division Champion and a three-time TNA World Tag Team Champion. Professional wrestling career Kazarian began training with Killer Kowalski in Malden, Massachusetts in 1998, and wrestled his debut match after one month's training, facing Freight Train Dan. After remaining at Kowalski's school for eight months, Kazarian returned to Southern California and began wrestling on the independent circuit, primarily in the Empire Wrestling Federation, where he continued his training and teamed with Josh Galaxy as \\"Bad Influence\\". Impact Wrestling commentator Mike Tenay revealed in a late 2007 shoot interview that during a World Championship Wrestling event in San Diego, California in 2000, a fan appeared to him and boldly declared that \\"someday, [Tenay] will be calling one of [his] matches\\". That fan was none other than Kazarian himself. Californian independent circuit (1998‚Äì2004) In 2000, Kazarian joined Ultimate Pro Wrestling, and in March 2001 he formed a tag team with Nova known as \\"Evolution\\". On March 10, 2001, he became the first Millennium Pro Wrestling (MPW) World Champion by defeating Christopher Daniels and \\"Scrap Iron\\" Adam Pearce in a three‚Äìway dance. On May 30, 2001, Evolution won the vacant Ultimate Pro Wrestling Tag Team title. He travelled to Japan as part of the Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) roster in 2002, where he faced Steve Corino, and also as part of Evolution he and Nova were defeated by Edge and Christian. He used to freestyle rap along with his close friends John Cena and Samoa Joe while the three of them were on the road in UPW. He toured the UK, Australia and New Zealand with the now defunct World Wrestling All-Stars promotion in May 2003, where he met Glenn Gilberti and Scott D'Amore, leading to his being offered a job by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Kazarian also worked for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, and won a tournament to become the first ever PWG Champion on August 30, 2003. He held the title until February 22, 2004 when he was defeated by Adam Pearce. On July 10, 2004, he became their first 2-time champion, however, when he regained the title from Adam Pearce in a \\"Loser Leaves PWG\\" steel cage match. He would hold the title until November 13, when he was defeated by Super Dragon. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003‚Äì2005) Kazarian knew Impact Wrestling President Jeff Jarrett and Scott D'Amore during a World Wrestling All-Stars tour and they invited him to a tryout. Kazarian joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in the summer of 2003, and quickly began pursuing the TNA X Division Championship. He was part of the first ever Ultimate X match, on August 20, 2003 along with Michael Shane and Chris Sabin, which was won by Shane. Kazarian did not appear with TNA Wrestling between October 2003 and March 2004. After Chris Sabin was stripped of the title while sidelined with a knee injury, Kazarian eventually won the X Division title on March 31, 2004, defeating The Amazing Red in a match for the vacant title. He lost the belt to A.J. Styles on June 9, 2004. In June 2004 he and Shane formed a tag team (informally known as Shazarian) managed by Traci Brooks. They claimed to resent the fact that A.J. Styles had held the TNA X Division Championship, then the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, then had won the X Division Championship once more. This was purportedly illegal according to a previously unknown by law of the Impact Wrestling rulebook, which stated that an X Division competitor who participated for the Heavyweight Championship could not return to the X Division. On July 28, 2004, he and Shane faced Styles in an Ultimate X match. Kazarian and Shane were declared co-champions when both took possession of the title belt at the same time. On August 11 they defended the title in a twenty two man Gauntlet for the Gold match. Kazarian started at number one and was one of the final three participants, but was eliminated by The Amazing Red, who in turn was eliminated by Petey Williams. Kazarian was put in the same situation at November's Victory Road where he entered number one in a 20-man X Division Gauntlet and was the last man eliminated. Throughout late 2004 and early 2005, Kazarian and Shane competed in the TNA tag team division. Kazarian's contract with TNA Wrestlng expired in September 2004 and was not renewed, but he continued working with the company on a per appearance basis. The duo eventually began a feud with the 3Live Kru and Jeff Hammond, a NASCAR analyst who was working with Impact Wrestling as a commentator. This led to a match at the Against All Odds pay-per-view on February 13, 2005 between Hammond and Kru member B.G. James and Shane and Kazarian. Kazarian was pinned by Hammond after Shane miscued on a superkick and knocked him out. World Wrestling Entertainment (2005) Kazarian and Shannon Moore after winning a match at a taping of Velocity On February 25, 2005, Kazarian left Impact Wrestling and signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He was assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, the primary developmental territory of WWE. He made his WWE television debut during an episode of Velocity on July 16, 2005, under the name \\"The Future\\" Frankie Kazarian defeating Nunzio, and remained undefeated throughout July and into August. During this time, he picked up victories against Scotty 2 Hotty, Funaki, and Paul London. On August 15, Kazarian announced on his website that he had left WWE two days earlier. He later revealed that he had asked for his release after realizing that the company had no plans to revamp its cruiserweight division. Return to the independent circuit (2005‚Äì2006) Kazarian returned to the Californian independent circuit shortly after his release. He wrestled on the August 19 Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) show in Los Angeles, Smells Like Steen Spirit, where he teamed with Petey Williams to unsuccessfully challenge the 2 Skinny Black Guys (El Generico and Human Tornado) for the PWG Tag Team Championship. During PWG's (Please Don't Call it) The O.C.on May 6, 2006, Kazarian's signature ponytail was cut off by Scorpio Sky, who he was feuding with at the time. While in WWE the previous year, Kazarian had gotten in trouble with company management after refusing to cut his hair and this was one of the reasons he had asked for his release. This would begin a nine-month rivalry during which Scorpio Sky would defeat Kazarian in a \\"First Blood\\" match. In September, Kazarian beat Scorpio Sky in the first round of the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles by disqualification, when Scorpio's manager Jade Chung attacked Kazarian with scissors when he was pinning Scorpio. Kazarian was eliminated from the tournament in the second round due to being unable to compete after being assaulted by Sky's stable, The Dynasty. The feud ended on January 13, 2007 when Kazarian beat Sky in a \\"Loser Leaves PWG\\" match, just as he did with Adam Pearce. Kazarian left PWG in May 2007, when TNA Wrestling pulled all of their talent from the company. On February 24, 2008, Kazarian made a one night return to PWG, when he took part in the tournament to crown the new PWG World Champion. He was, however, eliminated in the first round by Karl Anderson. Return to TNASerotonin (2006‚Äì2007)= Walter \\"Killer\\" Kowalski Memorial Show in Malden, Massachusetts on October 26, 2008 Kazarian returned to TNA on July 16, 2006 at Victory Road, in a Championship match loss to TNA X Division Champion Senshi. Afterwards he and his old tag team partner Michael Shane (now known as \\"Maverick\\" Matt Bentley due to name trademark issues) resumed in their tag team, before disappearing from television for weeks. Later resurfacing with a new goth look, the duo would be joined by Johnny Devine and all became subservient to Raven, forming the stable Serotonin. As part of Serotonin, his name was shortened to the simple and supposedly cryptic \\"Kaz\\". Kaz eventually became the first Serotonin member to become very rebellious towards Raven. Kaz turned on Raven on June 21, 2007 by attacking fellow members of Serotonin, Havok and Martyr, costing him a match against Chris Harris. =Kaz (2007‚Äì2008)= After his split with Serotonin, he began using his old ring attire and entrance video which both said the full \\"Kazarian\\" - though it was all later changed to only say the simple Kaz except for a few references on the TNA website. Shortly after this, he engaged in a brief feud with Robert Roode over his treatment of Ms. Brooks. Kaz would next be entered in the 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament, which he won by defeating Christian Cage at Genesis in the finals in a ladder match. On the Impact! following Genesis, Kurt Angle barely defeated Kaz to retain the TNA World Championship. PWG show At the 2007 Turning Point pay-per-view, he was partnered with Booker T against Christian Cage and Robert Roode, with Kaz and Booker winning. He then began attacking Dustin Rhodes, and stealing things from Rhodes' alter ego \\"Black Reign\\". He defeated Black Reign at Final Resolution. After defeating Black Reign, Kaz and Black Reign competed in a Four Corner Mouse Trap match were Kaz won but Black Reign ended up getting his things back from Kaz after hitting Kaz with his Darkness Falls weapon. On February 23, Kaz defeated Rellik. After the match, Black Reign and Rellik attacked Kaz. Eric Young ran out to help but got too scared to do anything. At Destination X, Kaz and Young defeated Black Reign and Rellik leading to Kaz and Young (now 'Super Eric') becoming a tag team. On April 13, at Lockdown 2008, they won the Cuffed in a Cage match. On the April 17 episode of TNA Impact!, following Lockdown, Kaz and Young defeated the holders of the TNA World Tag Team Championship, AJ Styles and Tomko and The Latin American Xchange (LAX) in a triple threat tag team match for the titles after Young's alter ego, \\"Super Eric\\" pinned Styles with a bridging suplex. Later in the night, Styles complained to Jim Cornette that since Young was signed to the match, not Super Eric, and Young claimed that he and Super Eric are different people, Super Eric's involvement was outside interference. When Eric refused to admit that he was Super Eric, Cornette vacated the titles. Following Kaz and Young's loss to LAX in a Deuces Wild Tournament qualifying match, Kaz competed in and won the Terror Dome Match at Sacrifice, becoming number one contender to the X Division Championship, and also taking Kurt Angle's place in the triple threat match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. The match was won by Samoa Joe, who retained the title. On the June 5 episode of Impact! Kaz won a future title match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the first ever X Division King of the Mountain Match. He then failed to win the X Division championship at Slammiversary, losing to the X Division Champion Petey Williams. He then challenged Joe the following Thursday on Impact! for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort. He led Team TNA in the 2008 World X Cup and was in the final round at Victory Road, but lost after he pulled off a huge leg drop on Daivari off the top of the Ultimate X structure. On July 21, 2008 TNA's official website announced that Kaz had been released, but it was revealed to be a storyline. He was later interviewed by Karen Angle to further the storyline, and claimed that after failing to beat Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and letting down his company in the finals of the World X Cup, he had fallen out of love with wrestling and, so, had made the decision to leave. =Suicide (2008‚Äì2010)= Suicide in January 2010 In late 2008 Kazarian made his return to TNA Wrestling as a masked wrestler named Suicide, who was featured in Midway's TNA Impact! video game. He debuted at Final Resolution in December 2008 as a face, swinging to the ring on a cable, attacking the Motor City Machine Guns. At Destination X Suicide won the TNA X Division Championship, in his debut match, in the Ultimate X match. Because of an injury to Kazarian, Suicide was portrayed for several weeks by Christopher Daniels, who was in the costume when the character won the X Division Championship. Afterwards, Daniels began feuding with the Motor City Machineguns of Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin, who on the April 30 episode of Impact! accused him of being Suicide. On the May 7 episode of Impact!, Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed joined the accusations by also accusing Daniels of being Suicide. On the May 14 episode of Impact! the Motor City Machineguns and Lethal Consequences were trying to unmask Suicide in an attempt to prove that they were right about his true identity, but Daniels made the save and helped Suicide clear the ring of Shelley, Sabin, Lethal, and Creed. At Slammiversary, Suicide retained the TNA X Division Championship against Shelley, Sabin, Lethal, and Creed, in a King of the Mountain match. On the July 16 episode of Impact! Suicide lost his X Division title to Homicide after he cashed in his \\"Feast or Fired\\" briefcase. After not being seen for a few weeks, Suicide made his return at Hard Justice to compete in the Steel Asylum match, which he lost because of D'Angelo Dinero. On the August 20 episode of Impact! Suicide attacked Dinero after his match with Consequences Creed sparking a feud between the two. On the September 17 episode of Impact! Dinero defeated Suicide in a grudge match. At No Surrender Dinero defeated Suicide again, this time in a Falls Count Anywhere match. The following week on Impact! Suicide finally defeated Dinero, by pinning him in a street fight. On the October 15 episode of Impact! Homicide stole Suicide's costume and claimed to now know his true identity. On the December 3 episode Impact! Suicide made peace with Dinero and joined him, Matt Morgan and Hernandez in their war with Rhino, Team 3D and Jesse Neal. At Final Resolution Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and Suicide defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On the February 11, 2010, episode of Impact! Gerdelman made his final TV appearance as Suicide, losing to Matt Morgan in an 8 Card Stud Tournament qualifying match. = Fortune (2010‚Äì2012)= On the February 18, 2010, episode of Impact!, Gerdelman made his return as Kazarian, teaming up with Amazing Red and Generation Me (Jeremy Buck and Max Buck) in an eight-man tag team match, where they defeated X Division Champion Doug Williams, Brian Kendrick and the Motor City Machineguns, after Kazarian pinned Williams. The following week he defeated Kendrick to earn himself a match for the X Division Championship at Destination X. However, instead of waiting for the pay-per- view, Kazarian was given his title shot on the March 8 Monday night episode of Impact in a three-way match, which also included Daniels. In the end Williams was able to retain his title by pinning Daniels. At Destination X Kazarian defeated Daniels, Kendrick and Amazing Red in a four-way ladder match to earn another shot at the X Division Championship. At Lockdown Kazarian defeated Homicide and Shannon Moore in a three-way steel cage match to win the vacant TNA X Division Championship for the fourth time (counting his reign as Suicide), after Douglas Williams was stripped of the title due to being unable to attend the event. Upon Williams' return to TNA two weeks later, he refused to hand the X Division Championship belt over to Kazarian, unless he was able to defeat him for it. At Sacrifice Kazarian lost the X Division Championship to Williams without ever actually holding the physical belt. Kazarian celebrating with A.J. Styles in July 2010 On the following episode of Impact! Kazarian started showing signs of a heel turn, when he won an X Division battle royal to earn spot number ten in the TNA rankings for a World Title shot, impressing Ric Flair in the process. The heel turn was completed the following week, when Flair interfered in his match with Jay Lethal, which led to Kazarian scoring the roll-up victory, while grabbing a hold of his opponent's tights. After the match, Flair's other associate A.J. Styles, trying to impress his mentor, attacked Lethal, which led to an argument between him and Kazarian, who wanted to finish Lethal off himself. The distraction was enough for Lethal to dropkick both of them out of the ring. At Slammiversary VIII Kazarian lost his spot in the rankings to Kurt Angle. Fortune as the X Division Champion On the following episode of Impact! Ric Flair, who had aligned himself with Kazarian, Styles, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm, announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , stating that each of them would have to earn their spots in the group and in order for Kazarian to earn his spot, he needed to become the Barry Windham of the group. Flair, wanting peace between Kazarian and Styles, booked them in a tag team match against Samoa Joe and Rob Terry at Victory Road.

The Gray code, or reflected binary code (RBC), appearing in Gray's 1953 patent, is a binary numeral system often used in electronics, but with many applications in mathematics. Gray conducted pioneering research on the development of television; he proposed an early form of \\"flying spot scanner\\" for early TV systems in 1927, and helped develop a two-way mechanically scanned TV system in 1930. With Pierre Mertz, Gray wrote the classic paper on the mathematics of raster scan systems in 1934. He later participated in the early days of the digital revolution, with Raymond W. Sears, William M. Goodall, John Robinson Pierce, and others at Bell Labs, by providing the binary code used by Sears in his PCM tube, a beam deflection tube of the type that Sears and Pierce collaborated on, which was used in Goodall's \\"Television by pulse code modulation\\".

In civil cases, they are only empowered to award legal damages, and generally cannot provide remedies in equity, such as injunctions or declaratory judgments. Jurisdiction and venue=Subject-matter jurisdiction The subject-matter jurisdiction of the GDC is narrow, both with respect to civil cases and criminal cases. With respect to civil claims, it has sole authority to try cases involving amounts of $4,500 or less. It shares authority with the Virginia Circuit Court to try cases involving sums between $4,500 and $25,000. The amount in controversy is determined without considering interest or attorney's fees, even if recovery of these costs is specified in the contract. Within these limitations, the GDC can hear cases in tort or contract, and actions in detinue seeking the return of wrongfully held personal property. In determining whether the amount involved falls within the amount in controversy requirement, interest payments and attorney's fees contracted for in a written instrument. In cases involving unlawful detainer of real estate used for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes, the GDC may hear cases involving claims of rent owed and property damage without limitation. If the real estate is used for residential purposes, then the $25,000 limit applies. The GDC may issue distress warrants establishing the rights of a creditor to seize property, again without limit as to the amount. Conversely, the GDC may order the attachment of personal property valued up to $25,000, but has no authority to order the attachment of real estate, no matter how low the value. With respect to criminal cases, the GDC may only try misdemeanors. The GDC also has no authority over domestic relations matters such as divorce, annulment, and child custody, nor does it have authority over the probate of wills, which are directed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts.Va. Code. Ann. ¬ß64.1‚Äì75. The only injunctive relief that the GDC may grant is in enforcing the state's Freedom of Information Act. Personal jurisdiction The GDC must also be able to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant, which may be premised on the defendant's physical presence in the jurisdiction, or on the occurrence of some element of the cause of action in the jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction is predicated on Virginia's long-arm statute, which generally permits Virginia courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a party that resides in Virginia, or transacts substantial business in Virginia, or who caused an actionable injury in Virginia. A party may waive a lack of personal jurisdiction, but may also appear in court to contest personal jurisdiction without thereby waiving the issue. Venue In terms of venue, where personal jurisdiction lies in multiple districts, the appropriate venue for the case to be heard is set forth by Virginia statutes, which divides possible venues as \\"Category A\\" (preferred) and \\"Category B\\" (permissible), and requires that Category B venue may only be used where no Category A venue is available. For example, in a dispute over the ownership of land, Category A venue lies where the land is located. Most Category A venue provisions of the Virginia statutes are inapplicable to the GDC, which does not have subject matter jurisdiction over divorce and probate matters, and can not issue injunctions. In the types of cases that can be heard in the GDC, venue is generally deemed objectionable if it is not where the defendant resides or has a registered office or registered agent, or where some part of the action arose.Va. Code. Ann. ¬ß8.01-261, ‚àí262. Civil procedure= Initiating litigation  GDC proceedings are relatively informal. It is not necessary to file formal pleadings. Rather, a plaintiff can fill out and serve the defendant with a \\"civil warrant\\", which is a form provided by the Clerk of the Court containing blanks to be filled in identifying the parties and the cause of action. Alternatively, the plaintiff can draft his own \\"notice of motion for judgment\\". The notice provided to the defendant must instruct the defendant of several things. It must explain how the trial date will be set; it must inform the defendant that failure to appear and contest the claim can result in a default being entered; and, under something of a quirk of Virginia law, it must tell the defendant how they may object to venue. The defendant need not file an answer at all, but can simply show up in court on the designated \\"return date\\" and contest the claim. The civil warrant may be served on the defendant by the sheriff or deputy of the county in which the defendant resides, unless the plaintiff opts to have service of process effected by an officer of the court. The return date is the date on which the defendant must appear in court, and can be anywhere from 5 to 60 days after service of process is effected. If the defendant feels that the plaintiff has not provided enough information about the cause of action, he may file a motion for a \\"bill of particulars\\", and if the court grants such a motion then the plaintiff will be ordered to provide the requested details. If the cause of action is premised on a written instrument such as a contract or a deed, the original document must be provided to the court, and the defendant may use a motion for a bill of particulars to compel the production of this document as well. The plaintiff, on the other hand, may file a motion for \\"grounds of defense\\", which, if granted, will result in an order requiring the defendant to submit a written response indicating the defenses that it intends to assert. If the plaintiff fails to respond to a bill of particulars, or the defendant fails to provide requested grounds of defense, the court may enter summary judgment against the non-responsive party. A defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a co- defendant, at any point before the trial begins, so long as the amount is within the jurisdictional limits of the GDC. Failure to file a counterclaim, however, does not effect a waiver of that counterclaim. A defendant may implead a third party anytime within ten days after service of process has been effected, up until the trial date, so long as the third party receives effective service of process. However, Virginia law prohibits a defendant from impleading a joint tortfeasor against whom the plaintiff is prohibited from recovering (such as plaintiff's employer in a negligent injury case, which would be covered by the state's workman's compensation). Virginia law does not recognize the doctrine of necessary and indispensable parties, so the inability to implead a party will not affect the court's jurisdiction over the case. The GDC can also entertain interpleader causes of action, allowing a party holding something of value to force all competing claimants to litigate which of them has the superior claim. As with other causes of action, the jurisdictional limitations must be met. It must be remembered that the GDC has no injunctive power; while the Circuit Courts can issue injunctions prohibiting parties from litigating the interpleader claim in other forums, the GDC can not prevent this. Finally, there is no right of intervention in GDC proceedings; a third party that wishes to become a party to a pending case can not do so except on a motion of an existing party to the case.  Discovery and trial  There is virtually no pretrial discovery available at the GDC level. However, a witness may be compelled to appear at the trial itself through a subpoena, and may be required to bring documents through a subpoena duces tecum. The party seeking to subpoena a witness must file a request for subpoena at least 15 days before trial, or else they will have to show \\"good cause\\" for why a subpoena should issue. As there are no juries in the GDC, trial is relatively fast and informal. Evidence is presented by oral testimony of witnesses, although personal injury damages may be proved by written records from a hospital or health care provider. If a written medical report by a health care provider is introduced, the party seeking to introduce it must notify the other party at least 10 days before the trial. The health care provider must swear out a statement affirming that they treated this patient and attesting that the report fully describes the injury, and is true and accurate as to the description of the injury and any statement of costs. Post-trial motions A party seeking a rehearing of a judgment must file the motion requesting this relief within 21 days of entry of the judgment.VA. Sup. Ct. R. 1.1 (2015). The cases are divided on whether the court must rule on the motion during the 21-day period.See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fields, 88 Va. Cir. 151, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 13 (Va. Cir. Ct. 2014).  Appeals  Appeals from the GDC for civil matters in excess of $50, and for all criminal and traffic cases, go to the Virginia Circuit Court, where they are re-tried de novo (because the GDC does not generate a record to be reviewed for error). The appellant in the Circuit Court will then be entitled to a jury trial, even if they were not entitled to one in the GDC. If the case is a criminal case or traffic infraction, the appellant will automatically receive a jury trial in the Circuit Court unless they affirmatively waive this right. For civil cases on appeal, the appellant must request a jury; if no such request is made, then the appeal will be heard by a Circuit Court judge alone. Cases heard in the GDC may not be directly appealed to any court other than the Circuit Court, although the decisions of the Circuit Court are subject to further appellate review. In determining whether the matter exceeds $50, the Circuit Court looks to the recovery achieved by the plaintiff. If, for example, the plaintiff seeks $3,000 and recovers $2,960, the plaintiff will have no right to appeal, but the defendant will (having been assessed a judgment well in excess of $50). On retrial in the Circuit Court brought about by an appeal from the defendant, the plaintiff may seek leave to amend to increase the claim to an amount in excess of the $25,000 limitation of the GDC. To appeal a case from the GDC to the Circuit Court, a notice of appeal must be filed with the clerk of the GDC within 10 days after a judgment or conviction has been entered by the GDC. The appellant must then post a bond and pay a writ tax in the GDC within 30 days of the judgment, or within 10 days of the judgment if the case is one of unlawful detainer.

It was initially developed for Hodgkin's, but has some use in NHL. It has roughly the same function as TNM staging in solid tumors. The stage depends on both the place where the malignant tissue is located (as located with biopsy, CT scanning, gallium scan and increasingly positron emission tomography) and on systemic symptoms due to the lymphoma (\\"B symptoms\\": night sweats, weight loss of >10% or fevers). Principal stages The principal stage is determined by location of the tumor: * Stage I indicates that the cancer is located in a single region, usually one lymph node and the surrounding area. Stage I often will not have outward symptoms. * Stage II indicates that the cancer is located in two separate regions, an affected lymph node or lymphatic organ and a second affected area, and that both affected areas are confined to one side of the diaphragm‚Äîthat is, both are above the diaphragm, or both are below the diaphragm. * Stage III indicates that the cancer has spread to both sides of the diaphragm, including one organ or area near the lymph nodes or the spleen. * Stage IV indicates diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, including any involvement of the liver, bone marrow, or nodular involvement of the lungs. Modifiers These letters can be appended to some stages: * A or B: the absence of constitutional (B-type) symptoms is denoted by adding an \\"A\\" to the stage; the presence is denoted by adding a \\"B\\" to the stage. * S: is used if the disease has spread to the spleen. * E: is used if the disease is \\"extranodal\\" (not in the lymph nodes) or has spread from lymph nodes to adjacent tissue. * X: is used if the largest deposit is >10 cm large (\\"bulky disease\\"), or whether the mediastinum is wider than ‚Öì of the chest on a chest X-ray. Type of staging The nature of the staging is (occasionally) expressed with: * CS: clinical stage as obtained by doctor's examinations and tests. * PS: pathological stage as obtained by exploratory laparotomy (surgery performed through an abdominal incision) with splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen). Note: exploratory laparotomy has fallen out of favor for lymphoma staging. Limitations The staging does not take into account the grade (biological behavior) of the tumor tissue. The prognostic significance of bulky disease, and some other modifiers, were introduced with the \\"Cotswolds modification\\". History The Ann Arbor classification is named after Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the Committee on Hodgkin's Disease Staging Classification met in 1971; it consisted of experts from the United States, UK, Germany and France, and replaced the older Rye classification from a 1965 meeting.Rosenberg SA.

History Plans for the first National Botanic Garden of Israel, on a plot of land purchased on Mount Scopus in 1926, were drawn up by Alexander Eig, chairman of the Botany Department of the Hebrew University, based on the flora of the Land of Israel from Mount Lebanon to the desert. Planting began in 1931. The botanical gardens on Mount Scopus were the first home of the Biblical Zoo.More than just Mount Scopus - Israel Travel, Ynetnews In 1948, in the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, access to Mount Scopus and the university campus was cut off from the rest of Israel, and it was decided to create a new Botanical Garden (the subject of this entry) near the Jewish National and University Library, on the new campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram in western Jerusalem. The new Botanical Garden, including a unique collection of Coniferae, was opened in 1954, soon after the establishment of Givat Ram campus. In 1962, a rocky hill in the southeastern corner of the campus was planted with conifers from North America. That year, Michael Avishai was appointed scientific director of the gardens.Michael Avishai, Jerusalem Botanical Gardens Many of the trees were raised from his private seed collection.A journey through the Holy Land Budgeting was a serious problem until 1975, when the Society of Friends of the Botanical Gardens was established and the garden became a joint project of the university, the Jerusalem Municipality and the Jewish National Fund. A scientific board was appointed, and architect Shlomo Aronson was commissioned to plan the layout. In 1981, the Garden Association was founded, and a board of executives appointed.

Falangism () was the political ideology of two political parties in Spain that were known as the Falange, namely first the Falange Espa√±ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (FE de las JONS) and afterwards the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (FET y de las JONS).Cyprian P. Blamires (editor). World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. Pp. 219-220.

Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 77-102. while others focus on its transformation into an authoritarian conservative movement in Francoist Spain.Martin Blinkhorn. Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe. Reprinted edition. Oxon, England, UK: Routledge, 1990, 2001. p. 10 The original Falangist party, FE de las JONS, merged with the Carlists in 1937 following the Unification Decree of Francisco Franco, to form FET y de las JONS. This new Falange was meant to incorporate all Nationalist political factions, and became the sole political party of Francoist Spain.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 273. The merger was opposed by some of the original Falangists, such as Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places a strong emphasis on Catholic religious identity, although it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation.Stanley Payne. A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Pres, 1995. Pp. 261. Falangism emphasized the need for total authority, hierarchy and order in society. Like fascism, Falangism is anti- communist, anti-democratic and anti-liberal.Ellwood, pp. 99‚Äì101.Bowen, p. 152. The Falange's original manifesto, the \\"Twenty-Seven Points\\", declared Falangism to support the unity of Spain and the elimination of regional separatism, the establishment of a dictatorship led by the Falange, utilizing violence to regenerate Spain, and promoting the revival and development of the Spanish Empire, all attributes that it had in common with fascism. The manifesto also called for a national syndicalist economy, and advocated agrarian reform, industrial expansion, and respect for private property with the exception of nationalizing credit facilities to prevent usury.Hans Rogger, Eugen Weber. The European Right. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press; London, England, UK: University of Cambridge Press, 1965. Pp. 195. The Spanish Falange and its affiliates in Hispanic states across the world promoted a form of panhispanism known as hispanidad that advocated both cultural and economic union of Hispanic societies around the world.Stein Ugelvik Larsen (ed.). Fascism Outside of Europe. New York, New York, USA: Columbia University Press, 2001. Pp. 120‚Äì121. Falangism has attacked both the political left and the right as its \\"enemies\\", declaring itself to be neither left nor right, but a syncretic third position.Roger Griffin (ed). Fascism.

Components = Nationalism and racialism  During the Spanish Civil War, the Falange and the Carlists both promoted the incorporation of Portugal into Spain, and the new Falange resulting from their unification in 1937 continued to do so. The Falange also advocated the incorporation of Gibraltar into Spain, both prior to and after its merger with the Carlists. During its early years of existence, the Falange produced maps of Spain that included Portugal as a province of Spain.Wayne H. Bowen. Spain during World War II. Columbia, Missouri, USA: University of Missouri Press, 2006. Pp. 26. The Carlists stated that a Carlist Spain would retake Gibraltar and Portugal.M. K. Flynn. Ideology, mobilization, and the nation: the rise of Irish, Basque, and Carlist national movements in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Palgrave Macmillan, 1999. Pp. 178. After the civil war, some radical members of the Falange called for a reunification with Portugal and annexation of former Spanish territories in the French Pyrenees. During World War II, Franco in a communiqu√© with Germany on 26 May 1942 declared that Portugal should be made a part of Spain.Paul Preston. Franco: a biography. BasicBooks, a division of HarperCollins, 1994. Pp. 857. Some of the Falangists in Spain had supported racialism and racialist policies, viewing races as both real and existing with differing strengths, weaknesses and accompanying cultures inextricably obtained with them. However, unlike other racialists such as the Nazis, Falangism is unconcerned about racial purity and does not denounce other races for being inferior, claiming \\"that every race has a particular cultural significance\\" and claiming that the intermixing of the Spanish race and other races has produced a \\"Hispanic supercaste\\" that is \\"ethically improved, morally robust, spiritually vigorous\\".Roger Griffin (ed). Fascism. Oxford, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Oxford University Press, 1995. Pp. 190.

Some have nonetheless promoted eugenics designed to eliminate physical and psychological damage caused by pathogenic agents.

In 1938 in Santa Isabel, Fernando P√≥o, now Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, there were two units of native Falangists and four of Europeans. In 1959, the Female Section extended its teaching to Guinean women to prepare them for independence. Franco and Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er with Heinrich Himmler and other leading Nazis like Karl Wolff in 1940 Franco praised Spain's Visigothic heritage, saying that the Germanic tribe of the Visigoths gave Spaniards their \\"national love for law and order\\".Roger Collins. Visigothic Spain 409 ‚Äì 711. Blackwell Publishing, 2004. P. 3. During early years of the Falangist regime of Franco, the regime admired Nazi Germany and had Spanish archaeologists seek to demonstrate that Spaniards were part of the Aryan race particularly through their Visigothic heritage.Philip L. Kohl, Clare Fawcett. Nationalism, Politics and the Practice of Archaeology. Cambridge, England, UK: Press Syndicate of Cambridge University Press, 1995. P. 46. The founder of the Falange Espa√±ola, Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, had little interest in addressing the \\"Jewish problem\\" outside areas of political issues.Paul Preston (2012). The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain. London, UK: HarperCollins. The Falange's position was influenced by the fact of the small size of the Jewish community in Spain at the time that did not favor the development of strong antisemitism.Walter Laqueur, Judith Tydor Baumel. The Holocaust Encyclopedia. Yale University Press, p. 183. Primo de Rivera saw the solution to the \\"Jewish problem\\" in Spain as simple: the conversion of Jews to Catholicism.Bowen, p. 20. However, on the issue of perceived political tendencies amongst Jews he warned about Jewish-Marxist influences over the working classes. The Falangist daily newspaper Arriba claimed that \\"the Judeo- Masonic International is the creator of two great evils that have afflicted humanity: capitalism and Marxism\\". Primo de Rivera approved of attacks by Falangists on the Jewish-owned SEPU department stores in 1935. The Spanish Falange and its Hispanic affiliates have promoted the cultural, economic and racial unity of Hispanic peoples across the world in \\"hispanidad\\". It has sought to unite Hispanic peoples through proposals to create a commonwealth or federation of Spanish-speaking states headed by Spain.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1999 pp.330‚Äì331  Economics  Falange leader Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera advocated national syndicalism as the alternative to both capitalism and communism Falangism supports a national, trans-class society while opposing individual-class-based societies such as bourgeois or proletarian societies. Falangism opposes class conflict. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera declared that \\"[t]he State is founded on two principles‚Äîservice to the united nation and the cooperation of classes\\".Rodney P. Carlisle (general editor). The Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right, Volume 2: The Right. Thousand Oaks, California, USA; London, England, UK; New Delhi, India: Sage Publications, 2005. Pp. 633 Originally, Falangism in Spain as promoted by Primo de Rivera advocated a \\"national syndicalist\\" economy that rejected both capitalism and communism. Primo de Rivera denounced capitalism for being an individualist economy at the hands of the bourgeoisie that turned workers \\"into a dehumanized cog in the machinery of bourgeois production,\\" and denounced state socialist economies for \\"enslaving the individual by handing control of production to the state.\\" The Falange's original manifesto, the \\"Twenty-Seven Points\\", called for a social revolution to create a national syndicalist economy that creates national syndicates of both employees and employers to mutually organize and control the economic activity. It further advocated agrarian reform, industrial expansion, and respect for private property with the exception of nationalizing credit facilities to prevent capitalist usury. The manifesto also supported criminalization of strikes by employees and lockouts by employers as illegal acts,Benjamin Welles. Spain: the gentle anarchy. Praeger, 1965. Pp. 124. while mirroring social democratic policies in supporting state jurisdiction over the setting of wages. After the merger of the original Falange with the Carlists in 1937 to form the new Falange (FET y de las JONS) that would serve as the sole political party of Francoist Spain, the result was a Falange intended as a \\"melting pot\\" for all of the various political factions on the Nationalist side of the civil war.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 273. It proclaimed support for \\"an economic middle way equidistant from liberal capitalism and Marxist materialism.\\"Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 298. Private initiative and ownership was recognized as the most effective means of production, but owners and managers were given the responsibility of advancing that production for the common good. At the same time, it was made clear that the economy would continue to rest on private property, whose protection was guaranteed, while the state was envisioned as undertaking economic initiatives only when private enterprise failed or \\"the interests of the nation require it.\\"Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 299. In October 1937, the new leader of the Falange, Raimundo Fern√°ndez-Cuesta, declared national syndicalism to be fully compatible with capitalism, drawing praise from the non-falangist right.Stanley G. Payne. Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: Wisconsin University Press, 1999. Pp. 281. The Franco-era Falange supported the development of cooperatives such as the Mondragon Corporation because it bolstered the Francoist claim of the nonexistence of social classes in Spain during his rule.Sharryn Kasmir. The Myth of Mondrag√≥n: Cooperatives, Politics, and Working-class Life in a Basque Town. State University of New York, 1996. Pp. 75. Falangism is staunchly anti- communist.Cyprian P. Blamires (editor). World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. Pp. 220: \\"the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS was formed... by representatives of very different ideologies united only by their proclaimed and resolute antiliberalism and anti-Marxism.\\" The Spanish Falange supported Spanish intervention during World War II against the Soviet Union in the name of anti-communism, resulting in Spain supporting the Anti-Comintern Pact and sending volunteers to join Nazi Germany's foreign legions on the Eastern Front to support the German war effort against the Soviet Union.  Gender roles  Secci√≥n Femenina volunteers do the Roman salute before delivering food for the needy in 1937. The Spanish Falange supported conservative ideas about women and supported rigid gender roles that stipulated that women's main duties in life were to be a loving mother and a submissive wife.Rodney P. Carlisle (general editor). The Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right, Volume 2: The Right. Thousand Oaks, California, USA; London, England, UK; New Delhi, India: Sage Publications, 2005. Pp. 634. This policy was set against that of the Second Spanish Republic that provided universal suffrage to women. Its instructed women to be good wives and mothers, teaching domestic economy and cultivating the folk dances of Spain in its troupes. Paradoxically, the Female Section enabled its leaders, women such as Jos√© Antonio's sister Pilar, who never married, to achieve prominent public roles while promoting family life.

As well as hosting the 1901 FA Cup Final replay, it was the scene in 1946 of one of the greatest disasters in English football, and the subject of an L. S. Lowry painting. It was demolished in 1999, two years after Bolton moved to their new home at the Reebok Stadium. Location Situated on Manchester Road in the Burnden area of Bolton ‚Äì less than a mile south of the town centre ‚Äì the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. History Bolton Wanderers was formed in 1874 as Christ Church FC, with the vicar as club president. After disagreements about the use of church premises, the club broke away and became Bolton Wanderers in 1877 meeting at the Gladstone Hotel. At this time Bolton played at Pike's Lane but needed a purpose built ground to play home matches. As a result, Bolton Wanderers Football and Athletic Club, one of the 12 founder members of the Football League, became a Limited Company in 1894 and shares were raised to build a ground. Land at Burnden was leased at ¬£130 per annum and ¬£4,000 raised to build the stadium. Burnden Park was completed in August 1895. The opening match was a benefit match against Preston and the first League match was against Everton in front of a 15,000 crowd. The stadium hosted the replay of the 1901 FA Cup Final, in which Tottenham Hotspur beat Sheffield United 3‚Äì1. The finals of the Rugby Football League's 1986‚Äì87 John Player Special Trophy, and 1988‚Äì89 John Player Special Trophy tournaments were played at the ground before crowds of 22,144 and 20,709 respectively. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold crowds of up to 70,000, but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life, mainly because of new legislation which saw virtually all English stadia reduce their capacities for safety reasons. A section of the embankment was sold off in 1986 to make way for a new Normid superstore. Bolton's attendances were also falling sharply by the 1980s due to the club's declining fortunes on the pitch. The club's directors had decided by 1992 that it would be difficult to convert Burnden Park into an all-seater stadium adequate for a club of Bolton's ambition. They were members of the new Division Two (which was known as the Third Division until the creation of the Premier League) but the club wanted to build a stadium to meet these requirements in the event of promotion to Division One and ultimately the Premier League. The last ever Wanderers game played at the historic ground was against Charlton Athletic on 25 April 1997. Bolton, who were already promoted as Division One champions, defeated Charlton 4‚Äì1 after being 1‚Äì0 down at half time. Whites' legend John McGinlay, who scored more than 100 goals in five years with the club, scored the final goal shortly before Bolton received their trophy and the crowd united in singing Auld Lang Syne. It was decided to build a new multi million pound 25,000-seater stadium (later raised to nearly 29,000) ‚Äì the Reebok Stadium ‚Äì six miles from Burnden Park at the Middlebrook development. The move took place in 1997, bringing an end to 102 years of football at Burnden Park. Burnden Park disaster On 9 March 1946, the club's home was the scene of the Burnden Park disaster, which at the time was the worst tragedy in British football history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an FA Cup quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and Stoke City. There was an estimated 85,000 strong crowd crammed in for the game, at least 15,000 over-capacity. The disaster led to Moelwyn Hughes's official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes. Outside football The railway embankment of Burnden Park was seen in the 1962 film A Kind of Loving, starring Alan Bates and June Ritchie. Part of the Arthur Askey film The Love Match was also filmed at Burnden Park in the early 1950s. A painting of Burnden Park in 1953 by L. S. Lowry, Going to the Match, was bought for ¬£1.9 million by the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1999. Redevelopment For some years after the stadium's closure, the site suffered. Travellers camped in the car park of the derelict Normid superstore and Burnden Park itself fell into disrepair, with demolition not taking place until two years after the last match had been played. There is now an Asda superstore on the site, which opened in 2005 after taking over the Big W. The Asda store identifies itself with Burnden Park by having a number of extremely large photographs of the former stadium and players, placed high above the checkouts. Also on the site are a Co-operative travel, a Subway, a Carphone Warehouse and a Johnson's Cleaners adjacent to Manchester Road.

He served as Archbishop of Utrecht from 1955-75, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1960. Biography Coat of arms of cardinal Bernardus Alfrink. Born in Nijkerk, Bernardus Johannes Alfrink was the youngest son of Theodorus Johannes Alfrink and his wife, Elisabeth Catharina Ossenvoort. His mother died in 1901 at the birth of his two younger twin sisters (both of whom also died after a few months), after which Bernardus was cared for by a childless aunt from neighboring Barneveld for the next three years. The priest who baptized him was Father Johannes Verstege. Alfrink received his first Communion in 1911. After attending the minor seminary in Culemborg, he enrolled in the seminary at Rijsenburg, and, eventually attended the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood on 15 August 1924 by Archbishop Henricus van de Wetering. He completed his studies at the √âcole Biblique in Jerusalem in 1930, the same year he was appointed chaplain in Maarssen. He also did pastoral work in Utrecht until 1933. Alfrink taught at the Seminary of Rijsenburg (1933‚Äì1945) and later the Catholic University of Nijmegen (1945‚Äì51). On 28 May 1951, he was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Utrecht and Titular Archbishop of Tyana. Alfrink received his episcopal consecration on the following 17 July from Archbishop Paolo Giobbe, papal internuncio in The Hague, with Bishops Willem Lemmens and Jan Smit serving as co-consecrators, in Saint Catherine's Cathedral. Alfrink succeeded Cardinal Johannes de Jong as Archbishop of Utrecht on 31 October 1955 and was named Apostolic vicar of the Catholic Military vicariate of the Netherlands on 16 April 1957. He contributed to scientific publications, led the Pax Christi movement in the Netherlands, and was created Cardinal-Priest of San Gioacchino ai Prati di Castello by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of 28 March 1960. From 1962-65, the Dutch primate participated at the Second Vatican Council, and sat on its Board of Presidency. During one session of the Council, Alfrink had Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani's microphone turned off after the latter exceeded his time limit. Alfrink was one of the cardinal electors in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI. Along with Cardinal Giovanni Colombo, he assisted Cardinal Achille Li√©nart in delivering one of the closing messages of the Council on 8 December 1965. He served as President of the Episcopal Conference of the Netherlands. Resigning as Utrecht's archbishop on 6 December 1975, he later voted in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II respectively. During the last years of his life, Alfrink lived, with his housekeeper Dora, in a bungalow at Dijnselburg near Huis ter Heide. The bungalow was called \\"Dora et Labora\\" by the Cardinal. It was specifically designed for him. He reappeared in public when Pope John Paul II visited the cardinal in 1985 during a papal visit to Benelux. Bernardus Johannes Cardinal Alfrink died in Nieuwegein at age 87, and after his funeral services in St. Catharine's Cathedral, was buried at St. Barbara's cemetery, next to his predecessor. Views=Aggiornamento Viewed by some as a \\"liberal\\", the Cardinal once said, \\"It is always a good thing for the Church to move forward. It is not good if the Church comes to a standstill.\\" Edward Schillebeeckx Nijmegen's Dominican theologian Edward Schillebeeckx was Alfrink's regular advisor. Alfrink supported Schillebeeckx and took the latter's condemnation as an offence to the Catholic Church in the Netherlands. Royal conversion Alfrink refused to respond to the Dutch Reformed Church's call for clarification in regards to Princess Irene's conversion to Catholicism in connection with her intended marriage to Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma. Awards and honors In 1986, Alfrink received the Four Freedom Award for the Freedom of Worship. Alfrink's bibliography *Israelitische und Babylonische Jenseitsvorstellungen.

The town is situated on the northern edge of the T≈ôebo≈à basin (407 meters above sea level), and is known for its fish ponds and pine forests. Since the late 19th century, it has been an important railway junction between ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, T√°bor, T≈ôebo≈à and Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec. The railway station remains one of the biggest local employers. The sand, concrete and food industries are also long-established in the town. History The town was first mentioned in 1259 as a hamlet and a redoubt on the salt road from Austria to Prague. Emperor Charles IV gave it the status of a town in 1362. In the 15th century, the town saw many fires and was looted by the Hussites. It was Petr Vok from the House of Rosenberg, a famous fish pond founder and supporter, who let the town grow again a hundred years later. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) damaged the town badly again - with only about 50 people remaining. New development came with the ≈†vamberk dynasty in the second half of the 17th century. Vesel√≠ stayed in their possession until the end of the First World War in 1918. It was originally two separate towns ‚Äì Vesel√≠ nad Lu≈ænic√≠ and Mezimost√≠ nad Ne≈æ√°rkou (a town since 1908). They were joined in 1943 to make one town under the present name. Sights The Church of Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the oldest monument from the 13th century, dominates the town. The renaissance Old Town Hall is the main building on the square and together with the Museum forms an architectonic unit. Chapel of St. Mark (1754) and the Little Church of St. Florian in Mezimost√≠ (1718) are other notable buildings. Vesel√≠ nad Lu≈ænic√≠ is a popular summer resort, especially for canoers and hikers. Another attraction are the man-made lakes south of the town; these were created in the 1970s and 1980s when huge amounts of sand were quarried. A nature trail runs around them.

He authored many books on atheism and proposed atheism as self-confidence. He propagated positive atheism by his articles, speeches, books and his social work. He is the founder of Atheist Centre along with his wife Saraswathi Gora and a few volunteers. Early days Gora was born on 15 November 1902, into an orthodox Telugu Brahmin family in Chhatrapur, Odisha, India. He pursued a botany degree, eventually earning his Master's in botany at Presidency College in Madras. He married Saraswathi Gora in 1922, when she was only 10. He taught botany at various institutes at Madurai, Coimbatore, Colombo and Kakinada, for fifteen years. Life and work Gora started his activism against superstition in the 1920s. He and his wife publicly viewed solar eclipses, as there was a superstitious belief that pregnant women should not do so. They stayed in haunted houses to dispel the myths about such places. Gora used to run a monthly programme called \\"cosmopolitan dinners\\" every full moon night, where people of all castes and religions gathered together. Gora insisted on staying in a Harijan locality whenever he was invited to address a village. He also conducted several inter- caste and inter-religious marriages. One of his own sons and daughters married spouses from untouchable castes. In 1933, he was dismissed from the PR College in Kakinada for his atheist views. In 1939, he was dismissed from the Hindu College in Machilipatnam for the same reason. Atheist Centre In 1940, after his dismissal, he and his wife founded the Atheist Centre, in a small village called Mudunur in the Krishna district. The Atheist Centre was (and is) heavily involved in social reforms. On the eve of Independence in 1947, they moved the Atheist centre to Vijayawada. In 1941, he published his first book on atheism in Telugu, Atheism: There is no god (Telugu: Nasthikatvamu: Devudu ledu). Throughout the 1940s, he worked in the Indian independence movement. In 1942, Gora along with his wife and eldest son were arrested during the Quit India Movement. Their 18-month son had to accompany his mother to the Royavellor jail. Gora and Gandhi had several discussions, some of which have been recorded in the book An Atheist With Gandhi. When Gandhi asked him to differentiate between atheism and godlessness Gora replied, Gandhi supported Gora's anti-untouchability reform movement, and remarked that he wished Gora would succeed in producing a Tuskegee in India. Tuskegee in Alabama, United States, is an important site in Africa American history where Booker T. Washington established the Tuskegee University. In 1952, he contested in the parliamentary elections to propagate his idea of party-less democracy. In 1967, he also contested in the assembly polls. World Atheist Conference Gora visited several nations in 1970 and 1974. He was in touch with the American atheist, Madalyn Murray O'Hair. On 5 October 1970, O'Hair mentioned Gora and his Atheist Center on her radio show. In 1970, when Gora stopped in United States during his tour, he met O'Hair. They decided that a World Atheist Conference should be held every three years. Gora offered to host the first one in 1972. O'Hair was not able to attend as her visa was not approved in time. The first World Atheist Conference was held on 1972. After the event, Gora published a book in English called Positive Atheism. Beef and Pork Party Gora first organized Beef and Pork Friendship party in Vijayawada on 15 August 1972, the Silver Jubilee of Indian Independence, there was big commotion and opposition. True to his principles, Gora urged for voluntary participation. Puri Shakaracharya and some orthodox people violently opposed and threatened to disrupt the function. When the matter went up to the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, The government reacted positively and provided police protection. Thousands of people gathered, to witness the beef and pork party. Gora and Saraswathi Gora, who headed the programme, made it clear that it was meant to bring social cohesion. Participants were asked to sign in a register. Among the hundreds of gatherers, 138 people came forward and ate beef and pork together. They included atheists, and even orthodox Hindus, Muslims and Christians. When similar programme was held at Coimbatore, Periyar EV Ramaswami and Gora participated. In various places including Visakhapatnam, Gudivada and Suryapet, Beef and Pork programmes were held. Family Gora had nine children. Gora got his eldest daughter, Manorama, married to Arjuna Rao, who belonged to the Dalit community In 1949. The marriage was held in Sevagram, in presence of Jawaharlal Nehru. The marriage of his eldest son, Lavanam, with Hemalata, the daughter of Gurram Jashuva, was also held in Sevagram In 1960. His eldest son was an atheist and Gandhian Lavanam, daughter Mythri and another son Vijayam, continued to organise the World Atheist Conference. Mythri chairperson of Atheist Centre and Vijayam is the current executive director of the Atheist Centre. The physician Samaram Goparaju is his son. His daughter, Chennupati Vidya, is a social worker. She was elected to the Lok Sabha, of the Parliament of India, in 1980 and 1989. Political views and philosophy Gora supported partyless democracy. Gora was a Gandhian and believed in Sarvodaya (progress of all). He rejected historical materialism and considered Marxism a 'fatalist philosophy'. He believed that atheism allows a person to surpass the barriers of castes and religions. It allows a person to understand that his/her actions are directed by free will and not Karma, fate or divine will. This in turn would allow Harijans to be liberated, as they would no longer believe that they are fated to be untouchable. Death Gora died on 26 July 1975 in Vijayawada. His autobiography, completed a few days before his death, was published in 1976. The Atheist Centre continued under the guidance of Saraswathi Gora, until her death in 2006 on 19 August. Recognition In 2002, India Post, the postal department of the Government of India, released a postage stamp of five rupee denomination commemorating Gora's birth centenary.

It was founded in 1990 as Wunsch Auction Systems by R. Steven Wunsch, and moved from New York City to Arizona in 1992. It closed in October 2001 due to lack of trading volume. History=1990-1991: Founding The exchange was founded in 1990 as Wunsch Auction Systems by R. Steven Wunsch, formerly of Kidder Peabody. The computers were based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with the headquarters in New York City. The technology trading center in Minnesota was built and run by a group of former Cray Research Supercomputer technologists that included Christopher Moran, Gray Lorig, Kerry Yndestad and Paul Sustman. Due to the exchange's low trading volume and small size, the Securities and Exchange Commission exempted Wunsch and the exchange from regulations, and it went unregistered. The system was an electronic auction for online trading of NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks for after-hours trades. The system was not intended for individual investors, but rather large trader entities. It got off to a \\"slow start\\" on Wall Street as a computerized stock trading systems that bypassed \\"traditional\\" exchange systems. The company was fought by the New York Stock Exchange. As of December 25, 1991, the exchange allowed about 3,100 stocks to be traded during a day, and the system had 56 customers that were institutions. It also had smaller activity than it needed, with Wunsch saying it needed about 24 customers a day placing orders to attract steady business, while it regularly had no more than a dozen customers per day place orders. As of 1991, it offered two auctions each day, one taking place a half-hour before the opening of the NYSE, and the other a half-hour after the NYSE closed. The exchange sought to connect bidders and sellers with set desired trade prices, with investors able to go to the other exchanges, either NYSE or regional, if no match was found. Over six months in 1991, Wunsch signed about four dozen institutional investors, with the New York Times describing the project as \\"the nation's first electronic stock-trading network to be designated a bona fide stock exchange by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\" It was not the first electronic exchange, but it was the first one set up to directly compete with traditional stock exchanges via price \\"discovery\\" in a bidding process. Traditional exchanges \\"cried foul\\" over the new exchange, according to the New York Times, with regulators being asked to reconsider what \\"constitutes a stock exchange.\\" It was worried that although the new exchange had a tiny amount of business, it \\"theoretically could supplant the Big Board for the large institutional investors.\\" Officials at the NYSE and other exchange argued that the best, easiest trades would be \\"cherrypicked\\" by the new exchange. Also, it \\"threatens to undermine\\" the NYSE's role as the price setter for corporate shares, according to the New York Times. Later in 1991, 125 institutional investors had signed on. 1991-1992: Move to Arizona In June 1991, the governor of Arizona signed legislation for the state to establish a stock exchange. In December 1991, the state of Arizona approved of Wunsch moving his online electronic auction to Phoenix, Arizona from Wall Street and rename it the Arizona Stock Exchange, or AZX. Formerly Wunsch Auction Systems, Inc. it was later operated by AZX, Inc. Arizona received up to $2 million in loans from Arizona, as well as promotion, to serve as incentive for moving to the state. Although Wuncsch asserted that the new exchange was not another regional stock market, Arizona officials said they hoped local small and medium companies would gain exposure. It was said the office in Arizona would become active in February 1992. Trading commenced on March 30, 1992. 1993-2001: Auctions and closure In April 2001, the SEC granted the Arizona Stock Exchange permission to hold one of its 30-minute live auctions when the markets opened. The exchange auctioned online stocks as though they were antiques or art. Previously, the exchange had only been able to operate on off-hours for a number of reasons, and hadn't been \\"introduced in a full- form way.\\" Support for the new time slot for the auction came from companies such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Credit Suisse, First Boston and Instinet. The auction's founder and president was Steven Wunsch. While the idea behind AZX was ahead of its time in the 1990s and anticipated the more successful electronic communication networks such as Archipelago, it closed in October 2001 primarily due to lack of volume. Business model Restricted to use by large institutional users only, participants could conduct screen-based trades of equity and other products through either direct dial-up or internet access. The Arizona Stock Exchange was structured as a proprietary \\"Single Price\\" electronic call market. Unique to the Arizona Stock Exchange was the ability to discover the best or \\"single\\" price for a stock during the auction based upon supply and demand utilizing both an open book and reserve book of equity orders. Operating under a de minimis exemption, it was not required to be registered or regulated as a stock exchange with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The general philosophy behind the Arizona Stock Exchange was to let natural buyers and sellers of equities trade directly with one another without intermediation by a broker or dealer. The AZX sought to reduce transaction costs for its participants, remove volatility from the market and determine more robust and fair pricing for equities traded.

As part of Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Goodfellow's main mission is cryptologic and intelligence training for the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Navy, and Marine Corps. Military firefighters are also trained here as part of the 312th Training Squadron. It is the home of the 17th Training Wing (17 TRW). The base is named for World War I aviator First Lieutenant John J. Goodfellow, Jr. History Goodfellow's history traces to the days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but its name registered the valor and sacrifice of an earlier conflict. On 14 September 1918, 1st Lieutenant John J. Goodfellow, Jr., of San Angelo, Texas, boarded his Salmson 2A2 observation plane at Gondreville Airfield in France to conduct visual reconnaissance behind enemy lines. The mission was part of a larger undertaking just underway, a major American offensive intended to reduce the German salient near Saint-Mihiel. Unfortunately, adverse weather permitted observation only at a low altitude that exposed the lumbering Salmson to enemy pursuit. Three days later, the offensive a success, the young pilot's remains were recovered from his ruined craft and interred at the St. Mihiel American Cemetery and Memorial near Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle. World War II Goodfellow Field 1943 Classbook The peace that arrived two months later endured a mere two decades more. Constrained by neutrality legislation, but witness to the aggression across Europe, Africa, and Asia, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt began a program of preparedness which included the construction of facilities dedicated to advanced air training. Several such bases were envisioned for Texas and one, specifically, for the Fort Worth- Midland-San Angelo triangle. Civic leaders from San Angelo immediately commended their community to the U.S. War Department. A generous offer of sewage and electrical service, a railroad spur, and a 50-year lease on at one dollar per year easily decided the issue. Construction of the new San Angelo Air Corps Basic Flying School began at once. Officially established on 17 August 1940, the base was ready for occupancy by 21 January 1941, and the first classes of students soon arrived. On 11 June 1941, in dedication to a young hero and in tribute to the community that shaped him, the base was officially renamed Goodfellow Field. In the next four years, more than 10,000 trained pilots were graduated, and many were decorated for outstanding heroism in action against Germany, Italy, and Japan. United States Air Force Still, the Axis collapse did not dissolve the Goodfellow mission. Goodfellow continued to train pilots into the postwar era, primarily for large multiengine piston and turboprop aircraft, first on the AT-6 Texan, the T-28 Trojan, and then, beginning in 1954, on the twin-engine TB-25 and B-25 Mitchell. On 3 September 1958, with nearly 20,000 aviators to its credit, Goodfellow graduated its last class of pilots, as the Air Force and Air Training Command (ATC) transitioned to the new Undergraduate Pilot Training construct with T-37 and T-38 Talon aircraft that required minimum 8000-ft (2400-m) runway lengths, far longer than Goodfellow's 5500-ft primary runways. With the transfer of the base from ATC to the USAF Security Service (USAFSS), Goodfellow's mission became the training of Air Force personnel in the advanced cryptologic skills that the Security Service required. Eight years later, in 1966, the mission expanded further to include joint-service training in these same skills for U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps personnel. Although flight operations at Goodfellow decreased dramatically after 1958, minimal activities continued with both transient aircraft and locally based Cessna U-3 Administrators (1958‚Äì1971), DeHavilland U-6 Beavers (1960‚Äì1966), Piasecki H-21, CH-21 and HH-21 Workhorse helicopters (1958‚Äì1966) and Cessna O-2 Skymasters (1972‚Äì1975). Goodfellow's runways were permanently closed in March 1975.http://www.airfields- freeman.com/TX/Airfields_TX_Abilene_W.htm#goodfellow After 38 years of pilot and then intelligence training, Goodfellow's mission had apparently come to a close with the announcement in 1978 that the base would revert to ATC and was a candidate for closure. Since Goodfellow was a single-mission facility, its mission could perhaps be executed more economically elsewhere. By then, senior intelligence personnel had already begun seriously to contemplate the consolidation of all Air Force-managed intelligence training at one location. The site selected for intelligence training consolidation was Goodfellow, and the base was designated a technical training center on 1 March 1985. During the next three years, intelligence training consolidation brought to Goodfellow advanced imagery training from Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; electronic intelligence operations training from Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi; and targeting, intelligence applications, and general intelligence training from Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, as a result of Lowry's identification for closure under Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). The successful completion of intelligence training consolidation on 30 June 1988 further facilitated the development of intelligence training integration, a multidisciplinary approach to the training of intelligence professionals. In 1992, as part of an overall organizational restructuring of the Air Force, ATC was inactivated, replaced by the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), which became the \\"parent\\" major command for Goodfellow AFB. On 1 July 1993, the 17th Training Wing was activated on Goodfellow AFB. With the change in name came a marked diversification and increase in Goodfellow's mission. Rounds one and two of the BRAC process transferred special instruments training from the former Lowry AFB and fire protection training from the former Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois, to Goodfellow. To support the increased training load, Goodfellow underwent extensive modernization and growth.

They are common, with as much as 70% of people experiencing them. They can be benign, or associated with more serious conditions. When no cause or pathology is identified, they are diagnosed as benign fasciculation syndrome. Diagnosis The most effective way to detect fasciculations may be surface electromyography (EMG). Surface EMG is more sensitive than needle electromyography and clinical observation in the detection of fasciculation in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Deeper areas of contraction can be detected by electromyography (EMG) testing, though they can happen in any skeletal muscle in the body. Fasciculations arise as a result of spontaneous depolarization of a lower motor neuron leading to the synchronous contraction of all the skeletal muscle fibers within a single motor unit. An example of normal spontaneous depolarization is the constant contractions of cardiac muscle, causing the heart to beat. Usually, intentional movement of the involved muscle causes fasciculations to cease immediately, but they may return once the muscle is at rest again. Tics must also be distinguished from fasciculations. Small twitches of the upper or lower eyelid, for example, are not tics, because they do not involve a whole muscle, rather are twitches of a few muscle fibre bundles, that are not suppressible.  Causes Fasciculations have a variety of causes, the majority of which are benign, but can also be due to disease of the motor neurons. They are encountered by up to 70% of all healthy people, though for most, it is quite infrequent. In some cases, the presence of fasciculations can be annoying and interfere with quality of life. If a neurological examination is otherwise normal and EMG testing does not indicate any additional pathology, a diagnosis of benign fasciculation syndrome is usually made. Risk factors Risk factors for benign fasciculations are age, stress, fatigue, and strenuous exercise. Fasciculations can be caused by anxiety, caffeine or alcohol and thyroid disease. Magnesium deficiency is a common cause of fasciculation.https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/magnesium-deficiency- symptoms Other factors may include the use of anticholinergic drugs over long periods. In particular, these include ethanolamines such as diphenhydramine (brand names Benadryl, Dimedrol, Daedalon and Nytol), used as an antihistamine and sedative, and dimenhydrinate (brand names Dramamine, Driminate, Gravol, Gravamin, Vomex, and Vertirosan) for nausea and motion sickness. Persons with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) may experience paraesthesia (especially numbness) shortly after taking such medication; fasciculation episodes begin as the medication wears off. Stimulants can cause fasciculations directly. These include caffeine, pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), amphetamines, and the asthma bronchodilators salbutamol (brand names Proventil, Combivent, Ventolin). Medications used to treat attention deficit disorder (ADHD) often contain stimulants as well, and are common causes of benign fasciculations. Since asthma and ADHD are much more serious than the fasciculations themselves, this side effect may have to be tolerated by the patient after consulting a physician or pharmacist. The depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine causes fasciculations. It is a normal side effect of the drug's administration, and can be prevented with a small dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker prior to the administration of succinylcholine, often 10% of a nondepolarizing NMB's induction dose. Even if a drug such as caffeine causes fasciculations, that does not necessarily mean it is the only cause. For example, a very slight magnesium deficiency by itself (see below) might not be enough for fasciculations to occur, but when combined with caffeine, the two factors together could be enough. Treatment Reducing stress and anxiety is therefore another useful treatment. There is no proven treatment for fasciculations in people with ALS. Among patients with ALS, fasciculation frequency is not associated with the duration of ALS and is independent of the degree of limb weakness and limb atrophy. No prediction of ALS disease duration can be made based on fasciculation frequency alone.  Epidemiology  Fasciculations are observed more often in men, and clinicians are overrepresented in study samples.

It is situated on the River Parrett, 5 miles (8 km) west of Yeovil, and has a population of 275. The village consists largely of small cottages built in the local golden hamstone quarried at the local Ham Hill. History The village was recorded in Saxon times as 'Ceoselbergon' and was later mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Ceolseberge' in the holding of Robert, Count of Mortain. The name derives from the Old English cisel and beorg (gravel and hill). The parish was part of the hundred of Houndsborough. The Earls of Ilchester held most of the village until 1914 when the estate was sold, having inherited it from the heirs of Joan Wadham, Lady Strangways, first wife of Sir Giles Strangways (1528-1562) of Melbury Sampford, sister and co-heiress of Nicholas Wadham, co-founder of Wadham College, Oxford. The current Baron and Baroness of Chiselborough do not reside in the area. The annual Chiselborough Fair was held on common ground near the street now known as Fair Place. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Yeovil Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography It is surrounded by five hills within the parish of the same name. Geologically, the valley consists of a thin layer of Fuller's earth clay over Yeovil sands. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Peter and St Paul has 12th-century origins. The chancel dates from the 17th century and the nave was rebuilt by E L Bracebridge 1842. The current priest in charge is Rev. Peter Thomas.

In the Dutch education system, particular education (\\"bijzonder onderwijs\\") refers to a separate category of education distinct from both public and private education, in which a school is administered by an independent board, as opposed to a government authority, while still receiving government funding. Particular schools are comparable to the concept of a charter school, with the additional characteristic of being grounded in a particular religious denomination or educational philosophy. Particular education is not to be confused with \\"speciaal onderwijs\\", which refers to schools specialized to deal with physical and/or learning disabilities.  Definition  Particular education schools teach on the basis of religion, philosophy of life or a vision of education. Public school lessons are not based on religion or belief. The government pays for both types of education. For this, schools must meet conditions. For example, education must be of sufficient quality. There are also requirements, for example, for the minimum number of pupils, the competence of teachers and the number of hours of education. Particular schools differ from both public and private schools in the way they are funded and run. While privately run, particular schools are not altogether outside the control of the Dutch Ministry of Education, as they are subsidized on equal footing with public schools, and cannot charge tuition over the statutory rate. They are therefore also distinct from private schools‚Äîof which there are a small but increasing number in the country‚Äîwhich get no subsidies and can charge market tuition.  Public schools  Public schools are open to every student and teacher. Education is not based on religion or belief. There are public schools that teach from certain educational principles. The municipality must ensure that there is enough public education. This is also stated in Article 23 of the Dutch Constitution on freedom of education. When there are not enough public schools in the area, then the municipality ensures that children receive public education in a different way. For example, by arranging transport to a public school.  Particular schools  Special schools teach from a certain direction, which is a religious or philosophical belief. A special school is usually created, because parents need a school of a particular religious or pedagogical direction.  Subcategories  Particular education can be further subdivided into two categories: * Denominational Particular Education (\\"confessioneel bijzonder onderwijs\\") refers to schools grounded in a religious denomination, often founded by or linked to church boards or religious foundations. Examples of denominational schools are Christian schools, including Roman Catholic, Evangelical, and Protestant Reformed, as well as Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu schools. Denominational schools represent the majority of particular schools. * General Particular Education (\\"algemeen bijzonder onderwijs\\") refers to a minority of particular schools not rooted in religion but operating on a particular educational concept, such as Dalton education, Montessori education, Jenaplan education , and Waldorf education.http://www.rug.nl/education/scholierenacademie/scholieren/profielwerkstuk/alfasteunpunt/subjects/onderwerpen/godsdienst/scholen In practice, classification is complicated by schools that combine aspects of denominational and general, as well as public and particular education, for instance schools that adhere to an educational philosophy while lacking an independent school board, and schools combining denominational and educational philosophy in their teaching.  History  The distinction between particular and public education arose from the hugely influential school struggle, which dominated Dutch politics from the mid-19th century until the Pacification of 1917, when public and religious schools were granted equal rights to government funding under article 23 of the Dutch constitution.  Criticism  Since the post-World War II decline of the pillarization of Dutch society along ideological lines, and the rapid secularization of Dutch society, government funding of particular schools has in recent years become a topic of debate once again, with several political parties calling for an amendment or revoking of article 23 of the constitution. In July 2015, Sander Dekker, the State Secretary for the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, proposed to the parliament to change the law on two aspects: # Not to demand that new schools are representing an ideological direction, such as a religion. New schools could be based on an idea for good education, for instance ICT-based education, green schools, or other innovative concept, as long as sufficient interest exists for such a system. # To introduce a more severe quality control. Freedom of education should not be a license for bad educational systems.

The teenage mall culture which formed around it and nearby malls formed the basis of the 1982 satirical song \\"Valley Girl\\" by Frank Zappa and daughter Moon Zappa, which mentions the Galleria by name (though misattributes its location as Encino, which it abuts). The mall has also been a shooting location for many films, most notably the seminal 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High as well as the 1983 film Valley Girl, both of which focused on the early 1980s San Fernando Valley youth culture. History The three-level mall was built on the site of Moses Sherman's original 1911 thousand-acre investment in the area, at the present-day intersection of Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards. It opened in 1980 with two department stores (Robinsons anchored the south, May Company anchored the north). Pacific Theatres' Pacific 4 occupied the uppermost level of the mall. The mall became famous in the early 1980s as being the center of the teenage mall culture and a well-known teenage hangout. The Galleria formed the basis of the Frank Zappa/Moon Unit Zappa 1982 satirical single \\"Valley Girl\\" from Zappa's album Ship Arriving Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch. Following on the popularity of the song, the TV show Real People hosted an Ultimate Valley Girl competition (referred to as \\"a nightmare\\" by contest judge Moon Zappa), at the Galleria. In 1993, Robinsons and May Company merged, forming Robinsons-May - both stores in the mall were converted to Robinsons- May, the north store becoming a Men's and Home store, and the south store becoming a Women's and Children's store. The next decade saw business at the Galleria decline. In January 1994, the mall closed for 11 days for repairs following the Northridge earthquake. Although the mall reopened quickly, Robinson-May didn't re-open its south wing store for four years following the earthquake, and many smaller stores on that floor closed. During that closure, the mall suffered due to having only one main anchor store. Mall management sued to evict Robinson-May in 1998, alleging that the delay was a lease violation and caused the store closures, but R-M countersued, claiming that poor mall promotion and management were the cause. Closures continued through the 1990s until a gift and jewelry shop was one of the few remaining stores in 1999. The rebuilt Sherman Oaks Galleria, opened in 2002, seen from Ventura and Sepulveda The mall closed in April 1999 for a major renovation and reopened in 2002 as an open-air center which was quite different from its previous incarnation. The new layout was termed \\"mixed-use\\". The only remnant of the original mall is the court where the Pacific 16 Theatres is located, which are on the uppermost of what was previously the southern Robinsons-May store. The majority of the remaining mall was turned into offices. Warner Bros. set up offices in what was once one of the mall entrances. Several mortgage companies and financial services providers are headquartered within the center. Additional tenants include 24 Hour Fitness, Burke Williams Day Spa, Devry, the Paul Mitchell School, as well as several major restaurant chains (Cheesecake Factory, P. F. Chang's China Bistro, Buffalo Wild Wings, & Frida's Mexican). The remodeling and new construction were designed by Gensler and built by Peck/Jones Construction, which in 2005 filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On Monday, June 4, 2007, the Pacific Galleria 16 Theaters changed into an ArcLight Cinema, as the Pacific Theaters own the ArcLight brand. The transformation began gradually, with re-branding at the start, and renovation throughout the summer of 2007. The theater was closed for three months to complete the process of this. Use in films The Galleria was featured in scenes in several films. Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Valley Girl(aerial, exterior shots), Night of the Comet, Commando, Back to the Future Part II, Albert Brooks' Mother, Phantom of the Mall: Eric's Revenge, Walk Like a Man (1987),Walk Like a Man (1987) at 1:00:36. Innerspace and Chopping Mall were filmed at the Galleria, as were scenes for the 2011 release Crazy, Stupid, Love.

The villages of Oberholzheim, Bronnen and Stetten were incorporated into the municipality of Achstetten between 1972 and 1975. Geography The strung-out village is situated west of the federal road Bundesstra√üe 30. The river Rot runs through it. Achstetten lies approximately north of the city of Laupheim and approximately south of the city of Ulm. The name Achstetten is derived from the Old High German words aha meaning water, and stet, meaning place; the name meaning thus place close to water. History Close to the road to Ersingen, tumuli from the Hallstatt period have been discovered. This indicates that the area has been settled for at least 2500 years. Celtic tribes are associated with Hallstatt culture. During the Roman period, Achstetten was also a place of settlement, indicated by the remains of Roman villa. The outlines of this structure are visible on aerial photographs. The Hil(de)gartstra√üe in Achstetten is a reminder of an early mediaeval trade route. It is a relic of a route leading from Konstanz via Meersburg towards Ulm and then further via Heidenheim to Aalen and W√ºrzburg, terminating at Fulda. There is evidence to indicate that a road towards the crossing of the river Iller branched off on the territory of Achstetten. This road would then lead on towards Regensburg. Achstetten is first mentioned in a charter dated 1194. This charter was signed by Pope Celestine III, confirming the rights of Wiblingen Abbey in Asteten. The possessions of the monastery of Wiblingen in Achstetten were, however, certainly older than 1194. From 1356 to 1447, the Freiherrn von Freyberg were the sole rulers of Achstetten. In 1442, the rule over Achstetten was divided amongst three brothers, Eberhard von Freyberg, Hans von Freyberg and Wilhelm von Freyberg. However, in 1447, Wilhelm von Freyberg sold his part to Gutenzell Abbey. As a consequence, the Freiherrn von Freyberg were forced to share the rule of the village with Gutenzell Abbey until 1625. In 1594, Ochsenhausen Abbey bought the second half of the revenues made from tithes, having already owned the first half for some time. Hunting party with Karl Viktor C√§sar Reuttner von Weyl (sitting, left) Through marriage, the two remaining parts of Achstetten came into the possession of the Counts of √ñttingen-Spielberg in 1689. They exchanged it in 1765, so that from 1765 onwards, it was part of the landed territories of the Freiherrn von Welden. The Freiherrn von Welden sold it on 12 May 1795 to the last Komtur of the Teutonic Knights, the Freiherr Beat Conrad Reuttner von Weyl. He transferred his possession to his nephew Julius C√§sar Reuttner von Weyl, who, in 1802, bought the rights of the revenue from the complete tithes from Ochsenhausen Abbey. He was elevated to the rank of count in 1819. To this day, his successors are owners of the Lordship of Achstetten. Following the secularization in 1803, the Counts of Toerring-Gutenzell became the inheritors of the share of Gutenzell Abbey, part of which had, since 1449, also been the hamlet of M√∂nchh√∂fe. As part of the mediatization, Achstetten became temporarily part of Bavaria in 1805, only to be handed over to the newly formed Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in 1806. Achstetten, ca. 1900 After having initially been part of the district of Wiblingen, it became part of the district of Laupheim in 1845. On 1 October 1938, Achstetten became part of the district of Biberach. On 1 March 1972, the formerly independent municipality of Oberholzheim was incorporated into Achstetten, followed on 1 November 1972 by Bronnen and on 1 January 1975 by Stetten. Coat of arms The three silver balls on blue were taken from the coat of arms of the Freiherrn of Freyberg who ruled the village from 1356 to 1625. The red and silver banderole is a reminder of the Cistercian abbey in Gutenzell with whom the Freiherrn of Freyberg shared authority over the village from 1447 onwards. Attractions=Parish church St Oswald and Agatha Parish church St Oswald and Agatha Chapel of the Annunciation Castle Achstetten Country Inn R√∂ssle Christoph Martin Wieland, 1805 Originally, Achstetten was part of the parish of Laupheim. It became an independent parish in 1442, when the Freiherrn von Freyberg founded a new parish, subordinate to the monastery of Ochsenhausen. The monastery of Ochsenhausen had the church St Oswald and Agatha built in Renaissance-style in 1625, replacing a late mediaeval structure at the same location. In 1823, the spire was raised and a new top was added. The interior was last renovated in 1932 and a new pipe organ was installed in 2000. The gallery is separated into two parts, one part designated for the general public, and a second part into which only the former rulers of Achstetten, members of the dynasty of Reuttner von Weyl, were permitted. The compartment for the aristocracy is connected to the castle by a passageway, built on wooden columns. A similar structure existed in Laupheim. There, however, the passageway is only preserved in fragments. Chapel of the Annunciation The Chapel of the Annunciation was built ca. 1650, immediately after the Thirty Years' War, as a burial church for the Freiherrn von Freyberg. Following the acquisition of Achstetten by the Counts of Reuttner von Weyl in 1795, the chapel has been used as the final resting place for members of that family. The structure of the Chapel is marked by flat wall-pillars on the interior as well as the exterior, a semi-circular choir and a pointed-topped spire. Castle A castle was first mentioned in 1386. The original castle was burnt down in 1525 during the German Peasants' War after the Baltringer Haufen had stormed the building. A rebuilding of the castle at the same location was mentioned in 1583. The last Komtur of the Teutonic Knights, Freiherr Beat Conrad Reuttner von Weyl, had a new castle built by the official architect of the Teutonic Knights, Franz Anton Bagnato, between 1794 and 1796.  Country Inn R√∂ssle  As early as 1449, a tavern was mentioned to have existed in Achstetten. In 1573, the two lordships over Achstetten determined that apart from this one, no other tavern or inn was to be allowed in Achstetten. Even then, the inn was used as a place for gatherings where the villagers would discuss and decide local affairs. The present building was erected at the beginning of the 18th century and continued to serve as a country inn until 2008 when it was converted into individual flats. In 2010, the designation of the building was changed when the local council approved plans by developers to establish a hostel for travelling tradesmen on the premises.

In performance it normally lasts just under ten minutes. The concerto is an example of programme music, representing both the struggle for Warsaw and the romance of the leading characters in the film. It became very popular in Britain during World War II. The concerto is written in imitation of the style of Sergei Rachmaninoff. It initiated a trend for similar short piano concertos in the Romantic style, which have been dubbed \\"tabloid concertos\\". Background The composer, Richard Addinsell, was born in London and initially studied law before turning to a career in music. His time at the Royal College of Music was brief, as he was soon drawn to musical theatre, and he also wrote for radio, but his most memorable contributions are to a series of film scores beginning in 1936. He wrote the music for the 1939 film Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the original Gaslight (released in 1940, not to be confused with the later Hollywood version), Scrooge, and Dangerous Moonlight (1941, also released in the US as Suicide Squadron). It is this last picture that began the trend of \\"tabloid concertos,\\"K. J. Donnelly, British Film Music and Film Musicals (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), 50. John Huntley defines the term as a \\"piece of context film music which was duly recorded and edited into the finished film\\". See his British Film Music (New York: Arno Press & The New York Times, 1972), 54. classical-style compositions written for performance in movies. John Huntley explores the reason behind this concept: > The associations which individual members of the audience may have in > relation to a certain piece of well-known music are quite beyond the control > of the director of a film in which it is used‚Ä¶. And so with Dangerous > Moonlight it was rightly decided to have a piece of music specially written, > that could be used to become associated in the mind of the audience with > Poland, air raids in Warsaw, and whatever the director wanted to > suggest.John Huntley, British Film Music (New York: Arno Press & The New > York Times, 1972), 53‚Äì54. The concerto was not part of the original plan. According to Roy Douglas, at that time orchestrator for all of Addinsell's scores: \\"The film's director had originally wanted to use Sergei Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, but this idea was either forbidden by the copyright owners or was far too expensive\\".Roy Douglas, \\"The Warsaw Connection: Roy Douglas Remembers How It Actually Turned Out\\", ICRC 18 (1999): 62; reprinted with slight changes in Jan G. Swynnoe, The Best Years of British Film Music: 1936‚Äì1958 (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2002), 215. Thus Addinsell wanted the piece to sound as much like Rachmaninoff as possible, and Douglas remembers, \\"while I was orchestrating the Warsaw Concerto I had around me the miniature scores of the Second and Third Piano Concertos, as well as the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.\\" And although it is at the heart of Dangerous Moonlight, the Concerto is never performed complete but rather revealed piecemeal. The opening of the work is heard when the two protagonists meet, and it is further developed when they are on their honeymoon. Finally, in the only extended concert sequence, we are given the closing section. But its use is not restricted to scenes with the \\"composer\\" at the piano. The themes are found as underscoring throughout the film, and in this way a brief concert piece gains a dramatic resonance that belies its small scale. Role in the film Dangerous Moonlight takes place at the start of World War II and tells the story of a Polish concert pianist and composer, Stefan Radecki (Anton Walbrook) who defends his country by becoming a fighter pilot. After an air raid in Warsaw by the German army, he is discovered by an American reporter, Carol Peters (Sally Gray), practising the piano in a bombed-out building. It is the opening of his Warsaw Concerto, at this point a work in progress, and the first line he says to her is, \\"It is not safe to be out alone when the moon is so bright\\" (referring to the moonlight bombing raids). Gazing intently at Carol and disclosing \\"something lovely you've just given me\\", he introduces the lyrical second theme of the Concerto. And, indeed, this melody is always associated with Carol.Laing, Heather, \\"The Gendered Score: Music and Gender in 1940s Melodrama and the Woman's Film\\", Ashgate Publishing, 2007, pp.156-9. Like Rachmaninoff, Addinsell introduces it almost as a nocturne. Stefan speaks of the piece later in the film: \\"This music is you and me. It's the story of the two of us in Warsaw, of us in America, of us in ‚Ä¶ where else I don't know. That's why I can't finish it\\". But finish it he does. Similar to the way that Rachmaninoff returns to his second theme in his Second Piano Concerto, the \\"Carol\\" melody is used, not only to bind together the emotional strands of the drama, but to bring the Concerto to a triumphant conclusion. Throughout the film, the unfinished piece is defined in a relationship with Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's \\"Military\\" Polonaise, symbolising Polish patriotism. It is \\"completed\\" when the Polonaise elements are integrated with the Romantic theme, implying the fusion of romantic and patriotic love. Within the context of its story, Dangerous Moonlight is also effective in creating the impression of a larger work written and performed by the film's fictional composer and pianist. When snatches of the Concerto are first played, one character tells another, \\"I've got the records\\", and when the \\"premiere\\" is shown, we are provided with a close-up of the program, Warsaw Concerto, with three movements listed. Only one movement was actually written by Addinsell. Popularity The success of the film led to an immediate demand for the work, and a recording was dutifully supplied from the film's soundtrack (at nine minutes, it fit perfectly on two sides of a 12-inch disk playing at 78 rpm) along with sheet music for a piano solo version.Huntley, British Film Music, 54. Such unexpected success had another consequence. The off-screen piano part was played by Louis Kentner, a fine British musician known for his performances of Franz Liszt, but he had insisted that there be no on-screen credit, for fear that his participation in a popular entertainment would harm his classical reputation.Douglas, The Warsaw Connection, 62. He lost his qualms when the recording sold in the millions, and Douglas notes that he even asked for royalties (they were granted).In the revised version of Douglas's article that appeared in Swynnoe, The Best Years of British Film Music, Douglas learned that Kentner did not receive royalties; see p. 216. Ultimately the Warsaw Concerto was such a hit that it made the then unusual journey from movie screen to concert hall. In his 1944 appearance on Desert Island Discs, Guy Gibson, leader of the Dambusters raid, asked for it as his first choice.Morris, Richard (1994). Guy Gibson. London: Viking, Penguin Group. pp. 233‚Äì234. One commentator has suggested that the Warsaw Concerto is the most significant instrumental work written in Britain during the war, still conjuring up a time and place better than any other piece.Lane, Philip (2003).

It is situated between the Solent coast and the New Forest, and is bordered by the towns of Lymington and New Milton. Like many New Forest parishes Hordle has no village centre. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Tiptoe and Everton as well as part of Downton. The parish was originally much larger; stretching from the New Forest boundary to Hurst Castle. The village Hordle has several shops including a post office, a pharmacy, and Co-operative Stores.History ‚Äì HordlePC The village also has a primary school, and a pub: The Three Bells. The present civil parish is somewhat smaller than the it used to contain, but still includes the hamlets of Tiptoe and Everton. Originally the parish included both Hurst Spit (and Hurst Castle) as well as Sway tower. During the 19th century, Hurst Spit and adjacent areas were transferred to Milford whilst the hamlet of Everton was included in Hordle. Similarly, a northwestern section was transferred to the newly created parish of Sway.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Pages 110‚Äì115 The soils of the parish are based mainly on well drained gravels to the south and clayey loams to the north: the character of the parish is agricultural, although in medieval times a few saltworks were operated on the coast. The present parish church, All Saints, was built in 1872 and succeeded a previous building on the same site dating from 1830 which fell down. Prior to this, the parish church was for some 700 years located a mile further south, where the churchyard still remains at Hordle Cliff. The local tradition telling of the existence of the original village near the church, which has disappeared into the sea owing to cliff erosion, is a myth although there is no doubting the substantial (and ongoing) coastal erosion.

The priory manor was afterwards known as the manor of Hordle Breamore. The priory continued to hold the estate up to the Dissolution. In 1537 the estate was granted to Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter and his wife Gertrude. In 1578, however, it belonged to Thomas Carew, who dying that year was succeeded by his son Henry. It passed to his son Henry in 1614, and then to his son George in 1639. It passed through various hands until it was purchased in 1863 by Colonel Frederick Clinton whose family sold the estate in the 1950s. The manor of Hordle Trenchard was held by Henry Trenchard in the 13th century together with Sharprix (modern Walhampton). His successor John Trenchard was in 1309 described as chief lord of Hordle, and in 1346 the estate belonged to another Henry Trenchard. In 1428 John Trenchard was lord of Hordle, but later in the same year, no doubt after his death, Robert Dingley and John Lisle owned the half fee which had once belonged to him. In 1633 it was again in the hands of a distantly related branch of the Trenchards, Sir Thomas Trenchard, suffering a recovery of the manor of Hordle, which had belonged to his father, Sir George. In 1747 the manor was sold to William Rickman and a few years later it was acquired by Edward Ives, who in 1773 conveyed it to John Missing. It probably merged with the main manor in the 19th century. The Domesday Book mentions a watermill at Hordle, although this has long since disappeared. An 18th-century watermill is visible nearby at Gordleton, just to the east of the present village. Another 18th-century mill at Efford lies on the border of the parish with Pennington.Hampshire Treasures, Volume 5 (New Forest), Page 153 ‚Äì Hordle With the enclosure of Arnewood Common in the early nineteenth century, the main centre of population moved northwards, away from the coast, and to meet this change the ancient parish church was demolished in 1830 and moved to its present situation close to the now enclosed Downton Common, two miles (3 km) to the north. There was no school in the parish until 1860. In the 1870s, Hordle Grange on Vaggs Lane was, for 3 years, home to the religious sect known locally as the New Forest Shakers. They were eventually evicted from this home and they moved to nearby Tiptoe, where they lived in tents until their leader, Mary Ann Girling, died in 1886.Frederic Boase (editor), (1892), Modern English biography, Volume 1 After about 1920 considerable infilling took place in the parish and this accelerated in the 1950s and 60s leading to a much increased population that largely seeks its livelihood in the neighbouring towns of Lymington and New Milton. The parish population in 1801 was 446 and by 1931 this had increased by a thousand and it has gone on growing ever since. Hordle today, despite considerable growth, still manages to retain its rural character helped by the green belts that separate it from the adjoining parishes. The population of the parish in the 2001 census was 5,271 people.Parish Headcounts, Hordle CP ‚Äì Office for National Statistics, retrieved 5 July 2011 Buildings of national importance are no longer within the parish boundary. These are Hurst Castle, one of Henry VIII's defensive works, and Sway tower (also known as Arnewood or Peterson's tower) the tallest non-reinforced concrete construction in the world. The church A church is recorded in the cartulary of Christchurch Priory early in the twelfth century. From very early times Hordle was a parochial chapelry of the vicarage of Milford and served by the vicar, until February 1867 when Hordle was declared a vicarage distinct from that of Milford. The old church was pulled down in 1830 being derelict. The site of the old church is at Hordle Cliff, about 2 miles to the south of the present village, and consists only of a graveyard inclosure. Several illustrations of the old church are preserved at the vicarage and show it to have consisted of chancel, north and south transepts with chapels, nave and central bell turret. The south door at least was of 12th-century date. The present parish church, All Saints, was built in 1872 and succeeded a previous building on the same site dating from 1830. Saltmaking The Domesday Book mentions six saltpans here but the industry declined thereafter and ceased well before the end of the 14th century apart from a saltworks on Hurst Spit.

The project's creators, the Lunar Resources Company, formed the Artemis Society as a non-profit NGO in 1994. They planned to cover the costs by exploiting the entertainment value in creating a lunar colony.Gregory Bennett, \\"The Artemis Project: Selling the Moon,\\" Analog Science Fiction and Fact, January 1995 They also believed that their costs would be a small fraction of what a government agency, such as NASA, would have spent. The project studied other space colonization projects as well, including colonies on outer planet moons. Overview The Reference Mission was designed to provide enough infrastructure to create a small lunar base. No flight hardware was built. Mission hardwareLunar transfer vehicle= The Lunar transfer Vehicle consisted of a single Spacehab module with communications equipment, Solar panels and an added booster stage. The Lunar Transfer Vehicle would have carried the crew as they travel from the Earth to the Moon. It would have been left in Lunar orbit as the crew descend to the lunar surface. =Lunar base habitat= The lunar habitat consisted of three Spacehab modules and a descent stage. It also would have contained other equipment such as solar panels, radiators and communications equipment. =Ascent stage= The ascent stage was to have been used by the crew to return to a lunar orbit from the surface of the Moon. Unlike the Lunar Module of the Apollo Program, the ascent stage was not to have maintained a breathable atmosphere. Because of this, a protective space suit would have to be worn throughout the flight to protect the astronaut from the harsh conditions of space.  Mission profile  The main mission hardware components would have been assembled in a low Earth orbit. Then the stack would have boosted to a lunar orbit. The astronauts would have transferred from the lunar transfer vehicle to the ascent stage. After a deorbit and braking burn, the lunar base habitat and the ascent stage would have been landed on the lunar surface. Following this, the crew would have unpacked and set up the new lunar base for future operations. Once the lunar operations were completed, the crew was to transfer to the ascent stage, where they were to enter into a lunar orbit and dock with the lunar transfer vehicle where they would have remained for the journey back to Earth.  Future plans  Once a base had been built on the Moon it was hoped that a lunar hotel would have been established. However it is not known how economically feasible this would have been because low-cost access to space (possibly involving single- stage-to-orbit or two-stage-to-orbit vehicles) had yet to be developed.

Intended as a means to equip Home Guard units with an anti-tank weapon in case of German invasion, at a time of grave shortage of weapons, it was accepted only after the intervention of Churchill. Although there were doubts about the effectiveness of the Bombard, many were issued. Few, if any, saw combat. Development With the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely.Mackenzie, p. 20 However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could field only twenty-seven divisions.Lampe, p. 3 (The German Army had more than 100 divisions at that time.) The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France, and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes. Given these shortcomings, those modern weapons that were available were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons.Mackenzie, pp. 90‚Äì91 One of these was the Blacker Bombard, designed by Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker, the origins of which went back to the 1930s.Hogg, p. 42 During the early part of the 1930s, Blacker became interested in the concept of the spigot mortar. Unlike conventional mortars the spigot mortar did not possess a barrel, and instead there was a steel rod known as a 'spigot' fixed to a baseplate; the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot, which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air. Blacker began to experiment with the concept in the hopes of creating a platoon mortar that was lighter in weight than the one used by the British Army at the time. This evolved into the Arbalest, which he submitted to the Army but was rejected for a Spanish design. Undeterred by this rejection, Blacker went back to the design and came up with the idea of an anti-tank weapon, although he was initially stymied in his attempts to design one because the spigot design failed to generate the required velocity to penetrate armour. However he was eventually successful in creating an anti- tank mortar, which he named the Blacker Bombard.Hogg, p. 43 When the Second World War began, Blacker was a lieutenant-colonel in the Territorial Army. He had offered his Bombard to the War Office for two years without success but was introduced to the government department of Military Intelligence Research (MIRc)Macrae 1971, p 78 later known as MD1, which had been given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe.Hogg, p. 44 Blacker showed his list of ideas to the head of MD1, Major Millis Jefferis, who was taken with the design for the Bombard. He argued that it could serve in an anti-tank and artillery capability, and claimed that it would have similar anti-tank properties to the 2 pounder anti- tank gun coupled with approximately the same range as the 3 inch mortar.Mackenzie, p. 95 Objections were raised by the Director of Artillery and other government officials, but on 18 August 1940 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, attended a demonstration of the weapon. Churchill took a liking to the weapon and ordered it into full production. It would act as a temporary anti-tank weapon for the Home Guard until more 2 pounders could be supplied to them. It was decided by General Headquarters Home Forces that Bombards would be useful as an anti-tank weapon for use by regular forces, as well as the Home Guard. General Alan Brooke entertained doubts about the weapon's effectiveness, but believed that its simplicity would allow it to be used by younger soldiers. In Southern Command, 14,000 were ordered for use by forces in that area; twenty-four were to be issued to anti-tank regiments, twelve to troops assigned to guard aerodromes, eight per brigade and two for each Home Guard company. However, RAF personnel were forbidden from using the weapons, a restriction which was extended to the RAF Regiment when it was formed in 1942. Design Cutaway blueprints for the Blacker Bombard The Bombard was a 29mm spigot mortar, weighing between 112Lowry, p. 21 and 360 lb, placed on top of a swivel or pivot. It was able to fire a 20 lb high-explosive bomb to a range of approximately 100 yards; when the bomb detonated, it was able to inflict significant damage on a tank, although it was unlikely to actually pierce the vehicle's armour as the projectile was not able to gain sufficient velocity. It was served by a crew of between three and five men The Bombard was considered to be most effective at short range, with targets being engaged with 'considerable success' at a range of between 75‚Äì100 yards. It was a muzzle-loaded weapon and therefore had a slow rate of fire, averaging between sixLowry, p. 24 and twelve rounds per minute; as such it was considered vital that the weapon be well-camouflaged and that it hit the target with the first shot. Two types of ammunition were provided for the weapon ‚Äì a 20 lb anti-tank bomb and a lighter 14 lb anti-personnel bomb, with each weapon being issued with 150 rounds of the former and 100 of the latter. The anti-tank rounds were found to possess several problems. They had insensitive fuzes, which meant that they would often pass through an unarmoured target without detonating, and when they did explode fragments were often thrown back at the crew. The Bombard was either affixed to a large cruciform platform, or an immobile concrete pedestal; in either case would usually be placed in range of defensive positions, such as road-blocks. It seems that there was a preference for the Bombard to be used primarily in a static role, with extra mountings being built by the Royal Engineers to provide alternative positions from which the weapon could be fired. In a static position, the weapon was usually emplaced in a pit with ammunition lockers nearby. Operational history Home Guard soldiers training with a Bombard on a fixed concrete mounting (May 1943) An abandoned Bombard emplacement, Brompton, Kent (2007) The first Bombards appeared in late 1941,Mackenzie, p. 94 and were issued to both regular and Home Guard units; in Southern Command, no more were issued after July 1942. By that time, approximately 22,000 of the Bombards had been produced and issued to forces throughout the country. By November 1941, concerns were already being aired about the suitability of the weapon and it was unpopular with a number of units; some attempted to trade their Bombards for Thompson submachine guns or refused to use them at all. However, Mackenzie cites the argument of the historian of the Ministry of Food Home Guard battalion, who stated that the issuing of the Bombard meant that the Home Guard was being taken seriously by the government. Mackenzie also argues that the Bombard did have a positive side, as it equipped otherwise unarmed Home Guard personnel with a weapon, and was a 'public relations' success. It would appear that a number of Bombards saw action with the British Army, being used in an anti-personnel role in the Western Desert Campaign, although their use may have been limited due to their weight. The design of the Bombards was the basis for the Royal Navy anti- submarine weapon known as the Hedgehog. Large numbers of fixed concrete pedestals for Bombards were installed and a significant number survive in their original positions in many parts of the United Kingdom. The Defence of Britain Project, a late-1990s field survey of 20th century military landscape features by the Council for British Archaeology, recorded a total of 351 surviving pedestals.

The campaign began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, in which the local colonial militias interdicted a British government attempt to seize military stores and leaders in Concord, Massachusetts. The entire British expedition suffered significant casualties during a running battle back to Charlestown against an ever-growing number of militia. Subsequently, accumulated militia forces surrounded the city of Boston, beginning the Siege of Boston. The main action during the siege, the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, was one of the bloodiest encounters of the war, and resulted in a Pyrrhic British victory.Brooks (1999), p. 237 There were also numerous skirmishes near Boston and the coastal areas of Boston, resulting in loss of life, military supplies, or both. In July 1775, George Washington took command of the assembled militia and transformed them into a more coherent army. On March 4, 1776, the colonial army fortified Dorchester Heights with cannon capable of reaching Boston and British ships in the harbor. The siege (and the campaign) ended on March 17, 1776, with the permanent withdrawal of British forces from Boston. To this day, Boston celebrates March 17 as Evacuation Day. Background In 1767, the British Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, which imposed import duties on paper, glass, paint, and other common items imported into the American colonies. The Sons of Liberty and other Patriot organizations responded with a variety of protest actions. They organized boycotts of the goods subject to the duty, and they harassed and threatened the customs personnel who collected the duties, many of whom were either corrupt or related to Provincial leaders. Francis Bernard, then Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, requested military forces to protect the King's personnel. In October 1768, British troops arrived in the city of Boston and occupied the city.Fischer (1994), p. 22 Tensions led to the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, and the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773.Fischer (1994), pp. 23‚Äì26 In response to the Tea Party and other protests, Parliament enacted the Intolerable Acts to punish the colonies. With the Massachusetts Government Act of 1774 it effectively abolished the provincial government of Massachusetts. General Thomas Gage, already the commander-in-chief of British troops in North America, was also appointed governor of Massachusetts and was instructed by King George's government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony.Fischer (1994) pp. 38‚Äì42 However, popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in Massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in Boston. Gage commanded four regiments of British regulars (about 4,000 men) from his headquarters in Boston,French (1911), p. 161 but the countryside was largely controlled by Patriot sympathizers.See e.g. Cushing (1896), p. 58, where Gage describes Crown appointees being harassed out of several towns. War begins A 1775 Amos Doolittle engraving depicting a bit of the action at the North Bridge in Concord On September 1, 1774, British soldiers removed gunpowder and other military supplies in a surprise raid on a powder magazine near Boston. This expedition alarmed the countryside, and thousands of American Patriots sprang into action, amid rumors that war was at hand.Brooks (1999), pp. 16‚Äì18 Although it proved to be a false alarm, this event--known as the Powder Alarm --caused all concerned to proceed more carefully in the days ahead, and essentially provided a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for events seven months later. Partly in response to this action, the colonists carried off military supplies from several forts in New England and distributed them among the local militias.Fischer (1994) pp. 52‚Äì64 On the night of April 18, 1775, General Gage sent 700 men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at Concord. Several riders ‚Äî including Paul Revere ‚Äî alerted the countryside, and when the British troops entered Lexington on the morning of April 19, they found 77 minutemen formed up on the village common. Shots were exchanged, eight Minutemen were killed, the outnumbered colonial militia dispersed, and the British moved on to Concord. At Concord, the troops searched for military supplies, but found relatively little, as the colonists, having received warnings that such an expedition might happen, had taken steps to hide many of the supplies. During the search, there was a confrontation at the North Bridge. A small company of British troops fired on a much larger column of colonial militia, which returned fire, and eventually routed the British, who returned to the village center and rejoined the other troops there. By the time the \\"redcoats\\" or \\"lobster backs\\" (as the British soldiers were called) began the return march to Boston, several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road. A running fight ensued, and the British detachment suffered heavily before reaching Charlestown.See Fischer (1994) for a comprehensive treatment of Lexington and Concord. With the Battle of Lexington and Concord ‚Äî the \\"shot heard 'round the world\\" ‚Äî the war had begun. Siege of Boston A map showing a British tactical evaluation of Boston in 1775. In the aftermath of the failed Concord expedition, the thousands of militiamen that had converged on Boston remained. Over the next few days, more arrived from further afield, including companies from New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Under the command of Artemas Ward, they surrounded the city, blocking its land approaches and putting the occupied city under siege. The British regulars fortified the high points in the city.French (1911), pp. 219, 234‚Äì237 Need for supplies While the British were able to resupply the city by sea, supplies in Boston were short. Troops were sent out to some of the islands in Boston Harbor to raid farmers for supplies. In response, the colonials began clearing those islands of supplies useful to the British. One of these actions was contested by the British in the Battle of Chelsea Creek, but it resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the British ship Diana.Brooks (1999), p. 108 The need for building materials and other supplies led Admiral Samuel Graves to authorize a Loyalist merchant to send his ships from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, accompanied by a Royal Navy schooner. The Machias townspeople rose up, seizing the merchant vessels and then the schooner after a short battle in which its commander was killed. Their resistance and that of other coastal communities led Graves to authorize an expedition of reprisal in October whose sole significant act was the Burning of Falmouth.Leamon (1995), pp. 67‚Äì72 The outrage in the colonies over this action contributed to the passing of legislation by the Second Continental Congress that established the Continental Navy.Miller (1974), p. 49 The colonial army also had issues with supply, and with command. Its diverse militias needed to be organized, fed, clothed, and armed, and command needed to be coordinated, as each militia leader was responsible to his province's congress.Brooks (1999), pp. 104‚Äì106 Washington wanted to both retaliate for the British Burning of Falmouth as well as interrupt and acquire British armaments approaching Boston. Toward this end, in October 1775, General Washington ordered the first American naval expedition. Washington borrowed two vessels from John Glover's Marblehead Regiment. Glover recruited Captain Nicholson Broughton in the Hancock and Captain John Selman (privateer) in the . There expedition north led to capturing fishing vessels off Canso, Nova Scotia and the Raid on Charlottetown (1775). Bunker Hill Late in May, General Gage received by sea about 2,000 reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war: William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton. They formulated a plan to break out of the city, which was finalized on June 12. Reports of these plans made their way to the commanders of the besieging forces,Brooks (1999), p. 119 who decided that additional defensive steps were necessary.French (1911), p. 254 On the night of June 16‚Äì17, 1775, a detachment of the colonial army stealthily marched onto the Charlestown peninsula, which the British had abandoned in April, and fortified Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill.Brooks (1999), pp. 122‚Äì125 On June 17, British forces under General Howe attacked and seized the Charlestown peninsula in the Battle of Bunker Hill. This battle was technically a British victory, but losses (about 1/3 the attacking forces killed or wounded, including a significant fraction of the entire British officer corps in all of North America) were so heavy that the attack was not followed up.Brooks (1999), pp. 183‚Äì184 The siege was not broken, and General Gage was recalled to England in September and replaced by General Howe as the British commander-in- chief.French (1911), pp. 355‚Äì357 Formation of the Continental Army The Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, had received reports of the situation outside Boston when it began to meet in May 1775. In response to the confusion over command in the camps there, and in response to the May 10 capture of Fort Ticonderoga, the need for unified military organization became clear.Frothingham (1886), pp. 420‚Äì430Frothingham (1851), pp. 98‚Äì101 Congress officially adopted the forces outside Boston as the Continental Army on May 26,Frothingham (1886), p. 429 and named George Washington its commander-in- chief on June 15. Washington left Philadelphia for Boston on June 21, but did not learn of the action at Bunker Hill until he reached New York City.Frothingham (1851), pp. 213‚Äì214 A Currier and Ives print depicting George Washington accepting the role of Commander-in-chief of the Continental Army from Congress. Stalemate Following the Battle of Bunker Hill, the siege was effectively stalemated, as neither side had either a clearly dominant position, or the will and materiel to significantly alter its position. When Washington took command of the army in July, he determined that its size had reduced from 20,000 to about 13,000 men fit for duty. He also established that the battle had severely depleted the army's powder stock, which was eventually alleviated by powder shipments from Philadelphia.Brooks (1999), pp. 194‚Äì195 The British were also busy bringing in reinforcements; by the time of Washington's arrival the British had more than 10,000 men in the city. Throughout the summer and fall of 1775, both sides dug in, with occasional skirmishes, but neither side chose to take any significant action.French (1911), pp. 331‚Äì359 Congress, seeking to take some initiative and to capitalize on the capture of Ticonderoga, authorized an invasion of Canada, after several letters to the inhabitants of Canada were rejected by the French-speaking and British colonists there. In September, Benedict Arnold led 1,100 troops on an expedition through the wilderness of Maine, which was drawn from the army assembled outside Boston.See Arnold's expedition to Quebec for details on the forces Arnold took on this expedition, and its outcome. Washington faced a personnel crisis toward the end of 1775, as most of the troops in the army had enlistments that expired at the end of 1775. He introduced a number of recruitment incentives and was able to keep the army sufficiently large to maintain the siege, although it was by then smaller than the besieged forces.Brooks (1999), pp. 208‚Äì209 Siege ends By early March 1776, heavy cannons that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga were moved to Boston, a difficult feat engineered by Henry Knox.Brooks (1999) pp. 211‚Äì214 When the guns were placed on Dorchester Heights in the course of one day, overlooking the British positions, the British situation became untenable. While General Howe planned an attack to reclaim the high ground, a snowstorm prevented its execution.Brooks (1999), pp. 230‚Äì231 The British, after threatening to burn the city if their departure was hindered, evacuated the city on March 17, 1776 and sailed for temporary refuge in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The local militias dispersed and, in April, General Washington took most of the Continental Army to fortify New York City and the start of the New York and New Jersey campaign.Frothingham (1851), p. 312 Legacy John Trumbull's Surrender of General Burgoyne The British were essentially driven from New England as a result of this campaign, although there (as elsewhere in the colonies) they continued to receive support from local Loyalists, especially in Newport, Rhode Island, from which they drove most of the local Patriots.Rhode Island (1977), p. 207 The campaign, as well as the final result of the war as a whole, were a significant blow to British prestige and confidence in its military. The senior military leaders of the campaign were criticized for their actions (Clinton, for example, while he went on to command the British forces in North America, would take much of the blame for the British loss of the war),Stephen (1886), p. 550 and others either saw no more action in the war (Gage),Wise or were ultimately disgraced (Burgoyne, who surrendered his army at Saratoga).Stephen (1886), pp. 340‚Äì341 While the British continued to control the seas, and had military successes on the ground (notably in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania), their actions that led to these conflicts had the effect of uniting the Thirteen Colonies in opposition to the crown.Frothingham (1886), pp. 395‚Äì419, in which colonial assemblies defer responses to a Parliamentary olive branch to a united response from the Continental Congress. As a result, they were never able to marshal enough support from Loyalists to regain meaningful political control of the colonies.See, e.g. the Southern campaign by the British, in which they assumed (or were misled to believe) Loyalists would rise to support their military actions, something that did not happen to the degree needed. The colonies, in spite of their differences, united themselves as a consequence of these events, granting the Second Continental Congress (predecessor to the modern U.S. Congress) sufficient authority and funding to conduct the revolution as a unified whole, including funding and outfitting the military forces that formed as a result of this campaign.Johnson (1912), pp. 40‚Äì42 See also *List of American Revolutionary War battles *Saratoga Campaign *Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga NotesReferences     Further reading * Category:Massachusetts in the American Revolution Category:1775 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Conflicts in 1775 Category:Conflicts in 1776 Category:Campaigns of the American Revolutionary War ","title":"Boston campaign"},{"id":"1872150","text":"Karen Simpson (born November 14, 1975) is a Canadian actress and fashion designer.

In 1973, Larrain published the highly successful photographic book, Idols, which presented portraits of transvestites. Two generations later, the book inspired American photographer Ryan McGinley who wrote an April 2010 article in Vice Magazine, which identified Larrain and the book Idols as one of his early and biggest influences for experimenting with colors, casting, and props, because all of Larrain's images in the book are raw without any manipulation. Larrain has photographed notable personalities in a wide range of creative disciplines, including the dancers of the American Ballet Theatre, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Salvador Dali, Miles Davis, Sting, Billy Joel, Roberto Rossellini, Norman Mailer, and more. Early life and education Born in Dalat, Indochina (now Vietnam) on December 5, 1938, Gilles Larrain began an atypical life moving to Chile, Argentina, Canada, France, and the United States, all before the age of 16. His father, Hern√°n Larrain, was a diplomat with the Chilean consul in Vietnam and a painter. His mother, Charlotte Mayer-Blanchy, was a French-Vietnamese pianist and painter. He is the great, great grandson of Paul Blanchy, the first mayor of Saigon (1895-1901) and the first pepper producer of Vietnam. He is the grandnephew of Rafael Larrain, the cardinal of Talca (Chile). Larrain quickly learned multiple languages every two years and cultivated personal insights throughout his global experiences. His education took on a more traditional slant, beginning with the Lycee Francais de New York (1954-1957). He met his first wife, Anne-Marie Maluski, whose father brought Michelin tires to the US. The couple divorced a few years later and Anne-Marie became a published children's author under the name, Anne-Marie Chapouton. Shortly after he received a French Baccalaureate at Lyc√©e Fran√ßais, he spent brief periods of time at M.I.T. and New York University, and eventually at Ecole Nationale des Beaux- Arts in Paris where he studied architecture and worked in city planning (1960-1965). He also continued drawing and painting. Throughout the 1960s, Larrain was a pioneer in kinetic art, using air, smoke, light, inflatable structures, water and neon tubes as means of artistic expression. In 1963, Larrain traveled to Oaxaca to study in Monte Alban and Mitla, where he realized drawing was insufficient to capture everything needed for information ‚Äî photography became the essential medium to ask the right questions and get the right answers. Here, Larrain learned to use the camera to create pictures that magnified emotions. From this point, he decided to become an architect of the image. Larrain's second marriage was to Marie Christine Bon in 1965 and they had a daughter, Olivia, in 1968. His third marriage was to Isabella Coco Cummings in 1989 and together they had a son, Lasco, in 1991. He is currently married to textile and couture designer, known by her first name, Louda, whom he married in 2006. Work Larrain's first one-man painting show was held in New York City at the Southampton East Gallery on 72nd Street in 1966. In addition to photography, Larrain began to add additional visual art forms. His paintings explored the space of shapes, colours, and materials; his kinetic art explored the space of light and volumes through neons and inflatable structure, which he showcased at the fifth Biennale de Paris ‚ÄúEspaces dynamiques en constant mouvement‚Äù and won the Les Levine prize with Francois Dallegret for their common work, Tubalair, at the sixth Biennale in 1969. In 1968, The New York Post Daily Magazine featured an article about Larrain written by Nora Ephron. He also appeared at the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York established by cellist and performance artist, Charlotte Moorman, and Korean American artist, Nam June Paik. Larrain began photographing full-time in 1969, which included commercial work for clients, such as Club Med, GTE, Lavazza, Knoll International, Joel Name Eyewear, American Ballet Theatre, Renault, as well as magazines, such as Esquire Magazine, Vogue, Oui, Rolling Stone, Time Magazine, New York Magazine and more. In 1973, Larrain published the highly successful and controversial book, Idols, which presented portraits of New York's most talented, outrageous, glamorous transvestites, and mostly gay personalities, who posed in his legendary SoHo studio. Idols is an authentic compendium of 1970s Warhol-era New York style and attitude, featuring Holly Woodlawn, members of the San Francisco-based psychedelic drag queen performance troupe, the Cockettes, Taylor Meade, and John Noble. Throughout the 1980s and later, Larrain's portraiture style was constantly sought after by luminaries, including Miles Davis, Sting, Billy Joel, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Jerry Rubin, Glenn Close, Norman Mailer, Mikhail Baryshnikov, publisher Maurice Girodias, Joe Cocker, wife of the late Shah of Iran, former Queen of Iran Farah Diba Pahlavi, Salvador Dali, and more. His skills were also used to create album covers for musicians. His subjects have ranged from dancers and musicians to artists and celebrities to friends and even a murderer, Michael Alig. Larrain insisted on mastering the entire photography process from taking shots on the camera all the way through the darkroom, so rather than meeting models in their own environment, subjects came to Larrain's studio to be photographed. Larrain aimed to capture the emotional background in addition to light, extracting what he wanted to extract. In 1982, Larrain worked with Robert Mapplethorpe, Deborah Turbeville, and Roy Volkmann on the book, ‚ÄúExquisite Creatures,‚Äù which was published in 1985 by William Morrow & Company, Inc., focusing on the ineffable beauty of woman through a series of nude portraits. In 1983, Larrain planned to visit Spain for a couple of weeks to photograph flamenco for GEO Magazine. He ended up staying more than two months in the attic of La Carboneria, a flamenco venue in Seville, as a guest to the owner, Paco Lira, recognized as a godfather in the flamenco world. Captivated by the flamenco aesthetic, Larrain used his camera to capture the soul of flamenco in one of those rare artistic conjunctions where technical wisdom and experience become melded with the most difficult to express emotions. Larrain has also been playing flamenco guitar player since 1960, often playing at various events, including the Art Salon Parties he would regularly host at the SoHo live-work space shared with his current wife, Louda. Their shared studio was 7 metres high with three intermediate floors, no windows showing anything of the outside world, and art displayed everywhere. These events were opportunities for new and established artists to meet and share creative collaborations. From 1996-2005, Larrain taught ‚ÄúThe Intimate Portrait‚Äù course for International Center for Photography (ICP) at his studio. Larrain now lives on Kauai, Hawaii with Louda. Together, they are developing a photography project, Dark Angel. He is in the process of publishing a book of his works, Stories by a Memory Maker, and continues to create. Much of his work is available for viewing on Behance.

Taken from the Nordisk familjebok, first edition 1876. Ancient Umbria and the Gallic coast. Extracted and adapted from The Historical Atlas by William R. Shepherd, 1911. Roman Umbria is a modern name for one of the 11 administrative regions into which the emperor Augustus divided Italy. The main source for the regions is the Historia Naturalis of Pliny the Elder, who informs his readers he is basing the geography of Italy on the discriptio Italiae, \\"division of Italy,\\" made by Augustus.. The Sexta Regio (\\"6th Region\\") is called Umbria complexa agrumque Gallicam citra Ariminium, \\"Umbria including the Gallic country this side of Rimini.\\". Umbria is named after an Italic people, the Umbri, who were gradually subjugated by the Romans in the 4th through the 2nd centuries BC. Although it passed the name on to the modern region of Umbria, the two coincide only partially. Roman Umbria extended from Narni in the South, northeastward to the neighborhood of Ravenna on the Adriatic coast, thus including a large part of central Italy that now belongs to the Marche; at the same time, it excluded the Sabine country (generally speaking, the area around modern Norcia) and the right bank of the Tiber, which formed part of Roman Etruria: for example Perusia (the modern Perugia) was not part of Roman Umbria; on the contrary Sarsina, Plautus birthplace, was considered to be \\"in Umbria\\", while today it is in the modern province of Forl√¨-Cesena, in Emilia-Romagna. The importance of Umbria in Roman and medieval times was intimately bound up with the Via Flaminia, the consular road that supplied Rome and served as a military highway into and out of the City: for this reason once the Roman empire collapsed, Umbria became a strategic battleground fought over by the Church, the Lombards and the Byzantines, and suffered consequently, becoming partitioned among them and disappearing from history. The modern use of \\"Umbria\\" is due to a renaissance of local identity in the 17th century. Italic Umbria Before its defeat by and assimilation to the Romans, Umbria was a sovereign state populated by a people speaking the Umbrian language. This circumstance prevailed in history during the early and middle Roman Republic. By the late republic, Umbria was part of Rome. The language was no longer generally spoken. Umbria in the geographers of the empire Like any other region, over the centuries Region VI changed its borders. These changes are reflected in the writings of the imperial geographers. Pliny The sexta regio is described in some detail by Pliny the Elder. =Gallia togata= Gallia Togata went along the northern Adriatic coast of Italy in Marche from Ancona to \\"this side of Rimini.\\" The southernmost point of Gallia Togata is Ancona. He mentions the Aesis River (Esino) north of there, Senagallia (Sinigaglia), Pisaurum (Pesaro) and then Fanum (Fano) at the mouth of the Metaurus (Metauro) River. There follows a folk-etymologic statement concerning the name of the Umbri. People believe, he says, that they are named from the thunderstorms (imbres) of the deluge and therefore that they are the oldest people on Earth. (The ancient Greeks and Romans inherited a mythological tradition of a deluge independent of that of the Old Testament.) Some of his further statements appear to be equivocal, leading to some historical misidentification of Gallia Togata. He declares: > \\"The largest part of this district was occupied by Sicilians and Liburnians > especially the territories of Palma, Praetutia and Adria.\\" This Adria (Hadrianus) is Atri, Italy on the coast of Abruzzi south of Ancona. Praetutia is Interamnia Praetutia, capital city of the Petrutii. From Interamnea comes Teramo and from Praetutia comes Aprutium, later Abruzzo. The coast of Abruzzo was in Augustus' Region IV; however, Pliny does not say that the Abruzzo was the largest part of Gallia Togata, only that it was the largest part of the region settled by Sicilians and Liburnians. Similarly if Hadrianus is taken to be Adria in Veneto then Gallia Togata would appear to be a synonym for all Gallia Cisalpina. However, Veneto is not \\"this side of Rimini.\\" Pliny states his belief that the Umbrians once held the north Adriatic coast, displacing Sicilians and Liburnians, and were in turn displaced by the Etruscans. The Gauls expelled them. Romans colonized the Gallic coast to control it, hence \\"togata.\\" =Umbria proper= For Umbria proper Pliny simply lists the settlements: Spello, Todi, Amelia, Attiglio, Assisi, Arna, Iesi, Camerino, Casuentillum, Carsulae, Dolates Sallentini, Foligno, Market of Flaminius, Market of Julius, Market Brenta, Fossombrone, Gubbio, Terni, etc. Ptolemy Ptolemy, 2nd century geographer, does not lump Gallia Togata together with Umbria, but describes them as separate regions.. =Gallia Togata= In Ptolemy, Ancona is in Picenum. The strip of country \\"above\\" the Apennines, \\"extending as far as Ravenna,\\" is Gallia Togata. Thirteen towns are listed for it, which are south of the Po River, but are as far inland as Piacenza. This region is somewhat larger than the one of the same name in Augustus' time, comprising almost all of Emilia-Romagna. The towns are: Piacenza, Fidenza, Brescello, Parma, etc. =Umbria proper= For the Umbri Ptolemy has only nine towns, omitting some of the major ones: Arna, Spello, Todi, etc. See also * Umbria * Umbri * Umbrian language ReferencesBibliography * * Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of Italy Category:History of le Marche Category:History of Umbria ","title":"Roman Umbria"},{"id":"1872214","text":"Onsi Sawiris (also written Sawires, , ; born August 14, 1930) is an Egyptian businessman.

He also began to publish the results of his classical Chinese literature research. At the outbreak of the Second Sino- Japanese War, he and many other intellectuals from northeastern China migrated to Kunming, Yunnan. There he was able to continue to teach, this time in the wartime National Southwestern Associated University. Wen stopped writing poetry in 1931 and became increasingly involved in social criticism. He became politically active in 1944 in support of the China Democratic League. His outspoken nature led to his assassination by secret agents of the Kuomintang after eulogizing his friend Li Gongpu's life at Li's funeral in 1946. There is a monument to Wen at the Yunnan Normal University campus in Kunming, as can a large statue. A small memorial to him, including a wall portrait painted from a famous picture of him smoking his pipe is found in a walkway by his former home (the site is now part of an elementary school) in the Green Lake area of Kunming. He and his wife, Gao Zhen, are buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing. Poetry Wen's poetry is noted for its experimentation with classical Chinese rules and forms. He modeled his poetry on that of the English poets John Keats, Alfred Tennyson, and Robert Browning, and tried to \\"recapture the symbolism and ethos of premodern Chinese society\\". The poems in his second collection, Dead Water (S«êshu«ê ), have \\"a haunting musicality\\", and deal with the \\"heartrendingly heavy\\" subject of exposing social injustice and corruption. Scholarship Wen was credited by David Hawkes as the initiator of the cult of Qu Yuan as \\"China's first patriotic poet\\", writing that, \\"although Qu Yuan did not write about the life of the people or voice their sufferings, he may truthfully be said to have acted as the leader of a people's revolution and to have struck a blow to avenge them. Qu Yuan is the only person in the whole of Chinese history who is fully entitled to be called 'the people's poet'.\\" References=CitationsWorks cited * . * . * . * . * . * .  Portrait  * Wen Yiduo.

Harding is the Chair of NHS Improvement, former Chief Executive of TalkTalk Group, and owned the 1998 Cheltenham Gold Cup winning horse, Cool Dawn. In 2016, Penrose, who lives in Winscombe, North Somerset, caused some local controversy over the design of a proposed personal swimming pool complex at his home. Winscombe and Sandford Parish Council formally objected to the 'ugly and massive' design on the grounds it would harm local views. The Daily Telegraph reported that this was noteworthy as Penrose had argued in 2013, in a previous ministerial role, for greater protection of historic views, suggesting some of the finest urban views in the country should be listed like buildings. Ultimately, the district council approved the planning application and accepted the argument that an originally planned grass roof was not possible.

With the first Muslim conquests in the 7th century, kharaj initially denoted a lump-sum duty levied upon the lands of conquered provinces, which was collected by hold-over officials of the defeated Byzantine Empire in the west and the Sassanid Empire in the east; later and more broadly, kharaj refers to the land tax levied by Muslim rulers on their non-Muslim subjects, collectively known as dhimmi. At that time, kharaj was synonymous with jizyah, which later emerged as a per head tax paid by the dhimmi. Muslim landowners, on the other hand, paid only ushr, a religious tithe on land, which carried a much lower rate of taxation,Lewis (2002), p. 72 and zakat. Changes soon eroded the established tax base of the early Arab Caliphates. Additionally, a large, but unsuccessful, expedition against the Byzantine Empire undertaken by the Umayyad caliph Sulayman in 717 brought the finances of the Umayyads to the brink of collapse. Even before Sulayman's ascent to power, the powerful governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, attempted to raise revenues by demanding from Muslims a full rate of taxation, but that measure met with opposition and resentment. To address these problems, Sulayman's successor Umar II worked out a compromise in which, beginning from 719, land from which kharaj was paid could not be transferred to Muslims; instead, they could lease such land, but in that case they would be required to pay kharaj from it. With the passage of time, the practical result of that reform was that kharaj was levied on most land without regard for the cultivator's religion. The reforms of Umar II were finalized under the Abbasids and would thereafter form the model of tax systems in the Islamic state.Lewis (2002), p. 79-80 From that time on, kharaj was also used as a general term describing all kinds of taxes: for example, the classic treatise on taxation by the 9th century jurist Abu Yusuf was called Kitab al-Kharaj, i.e. The Book On Taxation. 20th-century Russian orientalist, A. Yu. Yakubovski, compares the land tax system of Persian Sassanids with that of the post-Islamic Caliphate era: > A comparison between pre-Islamic documents and those of the Islamic period > reveals that conquering Arabs increased the land taxation without exception. > Thus, raising taxes of each acre of wheat field to 4 dirhams and each acre > of barley field to 2 dirhams, whereas during reign of Khosro Anushiravan it > used to be a single dirham for each acre of a wheat or barley field. During > the later stage of Umayyad Caliphate, conquered and subjugated Persians were > paying from one fourth to one third of their land produce to the Arab Empire > as kharaj.N. V. Pigulevskaya, A. Yu. Yakubovski, I. P. Petrushevski, L. V. > Stroeva, A. M. Belenitski. The History of Iran from Ancient Times to the End > of Eighteenth Century (in Persian), Tehran, 1967, p. 161. In the Ottoman empire, kharaj evolved into hara√ß, a form of poll tax on non- Muslim subjects. It was superseded by cizye.

Early life Ayres was born at East Creek, New York, along the Mohawk River in Montgomery County. He was the son of a small-town doctor, who trained him in Latin. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1847, ranking 22nd in a class of 38, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. Although graduating in time for the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Ayres served only on garrison duty in Puebla and Mexico City until 1850, seeing no fighting in the war. Between the wars, Ayres was stationed at various posts on the frontier and served at the Fort Monroe Artillery School from 1859 to 1861. In 1849 he married Emily Louis Gerry Dearborn in Bangor, Maine. His second wife was Juliet Opie Hopkins Butcher, the daughter of Juliet Opie Hopkins, a woman who later became prominent establishing hospitals for Confederate soldiers in Richmond, Virginia. Civil War After the start of the Civil War, Ayres was promoted to captain and commanded a battery in the 5th U.S. Artillery, which he led in the First Bull Run Campaign, and was heavily involved in the Battle of Blackburn's Ford, immediately before the larger First Battle of Bull Run. At First Bull Run, his battery, attached to the brigade of William Tecumseh Sherman, was held in reserve and he did not see action during the battle proper, but distinguished himself by providing cover for retreating Union Army troops pursued by Confederate cavalry. On October 3, 1861, Ayres was appointed chief of artillery for William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith's division (later designated the 2nd Division of the VI Corps) of the Army of the Potomac. He served in that position in the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, and at the Battle of Antietam. Just before the Battle of Fredericksburg, he was promoted to chief of artillery of the VI Corps as a brigadier general, as of November 29, 1862. At Fredericksburg he commanded the corps artillery stationed across the Rappahannock River on Falmouth Heights. While recuperating from an injury caused when his horse fell, Ayres considered his military career and realized that artillery officers had a much slower rate of promotion than their colleagues in the infantry. Thus, he arranged for a transfer and became a brigade commander in the 2nd Division of the V Corps as of April 21, 1863. This division was known as the Regular Division because it consisted almost entirely of regular army (versus state volunteers) soldiers and he led its 1st Brigade in the Battle of Chancellorsville. On the first day of the battle (May 1, 1863) his brigade formed the left flank of Sykes' division when it engaged Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws' division on the Orange Turnpike. Sykes' division was forced to retreat after being attacked on the right flank by Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes' division. In the Gettysburg Campaign, as part of a general shuffling of senior officers when Maj. Gen. George Meade was promoted from commander of the V Corps to be commander of the Army of the Potomac and Maj. Gen. George Sykes took command of the corps, Ayres was promoted to command the Regular Division. He had risen to division command quickly for an officer with little infantry experience. At the Battle of Gettysburg, he did not have an opportunity to shine in his new assignment. His division arrived on the battlefield around midday on the second day of battle, July 2, 1863. After a brief rest in camp near Power's Hill, two brigades from his division were sent to reinforce Union troops from Maj. Gen. John C. Caldwell's division (II Corps), which was counterattacking Confederate forces in the Wheatfield. Due to a great Confederate assault nearby at the Peach Orchard, Caldwell's division retreated so that his two brigades were at risk of being surrounded. They were forced to retreat as well, suffering heavy casualties. Nevertheless, Ayres received praise for his performance and he received a brevet promotion to major in the regular army for his actions at Gettysburg. After the battle, the Regular Division was sent in New York City to suppress the draft riots there. In March 1864, the Army of the Potomac was reorganized, reducing the number of corps commanders, and subordinates down the chain of command were affected. Ayres was reduced to commanding the 4th Brigade of the 1st Division, V Corps. He led the brigade in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign of 1864. He received command of a new 2nd Division of the V Corps for the Siege of Petersburg. On August 1, 1864, he received a brevet promotion to major general for his contributions in these campaigns; he received particular commendations and brevet promotions for Weldon Railroad and Five Forks. Ayres continued to lead his division through the Appomattox Campaign and the Confederate surrender. By the summer of 1864, the Regular Division no longer existed because it was hardly above brigade strength. Ayres was asked after the war if any of the regular troops he'd commanded were still serving. He replied \\"I had a division of regulars once. I buried half of them at Gettysburg and the other half in the Wilderness. There's no regulars left.\\" Postbellum After the war, Ayres commanded a division in the Provisional Corps, and then commanded the District of the Shenandoah Valley until April 30, 1866, when he was mustered out of the volunteer service. As part of the general reduction of ranks that was typical following many American wars, Ayres returned to the regular army with the rank of lieutenant colonel and he performed mostly garrison duty in a number of posts in the South, including Little Rock, Arkansas, Jackson Barracks, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Key West, Florida. In 1877 he commanded troops suppressing the railroad strikes in Maryland and Pennsylvania, and in 1879 he was promoted to colonel of the 2nd U.S. Artillery. Ayres died on duty on December 4, 1888 in Fort Hamilton, New York at 62 years of age. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, alongside his mother-in-law, Juliet Opie Hopkins.

Howe's contentious relationships with superior officers in the Army of the Potomac eventually led to his being deprived of division command. Early life Howe was born in Standish, Maine. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1841. After serving in the 4th U.S. Artillery for two years, he taught mathematics at the U.S. Military Academy for three years. Howe served in the Mexican War and was awarded a brevet promotion in 1847 to the rank of captain for gallantry during Winfield Scott's advance upon Mexico City, especially for his actions at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco. He was promoted to the rank of captain on March 2, 1855. Howe served under Robert E. Lee during the suppression of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. Civil War At the beginning of the Civil War, Howe served under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan in western Virginia. He took command of John J. Peck's 3rd Brigade, (55th New York, 62nd New York, and the 93rd, 98th, and 102nd Pennsylvania regiments) Couch's 1st Division, Keyes's IV Corps during the Seven Days Battles, after Peck was promoted to command of Silas Casey's Division of the same corps. Howe received the brevet rank of major in the regular army for his role at the Battle of Malvern Hill. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the volunteer service on June 11, 1862. In the subsequent campaigns of the Army of the Potomac, Howe fought in the Battle of South Mountain and was present at the Battle of Antietam. He was promoted to command 2nd Division, VI Corps, leading it at the Battle of Fredericksburg. His division was heavily engaged at Fredericksburg and Salem Church during the Chancellorsville Campaign. Howe's division led a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Fredericksburg on June 3, 1863, as the Union high command tried to determine whether the Army of Northern Virginia was moving out of its positions to undertake an offensive. It was only minimally engaged in the campaign culminating in the Battle of Gettysburg. His division was the last to reach the battlefield and his two brigades were assigned to opposite ends of the Union line, leaving him effectively without a command.Tagg, p. 112. During the pursuit of Lee's retreating army, the 1st Vermont Brigade of Howe's division fought the Confederate rear guard near Funkstown, Maryland, on July 10, 1863. Howe continued in division command during the Bristoe Campaign and the Mine Run Campaign. Howe was removed from command by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade shortly thereafter. Howe's bad relationship with his corps commander, Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, including support of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker in the controversies that were spawned by the Union defeat at Chancellorsville, probably contributed to this removal. Meade, if he did not initiate Howe's removal, at least did not oppose it.Hyde, p. 80, Howe testified against Meade and Sedgwick before the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, claiming Sedgwick spoke to him about retreating to Westminster, Maryland. Sedgwick's testimony before the committee contradicted Howe's without naming him. The committee did not pursue this contradiction.Hyde, p. 83. What is clear is that Sedgwick sought the services of Brig. Gen. George W. Getty to replace Howe in command of the 2nd Division.Winslow, pp. 141, 145. After leaving the Army of the Potomac, Howe commanded the artillery depot in Washington, D.C. He was in the field briefly at Harpers Ferry, opposing the raid on Washington by Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early. Postbellum service Mrs. Elizabeth M. Howe (Cecilia Beaux, 1903) At the close of the war, Howe served in the honor guard that stood watch over the corpse of Abraham Lincoln, and soon afterward was appointed as a member of the military commission that tried the Lincoln conspirators. Howe did not make any public comments on the conviction or hanging of Mary E. Surratt, but was not among the five officers who petitioned President Andrew Johnson to commute her sentence to life in prison.Kauffman, n. 471. Both assignments may indicate that the Radical Republican faction in the Congress found him useful and sympathetic.Hyde, p. 79. He also served in the Freedmen's Bureau in 1865. Howe was mustered out of the volunteer service on July 15, 1866. Howe retired from the Army on June 30, 1882, at the rank of colonel. He was a veteran companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is buried there in Mount Auburn Cemetery.Eicher, p. 306. Howe was married to Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Mahaffey, a superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Elizabeth McPherson.

This allows a minor in the United States to have property set aside for the minor's benefit and may achieve some income tax benefit for the child's parents. Once the child reaches the age of maturity (18 or 21 depending on the state), the assets become the property of the child and the child can use them for any purpose. Contributing money to an UGMA account on another person's behalf could be subject to gift tax; however, the Internal Revenue Code of the United States allows persons to give up to the annual gift tax exclusion to another person without any gift tax consequences, and gifts exceeding that amount as long as total gifts are below the lifetime limits. In the majority of states that have adopted the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), the assets are treated similarly. The assets are held in the custodian's name until the child reaches age of maturity. States that adopted UTMA also repealed UGMA; UTMA specifically provides that contracts in UTMA states which reference UGMA are governed by UTMA. Thus, UGMA is often still referred to in contracts designed for use in multiple states, even though it may actually mean UTMA in a particular state. Under the UGMA or UTMA, the ownership of the funds works like it does with any other trust and the donor must appoint a custodian (the trustee) to look after the account for the benefit of the beneficiary. Until 1986, a UGMA or UTMA account allowed the assets to be taxed at the minor's income tax bracket. Tax law changes in 1986, 2006, 2007 and 2017 known as the \\"kiddie tax\\" have substantially reduced the tax savings of UGMAs and UTMAs. Until 2018, for beneficiaries under 19 (under 24 if a student), the first $1,000 of unearned income was tax-free, the second $1,000 was taxed at the minor's rate (typically 15%), and the amount over $2,000 was taxed at the parent's rate. The current rule is that for beneficiaries under 19 (under 24 if a student), the first $1,050 of unearned income is tax-free, the second $1,050 is taxed at the minor's rate (typically 12%), and the amount over $2,100 is taxed at the ordinary and capital gains rates applicable to trusts and estates. UGMA and UTMA accounts can invest in the stock market. One negative effect of UGMA or UTMA assets for minors who plan to attend college is that financial aid is typically reduced by 20-25% of the UGMA or UTMA balance. Some financial advisers therefore advise depleting the balance in these accounts, always for purposes benefiting the minor such as summer camp, books, computer and similar expenses, well before the minor begins the process of applying to college.

David, \\"Elon J. Farnsworth\\", Faded Hoofbeats blog, June 13, 2007. He joined the Army as a civilian foragemaster in 1857 and served on the staff of Albert Sidney Johnston during the Utah War of 1857‚Äì58. He also worked as a buffalo hunter, scout and freighter in the Colorado Territory. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Farnsworth was appointed a first lieutenant in the 8th Illinois Cavalry, the regiment commanded by his uncle, serving with distinction throughout the early stages of the war. Being promoted to captain on December 25, 1861, he was made Assistant Chief Quartermaster of the IV Corps, and in early 1863, he served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Alfred Pleasonton through the Battle of Chancellorsville and early stages of the Gettysburg Campaign. Pleasonton, then in command of the Army of the Potomac's Cavalry Corps, gave Farnsworth command of 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac on June 28, 1863, three days before the Battle of Gettysburg. On June 29, 1863, just two days before the battle, President Lincoln nominated Farnsworth to the grade brigadier general of volunteers but the appointment was never confirmed by the United States Senate. Death at Gettysburg thumbSouth Cavalry Field at Gettysburg After the collapse of Pickett's Charge and the defeat of Major General J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry on July 3, the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Brigadier General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, commanding the 3rd Division, ordered Farnsworth to make a charge with his brigade against Confederate positions south of the Devil's Den area of the battlefield, below Little Round Top. Farnsworth initially balked, arguing there was no hope of success, and only agreed to it when Kilpatrick allegedly accused him of cowardice. Farnsworth made the charge, against elements of John B. Hood's division, under Evander M. Law (Hood having been wounded the previous day). Farnsworth rode with the second battalion of the 1st Vermont Cavalry, alongside Major William Wells. The charge was repulsed with heavy losses, and Farnsworth himself was shot five times in the chest. An account by Confederate Colonel William C. Oates claimed that Farnsworth was surrounded by Confederate soldiers and committed suicide to avoid capture, but this has been disputed by other witnesses and discounted by most historians.Wert, Jeffry D. Gettysburg: Day Three. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. p. 278: \\"Subsequent accounts by Confederates alleging that he had committed suicide are bogus.\\" Kilpatrick received much criticism for ordering the charge, but no official action was taken against him. Farnsworth is buried in Rockton Cemetery, Rockton, Illinois. Memorials Battery Farnsworth, a coastal defense built between 1897 and 1899 near Fort Constitution at New Castle, New Hampshire, was named in his honor.

A public domain audiobook version of The Defenders by Philip K. Dick. \\"The Defenders\\" is a 1953 science fiction novelette by American author Philip K. Dick, and the basis for Dick's 1964 novel The Penultimate Truth. It is one of several of his stories to be expanded into a novel. The story was first published in the January 1953 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction. In 1956, the story was adapted for the radio program X Minus One by George Lefferts. Plot Eight years ago a nuclear war began between the United States and the Soviet Union. American survivors evacuated to gigantic bunkers miles under ground. Sophisticated, radioactivity-immune robots called \\"leadys\\" continue fighting the war on the devastated surface that is too dangerous for humans. The Soviets have similarly evacuated underground, and each side builds powerful weapons and vehicles for the remote-controlled war they only see from film that the robots deliver. The security department asks Taylor, an American war planner, to observe the interrogation of a leady regarding the progress of the war. Although the robot reports that lethal radioactivity and sophisticated new Soviet weapons continue to make the surface dangerous for humans, the observers find that the leady is not radioactive. Taylor learns that this is the second such robot the security department has found; it assigns him to an expedition, wearing lead suits, to investigate the truth about surface conditions. Taylor's group surprises the leadys at the surface and demands to see the outside. Although the robots attempt to delay the humans as long as possible, the group discovers outside the bunker an undamaged valley with forests, animals, and a farm. The leadys reveal that the war ended as soon as the humans evacuated because the robots could not see a rational purpose for it. Analyzing history, they found that groups of humans warred with each other until they matured to overcome conflict. Humanity is almost ready for a single culture, the current worldwide division into American and Soviet sides being the final step. The leadys create counterfeit photographs of the devastated planet to fool humans, while destroying weapons they received and rebuilding the world for their creators' return. The Americans believe that because the Soviets do not know that they were also tricked, the United States can quickly win the war. The robots reveal, however, that during their explanation they sealed all tubes to under ground. Although this prevents the expedition from leaving, the leadys expect that by the time their countrymen dig new tunnels, humanity will be ready for the truth. The robots invite Taylor and the others to join a group of Soviets who were similarly stranded after visiting the surface. \\"The working out of daily problems of existence\\", the leadys suggest, \\"will teach you how to get along in the same world. It will not be easy, but it will be done.\\" Copyright Status This novelette is in the public domain in the U.S., and is available at Project Gutenberg.

It was founded in New York City in 1946 by Herb Abramson. His partner was Jerry Blaine. Blaine bought Abramson's half of the company in 1947, when Abramson went on to co-found Atlantic Records with Ahmet Ertegun. The company name was Jay-Gee Recording Company, a subsidiary of the Cosnat Corporation. Cosnat was a wholesale record distributor. History Jubilee was the first independent record label to reach the white market with a black vocal group, when the Orioles' recording of \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" reached the Top Twenty on the Pop chart in 1953. The Four Tunes started recording for Jubilee in 1953. The biggest early hit for Jubilee was \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" by the Orioles. A subsidiary label, Josie Records, was formed in 1954 and issued more uptempo material. Hits on Josie included \\"Speedoo\\" by the Cadillacs (number 3 R&B;, number 17 pop) and \\"Do You Wanna Dance\\" by Bobby Freeman (number 2 R&B;, number 5 pop). The biggest success was the million-seller \\"Last Kiss\\", by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers, which reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1964. In the late 1960s, The Meters, a group of New Orleans session musicians, released a series of R&B; instrumental hits, including \\"Cissy Strut\\", which reached number 4 R&B; and number 23 pop. The label's last rock-and-roll hit was the rhythm-and-blues instrumental \\"Poor Boy\\"/\\"Wail!\\" by the Royaltones (number 17, 1957). Of the label's novelty recordings, releases by the blooper compiler Kermit Schaefer, and the comedian Rusty Warren were successful. Jubilee/Josie also had a custom label, Gross Records, whose only artist was Doug Clark and the Hot Nuts; their material was so off-color that the Jubilee and Josie names appeared nowhere on their albums. In 1970, Jubilee/Josie, in financial difficulties, was sold to Viewlex, which owned Buddah Records, and Blaine left the company. The catalog was eventually taken over by Roulette Records. The label was declared bankrupt in 1971. In the late 1980s, Roulette was sold jointly to Rhino Records and EMI, and in the 1990s, Rhino was sold to Time Warner. The rights to the Jubilee Records archives in North America are now owned by Warner Music, with EMI holding the rights in the rest of the world until 2013. Warner Music Group now has worldwide rights to the Roulette/Jubilee catalogue as a result of acquiring Parlophone in 2013.

Early life Barnes was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Latin School and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1829, in the same class as Robert E. Lee. However, at age 28 he was older than most West Point cadets upon completion, and placed fifth out of 46 cadets. He was then commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery, but spent most of his army service as an instructor of tactics and French at the Academy.Eicher, p. 116. Barnes married Charlotte Adams Sanford in 1832 (sister of John F. A. Sanford). After the birth of his second son, John Sanford Barnes, he resigned his commission on July 31, 1836, to become a railroad civil engineer and by 1839 he was superintendent of the Western Railroad, a job he would hold for 22 years. Civil War service On July 26, 1861, Barnes was commissioned a colonel in the 18th Massachusetts Infantry. He and his regiment joined the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign, but saw no combat. During the Seven Days Battles the 18th was assigned to guard duty in the rear, and again Barnes saw no combat. His brigade commander, Brig. Gen. John Martindale, was relieved of command after the Battle of Malvern Hill and Barnes became the new commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps on July 10, 1862. For reasons unrecorded, Barnes was not present with his brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run and although the V Corps marched to the Battle of Antietam, it was left in reserve and once again saw no action. However, during Lee's retreat back to Virginia, Barnes saw his first combat when his brigade was attacked by the rearguard of the Confederate Army, resulting in over 200 men shot or drowned in the Potomac River and over 100 more captured. At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, Barnes distinguished himself for the first time, leading his brigade in one of the final assaults against Confederate positions on Marye's Heights. His division commander wrote after the battle, \\"James Barnes ... is entitled to special notice for his coolness, energy, and marked ability.\\"Tagg, p. 84. On April 4, 1863, Barnes was promoted to brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, with date of rank established as November 29, 1862.Eicher, p. 718. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, Barnes' brigade was not heavily engaged. Late in the battle, his division commander, Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin, fell ill and Barnes assumed command of the 1st Division on May 5, 1863. In 1863 Barnes' division camped at Union Mills, Maryland, on its way to Pennsylvania, where the Battle of Gettysburg would turn out to be the most significant action in his career. The new division commander, now 61 years old (older than any other Union general present except Brig. Gen. George S. Greene), arrived early on the morning of the second day, July 2, 1863, with the rest of the V Corps. During the massive Confederate assault on the Union left flank that afternoon, one of Barnes' brigades, under Col. Strong Vincent, was diverted to defend the flank at Little Round Top. The brigade performed magnificently, but Barnes had essentially nothing to do with its actions or the decision to send it there. Barnes did get personally involved with his other two brigades, who were sent to reinforce the Union line in the Wheatfield, and here his career took a fatal downward turn. He was criticized after the battle for withdrawing his two brigades under Colonels Jacob B. Sweitzer and William S. Tilton 300 yards back from the Wheatfield without permission, despite protests from the generals on his flanks. When reinforcements from the II Corps arrived, Maj. Gen. David B. Birney gave orders for Barnes' men to lie down while the brigade of Brig. Gen. Samuel K. Zook marched over them. Sweitzer's brigade was sent into the Wheatfield, where it was attacked in the flank by another Confederate charge led by Brig. Gen. William T. Wofford. Aides could not find Barnes in the vicinity of his troops. Later that day, Barnes was wounded in the leg and although it healed, he would never return to combat duty. After recovering from his wound, Barnes spent the remainder of the war on garrison duty in Virginia and Maryland. This included commanding the District of St. Mary's, Maryland, which contained the prisoner- of-war camp at Point Lookout, Maryland, in the Middle Department. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated and on March 12, 1866 the U.S. Senate confirmed the award to Brigadier General Barnes of the honorary grade of brevet major general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 710 Postbellum career After the war, Barnes returned to his profession of railroad civil engineering and was a member of the government commission that supervised the building of the Union Pacific Railroad. Barnes died in Springfield, Massachusetts, and is buried there in Springfield Cemetery.

In the depths of the forest they do not wear much clothing, using only leaf huts as shelter for their bodies in the intense heat. The Ef√© are Pygmies, and one of the shortest peoples in the world. The men grow to an average height of 142 cm (4 ft. 8 in.), and women tend to be about 5 cm (2 in.) shorter. Dr. Jean-Pierre Hallet was very involved with the Ef√©, from raising awareness to the plight of the tribe, to the introduction of new foods and methods previously unknown (such as a legume called the \\"winged bean\\" of New Guinea). He also introduced new methods of farming to the Ef√©, who likely had been a hunter-gatherer society for many thousands of years. Origins The Ef√© pygmies are considered by mitochondrial DNA haplotype analysis to be one of the oldest races on earth. The Semliki harpoon, 90,000 years old, is one of the oldest tools known to mankind and occurs in the natural range of the Ef√© pygmies. This suggests an initial aquatic civilisation based on fishing. Jean-Pierre Hallet promoted the establishment of a sanctuary for the Ef√© along the Semliki River near Virunga National Park, and also lobbied heavily for the rights of the semi-nomadic pygmies to continue living in the protected Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the Ituri Forest. Location and overview The Efe are one of three groups of pygmies, collectively named BaMbuti, of the Ituri forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The other groups are the Sua, and the Aka. Of these, the Ef√© occupy the most land, from the north to the southeast of the forest. One of the main ways in which these groups are distinguished is by the neighbouring non-pygmy tribes with whom they cooperate. The Ef√©, who differ from other pygmy groups in that they hunt with bows and arrows instead of nets, are associated with the Lese people. The Ef√© language is related to that of the Lese, and is Central Sudanic in origin. (The pygmy groups in the region generally speak the language of the tribes with whom they associate.) History and external influences There is some debate over how long the Ef√© have lived in their present state, with accounts of their having been in the Ituri forest for 20,000 years. Bailey states that the Ituri area has been inhabited since 40,700 BC, but that the region was most likely savannah and temperate forest (as opposed to rainforest) until somewhere between 2900 and 720 BC. His analyses suggest that hunter-gathering is not a sufficient source of caloric intake alone, so that some form of agricultural pursuits were likely and that the civilization probably developed at the border of the savannah and the rainforest, rather than in the forest itself. Net hunting by other pygmy tribes, however, seem to provide higher caloric intake than the bow and arrow hunting of the Ef√©. Some suggestions as to the evolutionary benefit of the pygmy short stature was the ability to navigate the dense jungle, with its low hanging branches, more easily. Small stature also confers a small advantage for body heat dissipation in equatorial (hot, humid) regions. (While there are pygmy peoples in colder climates as well, this may have occurred by migration.) Arab slave raids, especially from the 1850s until the 1890s, served to destabilise the region. Trade routes were opened up, and a common dialect called Kingwana (a Congo variant of Kiswahili, also known as Copperbelt Swahili) was introduced. New crops, firearms, and hut designs were also introduced during that time. The Ef√© assumed roles as watchmen for the Lese against the slavers. Belgian Congo was established in 1908, and the Belgian colonial government played a role in shaping the lives of the Ef√© and Lese. Chiefdoms among the Lese were formalised and police forces were created with Lese policemen. These supervised the work projects of the colonial administration: primarily the construction of three main roads in the Ituri region. Whole villages of Lese and Ef√© were relocated alongside these roads in these work projects, and new crops were planted for sale as well as for village use. The structure of these roadside villages and the resultant behaviour of the Ef√© differed significantly from their forest villages. When Congo became independent from Belgium on June 30, 1960, the Ituri region began to fall into decay. The dictatorship of Mobutu that soon followed independence followed a practice of neglect for the region, allowing the roads to fall into disrepair. \\"...We have no roads, we have no insurrection\\" was one of his favourite sayings. In 1997 he died of prostate cancer and the rebel army of Laurent Kabila took control of the country in the First Congo War. This was soon followed by Rwandan and Ugandan invasions of the Eastern Congo in the Second Congo War. Congolese militias known as Mai Mai also sprang up and began fighting in this conflict, and the Ituri region was one of the areas most affected by this conflict, the largest in Africa. Economic and cultural features The Ef√© are primarily a foraging society, but they do sometimes perform wage labour for the Lese villagers. Ef√© men hunt and gather honey while the women gather food and also fish. Recently, the Ituri forest has been logged at a tremendous rate, and Ef√© have been hired to assist with the logging. Attaining necessities Hunting is a primary way in which Ef√© men contribute to the food supply of the tribe, which they were observed doing 21.1% of the time during 12-hour observation days. They hunt either alone or in groups, using either spears or bows and arrows (the arrows may be iron- tipped or poison-tipped, depending on the type of prey). Monkeys are hunted alone using poison-tipped arrows, which is done by solitary hunters who locate groups of monkeys feeding in trees and stand where they think the monkeys will move. Once they are within , an Ef√© archer fires several arrows and, if he hits one of the monkeys, he will either try to follow it up to through the forest (waiting for the poison to set in), or he will return later (the same day or the next morning) in order to bring it back to camp. Poison-tipped arrows are labour-intensive to make (the poisonous roots and vines have to be gathered and then crushed up to turn them into a juice that can be used to coat the arrow tip), and are made in batches of about 75, with about 5.9 minutes spent on each arrow. Duikers (a type of antelope) are hunted either in groups or ambushed alone from trees with iron-tipped arrows. The ambush hunts are called ebaka, and they are performed by building perches in fruit trees from which the duikers eat dropped fruits and waiting there during feeding hours, which are early morning and late afternoon. If the hunter hits a duiker, he will jump out of the 2.5- to 3-metre perch and chase it, and call the dogs to join him. Sometimes, though, the animal gets away, since they can run the distance of several football fields away in the dense forest, even wounded. Group hunts, which are called mota, take place with between 4 and 30 men who use either spears for large animals (like forest buffalo and elephants) or iron-tipped arrows for duikers, other species of antelope, and water chevrotain. They also use their dogs to drive game out of their hiding and/or sleeping places and to chase down wounded animals. Another exclusively male task is to gather honey, which takes place from June through September. Honey season, however, can last until November if it is a particularly plentiful season. Women perform most tasks unrelated to hunting and honey- gathering. These include gathering firewood and water, which women do about 5 percent of the time. Generally, they do this with at least one other person, very occasionally a man. Gathering forest foods, namely fruits, nuts, tubers, mushrooms, caterpillars, and termites takes up a lot of their time, as does labouring in the villages. Women also spend 17% of their time preparing food, and are almost solely responsible for maintaining the camp. Family life One interesting feature of the family life of the Ef√© is the degree of cooperation involved in caring for children, particularly babies. Sometimes Ef√© infants will even be nursed by a woman other than the mother if the mother's milk has not come in yet. Other women help more in caretaking than the baby's father, and studies indicate that Ef√© babies spend just 40% of their time with their mothers and are switched around between caretakers 8.3 times per hour, with about 14 people looking after the infant on average in 8 hours of observation. Also notable is the fact that children constitute only a quarter to a third of the population, and nearly half of women have either no or one child during their lifetime. The Ef√© ideal is to marry by sister exchange, but this happens for only 40 percent of men. There is no bridewealth and very little bride service. The Ef√© are not allowed to marry anyone related to their grandfathers, and they trace their heritage patrilineally. Generally, residence is patrilocal and the composition of camps roughly follows that of a patriclan.  Relationship to the Lese  The Ef√© can be said to live in cooperation with the Lese, who live in villages of between fifteen and a hundred people and grow their food. The Ef√© make their camps on the outskirts of the forest near a Lese village for about seven months of the year (save for the best hunting season, January through March, and honey season), and are never more than eight hours away on foot from a village. The Ef√© generally trade the meat and honey they acquire in the forest for material goods or the cassava, bananas, peanuts, and rice grown by the Lese, and the meat provided by the Ef√© accounts for over half of the meat eaten by the Lese. Important goods that the Lese villagers provide for the Ef√© are tobacco and marijuana, which about half of men and a third of women smoke. In addition to trading meat and honey with the villagers, Ef√© men and women also provide their labour in exchange for foods, tobacco, marijuana, iron, cloth or other material goods. Women do this about 9.6% of their time, usually helping to plant, harvest, and prepare the food from Lese gardens in return for food from the garden. Ef√© men, on the other hand, mostly perform work related to clearing fields in December, and spend about 3.5% of their time doing it. They are usually paid with cooked food, some of which they eat right away and some of which they bring back to camp with them; but they are also occasionally paid with marijuana or tobacco. Men spend more time in the villages doing things other than working, like drinking palm wine with the villagers and generally socializing. Lese and Ef√© men even establish partnerships, which can be inherited and constitute a special bond between a Lese and an Ef√© man. However, these partnerships can be dissolved when an Ef√© man returns borrowed items to his Lese partner. One aspect of the Lese‚ÄìEf√© relationship that is less than cooperative is the way in which they view each other. Ef√© often steal from Lese gardens, particularly around April and May when there is little food and the Lese are ungenerous about payment for Ef√© labor. The Lese, on the other hand, view the Ef√© with something of a condescending attitude and see themselves as entirely separate entities. Ef√© are viewed by Lese men and women alike as being female. The Lese also see strict dichotomies between themselves and the Ef√© ‚Äì they characterize the Ef√© as uneducated savages and see themselves as more civilized since they go to school and live in villages. Another interesting image they create is that of red versus white ‚Äì the Ef√© and the meat and honey they provide are described as red, and the goods the Lese provide (dried corn, cassava, etc.) are closer to white in colour. However, Lese men describe Ef√© men as \\"devoted friends and protectors\\" and also find Ef√© women \\"stronger, more sexually attractive, and more fertile than Lese women\\". The Lese also believe that the Ef√© can hunt witches and protect the village from them. Religion It is rather difficult to accurately describe the Ef√© religion, as there is not a great deal of information that deals specifically with the Ef√©. The main source used was a collection of Bambuti legends, i.e. legends that the author felt belonged to some extent to all of the pygmy groups of the Ituri forest, but the tribe from whom the legends were gathered were one of the net-hunting groups, not the Ef√©. Because of the lack of information, it seems imprudent to relay any of the specific legends. The legends, though, tend to fall into three categories: ‚Äúcreation myths; legends of origin and tradition, legends dealing with social relations, and legends dealing with relations with the supernatural\\". Another interesting aspect of Ef√© religion is that it is also shared with the Lese. Many of pygmy legends deal with their larger partners, and the associated tribes have myths dealing with the pygmies. Even some religious ceremonies are held in common, such as the ima celebration in which girls who have reached menarche and been secluded in a hut together are carried back out into the village. Bailey describes the period of seclusion as being three months, but Grinker states that it is more like six months to a year and that the girls‚Äô feet are not allowed to touch the ground without being wrapped in palm leaves and that whenever they have to use the bathroom, they must be carried to an outhouse wrapped in palm leaves so that the sun does not touch them. This period is also supposed to make the girls fat, and they are supposed to consume a lot of palm oil and meat while they are being sequestered.

Jorge Manuel d‚ÄôAbreu Palma, known as Jorge Palma (born June 4, 1950 in Lisbon, Portugal), is a Portuguese singer and songwriter. Early life and career At the age of six, Palma learnt to play the piano and to read. When he was eight years old he performed his first piano audition in the Portuguese National Conservatory. In 1963, aged 13, Palma finished second in a musical contest in Majorca, Spain. At the same time, he continued his studies, first at the Cam√µes high school and next at a school in Abrantes. The next year, 1964, marked a turning point in Palma's musical style, after leaving his classical influences he started to play rock'n'roll and taught himself to play guitar. In 1969, he joined the Hard rock band Sindikato while continuing his studies in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Lisbon. Being in the band gave him the opportunity to play in the very first edition of the Vilar de Mouros Festival, in 1971. In that same year, aided by some friends, such as R√£o Kyao, Jo√£o Mal√≥, Rui Cardoso and V√≠tor Mamede, he began to write lyrics and compose songs and in the end he recorded, with Sindikato, an album with a single and an album of covers. To avoid conscription and the Portuguese Colonial War in Portugal's overseas territories in Africa, Jorge Palma dropped out of university and went to Denmark with his wife, Gisela Brande, where he lived from 1973 to 1974 as a political refugee. In Denmark, he got a job at a hotel and presented some of his musical works through radio broadcast. After the Carnation Revolution on April 25, 1974 in Lisbon, Jorge Palma returned home.

The solo Career=First albums Jorge Palma's solo career started with the release of the single \\"The Nine Billion Names of God\\", based on the short story of the same name by Arthur C. Clarke with lyrics in English language. After that he spent some time improving his writing skills in Portuguese language with the famous poet and song lyricist Jos√© Carlos Ary dos Santos. His first LP, named Com Uma Viagem na Palma da M√£o was released in 1975, in a style very influenced by Progressive Rock acts such as Yes, Genesis and Gentle Giant. In 1977, he released his second album, T√© J√°, album that made him play abroad, in Spain and Brazil. Palma spent the following years, 1978 and 1979, in France, mainly in Paris, where he performed in several bars, playing songs of some major names of the musical panorama, such as Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon, Crosby, Stills & Nash and others. After returning to Portugal, in 1979, Palma recorded and released his 3rd album, named Qualquer Coisa P√° M√∫sica, followed by live concerts alone or with the group O Bando. In the early 1980s, he travelled to Paris, only returning in 1982 to finish the record of his 4th album, Acto Cont√≠nuo, album that was first meant to be a live album, but due to some difficulties, was recorded in studio. In 1983, when Palma was about to restart his musical studies, which he would finish in 1986, his first son, Vicente Palma, was born. In the next year, Palma recorded his 5th album, Asas e Penas, where he included a song dedicated to Vicente, named Castor (Beaver). In that same year he performed in Portugal, France and Italy, sometimes playing in the streets. In 1985, Palma released one of the most acclaimed albums of his career, named O Lado Errado da Noite, the album included the single Deixa-me Rir, which became a huge success. The album received several musical awards and many music critics called it \\"the right side of Jorge Palma\\" (the album name is translated from Portuguese as \\"the wrong side of the night\\"). After releasing the album, Palma made a major Tournee, Azores and Madeira. In 1986 Palma finished his piano course and recorded the seventh album, Quarto Minguante, which was marked by the recording company's will of changing Palma's musical style, a thing he refused. Recent years After releasing his eighth album, Bairro do Amor, in 1989, Palma started a long period without releasing an album of originals, but continued his piano studies, finishing the Superior Course of Piano in the Portuguese National Conservatory in the next year. This last album was considered by many critics and newspapers among the best Portuguese albums of the century. The album was recorded by PolyGram, unlike the previous, as Palma had finished his contract with EMI after the refusal of the last in releasing the album. In 1991 was released a compilation titled S√≥, which revisited old songs with only vocals and Piano. After the release of this album, Palma formed the Palma's Gang, with members of the bands Xutos & Pontap√©s and R√°dio Macau, which released a live album in 1993, titled Palma's Gang ‚Äì Ao Vivo no Johnny Guitar. In that same year, Palma participated in an album of the punk band Censurados. The next two years, Palma performed in several stages from north to south Portugal, alone or with Palma's Gang, some of them broadcast by the RTP ‚Äì R√°dio e Televis√£o de Portugal. Meanwhile, his second son, Francisco Palma, was born. In 1996, Palma accepted an invitation to join a new project, named Rio Grande, a band that included other famous Portuguese musicians, Tim (Xutos & Pontap√©s), Jo√£o Gil (Ala dos Namorados), Rui Veloso and Vitorino. The first album of the band was inspired in the Portuguese traditional music and became a major success in that year. In 1997, along with several concerts, Palma participated in several musical projects, such as Todo Este C√©u with N√© Ladeiras or Voz e guitarras, an acoustic album with several other artists. Also in 1997, the Rio Grande released their second album, a live album recorded in a major concert in Lisbon. In this album was present an unreleased song by Palma, Quem √âs Tu De Novo In 1998, Palma played several major concerts, for university students in Lisbon and Porto, and also in the World's Fair Expo '98 in Lisbon.

It was released in August 1966 as the final track on their album Revolver, although it was the first song recorded for the LP. The song marked a radical departure for the Beatles, as the band fully embraced the potential of the recording studio without consideration for reproducing the results in concert. When writing the song, Lennon drew inspiration from his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD and from the book The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner. The Beatles' recording employed musical elements foreign to pop music, including musique concr√®te, avant-garde composition and electro-acoustic sound manipulation. It features an Indian-inspired modal backing of tambura and sitar drone and bass guitar, with minimal harmonic deviation from a single chord, underpinned by a constant but non-standard drum pattern; added to this, tape loops prepared by the band were overdubbed \\"live\\" onto the rhythm track. Part of Lennon's vocal was fed through a Leslie speaker cabinet, normally used for a Hammond organ. The song's backwards guitar parts and effects marked the first use of reversed sounds in a pop recording, although the Beatles' 1966 B-side \\"Rain\\", which they recorded soon afterwards using the same technique, was issued over three months before Revolver. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was an early and highly influential recording in the psychedelic and electronic music genres, particularly for its pioneering use of sampling, tape manipulation and other production techniques. It also introduced lyrical themes that espoused mind expansion, anti-materialism and Eastern spirituality into popular music. On release, the song was the source of confusion and ridicule by many fans and journalists; it has since received praise as an effective representation of a psychedelic experience. Pitchfork placed the track at number 19 on its list of \\"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\\", and Rolling Stone ranked it at number 18 on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest Beatles songs. Background and inspiration Timothy Leary before a crowd of university students during a lecture tour in 1969. In his lyrics to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", Lennon drew from Leary's espousal of LSD as a means to transcend material concerns. John Lennon wrote \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" in January 1966, with lyrics adapted from the book The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead by Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner, which was in turn adapted from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Although Beatles aide Peter Brown believed that Lennon's source for the lyrics was the Tibetan Book of the Dead itself, which, he said, Lennon had read while under the influence of LSD, George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary, Alpert and Metzner's book. Paul McCartney confirmed this, stating that when he and Lennon visited the newly opened Indica bookshop, Lennon had been looking for a copy of The Portable Nietzsche and found a copy of The Psychedelic Experience that contained the lines: \\"Whenever in doubt, turn off your mind, relax, float downstream.\\" Lennon said he bought the book, went home, took LSD, and followed the instructions exactly as stated in the text. The book held that the \\"ego death\\" experienced under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs is essentially similar to the dying process and requires similar guidance. This is a state of being known by eastern mystics and masters as samƒÅdhi (a state of being totally aware of the present moment; a one-pointedness of mind). Harrison questioned whether Lennon fully understood the meaning of the song's lyrics: > Basically [the song] is saying what meditation is all about. The goal of > meditation is to go beyond (that is, transcend) waking, sleeping and > dreaming. So the song starts out by saying, \\"Turn off your mind, relax and > float downstream, it is not dying.\\" Then it says, \\"Lay down all thoughts, > surrender to the void ‚Äì it is shining. That you may see the meaning of > within ‚Äì it is being.\\" From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have > one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even > when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from > birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts. But you can > turn off your mind, and go to the part which Maharishi described as: \\"Where > was your last thought before you thought it?\\" The whole point is that we are > the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state > of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the > physical world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and > actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure > consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and about the > quality of the transcendent. I am not too sure if John actually fully > understood what he was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw > those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the > lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood > it. The title never appears in the song's lyrics. Lennon later revealed that, like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", it was taken from one of Ringo Starr's malapropisms. In a television interview in early 1964, Starr had uttered the phrase \\"Tomorrow never knows\\" when laughing off an incident that took place at the British Embassy in Washington, DC, during which one of the guests had cut off a portion of his hair. The piece was originally titled \\"Mark I\\" and was referred to as such in the EMI studio documentation until the Beatles were remixing tracks for the Revolver album in June. \\"The Void\\" is cited as another working title, but according to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, this resulted from Neil Aspinall, the band's road manager and assistant, referring to it as such in a contemporary issue of The Beatles Book. Lennon said he settled on Starr's phrase \\"to sort of take the edge off the heavy philosophical lyrics\\". He also said \\"The Void\\" would have been a more suitable title, but he was concerned about its obvious drug connotations. According to Aspinall's account in The Beatles Monthly, the musical portion of the song was the result of all four Beatles working to ensure the music matched the power of Lennon's lyrics: \\"The basic tune was written during the first hours of the recording session.\\" Musical structure McCartney remembered that even though the song's harmony was mainly restricted to the chord of C, George Martin, the Beatles' producer, accepted it as it was and said it was \\"rather interesting\\". The harmonic structure is derived from Indian music, a genre that Harrison had introduced to the Beatles' sound late in 1965 with his sitar part on \\"Norwegian Wood\\", and is based on a high volume C drone played on a tambura. The song's musical key is C Mixolydian. The chord over the drone is generally C major, but some changes to B major result from vocal modulations, as well as orchestral and guitar tape loops. According to author Peter Lavezzoli, the composition is the first pop song to eschew formal chord changes altogether. Despite this limitation, musicologist Dominic Pedler sees the Beatles' harmonic ingenuity displayed in the upper harmonies ‚Äì \\"Turn off your mind\\", for example, is a run of unvarying E melody notes, before \\"relax\\" involves an E‚ÄìG melody-note shift and \\"float downstream\\" an E‚ÄìC‚ÄìG descent. \\"It is not dying\\" involves a run of three G melody notes that rise on \\"dying\\" to a B, at the start of the verse's fifth bar, creating a VII/I (B/C) \\"slash\\" polychord. Due to Lennon's adherence to Leary's text, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was also the first song by the Beatles to depart from any form of rhyming scheme. Recording A cross-section showing the inner workings of a Leslie speaker cabinet \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was the first song attempted during the sessions for Revolver, which started at 8 pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio 3 at EMI Studios (subsequently Abbey Road Studios). Geoff Emerick, who was promoted to the role of the Beatles' recording engineer for Revolver, recalled that the band \\"encouraged us to break the rules\\" and ensure that each instrument \\"should sound unlike itself\\". Lennon sought to capture the atmosphere of a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony; he told Martin that the song should sound like it was being chanted by a thousand Tibetan monks, with his vocal evoking the Dalai Lama singing from a mountaintop. The latter effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he enquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the Leslie cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker. A small gompa (Buddhist monastery) in Ladakh. Lennon sought to capture the mood of Tibetan monks chanting from a mountaintop. Further to their approach when recording Rubber Soul late the previous year, the Beatles and Martin embraced the idea of the recording studio as an instrument on Revolver, particularly \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". As Lennon hated doing a second take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's technical manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the signal from the sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: the effect of the Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo. The track includes the highly compressed drums that the Beatles favoured at the time, with reverse cymbals, reverse guitar, processed vocals, looped tape effects, and sitar and tambura drone. In the description of musicologist Russell Reising, the \\"meditative state\\" of a psychedelic experience is conveyed through the musical drone, enhancing the lyrical imagery, while the \\"buzz\\" of a drug-induced \\"high\\" is sonically reproduced in Harrison's tambura rhythm and Starr's heavily treated drum sound. Despite the implied chord changes in the verses and repeatedly at the end of the song, McCartney's bass maintains a constant ostinato in C. Reising writes of the drum part: > Starr's accompaniment throughout the piece consists of a kind of stumbling > march, providing a bit of temporal disruption ... [The] first accent of each > bar falls on the measure's first beat and the second stress occurs in the > second half of the measure's third quarter, double sixteenth notes in > stuttering pre-emption of the normal rhythmic emphasis on the second > backbeat ‚Äì hardly a classic rock and roll gesture. The use of ¬º-inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney's admiration for Stockhausen's Gesang der J√ºnglinge. By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concr√®te. The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower. McCartney encouraged the other Beatles to use the same effects and create their own loops. After experimentation on their own, the various Beatles supplied a total of \\"30 or so\\" tape loops to Martin, who selected 16 for use on the song. Each loop was about six seconds long. The overdubbing of the tape loops took place on 7 April. The loops were played on BTR3 tape machines located in various studios of the Abbey Road building and controlled by EMI technicians in Studio Three. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like most of the other loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music. Harrison similarly described the mix of loops as \\"spontaneous\\", given that each run-through might favour different sounds over another. A 7-inch reel of audio recording tape, which was the type used to create the song's tape loops Five tape loops are prominent in the finished version of the song. According to author Ian MacDonald, writing in the 1990s, these loops contain the following: #A recording of McCartney's laughter, sped up to resemble the sound of a seagull (enters at 0:07) #An orchestral chord of B major (0:19) #A Mellotron on its flute setting (0:22) #A Mellotron strings sound, alternating between B and C in 6/8 time (0:38) #A sitar playing a rising scalic phrase, recorded with heavy saturation and sped up (0:56). Author Robert Rodriguez writes that the content of the five loops has continued to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo. Rather than revert to standard practice by having a guitar solo in the middle of the song, the track includes what McCartney described as a \\"tape solo\\". This section nevertheless includes a lead guitar part played by Harrison and recorded with the tape running backwards, to complement the sounds. The final overdubs were recorded on 22 April. According to Lewisohn, who had access to EMI's studios logs and notes, these overdubs comprised Harrison's sitar and Lennon's Leslie- treated vocal part. Lennon later told Beatles biographer Hunter Davies: \\"I should have tried to get near my original idea, the monks singing. I realise now that's what I wanted.\\" The discarded take 1 was issued on the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996. Previews and influence on Revolver project While highlighting \\"Love You To\\" as an example of the Beatles fully exploring Indian musical form during the Revolver sessions, music historian Simon Philo identifies \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as the track that \\"made few if any concessions to formula, and so confirmed that the Beatles had unequivocally moved on. 'Tomorrow Never Knows' was barely a song, let alone a pop song.\\" Musicologist William Echard describes it as an example of a raga rock song \\"rubb[ing] shoulders with the classical avant-garde\\". After completing the recording, McCartney was eager to gauge the reaction of the band's contemporaries. On 2 May, he played the song to Bob Dylan at the latter's hotel suite in London; as the track started, Dylan said dismissively: \\"Oh, I get it. You don't want to be cute anymore.\\" According to Marianne Faithfull, who was also present, Dylan then walked out of the room. McCartney recalled that when the Beatles played the song to members of the Rolling Stones and the Who, they \\"visibly sat up and were interested\\", whereas Cilla Black \\"just laughed\\". After experimenting with the techniques on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", the Beatles used reversed sounds and tape-speed variation extensively throughout the Revolver sessions. On \\"Rain\\", which was issued as the B-side of their \\"Paperback Writer\\" single in May 1966, part of Lennon's vocal track was reprised backwards over the coda, while Harrison planned and recorded his lead guitar parts for \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" with the tape direction reversed, in order to achieve a dislocated effect. Tony Hall, a music industry figure and journalist with a reputation for predicting trends, was also given a preview of the song, along with other tracks from early in the sessions. Writing in his column for Record Mirror in the issue dated 14 May, Hall especially highlighted \\"The Void\\" when describing the new songs as \\"the most revolutionary ever made by a pop group\\". Focusing on the otherworldly electronic effects, he wrote: \\"Sound-wise, it's like an hypnotically horrific journey through the dark never-ending jungle of someone's mind ... And the effect is of shapes and sounds and colours looming over and above one and zooming in and out of a monotonous drone.\\" Hall added that the track was \\"as revolutionary as Ornette Coleman appeared to the jazz scene a decade ago\\", before concluding: \\"[The Beatles] are so far ahead. And I'm longing to hear your reaction when the album is eventually issued.\\" Release \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was sequenced as the final track on Revolver, which EMI's Parlophone label issued on 5 August 1966. According to author Mark Hertsgaard, as the first song recorded during the Revolver sessions, its sequencing ensures that the track serves as \\"the summit to which the entire album ascends\\". In his design for the LP cover, Klaus Voormann drew inspiration from the song, recognising the need for artwork that would capture the Beatles' new direction and the avant-garde aspect of the recording. Voormann later said that he found \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" \\"frightening\\", adding that it was \\"so far away from the early Beatles stuff that even I myself thought, well, the normal kind of Beatles fan won't want to buy this record. But they did.\\" In an interview in October 1966, Harrison described the song as \\"easily the most amazing new thing we've ever come up with\\", but acknowledged that it might represent \\"a terrible mess of a sound\\" to listeners who approached the track without \\"open ears\\". He added: \\"It's like the Indian stuff. You mustn't listen to Eastern music with a Western ear.\\" In advance of the release, EMI had issued the songs to radio stations throughout July, in increments, to prepare the Beatles' audience for the new music. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was the last track to receive a public airing, a few days before the album was issued commercially. Reaction to Revolver was \\"generally ecstatic\\", according to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's \\"aural invention\\". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine Mirabelle wrote: \\"Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang at the end of Revolver.\\" Recalling the release in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner commented that whereas the group's more traditional fans warmed to McCartney's new songs, \\"some people thought Lennon was sprouting complete gibberish, and concluded that the poor lad had slid off the deep end.\\" Aged 16 in 1966, author and academic Nick Bromell says that psychedelic drugs were a year away from \\"erupting\\" into American youth culture, and most contemporary listeners heard \\"strangeness, undiluted and outrageous strangeness\\" in the song. He adds: \\"'Tomorrow Never Knows' was an enigma they would understand only gradually, through many listenings and over many months. They heard it first and foremost as a place to dwell, not as an answer or as a deliverance.\\" Critical reception In his album review for the NME, Allen Evans expressed confusion over \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". In response to the lyric's exhortation to \\"relax and float downstream\\", he wrote: \\"But how can you relax with the electronic, outer-space noises, often sounding like seagulls? ‚Ä¶ Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural.\\" Peter Jones of Record Mirror commented: \\"You need some sort of aural microscope to get the message from this. But it's darned compelling listening.\\"Green, Richard; Jones, Peter (30 July 1966). \\"The Beatles: Revolver (Parlophone)\\". Record Mirror. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Disc and Music Echos review of Revolver took the form of a track-by-track rundown by Ray Davies of the Kinks, who, in author Steve Turner's opinion, took the opportunity to air his longstanding bitterness towards the Beatles. Davies was unimpressed with the track, and concluded that the band must have had \\"George Martin tied to a totem pole when they did this\\". Writing in the recently launched Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams derided \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and the album's single, \\"Yellow Submarine\\", saying of Lennon's song: \\"A good artist doesn't publish first drafts.\\" Edward Greenfield of The Guardian described the track as \\"the most remarkable item on a compulsive new record\\". He said the lyrics were a \\"curious sort of poetry\\" that conveyed the concept of \\"pop-music as a substitute, both for jungle emotions and for the consolations of religion\\", as teenagers followed in the long societal tradition of disengaging the mind and surrendering \\"to the tribal leader, the priest, or now the pop- singer\\". Greenfield concluded by saying, \\"Thank goodness Lennon is being satirical: at least one hopes so.\\" In 2006, Pitchfork ranked \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" at number 19 on its list of \\"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\\" and Q magazine placed the track 75th on a list of \\"The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" appears at number 18 on Rolling Stones list of the best Beatles songs and at number 4 on similar lists compiled by Uncut in 2001 and Mojo in 2006. In 2018, the music staff of Time Out London ranked it at number 2 on their list of the best Beatles songs. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 144th most celebrated song in popular music history. Love remix The Love project, which combined \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\" In 2006, Martin and his son, Giles Martin, remixed 80 minutes of Beatles music for the Las Vegas stage performance Love, a joint venture between Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles' Apple Corps. On the Love album, the rhythm to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was mixed with the vocals and melody from \\"Within You Without You\\", creating a different version of the two songs. Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Zeth Lundy wrote: \\"The 'Within You Without You'/'Tomorrow Never Knows' mash-up, perhaps the most thrilling and effective track on the entire disc, fuses two especially transcendental songs into one: ... a union of two ambiguous, open-ended declarations of spiritual pursuit.\\" In their chapter on the Beatles' psychedelic period in The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles, authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc describe \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as \\"the most musically and visually stunning segment\\" of the Cirque du Soleil show. The Love remix is one of the main songs in The Beatles: Rock Band. Influence and legacy=In popular culture Nicholas Schaffner said that listeners who had been confused by the song's lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love. According to Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" has been recognised as \\"the most effective evocation of a LSD experience ever recorded\\". Ian MacDonald says that the song's message represented a revolutionary concept in mainstream society in 1966, and by introducing LSD and Leary's \\"psychedelic revolution\\" to Western youth, it is \\"one of the most socially influential records The Beatles ever made\\". He adds: \\"'Tomorrow Never Knows' launched the till-then √©lite-preserved concept of mind-expansion into pop, simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness-enhancing drugs and the ancient religious philosophies of the Orient, utterly alien to Western thought in their anti- materialism, rapt passivity, and world-sceptical focus on visionary consciousness.\\" According to Simon Philo, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was the most groundbreaking track on an album that announced the arrival of the \\"underground London\\" sound. Barry Miles also sees it as the experimental highpoint of Revolver, which he recalls as an \\"advertisement for the underground\\" and a work that resounded on the level of experimental jazz among members of the movement, including those who soon founded the UFO Club. In music Hernan Campbell of Sputnikmusic recognises \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as \\"the most important Psychedelic composition in the history of the genre\\" and \\"the epitome of everything that psychedelia stands for\\". In the opinion of former Mojo editor Paul Trynka, the track benefited most from the Beatles' ability to channel their ideas into a recognisable song form, a discipline that ensured their psychedelic recordings were superior to those by the Grateful Dead and other contemporary San Francisco acts. In the 1997 Mojo feature article \\"Psychedelia: The 100 Greatest Classics\\", Jon Savage listed the April 1966 recording as the first item in his chronological history of UK psychedelia, adding that the song \\"immediately impacted on pop culture\\". According to Bromell, writing in his book Tomorrow Never Knows: Rock and Psychedelics in the 1960s, the track is \\"regarded by many critics as the most important rock song of the decade\\". In his book Electronic and Experimental Music, Thom Holmes includes \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" in his list of the \\"pioneering works\\" in electronic music. He credits the song with \\"usher[ing] in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music\\". Music historians David Luhrssen and Michael Larson say that with Revolver the Beatles \\"erased boundaries of time and culture\\", adding: \\"Ancient met modern on 'Tomorrow Never Knows' as sitars encountered tape loops. 'Tomorrow Never Knows' reintroduced the sustained repetition of the drone, absent in Western music since the Middle Ages and only recently discovered by avant-garde composer La Monte Young.\\" According to Peter Lavezzoli, in his book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, \\"'Tomorrow Never Knows' was the most groundbreaking production to date in popular music\\" and he says it \\"still retains a terrifying visceral power\\". Musicologist Walter Everett describes Revolver as \\"an innovative example of electronic music\\" and says that \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was also \\"highly influential\\" on psychedelic rock. He identifies its studio effects and musical form as central to Pink Floyd's \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" and recognises the same use of extreme tape-speed manipulation in subsequent recordings by Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa, and backwards tapes in the work of Hendrix, Pink Floyd, the Byrds, the Who, the Electric Prunes, Spirit, Tomorrow, Soft Machine and the First Edition. He also identifies the Leslie-treated vocal as a precedent for similar experimentation by Hendrix, the Grateful Dead, the Moody Blues, Cream, Yes, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic at The New York Times, has described \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as \\"a portal to decades of music to come\\". Steve Turner highlights the sound sampling and tape manipulation as having had \\"a profound effect on everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Jay Z\\". Having introduced these techniques to mainstream pop, Turner writes, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" inspired the sampling that became commonplace over ten years later ‚Äì such as in Sugarhill Gang's \\"Rapper's Delight\\" and other examples of an artist taking a well-known riff or musical motif from an existing song; in David Byrne and Brian Eno's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, with its use of assorted spoken- word and vocal samples; in recordings by Big Audio Dynamite, which included samples from film soundtracks; and in Moby's Play, with its incorporation of little-known and disparate vocal tracks. In 2011, DJ Spooky said that the Beatles' song remained \\"in the DNA of so much going on these days\\" and that the use of \\"tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use sampling really successfully. I also think that Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording. Recalling his introduction to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" in 1966, American producer Tony Visconti has said: \\"It was incredible how the music matched the lyrics and, previous to this album, nobody was writing like that.\\" He also said that Revolver \\"showed how the studio could be used as an instrument\\" and contributed to his decision to relocate to London, because, \\"I had to learn how people made records like this.\\" In his 2004 book Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings, David Howard pairs Martin's work on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" with Phil Spector's 1966 production of \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\" as the two \\"visionary achievements in sound\\" that ensured that \\"the recording studio was now its own instrument: record production had been elevated into art.\\" The song is referenced in the lyric to Oasis' 1995 song \\"Morning Glory\\": \\"Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon\\". The Chemical Brothers have referred to \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as the template for their music; their 1996 track \\"Setting Sun\\" is a direct tribute to it, as is \\"Let Forever Be\\". John Foxx of Ultravox also cited \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as an influence, saying that \\"As soon as I heard it, I knew it contained almost everything that I would want to investigate for the rest of my life.\\" In 2012, the song was included as the title track of the Beatles' iTunes compilation album Tomorrow Never Knows, which the band's website described as a collection of \\"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\\". = Cover versions = * 801, an experimental rock group that included Brian Eno and his former Roxy Music bandmate Phil Manzanera, performed the song live at their three concerts in 1976, under the name \\"TNK (Tomorrow Never Knows)\\". The final performance at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall was released on their album 801 Live. Author and musician Alan Clayson cites 801's adoption of the track as evidence that the Beatles' musical influence remained strong among 1970s glam rock artists, and that the latter scene lacked the generational divisiveness that would soon characterise punk rock. Dave Swanson of Ultimate Classic Rock ranks 801's version at number 6 in his list of the \\"10 Most Unique Beatles Cover Versions\\", saying that the band transform the song in an arrangement that features \\"Funky bass lines, squabbling synths and the guitar dynamics of Manzanera\\". * Phil Collins released a version on his 1981 album Face Value as a tribute to John Lennon, who was killed at the time Collins was recording the album. * In 2007, Oasis set \\"Within You Without You\\" to the music of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as their contribution to the BBC's 40th anniversary tribute to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album. * Tangerine Dream recorded an instrumental version in 2008. * Herbie Hancock performed a version featuring Dave Matthews in 3/4 time on his 2010 recording The Imagine Project. *Our Lady Peace covered the song for The Craft (1996 film) soundtrack. * Daniel Johnston and Jad Fair covered the song on their 1989 album It's Spooky. In television and film The song was parodied, as \\"L.S. Bumblebee\\", as part of a satirical sketch on the Swinging London phenomenon in the Not Only ... But Also 1966 Christmas TV special, which included a cameo appearance by Lennon. Sung by comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, both of whom are dressed in Indian clothing, the song evokes the seagull sounds of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" through the presence of a bird squawking in the studio, and includes lyrics playing on the sensory contradictions of lines such as \\"Listen to the colour of your dreams\\" from the Beatles track. In 1967, Bruce Conner used \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" as the soundtrack to his LSD-inspired experimental film Looking for Mushrooms. When reworking the film for a 1996 presentation, Conner replaced the song with an instrumental piece by avant-garde composer Terry Riley. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was featured during the final scene of the 2012 Mad Men episode \\"Lady Lazarus\\". Don Draper's wife Megan gives him a copy of Revolver, calling his attention to a specific track and suggesting, \\"Start with this one\\". Draper, an advertising executive, is struggling to understand youth culture, but after contemplating the song for a few puzzled moments, he shuts it off. The track also played over the closing credits. The rights to the song cost the producers around $250,000, \\"about five times as much as the typical cost of licensing a song for TV\\".

He was the adoptive son of American actor Carroll O'Connor. Biography=Personal life Hugh was born in Rome, Italy. When he was six days old, he was adopted by Carroll and his wife, Nancy (n√©e Fields). Carroll was in Rome filming Cleopatra. He was named after Carroll's younger brother, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1961. When he was 16, Hugh was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. He survived the cancer with chemotherapy and two surgeries but ultimately became addicted to drugs. He had been taking prescription drugs for the pain and marijuana for nausea but later became dependent on harder drugs. Despite numerous stays at rehabilitation clinics, he never conquered his addiction and remained in recovery. Marriage Hugh married Angela Clayton, a wardrobe assistant on In the Heat of the Night, on March 28, 1992. Their son, Sean Carroll O'Connor, was born in 1993. Legal issues Six months before Hugh's death, Angela told Carroll that a man named Harry Thomas Perzigian had been furnishing Hugh with drugs. Carroll had retained a private detective to investigate. About a week before Hugh's death, Carroll brought the evidence to the Los Angeles Police, asking them to arrest Perzigian. Several hours after Hugh's death, Carroll publicly named Perzigian as the man who caused his death. Perzigian was arrested the next day for drug possession and furnishing cocaine, after a search of his apartment turned up cocaine and drug paraphernalia. In January 1996, he was sentenced to a year in jail, a $1,000 fine, 200 hours of community service, and three years of probation. Perzigian later sued Carroll for slander, for calling him a \\"sleazeball\\" and saying \\"he was a partner in murder, not an accessory, a partner in murder\\" in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC's Primetime Live. After a highly publicized civil trial, Carroll was found not liable. He dedicated much of the rest of his life to speaking out on drug awareness. Death On March 28, 1995, the third anniversary of his marriage, Hugh called his father Carroll to tell him he was going to end his life. He told his father he believed he could not beat his drug addiction and could not face another drug rehabilitation program. Carroll called the police, who arrived at Hugh's Pacific Palisades, California, home just as he shot himself. The police later determined he had cocaine in his blood. Hugh's body was cremated, and his ashes were originally buried at the Church of St. Susanna in Rome, Italy. Later, they were moved to the mausoleum of the Pontifical North American College in Campo Verano, Rome, Italy. Today, he has a cenotaph at the Church of St. Susanna. The Hugh O'Connor Memorial Law After Hugh's death, Carroll successfully lobbied to get the state of California to pass legislation that allows family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealer's actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment and rehabilitation costs. The law, known as the Drug Dealer Liability Act in California, went into effect in 1997. It is an updated version of the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act authored in 1992 by then Hawaii U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent. It had been passed in several states before it was passed in California with Carroll's support, and it is now the law in sixteen states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Successful cases have been brought under the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act in Michigan, Utah, and Illinois.
