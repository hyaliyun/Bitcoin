It was and remains a highly popular translation, and was reissued in a Hebrew-English version with haftarot for synagogue use. Kaplan had the following goals for his translation, which were arguably absent from previous English translations: * Make it clear and readable * Keep it close to the basic meaning (peshat) of the text in many places, but in other places translated it to be in accord with post-biblical rabbinic commentary and Jewish codes of law. * Keeping it faithful to Orthodox Jewish tradition * Provide useful notes, a table of contents, illustrations, and a comprehensive index. Kaplan's work has been hailed as one of the best English translations of the Torah, next to Rabbi Hirsch's translation, because of his inclusion of the rabbinic elucidation of the text. Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg, a prominent legal decider for the Orthodox community, is reported to have said that the translation is so good that if one is unable to read the Targum Onkelos, which is written in Aramaic, one can fulfill Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum, the obligatory weekly reading of the Torah twice in Hebrew and once with translation, with The Living Torah's translation.

Adopted in 1908 by a Royal Warrant, it has been the coat of arms of Fiji since that year, having been retained after independence in 1970. The escutcheon from the arms is featured on the flag of Fiji. History The Kingdom of Fiji became a crown colony of the British Empire on 10 October 1874. ' About 34 years later, the islands were accorded with their own coat of arms through a royal warrant issued on 4 July 1908. Although its design was \\"intended to be British\\", the arms did incorporate symbols of Fiji ‚Äì it was eventually used on the flag of the territory. When it was granted independence on 10 October 1970, Fiji decided to retain its coat of arms from the colonial era. ' This was partly because of its links to Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the first and last King of Fiji () who relinquished control of the country to Britain. However, the coat of arms featured on the flag was modified, which involved removing the crest, supporters, and motto, thus leaving only the escutcheon untouched. This was done in order to enlarge the shield and make it more prominent. This has led to calls from several Fijian chiefs for the restoration of the full, official coat of arms to the national flag. ' Design=Symbolism The colors and objects on the coat of arms carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The Cross of St. George‚Äîwhich divides the shield quarterly‚Äîand the golden lion at the top represent the United Kingdom, the former colonial power that ruled over Fiji. The cacao pod held in the lion's paw, along with the sugarcane, coconut palm and bananas occupying three of the four quadrants, represent the country's natural resources, since these are key agricultural crops in Fiji. The bottom left quadrant contains a dove that symbolizes peace ‚Äì this was utilized on the country's flag during the reign of King Cakobau, whose government was the last before the commencement of British rule. The crest at the top depicts a takia‚Äîa traditional Fijian canoe‚Äîwhile the supporters grasping the shield on both sides are Fijian warriors. According to legend, they are twins; the older brother is clutching a spear, while the younger one holds a totokia club. At the bottom is the country's motto: Fear God and honour the Queen ().

The Hotel2Tango (sometimes referred to as Thee Mighty Hotel2Tango and abbreviated H2T) is a 24-track analogue recording studio situated in the Mile End district of Montreal, Quebec. The current facility is the second to bear the name, and was preceded by a similar operation in the same neighborhood until 2007 when the studio changed locations. The majority of recording projects undertaken at the studio are helmed by one of the facility's four partner-engineers: Efrim Menuck and Thierry Amar, both members of Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra- La-La Band and Godspeed You! Black Emperor; Radwan Ghazi Moumneh, member of Jerusalem In My Heart; and Howard Bilerman. The Hotel2Tango is often closely associated with Constellation Records, a Montreal-based record label. Before becoming a dedicated studio, the original Hotel2Tango acted first as a living space and later as a live performance venue. Original location (1995‚Äì2007) Future Godspeed You! Black Emperor member Mauro Pezzente and his partner Kiva Stimac first moved into the space that later became the Hotel2Tango in 1995. The loft doubled as a performance space and was dubbed Gallery Quiva, hosting approximately one show per month. However, after less than a year exhaust fumes and odor from the mechanic's garage directly below the loft forced Pezzente and Stimac to vacate the building. Shortly thereafter the lease was taken over by Efrim Menuck, who took the first three letters of the area's postal code, H2T, and used the NATO phonetic alphabet to create the space's new name: Hotel2Tango. Pezzente and Stimac later opened three highly- influential performance spaces on Saint Laurent Boulevard in Montreal: Casa del Popolo, La Sala Rossa, and the now defunct El Salon. By 1998, the Hotel2Tango had become one of the most popular alternative music venues in the city of Montreal and acted as a hub for a number of projects by members of the local artistic community. At one point the loft acted as a work space for Montreal silk-screeners the Bloodsisters, and as a workshop for a local carpenter. Godspeed You! Black Emperor performed at the Hotel2Tango frequently and used the loft as a practice space along with other groups such as Fly Pan Am and Molasses. Godspeed also recorded the bulk of their first album, F‚ôØA‚ôØ‚àû in the loft's large main room the previous year. As the band's popularity grew over the next several years, so too did the mystery surrounding its secretive members. Many rumours developed about the group and its de facto home base. At one point it was commonly believed by outsiders that all of the band members were squatting illegally in the loft. Eventually word spread about the shows taking place at the Hotel2Tango and the crowds arriving each evening came to be greater than the facility could handle. Amid numerous thefts by show attendees and a generally out-of-control crowd, shows at the Hotel2Tango became less frequent and eventually stopped completely, effectively passing the torch to a handful of newly opened dedicated concert venues within the city. At that time at least two people still lived within the walls of the Hotel2Tango, including Godspeed bassist Thierry Amar, though he later moved out. In 2000 Howard Bilerman, then-owner of Mom and Pop Sounds, a small Montreal recording studio near the city's Chinatown, approached Amar and Menuck, who were interested in focusing on establishing a studio in the Hotel2Tango, about combining the trio's equipment to use in a central space. Finding the offer favourable, the group began consolidating their two facilities; building a number of walls within the Hotel2Tango, effectively separating the space into three areas: a control room, a live room and a large common area. Soon after, the three purchased a professional 24-track analogue tape machine, which became the centerpiece of the new Hotel2Tango studio. The studio had a built-in clientele, quickly becoming the studio of choice for most of the Montreal-based artists on the Constellation Records label. For a number of years the studio remained closed to most outsiders, its operators choosing to concentrate mostly on the projects of friends and those groups directly related to Constellation and another Montreal record label, Fancy Recordings, a now-defunct subsidiary of Alien8 Recordings. In recent years, however, the Hotel2Tango has opened its doors to many other bands from Montreal and abroad, launching a promotional website in September 2004. Relocation In early 2006 several people involved with Constellation Records and the Hotel2Tango purchased an industrial building two blocks from the site of the original studio. The building had reportedly been abandoned for about a decade and was nearly to be developed into condominiums at the time of the purchase. The building was renovated over the course of a year in order to house a new Hotel2Tango along with Harris Newman's Grey Market Mastering and the Constellation Records headquarters. The transition between the two locations officially took place in early 2007, with operations in the original building ceasing on February 4. Clientele Many groups and musicians have recorded at the Hotel2Tango, including Vic Chesnutt, Sam Roberts Band,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KilsYGUAdoY Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade and Basia Bulat to name a few.Hotel2Tango bandlist NotesExternal links * Hotel2Tango Homepage * Casa del Popolo Homepage * Constellation Records Homepage * Alien8 Recordings Homepage Category:Recording studios in Canada Category:Companies based in Montreal Category:Music of Montreal Category:Mass media companies established in 1995 Category:Le Plateau-Mont- Royal ","title":"Hotel2Tango"},{"id":"3567289","text":"Chile competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

She was convicted of murdering her de facto husband's son, Arthur Morris, in 1908. She was also suspected of killing his two daughters, Annie and Olive, by swabbing their throats with hydrochloric acid. Although the children died slow and agonising deaths, they had been treated by a number of doctors during their illness, only one of whom expressed any doubts about their deaths. Beginnings Martha Rendell moved in with Thomas Nicholls Morris at 23 Robertson St, East Perth after he had separated from his wife, who had moved out and lived elsewhere. Morris had custody of his four children at the time. Rendell, who had known Morris whilst in Adelaide and had followed him west, moved into the house and posed as his wife. The children were told to call her \\"mother\\". Rendell brutally abused Morris' children, once beating Annie so savagely that she could not walk. Arresting officer Inspector Harry Mann said \\"she delighted in seeing her victims writhe in agony, and from it derived sexual satisfaction\\".  Crimes committed  Rendell killed 7-year-old Annie first. Her method was to put something in the child's food that would result in a sore throat. It was alleged that she killed the children by swabbing hydrochloric acid on the backs of their throats, claiming it was medicine. This would inflame the throat until the child could no longer eat, and thus would starve to death. Annie died on 28 July 1907. Dr. Cuthbert issued a certificate stating the cause of death was diphtheria. After killing Annie, she turned her attention to Olive, aged 5. Olive died on 6 October 1907, and again Cuthbert issued a certificate stating the cause of death was diphtheria. In the winter of 1908, Rendell tried the same method on Arthur, the third son and youngest child still alive. Arthur, who was 14, took longer to succumb to the treatment, finally dying on 6 October 1908. Cuthbert asked permission for an autopsy. Rendell said she wanted to be present during the investigation. She stood by as the autopsy was performed, and the doctors found nothing to incriminate her. In April 1909, she turned her attention to the second son, George. It didn't take long for the second son to complain of a sore throat after drinking a cup of tea. Rendell coated his tonsils with the syrup, frightening the boy, who ran to his mother's place some streets away. Neighbours enquired as to the boy's whereabouts; however, his father Thomas Morris stated that he did not know.  Investigation and trial  Rendell and Eric Edgar Cooke's grave in plot 409, Fremantle Cemetery Neighbours went to the police, and inspector Harry Mann conducted inquiries. Mann heard repeated references to the children's having their throats painted, and Rendell's apparent indifference to their pain. One neighbour claimed he often peeked in the windows to see Rendell standing in front of the screaming victim, rocking back and forth as if in ecstasy. Some also claimed to have witnessed her masturbating. Mann located George Morris, who had claimed to have run away because his stepmother had killed his siblings and was trying to poison him with spirits of salts (i.e. hydrochloric acid). The inquiry was hampered by the period of time that had elapsed since the deaths, and because doctors could not say what effect swabbing with spirits of salts would have. Suspicions were further aroused when it was shown that Rendell had purchased large quantities of spirits of salts during the period of the children's illnesses, but none since the last death. Armed with this information the detectives obtained permission to exhume the bodies and this was done on 3 July 1909. Police exhumed the bodies of the three children; diluted hydrochloric acid was found on the throat tissue. Rendell and Thomas Morris were both charged with murder, the former being sentenced to death by hanging. Rendell protested her innocence, maintaining that she was treating the children for diphtheria. Although Thomas Morris was also charged with the murders, he was acquitted; it was believed that, although he had purchased spirits of salts, he had not been aware of the crimes until after the children's deaths. The jury wanted to find him guilty of being an accessory after the fact, but this was not allowed. Execution The window with \\"Rendell's\\" image Rendell's crimes aroused considerable public outrage at the time; the press portrayed her as a \\"scarlet woman\\" and \\"wicked stepmother\\". She was hanged at Fremantle Prison on 6 October 1909. She is buried at Fremantle Cemetery, in the same grave where serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke was interred more than half a century later. Martha Rendell was the last woman executed in Western Australia. An illusion appears on one of the prison windows which can only be seen on the outside of the window; when inside the church looking out the glass is smooth and even, with no unusual shape or texture. An example of pareidolia, urban legend has it that this illusion is the portrait of Rendell, who watches over the prison. In popular culture The crimes of Martha Rendell were featured in an episode of the true crime TV series Deadly Women entitled \\"Pleasure From Pain\\" Season 5, Episode 14.

However it wasn't until Round 7 of the 2004 season that Newton held down a regular first team starting role after suffering two severe ankle injuries in 2003. In 2006 he was selected to play Country Origin, but was ruled out with injury and replaced by the man he struck in the elbow late in the 2004 season, Ashton Sims (see below). Sims himself was also ruled out and replaced by then-Wests Tigers backrower Anthony Laffranchi. Ashton Sims incident During the 2004 season, Newton was sent off in the Round 24 match against St George Illawarra Dragons. Newton received a 12-week suspension for elbowing St George Illawarra Dragons forward Ashton Sims. The suspension cost Newton the chance to represent the United States in an international match against Australia later that year. Newton had been sin binned four weeks earlier against the Cowboys for a professional foul. Departure Ryan Hoffman and Newton in 2007 celebrating after a win for Melbourne On 27 May 2007, Newton started in Newcastle Knights 71‚Äì6 defeat by Brisbane Broncos in what turned out to be his last game for the club. The next day, Newton announced he was leaving the Newcastle Knights after just 100 games, due to \\"personal reasons\\" and after learning coach, Brian Smith no longer saw him as a \\"must keep\\" for the remainder of the 2007 season or beyond. Melbourne Storm On 29 May 2007 Newton signed with the Melbourne Storm. He started in the second row in the Storm's round 13 clash with the New Zealand Warriors in Auckland and was one of the best players on the field, playing the full 80 minutes. He went on to play and score in the Grand Final, a 34‚Äì8 victory over Manly, becoming the second player to transfer mid-year to a Grand Final winning club and made history by being the first player to transfer mid-year and score a try in his winning grand final. In all Newton played 15 matches for Melbourne, ending up on the losing side only once, a Round 20 defeat by Sydney Roosters. He had the same birthdays as fellow Storm players Billy Slater and Cameron Smith but was two years older than both players. In 2010, the premiership that Newton won with Melbourne was stripped by the NRL for major breaches of the salary cap alongside the 2009 premiership.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-04-23/storm-punishment-too-harsh- geyer/407390 Hull KR On 17 October 2007, he was released by the Melbourne Storm due to salary cap restrictions and announced his move to the Super League on a two-year contract at the Hull Kingston Rovers. 2008 Newton made his Hull KR d√©but in the opening match of the 2008 season, a narrow 20‚Äì12 away defeat by reigning champions Leeds Rhinos. Newton went on to score his first try for the club in only his second match, a thrilling 24‚Äì22 home victory against St. Helens. 2009 Newton has been a star performer during the 2009 season, including scoring two hat tricks against Crusaders and Warrington Wolves. During the season Newton has, on occasions, been used as a starting prop forward before reverting to his familiar second row role later in the match. He has scored 12 Super League tries and 3 challenge cup tries in the 2009 season, his excellent form earning him a spot in the 2009 Super League Dream Team alongside teammates Ben Galea, Michael Dobson and Shaun Briscoe. Newton signed a four-year contract to take him through to the end of 2013 with Hull KR. 2010 Following on from the successful 2009 campaign Newton continued his string of impressive performances in the opening round victory over Salford City Reds, scoring a try in the 30‚Äì12 victory. Penrith Panthers Newton signed a two-year deal with the Penrith Panthers from 2012 having been brought in by Phil Gould to help rebuild the club, mentor younger players and use his experience to lead by example. Newton played a total of 46 first-grade games out of a possible 48 during his time at Penrith. Newton in 2013 Return to Newcastle Knights On 6 September 2013, Newton signed a 1-year contract to return to the Newcastle Knights. On 21 July 2015, Newton announced his retirement from rugby league at the end of the year, after spending his two last years back at the Knights mentoring younger players in New South Wales Cup. On 27 September 2015, he captained the Knights in their 2015 New South Wales Cup Grand Final win over the Wyong Roos. Post-rugby league career Newton is now the Chief Executive Officer of the Rugby League Players Association. After finishing his Rugby League career he went on to sign with the Rugby Union club Avoca Beach on the Central Coast, NSW where he was scouted out by the 2019 premiership winning 3rd grade coach for the 2020 season. Not only did Clint score on his debut and suffer a minor injury during the season, he came back to the ‚Äúdream team‚Äù to go on and beat the ‚Äúblue filth‚Äù in the 2020 grand final helping steer the side to back to back grand final victories. Although he never received the man of the match award, he played a massive part in contributing to the recipients game where Clint‚Äôs initials will also be engraved into the medallion. Outside rugby league While recuperating from injury in 2008, Clint caddied for Nikki Garrett during the Goteborg Masters in Sweden. Newton has also appeared alongside Garrett at the Jack Newton Celebrity Classic.

Publication history Created by Alan Kupperberg, Dan Mishkin, and Gary Cohn, he first appeared in Blue Devil #14. Fictional character biography=Origin and early heroics Eddie had the good fortune of being a gofer in his Aunt Marla's film company. He met Blue Devil on a film set, and became quite a fan of the hero, dreaming about one day becoming Blue‚Äôs sidekick. Edward snuck into Blue Devil's workshop at night and, using his prodigious knowledge of electronics, created a battlesuit incorporating the designs of the Blue Devil suit. Even though Blue Devil did not want a sidekick, Eddie was determined to make a go at being a hero. As \\"Kid Devil\\", he assisted his hero in foiling an airplane hijacking, and later helped defeat one of his enemies, the Vanquisher. After these adventures, his parents left Eddie's education and supervision to professors at the Institute of Hypernormal Conflict Studies. After Eddie's Aunt Marla died in a helicopter crash, Eddie attempted to live up to her name and succeed in the movie business. His attempts failed, however, and Eddie continued to have adventures as Kid Devil. He helps Young Justice's assault on Zandia, a small country that has become a refuge for supervillains.Young Justice #49-50 (December 2002) Changes and Titans Since the events in Infinite Crisis, Eddie has tried to join the Teen Titans with little success. Pulsar helps Eddie get into a project Lex Luthor has been using to give normal humans superpowers. However, Eddie fails because of \\"psychological problems\\". One evening, Eddie is visited by a cloaked figure, who gives him a candle. Eddie then goes to find his friend, Zachary Zatara. Zatara, being a magician, knows a little about magic and tells Eddie that the candle is a \\"demon stick\\", forged in demon's blood. Zatara tells Eddie that if someone light it, it will take him to its creator (which could be anyone). Eddie asks if, after teleporting them both to the creator, Zatara could just teleport them back. Zatara brags that he could, even though his magic could only affect things, not people. Not knowing of Zatara's inability to teleport anyone anywhere, Eddie decides to light it and the two are taken to Neron. Neron makes a deal with Eddie, transforming him into a new Kid Devil. Neron's magic gives Eddie a new, demonic appearance and inherent superpowers. As part of the deal, Eddie will not lose his soul to Neron if he can still trust Blue Devil by his 20th birthday. Before Eddie leaves, Neron tells him that it is Blue Devil's fault that his Aunt Marla died. Zachary helps Eddie join the Teen Titans, they battle Kid Crusader, and Zachary promises to keep his secret. One Year Later, a rift has formed between Eddie and Zachary. Though Eddie is still friendly with Zachary, the boy magician wants nothing to do with Eddie or any of the other Titans. Eddie also forges a bond with Rose Wilson, as both new members feel like third-string Titans. For many months, Eddie tells the Titans of multiple daily phone calls to Blue Devil as his way of confirming that \\"everything is fine\\".Teen Titans (vol. 3) #34 (May 2006) On a Titans mission, Eddie is disemboweled by Plasmus and the EMTs are unable to help him. The new Doom Patrol arrives and take Kid Devil to their HQ for treatment, where the Chief heals Eddie while also attempting to manipulate him into joining the Doom Patrol (as he has done to the other DP members). During the operation, the Chief revealed to Elasti-Girl that Kid Devil is not truly a demon by nature, but rather his powers are the result of metahuman gene manipulation. Robin calls Blue Devil, as he is on Kid Devil's emergency contact list, but finds that the number is out of order. Robin eventually tracks down Blue Devil and tells him the situation. Blue Devil tells Robin that he has not seen or spoken to Eddie in two years. When Robin confronts Eddie about his relationship with Blue Devil, Eddie confesses he was only pretending in order to better fit in with the Titans. The Chief's manipulation is stopped by both the Titans and the other members of the Doom Patrol, which makes Eddie feel as if he is finally accepted as a Titan since they stood up for him. He also tries rekindling his bond with Blue Devil, but the man does not show up to a meeting to which Eddie invited him. Later, Eddie finally finds and confronts Blue Devil. Blue Devil admits that he was to blame for his Aunt Marla's death and that it was an accident. As part of a deal with Neron for gaining fame and fortune, Blue Devil was asked to destroy an unmanned electrical power station. Despite Blue Devil's various precautions, a resulting power surge accidentally killed Marla, who was scouting the nearby area for a film. Eddie storms off before Blue Devil can explain further, telling Blue Devil to stay far away from him. Now having lost his trust in Blue Devil, Eddie knows that he will lose his soul to Neron. Still, Eddie decides to make the best of his remaining years by having a good time with his friends. He comforts himself by saying that, at least, he has Marla's memory and that Neron cannot take that away from him. However, it is revealed that Neron is holding Marla's soul captive.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #42 (February 2007) Kid Devil is attacked by Kid Crusader, who vows to \\"save\\" him from Neron by turning Eddie back into a human and killing him. Kid Crusader appears to succeed when he exorcizes the demon from Eddie and returns him to his human form, but the demon is now bound to Kid Crusader himself. When given the choice later to either return to his demonic form or stay human, Eddie chooses his demonic form, not wishing to damn anyone else (even his enemy) to his fate as Neron's prot√©g√©.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #43-44 (March-April 2007) Titans Tomorrow In Teen Titans #51 (vol. 3), the Titans Tomorrow (a possible future version of the current Titans team) arrive in the present to aid the Teen Titans against Starro-controlled villains. Kid Devil is shown as part of the team, now known as Red Devil. He claims that even though the loss of his soul to Neron at 20 was bad, the power he receives far outweighs the consequences. Eddie initially watches as Ravager battles alone against Rampage and Livewire, before betraying his older self in order to aid Rose. Later, Rose, Red Devil, and Eddie return to the Titan's Lair (home of the original Teen Titans), where they meet with Blue Beetle. There, Eddie learns that he is supposedly destined to murder the Blue Beetle some point in the future. Shortly after Eddie, Rose, and Jaime find themselves surrounded by an army of Titans led by Lex Luthor before they all battle against an invading army of Starros. Thanks in large part to Blue Beetle's powers and Robin and Wonder Girl managing to supposedly alter Robin's future (and thus alter the future of the Titans as a whole), the army of Titans is defeated. However, prior to his vanishing, Red Devil warns Eddie against trusting Blue Beetle. Terror Titans In Teen Titans (vol. 3) #56, a group of supervillains under the leadership of the new Clock King began a systematic assault on the Titans. With Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle, Ravager, and Robin away and Miss Martian still reeling from the battle with her future counterpart (whose mind is revealed to have taken refuge in Megan's), Eddie decides to throw a party in Titans Tower and invites several Titans fans. The party quickly gets out of hand when the guests trash the place, go through personal items, and prank call Batman. Lectured by all members of the team (except Miss Martian, who had left for the week to resolve her own problems), Eddie goes into town with one of the guests, who reveals himself to be Dreadbolt, the son of Bolt. A fight ensues and the arrival of the rest of the Terror Titans puts a quick end to the battle. In the aftermath, Kid Devil finds himself chained to a wall and severely injured, captive of the Clock King, who then begins shattering his self-confidence telling him that Rose Wilson could not care less about his status, encouraging him to accept his place as a monster. Brought to the Dark Side Club as a challenger, he is imprisoned in the same cell in which Miss Martian is later brought, who finds him reduced to a rampaging, savage monster due to his physical and mental ordeal. M'Gann tries unsuccessfully to undo the damage, but Eddie is brought to face Hardrock in a death match. Red Devil After the crisis with the Terror Titans is settled, Kid Devil is saved, and with the help of the Teen Titans, is able to rebuild his mental sanity while he is nursed back to health. Still trying to prove himself, he begins searching for Shockwave, who is rampaging apparently without a pattern throughout America, deliberately hiding from Robin his suspicions to avoid burdening the decimated Titans with an apparent wild goose chase. He is forced then to accept the unwilling cooperation of Blue Beetle, who, demonstrating to be a better detective than he and a more seasoned fighter despite his later induction into heroics, goes on alone. In a fit of anger spurred by his inability to come in and fight Shockwave, he finally unlocks the full might of his demonic powers, as demonstrated by his future counterpart, teleporting effortlessly from Salt Lake City to Denver and melting off Shockwave's exoskeleton with a touch. Kid Devil is able to resolve his jealousy issues about Ravager when he learns that Blue Beetle had no interest in her at all. He then honors his newfound maturity by taking the sobriquet of Red Devil. Jaime happily teases Eddie about his new costume, hinting that while in the Tomorrow history they were sworn enemies; at present, they have a budding friendship signified by Eddie giving Jaime the playful nickname \\"Bug-Butt\\" which Jaime reciprocates by calling him \\"Sizzle- Shorts\\". Around this time the events of Final Crisis happen, Eddie becomes one of the last few super-powered resistance members operating out of the time- tossed Justice League Watchtower. The Miracle Machine restores everything back to normal.Final Crisis #7 (2009) Unfortunately, soon after Blue Beetle joins the team, Miss Martian, with whom Eddie had become increasingly closer, has opted to leave the team due in large part to her being merged with her evil future self. Still, Eddie appears to have become more content with his life amongst the Titans and has become closer to Blue Beetle and his girlfriend Traci 13. During a Christmas trip to New York, Miss Martian appeared to him to wish him a Merry Christmas and promised that she would return soon. Soon after, the Titans began having a membership drive, with Red Devil teleporting to each potential hero so as to offer them membership. Unfortunately, none seem available or willing to join. The stress of multiple 'ports eventually causes Eddie to pass out on his return to the tower. On the night that follows, Robin opts to leave the team shortly before Brother Blood returns from Hell. During the battle against him, Blood manages to absorb the demonic power from Eddie, leaving him human again and supposedly free of Neron's debt. Powerless Eddie, now powerless, is offered by Kid Eternity a chance to travel to Hell and see his contract with Neron in an attempt to regain his powers. Learning that he had not signed the contract, he finds that Neron tapped into his metagene, which activated his demon-like powers. Blaze, having won the war in Hell, offers Eddie a new contract, with his demonic powers now irrevocable, but with the same price of servitude as Neron's contract. Kid Eternity intervenes and summons Eddie's Aunt Marla. Marla convinces Eddie not to take the contract.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #68 (March 2009) Eddie continues to be a member of the team, but his ability to help is unclear. To add insult to injury, Eddie is asked by new Titan recruit Static if he is the \\"team janitor\\" due to his lack of abilities.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #69 (April 2009) During the prelude to the Deathtrap crossover, Eddie dons his old mechanical costume to combat the Tower's defense mechanisms, which had been overridden by crazed former Titan Jericho.Teen Titans Annual #1 His way of helping, which Bombshell repeatedly makes fun of, is to be the eyes and ears for the Teen Titans when the new Fearsome Five reform under the Calculator. However, he is also seen as helping the team through communications and coordinating missions at Titans Tower. He later died saving the city from a radioactive man who was about to explode while the other Titans were putting down a prison riot. It appears that this was all part of the Calculator's plan to get revenge at the Titans for the previous death of his son Marvin and the injury of his daughter Wendy.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #74 (August 2009) The New 52 In The New 52, Eddie Bloomberg first appears as the godson to Blue Devil.DC Presents #12 Red Devil checked into Sanctuary and is among the heroes who were killed in an unexpected attack.Heroes in Crisis #3. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Kid Devil in his power suit from Blue Devil #14, artist Paris Cullins Originally, Eddie wore a devil suit which gave him enhanced strength and agility, near impenetrable armor, a weapons system that included a bright light burst effect, exploding bubbles, night vision, and mini-gills. He also had a rocket trident which could propel him through the air for distances of up to several miles and could emit flames and/or electric shocks. After the events of Infinite Crisis and 52, Eddie has a demonic appearance and inherent abilities, both granted to him by the demon-lord Neron. His new form gives him a capacity to breathe fire, enhanced strength and endurance, and an ability to heal from non-fatal wounds ten times faster than a human. When punched in the stomach, Eddie cannot control his fire breath. Eddie's blood is now a thick gasoline- smelling liquid, his breath is hotter than fire, his own skin is able to cause burns (being at 200 degrees) and he has been seen to be able to increase this, to the point of his skin turning white hot. He can fire streams of flame from his hands, has retractable wings underneath his arms that help him glide, possesses a prehensile tail, and his internal temperature is 600¬∞. He learned how to create portals of fire through which he can travel long distances. When Dr. Niles Caulder, leader of the Doom Patrol, tended Kid Devil's injury, he revealed that the young hero is not a demon nor are his powers supernatural in nature, despite being granted by a demon. Rather, Neron activated Eddie's metahuman gene which gave him his powers. However, due to his deal with Neron, his given demonic form causes his skin to burn while inside a sacred building such as a church. Eddie lost his powers due to an attack by the new Brother Blood, Sebastian, shortly before sacrificing himself to save the other Titans. Other versions=Chris King Chris King is quite literally the hero of a thousand faces. He is a user of the legendary H Dial who was part of a team with Vick Grant. Each time he goes into action, he has a new and completely different identity and powers, conjured up entirely at random in a pattern that never repeats itself, in one of the missions he used the name \\"Red Devil\\". He first appears in Legion of Super-Heroes Vol. 2 #272 (February 1981) and was created by Marv Wolfman and Carmine Infantino. He has also used the names Moth, Doomster, Wrangler, Volcano, Mister Thin, Dragonfly, Zeep, Steadfast, Avatar, Power Punch, Glassman, Trouble Clef, Puffball, X-Rayder, Kinetic Kid, Jimmy Gymnastic, Trailblazer, Any- Body, Earth-Man, Spheror, Music Master, Rock, Mister Opposite, Topsy-Turvy, Centaurus, Spectro, Hasty Pudding, Prism, Electrostatic, White, Brimstone, Stuntmaster, Radar Man, Shadow Master, Deflecto, Worm Man, Air Master, Sting, Attacker, Galaxy, Enlarger-Man and Ragnarok.

Flashpoint In the alternate universe of Flashpoint, Kid Devil is a member of the Resistance.Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons #3 (August 2011) Final Crisis A spacebound Blue Devil met a futuristic version of Edward who was saved from being erased from existence. Blue Devil also encountered a Nazi version of him. Tiny Titans Kid Devil appears in Tiny Titans as a toddler. Raven often has to babysit for him. Her father, Trigon, shows more of an interest in Kid Devil than in Raven when she does. He thinks of Kid Devil as \\"a cute little baby\\". Raven often tells Trigon that Kid Devil is not a baby, he is a little kid. However, Trigon does not listen and only babies Kid Devil more. Kid Devil does not speak in this series and relies solely on visual gags. In one issue, Kid Devil travels to the center of the Earth with Terra, Hotspot, and Beast Boy, and meets Etrigan.

In accordance with state and federal laws, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. Some Special Education services are provided by Westmoreland Intermediate Unit No. 7. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Yough School District received a $1,374,469 supplement for special education services in 2010. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 78 or 3.34% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy Yough School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required, by state law, to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools are mandated to send a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and to review their antibullying policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of the antibullying policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district reports employing over 170 teachers with a starting salary of $40,440 for 180 days for pupil instruction and 190 days total (7 inservice days and 3 clerical days). The average teacher salary was $52,507 while the superintendent's salary is $110,000. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. The Yough teachers work 7 hours 30 minutes per day with a 30-minute paid lunch period. Teachers receive daily preparation periods. Additionally, Yough School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, 3 paid personal days, 10 sick days and other benefits. Teachers in the Yough School District have one of the highest cost share contributions in the state for health care. Teachers are paid extra for certain duties, if they are required to work outside of the regular school day. When a teacher takes a sabbatical leave they are paid 50% of their salary and receive taxpayer paid benefits, and continue to pay their health care cost share. The union receives 12 days to conduct union business, in which the cost of those days are reimbursed to the district by the union. According to State Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees‚Äô Retirement System Board, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary, as so long as a total of five teachers are willing to retire at a time. Any less than five teachers cannot retire at a time, according to the current teachers contract. In 2007, the district employed 70 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $50,267 for 180 school days worked. Yough School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $699.74 per pupil. The district is ranked 319th out of 500 in Pennsylvania for administrative spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. Administrators in the Yough School District were granted a 4 percent pay increase for the 2010‚Äì11 school year. In 2008, Yough School District reported spending $18,008 per pupil. This ranked 23rd in the commonwealth. ; Reserves In 2009, the district reported $2,864,419 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as zero. In January 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. Pennsylvania school district local revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. State basic education funding For the 2010‚Äì11 budget year, the Yough School District was allotted a 7.40% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,282,464. This was the highest increase provided to a school district in Westmoreland County. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase, among all Pennsylvania school Districts, in 2010‚Äì11 was awarded to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The amount of increase each school district receives is set by the Governor and the Secretary of Education as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. In the 2009‚Äì2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 6.19% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $9,574,418. The state Basic Education funding to the Yough School District in 2008‚Äì09 was $9,016,004.71. The highest increase in Westmoreland County went to Southmoreland School District which received a 6.44% increase. Fourteen Westmoreland County school districts received an increase of less than 6% in 2009‚Äì10. Muhlenberg School District of Berks County received an increase of 22.31 percent. In Pennsylvania, sixteen school districts received an increase in funding of over 10 percent in 2009. In 2008, the administration reported that 853 students received a free or reduced-price lunch based on the federal poverty levels. =Accountability Block Grants= Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010‚Äì11 the district applied for and received $439,526 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The Yough School District uses the funding to provide increased instructional time, to provide all-day kindergarten for the 5th year, and to maintain low class size K-3rd grade. =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. Yough School District did not apply for funding in 2006‚Äì07 or 2007‚Äì08. In 2008‚Äì09, the district received $132,621. Federal Stimulus funding The district received an extra $1.7 million in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. Common Cents state initiative The Yough School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Real estate taxes Yough School Board set property tax rates in 2011 at 75.6000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 75.6000 mills. *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 75.6000 mills. *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 75.6000 mills. *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 71.8200 mills. =Act 1 Adjusted index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index and the adjusted index for each district are publicly announced by the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September each year. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010‚Äì11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Yough School District 2006‚Äì2007 through 2010‚Äì2011. 2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 5.4%, Base 3.9% 2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 4.7%, Base 3.4% 2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 6.1%, Base 4.4% 2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 5.7%, Base 4.1% 2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 4.0%, Base 2.9% 2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 2.0%, Base 1.4% For the 2011‚Äì12 school year the Yough School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Yough School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Yough School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index for the budget year 2010‚Äì2011. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. =Property tax relief= In 2011, property tax relief for 4902 approved residents of Yough School District was set at $157 for approved homesteads. In 2010, the relief was $157 for 4880 homesteads. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Yough School District was $158 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,856 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Westmoreland County, the highest tax relief went to New Kensington‚ÄìArnold School District at $302 in 2009 and $300 in 2010. The greatest tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the Chester Upland School District of Delaware County set at $632 in 2009 and $641 in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, 2010. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Westmoreland County, 62% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Enrollment and Consolidation The enrollment at Yough School District is among the lowest 12% in Pennsylvania. Department of Education enrollment projections anticipate a further decline in enrollment for the next decade. A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was 3000 pupils. Consolidation of administrations with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities. According to a 2009 proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improving high school student academic achievement, enriching the curriculum programs or to reducing local property taxes. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania Department of Education data shows that from 1999 to 2000 to 2008‚Äì09 there has been a 12 percent increase in public school staff even as there was a 1 percent decline in enrollment. Pennsylvania schools added 17,345 professional employees and 15,582 support workers over this time, while enrollment declined by 26,960. Total public school enrollment in 2009 was 1,787,351 pupils. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor.

The district provides a wide variety of clubs activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is set in school board policies. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Marcos.  Life  Dr. Marcos was born in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte to Mariano Rubio Marcos and Josefa Quetulio Edralin. Marcos, a graduate of the University of the Philippines College of Medicine and a member of the Mu Sigma Phi, was a President of the Philippine Medical Association. In 1971 he was appointed the first chair of the nine-member Philippine Medical Care Commission. This commission was tasked to provide medical insurance to poor Filipinos. The commission's program ran for almost a quarter of a century. He was chair for 12 years. In the 1970s, Marcos headed a defense fund which supported two Filipina nurses accused of killing 10 patients in the Ann Arbor Hospital Murders. He called their conviction a \\"miscarriage of justice\\". He owned, controlled, or had interests in 50 corporations, including a large car dealership, a sugar mill called Consolidate Sugar Corporation, a real estate firm called Citizens Development Inc, and Philippine Seed Inc. Marcos did not involve himself in politics, and distanced himself from his brother's regime when it grew unpopular during the 1980s. In a 1986 interview he said he was unaware of his brother's wealth. He did not join the Marcos family in Hawaii after the EDSA Revolution, and opted to stay in the Philippines in retirement. In 1998 Marcos was the subject of a lawsuit over an under- collateralized \\"behest loan\\" in the amount of ‚Ç±60 million which his company, Bagumbayan Corp, received from the Development Bank of the Philippines. It was one of a series of lawsuits over behest loans given to associates of President Marcos. The case was finally dismissed in 2007 by the Supreme Court, which said there was no evidence that the loan was given simply because Pacifico Marcos was a \\"crony\\" of the former president. His son, Mariano \\"Nonong\\" Marcos II, who became a provincial board member in Ilocos Norte, died on February 15, 2019.  Death  By 2017, news reports indicated that Fortuna Marcos-Barba, the youngest of the Marcos siblings, was the only member of that generation still alive. Reports from the February 2019 death of Pacifico's son Mariano Marcos II also reported that Pacifico had predeceased Mariano II.

Yellamma is the patron goddess of the Maharashtra and the south Indian states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Her devotees revere her as the \\"Mother of the Universe\\" or \\"Jagadamba\\". Origin story The legends of Renuka are contained in the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa and in the Bhagavata Purana.Goddess Renuka is known for her chastity.Once her husband Jamadagni felt thirsty and asked water to his wife but Renuka devi could not find water anywhere due to the drought so she with the help of her chastity went to kailash with her mortal body and asked Lord Shankara to give ganga to quench her husband thirst. Renuka Sagara, Malaprabha River, Saundatti. (Belgaum District), North Karnataka, Karnataka Early life King Re·πáu (father of Re·πáukƒÅ) performed a yajna -- a ritual performed to maintain peace and good health. He was blessed with a daughter, who originated from the fire of this yajna. Re·πáukƒÅ was a bright and active child and became the most beloved child of her parents. When she was eight, Agastya, who was the guru of king Re·πáu, advised him to have his daughter married to Jamadagni when she reached maturity. Jamadagni was the son of Ruchik Muni and Satyavati and had obtained the blessings of the gods by performing severe penance. Renuka and Jamdagni Muni lived in the Ramshrung mountains, near the present day Savadatti area of Belagavi district. Renuka helped the Jamdagni Muni in all of his tasks of performing various rituals and puja. Gradually she became close and dear to Jamdagni. After a while Renuka was blessed with another daughter called Anjana (Anjana Devi). Renuka would wake up early in the morning to bathe in the Malaprabha River with complete concentration and devotion. Her devotion was so powerful that she was able to create a pot to hold water made only of sand, one fresh pot every day. She would fill this pot, on the bank of the river and would use a snake which was nearby, turning it into a rope-like convolution and placing it on her head, so that it supported the pot. Thus, she brought the water to Jamdagni for his rituals of oblation. (\\"Renuka\\" is derived from the Sanskrit for \\"fine grain of sand\\".) Another temple of Renuka is situated at near Zamania, Ghazipur.. There is another temple in Tamilnadu near vellore (padaiveedu) where the goddess is in the form of suyambu ( the idol itself originated from the land). Later life Renuka gave birth to five sons: Vasu, Viswa Vasu, Brihudyanu, Brutwakanwa and Rambhadra. Rambhadra was the youngest and most beloved, gaining the favour of Lord Shiva and Parvati and hence called Parashurama (the sixth incarnation of Vishnu). One day when Renuka went to the pond, she saw Gandharva a heavenly being's reflection in the pond who was flying over the pond with his wife. She just thought that the gandrava is beautiful for a moment. she lost her concentration and devotion to her husband for a moment as she started thinking about another man. As she was distracted, she lost her power of collecting water in unbaked pots, which she had gotten from her chastity. She lost the water which she had collected. Disappointed by this, she returned to the ashram in worry.Jamadagni saw all these events through his yogic power. Jamadagni became furious and angrily ordered her to go away. After being cursed by her husband, Renuka went east and sat in the forest to meditate. In her penance, she met with the saints Eknath and Joginath; she prayed to them and asked to gain the mercy of her husband. They first consoled her, then instructed her to follow their advice exactly as told. They told her to purify herself, first bathing in a nearby lake, and then to worship a Shivalinga, which they had given to her. Next, she should go to the nearby town and beg for rice from the houses (this ritual, called \\"Joga Bedodu\\", is still carried out by women during a particular month in Karnataka/ \\"Jogawa\\" in marathi, \\"Yellamma Jogu\\" in Telangana). After collecting the rice, she was to give half to the saints and cook the remaining half, adding jaggery, partaking of the cooked rice with full devotion. They said that if she performed this ritual for three days, she would be able to visit her husband on the fourth day. Yellamma temple at Badami. Knowing the anger of Jamadagni, they warned her that she may not be fully pardoned by him, and that she would have to experience the most difficult time of her life for a few minutes. \\"After that,\\" they said, \\"you will be eternally revered and will be blessed with your husband. You will be worshiped by all the people henceforth.\\" After blessing her this way, they disappeared. Renuka followed their instructions with devotion and worshipped the Shivalinga with full care and reverence. On the fourth day, she went to see her husband. Punishment and resurrection Jamadagni was still furious with Renuka and ordered his elder four sons to kill Renuka Devi but all of them refuse to kill their mother. Jamadagni,cursed his four sons to become stone for disobeying his order. Jamadagni called his fifth son Parashurama who was meditating on Lord Shiva and ordered him to behead Renuka devi. Parashurama immediately obeyed his father's words and beheaded his mother with his axe. Though Parashurama is devoted to his mother he didn't wish to disrespect his father's words because father's words are superior than vedic mantras .Jamadangi was very much pleased by Parashurama's devotion towards him. Renuka temple at Yallammagudi, Saundatti (Belgaum District ). North Karnataka, Karnataka He then offered a boon to Parushurama, who asked for his mother and brothers to be brought back to life. To everybody's astonishment, Renuka's spirit multiplied and moved to different regions. Renuka was back as a whole too. This miracle inspired her sons and others to become her followers, and worship her. Renuka vs. Yellamma In many traditions, Renuka and Yellamma are taken to be two names for the same goddess. However, there is also an oral tradition that distinguishes between the two. According to these tales, Renuka fled to a fisherman community when her son Parushurama was coming to kill her.A woman belonging fishing community helped Renuka Devi and asked her to hide in her hut. Parashurama found and beheaded her, along with the woman who belongs to fishing community who had tried to protect Renuka Devi . When he later brought them back to life, he mistakenly attached the woman's head to Renuka's body, and vice versa. Jamadagni accepted the former as his wife Renuka, while the latter remained to be worshipped by all caste people as Yellamma, the mother of all. Matangi, Renuka, and Yellamma are all names of the Goddess. Temples and related places One of the famous temples of Renuka Yellamma Thalli is located at Balkampet in Hyderabad where every year in Ashadha month Yellamma Kalyanothsavam is celebrated with thousands of pilgrims performing special rituals to get the blessings of Renuka Yellamma Thalli. The idol of the goddess, interestingly, is 10 feet deeper than the ground level. There is also a well in the Balkampet Yellamma temple complex and some devotees believe that the water in the well heals all ills. Therefore, a bath here is supposed to purify you of all disorders and skin diseases. This holy water is called ‚ÄòTheertham‚Äô. An Akhand_Jyoti is also present in the temple that was lit during the renovation. In fact, Nita_Ambani wife of India's richest person Mukesh_Ambani visits the temple whenever she is in Hyderabad to express her faith in the deity. Every year, there is a gathering of as many as 200,000 of her devotees at the Yellamma Gudi temple (Yallamma Temple) in Saundatti. Two other Very famous Temple of Renuka Yellamma is located in Bidarahalli, Gadag, and chandragutti, shivmoga, Karnataka, India . Many devotees from different region come to temple in the month of kartik to celebrate Karthik of Renuka- Yellamma.

With complete concentration and devotion to fill the pot, which she used to prepare out of the sand on the bank the river and would hold the snake which was there and turn it into a convolution and place it on head so that it supported to the pot. She bought the pot to Jamdagni for performance of rituals. Another temple Renukambe [Yellamma] is atop a hill in Chandragutti, Soraba Taluk in Shimoga. This temple is an example of ancient architecture and dates back to the Kadamba period. Another temple is in Mahur, Maharashtra, the supposed birthplace of the goddess, which finds mention in Devi Gita, the final chapter of Devi Bhagawatam as, \\"Matripura in the Sahyadri mountain; here the Devi Renuka dwells ...\\". One of the temple of Renuka Devi is Chandwad in Nasik. The temple was constructed by her highness Maharani Ahilya Devi Holkar of Indore There is a great place of pilgrimage named Kolhapura in the southern country. Here the Devi Laksmi always dwells.

Renuka Lake in Himachal Pradesh Renuka Lake in the Renuka Sanctuary in Himachal Pradesh is named after the goddess. According to one legend, King Sahasrarjuna (Kartavirya Arjuna) wanted the Kamadhenu cow from Jamadagni and Renuka. So for this he killed Jamadagni, and Renuka became sati along with Jamadagni at Mahurgadh, Maharashtra. Another famous temple for Renukambal is situated in Serampattu Village near Cheyyar in Tiruvannamalai district. Thousands of people gather here during Pongal festival. Another powerful temple of Renuka Parameshwari is located in Tiruchampalli near Sembanarkoil in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu.

Ragupathi Naicken Palayam can be reached from Erode - Poondurai Road as well as Erode - Vellode Road. Although it is unclear when the temple was constructed, it is understood from the inscription placed at the temple that the temple was renovated by Late Mr. Duraisamy Naicker in 1923. He is said to belong to community of Banajiga (or Balija) of Lingayat Society which has origin in Karnataka, but settled in Tamilnadu in 19th century. The temple is maintained by people of the Banajiga community now. Maha Shivarathiri in the month of Maasi and Full Moon day of Karthigai are celebrated by the Banajigas in this temple.

It stands near the tomb of Gwanggaeto in the city of Ji'an along the Yalu River in Jilin Province, Northeast China, which was the capital of Goguryeo at that time. It is carved out of a single mass of granite, stands nearly seven meters tall and has a girth of almost four meters. The inscription is written exclusively in Classical Chinese. The stele is one of the major primary sources for the history of Goguryeo, and supplies invaluable historical detail on Gwanggaeto's reign as well as insights into Goguryeo mythology. It has also become a focal point of national rivalries in East Asia manifested in the interpretations of the stele's inscription and the place of Goguryeo in modern historical narratives. An exact replica of the Gwanggaeto Stele stands on the grounds of War Memorial of SeoulGwanggaeto Stele in Seoul and the rubbed copies made in 1881 and 1883 are in the custody of China and Japan.Pyong-son Pak, „ÄäKorean printing:from its origins to 1910„Äã, Jimoondang, 2003. p.68 Rediscovery The Gwanggaeto Stele stands at nearly 7 meters. (Sept. 2001) The stele's location, in Ji'an in the northeastern Chinese province of Jilin,Injae, Lee; Miller, Owen; Park Jinhoon; Yi Huyn-hae (2014), Korean History in Maps, Cambridge University Press, p. 49, was key to its long neglect. Following the fall of Goguryeo in 668, and to a lesser extent the fall of its successor state Balhae in 926, the region drifted outside the sway of both Chinese and Korean geopolitics.Yi, Hyonhui; Pak, Songsu; Yun, Naehyon (2005), New History of Korea, Jimoondang, p.247, . Afterwards the region came under the control of numerous Manchurian states, notably the Jurchen and from the 16th century the Manchu.Minahan, James B. (2014), Ethnic Groups of North, East and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, p. 193, . When the Manchu conquered China in 1644 and established the Qing dynasty, they instituted a \\"closure policy\\" (fengjin Â∞ÅÁ¶Å) that blocked entry into a vast area in Manchuria north of the Yalu River, including the stele's site. This seclusion came to an end in the latter half of the 19th century, when the region was opened up for resettlement. In 1876, the Qing government established the Huairen County (now Huanren Manchu Autonomous County) to govern the area. New settlers into the region around Ji'an began making use of the many bricks and baked tiles that could be found in the region to build new dwellings. The curious inscriptions on some of these tiles soon reached the ears of Chinese scholars and epigraphers. A few tiles were found inscribed \\"May the mausoleum of the Great King be secure like a mountain and firm like a peak\\". It was around 1876 that a local Chinese official named Guan Yueshan, who also dabbled as an amateur epigrapher, began collecting such tiles and discovered the mammoth stone stele of Gwanggaeto obscured under centuries of mud and overgrowth. The discovery soon attracted the attention Chinese, Korean and Japanese scholars, the third often supplemented by Japanese spies travelling incognito to spy the region's fortifications and natural layout, prescient of a future of increased international rivalry. Initially only rubbings of sporadic individual letters could be made, due to the overgrowth. In order to uncover the entire inscription, the county magistrate in 1882 ordered the vegetation to be burnt off, causing damage to the stele's surface. Almost every inch of the stele's four sides were found to be covered with Chinese characters (nearly 1800 in total), each about the size of a grown man's hand. But rubbed copies could not initially be made due to the irregular surface and other factors, so that the early batch of copied inscriptions were actually \\"tracings\\" rather than \\"rubbings\\". In 1883 a young Japanese officer named (or \\"Sakao Kagenobu\\") traveling disguised as a civilian kanpo (Chinese medicine) herbalist while gathering intelligence in Manchuria. While in Liaoning he apparently heard of the stele's recent discovery, traveled to Ji'an sometime during April ~ July 1883, and procured a \\"tracing\\" of the stele's inscriptions to carry back to his homeland.; citing Chinese Geography, \\"Manchuria section\\" („ÄéÊîØÈÇ£Âú∞Ë™å„Äè„ÄåÊ∫ÄÂ∑û‰πãÈÉ®„Äç) compiled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. The inscription drew significant attention from Japanese scholarship after the advent of this copy. Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office invited leading sinologists and historians to decode the text, later publishing their findings in Kaiyoroku ÊúÉÈ§òÈå≤, volume 5 (1889). The first authentic rubbings of the full inscriptions were not made until 1887 according to one researcher. It was after the authentic \\"rubbings\\" (rather than \\"tracings\\") became available that Chinese scholars started studying the earnest, and the first scholarly paper produced by the Chinese was Wang Chih-hsiu (ÁéãÂøó‰øÆ; Wang Zhixiu), Kao-ch√º-li Yung-lo t'ai-wang ku pei k'ao (È´òÂè•È∫óÊ∞∏Ê®ÇÂ§™ÁéãÂè§Á¢ëÊî∑ 1895). And Korea was not aware of the monument until Kaiyoroku was published in 1889. Thus, the Japanese scholars were the ones to make the first detailed analysis of the stele's ancient text. The inscription A rubbing of the Gwanggaeto Stele The part of sinmyo passage of the Stele There is some discrepancy with regards to the number of inscribed characters. Some sources state that the stele has 1,802 characters, while others say it has 1,775. The inscribed text can be grouped by content into three parts. 1) Foundation myth of the Goguryeo kingdom; 2) the military exploits of King Gwanggaeto; and 3) personal record of the custodians of monarch's grave. The first part details the legend of the Goguryeo's founder and his lineage while the second outlined Gwanggaeto's martial accomplishments, beginning with the conquest of Paeryo () in 395. The record of the king's conquest was outlined in the form of a list of the castles he occupied and the surrender of the states conquered such as Paekche's in 396. The stele identified a total of seven conquests, which were corroborated by the historical accounts found in the Samguk sagi, or the Historical Records of the Three Kingdoms. Finally, the last part contains the list of custodians called Sumyoin, who were appointed to oversee the king's tomb. Foundation myth The inscription thus traces lineage from the legendary founder of the kingdom to the King who is memorialized by the stele. > Note: Text written in italics in brackets has been reconstructed from glyphs > chipped or eroded on the stone monument. Of old, when our first Ancestor > King Ch'umo laid the foundations of our state, he came forth from Northern > Buyeo as the son of the Celestial Emperor.

Chronology of Gwanggaeto Wars The stele records entire battles of Gwanggaeto's reign and his triumphs. Much of the battles deals with the Wa aggression. The king of Goguryeo is here seen assisting Silla when it was invaded by the Wa (conventionally the \\"Japanese,\\" an interpretation that is subject to debate), and punishing Baekje for allying with the Wa. *Year 395 (): **The King led troops to defeat the tribe ( believed to be a Khitan tribe) and acquired their livestock. He inspected the state and returned in triumph. *Year 396 (Yongnak 6): **This year, the King led troops and conquered many Baekje castles. As the troop reached the capital, the Baekje king paid reparations in and swore to be a subject of Goguryeo, paying male and female captives and a thousand bolts of cloth in reparation. Gwanggaetto returned home with a Baekje prince and nobles as hostage. *Year 398 (Yongnak 8): **Assigned troops to conquer the Poshen () (presumably a tribe of the Sushen people) to capture 300 people. Since then, they have sent tribute to Goguryeo. *Year 399 (Yongnak 9): **Baekje broke previous promise and allied with Wa. Gwanggaeto advanced to Pyongyang. There he saw Silla's messenger who told him that Wa's troops were crossing the border for invasion, and asked Goguryeo for help. As Silla swore to be Goguryeo's subject, the King agreed to save them. *Year 400 (Yongnak 10): **The King sent 50,000 troops to save Silla. Wa's troops retreated just before the Goguryeo troops reached to Silla capital. They chased Wa's forces to a castle in Imna Gaya (Mimana). The Japanese troops in the castle soon surrendered. **(Following many disappeared letters; Some traceable letters include \\"Alla soldiers in defense (ÂÆâÁæÖ‰∫∫ÊàçÂÖµ)\\", \\"Wa (ÂÄ≠)\\", and \\"collapse (ÊΩ∞)\\", and likely to be records of further battles against Gaya and Wa, but no details are available.) *Year 404 (Yongnak 14): **Wa unexpectedly invaded southern border at Daifang. The King led troops from Pyongyang to prevail. Wa troops collapsed with enormous casualties. *Year 407 (Yongnak 17): **The King sent 50,000 troops, both foot soldiers and mounted, and battled (the inscription that mention the opponent state is marred). *Year 410 (Yongnak 20): **Eastern Buyeo () ceased tribute to Goguryeo. The King led troops to conquer them. Eastern Buyeo was surprised (and surrendered. Some characters are also scratched out in this passage). As they submitted to the King's kindness, there was also a noble who followed the King to Goguryeo. The inscription states that since the \\"sinmyo\\" year (391 AD), the Wa had been crossing the sea into Korea. The passage continues by saying that \\"it\\" subjugated the two kingdoms Baekche and Silla. Japanese scholarship generally consider that Wa is the subjugators being referred to here. However, Korean scholarship generally disagree, and render this portion as Gokuryeo's claims to the two kingdoms as \\"our subject peoples\\". Some scholars also posit that \\"Wa\\" here does not refer to the \\"Japanese\\" people in the conventional sense at all. (For further information on the \\"sinmyo passage\\" controversy, see section below) Debate over an ancient message It soon became clear that the stele was dedicated to king Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo, who reigned 391‚Äì413 CE It also became clear the stele was raised as a grand memorial epitaph to the celebrated monarch, whose empty tomb indeed lay nearby. Though historians and epigraphers still grapple with the interpretation of portions of the text, the inscription's general layout is clear. One face provides a retelling of the foundation legend of Goguryeo. Another provides terms for the maintenance of Gwanggaeto's tomb in perpetuity. It is the rest of the inscription, which provides a synopsis of Gwanggaeto's reign and his numerous martial accomplishments (see section above) that is rife with the most controversy. The most controversial portion of the stele's narrative has come to be known simply as the \\"sinmyo passage\\". The sinmyo passage as far as it is definitively legible reads thus (with highly defaced or unreadable characters designated by an X): :ËÄå ÂÄ≠ ‰ª• Ëæõ ÂçØ Âπ¥ ‰æÜ Ê∏° Êµ∑ Á†¥ Áôæ ÊÆò X X [XÊñ§ (Êñ∞)] ÁæÖ ‰ª• Áà≤ Ëá£ Ê∞ë Interpretation Disagreement in the \\"sinmyo passage\\" of year 391 is whether it states that the Goguryeo subjugated Baekje and Silla, as Korean scholars maintain, or whether it states that Wa had at one time subjugated Baekje and Silla, as Japanese scholars have traditionally interpreted. The Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, which learned about the stele and obtained a rubbed copy from its member Kageaki Sak≈ç in 1884, became intrigued over a passage describing the king's military campaigns for the sinmyo ËæõÂçØ year of 391 (sinmyo being a year designator in the sexagenary cycle that characterizes the traditional Sino- oriented East Asian calendar). Some officers in the Japanese army and navy conducted research during the 1880s and the rubbed copy was later published in 1889. Most Japanese scholars, notably Masatomo Suga, interpreted the passage as follows (brackets designating a \\"reading into\\" the text where the character is not legible): : They presumed that Wa referred to a centralized Japanese government at the time that controlled the entire western part of Japan. In the 1910s and 20s, Torii Ry≈´z≈ç and other Japanese scholars traveled to Ji'an and observed the stele close hand. They found that the inscription had been repaired by clay and lime, and therefore questioned the credibility of the rubbed copy. The first Korean scholarly study challenging the Japanese interpretation was published by in 1955. He supposed that the subjects of the sentence Ê∏°Êµ∑Á†¥ and ‰ª•Áà≤Ëá£Ê∞ë were respectively Goguryeo and Baekje. By Ch≈èng's interpretation the entire passage read as follows: : In 1959 the Japanese scholar Teijiro Mizutani published another important study.Â•ΩÂ§™ÁéãÁ¢ëËÄÉ, Êõ∏ÂìÅ, vol.100, 1959 He had acquired rubbed copies made before the repair of the stele and concluded that Sak≈ç's copy had not been made by the rubbing method but rather had been traced, a method known in China as shuanggou tianmo (ÂèåÈâ§Â°°Â¢®). The North Korean scholar Kim reported his conclusions in a 1963 article.ÈáëÈå´‰∫®, ‰∏âÈüì‰∏âÂúãÏùò Êó•Êú¨ÂàóÂ≥∂ÂàÜÂúãÎì§Ïóê ÎåÄÌïòÏó¨, Ê≠∑Âè≤ÁßëÂ≠∏, Á¨¨1Ëôül, 1963 He had studied the Japanese chronicles Kojiki and Nihonshoki, and concluded that Wa referred to colonies of Samhan in Japan. He claimed that these colonies were established by Korean immigrants and was centered in Ky≈´sh≈´, Kinai, Izumo. Later, according to Kim, the colonies were absorbed by Yamato polity, which was also founded by Koreans. He also posited that the subject of ‰æÜÊ∏°Êµ∑Á†¥ÁôæÊÆò was Goguryeo, and ÁôæÊÆò was not the Baekje kingdom but Baekje's colony in Japan. Other North Korean scholar also argued for Goguryeo's invasion of Japan.Â∫ÉÈñãÂúüÁéãÈôµÁ¢ë, ÊúùÈÆÆÁ§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 1966 Many Korean scholars reject the interpretation that Japan () conquered () Baekje and Silla. It is difficult to tell when sentences begin or end because of the absence of punctuation and the necessity of reading into the text via context. Furthermore, the subjects Baekje and Silla are not recognizably mentioned in the passage; only the first character for \\"Baekje\\" () is noted, and even the supposed first character of Silla is not complete (only Êñ§ as opposed to Êñ∞). Furthermore, the character \\"jan\\" () was a character used derogatively by Goguryeo in place of the character \\"jae\\" () in Baekje's official name (this may have denoted wishful thinking on the part of Goguryeo that another nation came and conquered Baekje). Thus, when taking into consideration the major absence of characters and lack of punctuation, the passage reads: : However, further analysis of the passage is that Goguryeo, not Japan, crossed the sea and defeated Baekje or Wa. In the case of this interpretation, and the abbreviation of King Gwanggaeto's title in the passage, the passage states: : Some point out several facts that put in doubt the traditional Japanese interpretation of the sinmyo passage. Firstly, the term Wa at the time the stele was made did not solely refer to people from Japan but could also refer to the people from southern Korean, particularly from the Gaya Confederacy. Conspiracy theories In 1972 the Zainichi Korean scholar Lee Jin-hui (Yi Jin-hui; romaji: Ri Jinhi) reported the most controversial theory of the interpretation. He claimed the stele had been intentionally damaged by the Japanese Army in the 20th century to justify the Japanese invasion of Korea. According to his books, Sak≈ç altered the copy and later the Japanese General Staff thrice sent a team to make the falsification of the stele with lime. In 1981, the Korean Lee Hyung-gu began putting forth the argument, based on the irregularity of the Chinese character style and grammar, that the sinmyo passage was altered so as Âæå read ÂÄ≠, and ‰∏çË≤¢Âõ†Á†¥ read ‰æÜÊ∏°Êµ∑Á†¥. Thus, the subject of the sinmyo passage becomes Goguryeo.Êùé‰∫´Ê±Ç, Â∫ÉÈñãÂúüÁéãÈôµÁ¢ëÊñ∞Á†îÁ©∂, ÂêåÂíåÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 1986 Geng Tie-Hua questioned another character, claiming ÊØé was altered to Êµ∑.ËÄøÈâÑËèØ Â•ΩÂ§™ÁéãÁ¢ë<ËæõÂçØÂπ¥>Âè•ËÄÉÈáà, ËÄÉÂè§„Å®ÊñáÁâ©, 1992 Chinese scholars participated in studies of the stele from the 1980s.

He considered ÂÄ≠ (\\"Wa\\") word meaning is not a country but a pirate group, and he also denied Japan dominated the southern part of Korea.Â•ΩÂ§™ÁéãÁ¢ëÁ†îÁ©∂, ÁéãÂÅ•Áæ§, 1984, ÂêâÊûó‰∫∫Ê∞ëEnCyber encyclopedia 1984ÎÖÑÏóêÎäî Ï§ëÍµ≠Ïùò ÏôïÏ††Ï∑¨[ÁéãÂª∫Áæ§]Ïù¥ Ïû•Í∏∞Í∞ÑÏùò Ïã§ÏßÄÏ°∞ÏÇ¨Î•º ÌÜ†ÎåÄÎ°ú „ÄéÌò∏ÌÉúÏôïÎπÑÏó∞Íµ¨(Â•ΩÂ§™ÁéãÁ¢ëÁ°èÁ©∂)„ÄèÎ•º Î∞úÌëúÌñàÎäîÎç∞, Í∑∏Îäî Ïù¥Ï†úÍπåÏßÄ ÏûòÎ™ª ÏùΩÏùÄ Î∂ÄÎ∂ÑÏùÄ ÏãúÏ†ïÌïòÍ≥† ÌÉàÎùΩÎêú Î¨∏ÏûêÎ•º Î≥µÏõêÌñàÎã§Í≥† Ï£ºÏû•ÌïòÍ≥†, ÎπÑÎ¨∏Ïùò Ï¥ù Í∏ÄÏûêÎ•º 1,775ÏûêÎ°ú ÌôïÏ†ïÌñàÎã§.

Relations to other chronicles and archaeological records In refuting the interpretation that Wa conquered Baekje and Silla, some Korean scholars alleges that it is unreasonable that a monument honoring the triumphs of a Goguryeo king singles out a Japanese (\\"Wa\\") victory as worthy of mention on the stele (if one follows the Japanese interpretation). Generally, Japanese scholars points out that the rhetoric of inscription describes Gwanggaeto's battle as \\"overcoming the trying situation\\". Yukio Takeda claims that \\"Wa's invasion\\" was used as such situation when describing battles against Baekje. Some Japanese scholars also propose that Wa's power was more or less exaggerated by Goguryeo to illustrate the triumph of the King, and the sinmyo passage does not necessarily prove the power of Wa in Korean peninsula of the late 4th century. On the other hand, they generally reject the Korean interpretation because the stele says Baekje was previously a state subservient to Goguryeo before the simmyo passage and that recording the conquest into Baekje would result tautology in this section of the stele. Further, the Korean interpretation arbitrarily interject Goguryeo as the subject that conquered Baekje and Silla, which is also inconsistent with the preceding phrase \\"crossed the sea.\\" However, Korean scholars generally refute this claim by pointing to ancient records (chiefly the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa), which make clear that before King Gwanggaeto, Baekje held out well against its northern neighbor. Therefore, the statement in the stele that claims Baekje was a Goguryeo subject before the sinmyo passage would be propaganda on the part of Goguryeo; thus the conquest of Baekje would not be redundant.

Looney Tunes series of cartoons. He is a hound dog who is characterized by his below-average intelligence and overall gullibility. History Willoughby first appeared in the 1940 cartoon Of Fox and Hounds. He was created and voiced by Tex Avery. According to Chuck Jones, the character was based on Lennie, from Of Mice and Men (of which the title of Of Fox and Hounds is a knockoff). Critic Steven Hartley described this short as lacking in creativity, originality, excitement, and story construction, particularly compared to Avery's seminal earlier work A Wild Hare. Willoughby later appears in other Warner Brothers animated shorts, including The Heckling Hare (1941), The Crackpot Quail (1941), and Nutty News (1942), as the lead dog of a fox hunting party. A fundamentally similar character, Laramore, appears in To Duck or Not to Duck (1943), albeit with a fully brown coat of fur.

During the late 1990s and through the entire 2000's, both programs were a dominating presence in WESCO and a staple at the state tournament. The girls have two 3A state titles to their credit, winning in 2000 and 2004, as well as being runners up in 1994 and 1999. All four state championship appearances came under head coach Karen Blair, who was inducted into the Snohomish County Sports Hall of Fame in 2013.Snohomish_County_Sports_Hall_of_Fame_Award_Winners_2015 Before never making the state tournament in program history, the Lady Chiefs/Mavs made the state tournament 16 times in a 17-year span (from 92-93 until 08-09), and placed at state (top 8) 13 times.

Meadowdale has a feeder program that develops 5th through 8th grade basketball players who will eventually attend the high school. The program describes itself as teaching the \\"Meadowdale Way\\" to boys and girls long before they reach high school. Wrestling When the Mavericks were known as the Chiefs, they won 3 individual state titles and also had a 6th-place finisher on their way to a team state title in the 83-84 season.

The settlement owes its existence to a deep inlet into which the small Mutamba River flows. Two protective sandy headlands protect the harbor and form a sandbank. The sister town of Maxixe is located across the bay of Inhambane. History A Francisco de Almeida ship Inhambane is one of the oldest settlements on Mozambique's eastern coast. Dhows traded here as early as the 11th century. Muslim and Persian traders were the first outsiders to arrive to the area by sea and traded pearls and ambergris, and they also traded at Chibuene in the south. The area became well known for its local cotton spinning and production by the Tonga tribe. Sometime before the Portuguese reached the area, the Karanga had invaded Inhambane and formed a number of local chieftains. They dominated over the Tonga cotton workers and the rewards of trading with the Muslims went to them.Newitt, M., (1995),A History of Mozambique , p.161, C. Hurst & Co, Retrieved on June 15, 2008 When Vasco da Gama rounded Africa in the late 15th century, he pulled into Inhambane to replenish stocks and to explore. He took an immediate liking to the area and named it Terra de Boa Gente or 'Land of the Good People'. In 1505, a ship sent by Francisco de Almeida was shipwrecked south of the town, but the Portuguese gained an initial meeting with the Karanga chiefs. Later, their sons landed on Mozambique Island to survey the situation. The Portuguese eventually established a permanent trading post at settlement in 1534.Mozambique Connection , Retrieved on June 15, 2008 Inhambane was then chosen as the first Jesuit mission to Southeast Africa in 1560. The port gradually grew as an ivory and slave trading centre, particularly in the eighteenth century under mostly Indian control. It was destroyed in 1834 by Soshangane, but grew rapidly in the second half of the century as a town of Portuguese East Africa. The old cathedral and old mosque was built during that period. However, in the 20th century the status of the town declined and the economic situation worsened as Maputo (called Louren√ßo Marques before 1975) became the main centre.

Merrie Melodies directed by Friz Freleng. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc and June Foray (uncredited). The short was released on May 16, 1957, and stars Tweety and Sylvester the Cat. The short is the third Warner Bros. cartoon based on Jack and the Beanstalk. Plot The story begins with a farm mother scolding Jack for trading his cow for five seemingly worthless beans. The beans are thrown out a window and land under Sylvester's cat bed while the lazy cat is taking a \\"catnap\\". Instantly, the beans sprout into a giant beanstalk that reaches into the heavens, taking the still-sleeping Sylvester with it. The puddy tat awakens and is startled at how everything seemingly grew overnight. Eventually, he walks inside a castle and instantly spots a giant birdcage (with a giant Tweety singing inside). Sylvester opens the cage and chases what he says are \\"acres and acres of Tweety Bird\\", and Tweety responds, \\"I tawt I taw an itty bitty puddy tat.\\". However, Tweety's owner comes into the room; after Sylvester hides, the giant puts Tweety back in his cage and hangs it on a high ceiling; that way, he will not get into any mischief while he is gone. Sylvester makes several attempts to get at Tweety, having to overcome both the cage being on the ceiling and dodging a giant bulldog who is trying to chase the cat away. Each of Sylvester's attempts to get the bird ends unsuccessfully; several times, he is barely able to get away from the bulldog. At one point, he encounters a real giant mouse, only to have both of them get scared of each other and run away in opposite directions. Eventually, Sylvester's last attempt proves to be successful, but before he can make a clean getaway with Tweety, the giant returns and, sensing an intruder in his home, remarks (with a combination of his line and Tweety's) \\"Fee, fi, fo, fat! I tawt I taw a puddy tat!\\" Sylvester flees the castle without Tweety and scurries down the beanstalk with the giant in chase. Sylvester manages to reach the ground and chops down the beanstalk with an axe. The giant falls to the ground very noisily, the impact crushing Sylvester and everything in sight being wrecked. This causes him to be hurled through the Earth to China, where he meets with a stereotypical Chinese Tweety, who remarks (in a Chinese accent) his English counterpart's signature lines (\\"Oh, I tawt I taw dishonorable puddy tat.\\") in addition to speaking mock Chinese.

The organisation opposed compulsory vaccination, particularly against smallpox. It was part of a wider anti- vaccinationist movement, arguing that vaccination did more harm than good. Early history and formation of the league In June 1867, the publication \\"Human Nature\\" campaigned against \\"The Vaccination Humbug\\". It reported that many petitions had been presented to Parliament against Compulsory Vaccination, and many from parents who alleged that their children had died through the operation, and complained that these petitions had not been made public. The journal reported the formation of an Anti- Compulsory Vaccination League \\"To overthrow this huge piece of physiological absurdity and medical tyranny, and quoted Richard Gibbs, who ran the Free Hospital at the same address as stating \\"I believe we have hundreds of cases here, from being poisoned with vaccination, I deem incurable. One member of a family dating syphilitic symptoms from the time of vaccination, when all the other members of the family have been clear. We strongly advise parents to go to prison, rather than submit to have their helpless offspring inoculated with scrofula, syphilis, and mania.\\" After the death of Richard B. Gibbs in 1871, the Anti- Compulsory Vaccination League underwent various changes until 1876 when it was revived under the leadership of Mary Hume-Rothery and the Rev. W. Hume- Rothery. In 1880 the movement was enlarged and reorganised by the formation of \\"The London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination,\\" and an office was opened in Victoria Street, Westminster, with William Young as secretary. The \\"Vaccination Inquirer\\", established by William Tebb in 1879, was adopted as the organ of the Society. A series of fourteen \\"Vaccination Tracts\\" was begun by Young in 1877 and completed by Garth Wilkinson in 1879. The movement grew, and as the influence of the London Society overshadowed the Hume-Rotherys and it took the national lead, it was decided in February 1896 to re-form the Society as \\"The National Anti-Vaccination League.\\" In 1898 the league took on a school leaver named Lily Loat. By 1909 she was elected as the league's Secretary. The 1900 Labour Party General Election Manifesto contained a commitment to \\"No Compulsory Vaccination\\". Lily Loat devoted her life to the cause and died still working for the league in 1958. The league's journal ceased to create new issues in 1972.

Polygonal rifling ( ) is a type of gun barrel rifling where the traditional sharp-edged \\"lands and grooves\\" are replaced by less pronounced \\"hills and valleys\\", so the barrel bore has a polygonal (usually hexagonal or octagonal) cross-sectional profile. In more modern designs, the Italian firearm manufacturer Sabatti S.P.A. published a press release on September 7, 2017, describing a special type of uncornered polygonal rifling with rounded valleys, dubbed multi-radial rifling. Polygonal riflings with a larger number of edges have shallower corners, which provide a better gas seal in relatively large diameter bores. For instance, in the pre-Gen 5 Glock pistols, octagonal rifling is used in the large diameter .45 ACP bore, which has an 11.23 mm (0.442 in) diameter, since it resembles a circle more closely than the hexagonal rifling used in smaller diameter bores.Barrel History History While polygonal rifling has been around since the earliest days of rifled barrels, it had faded out of use by the time of the early cordite cartridges, mainly due to production issues and poor tolerance towards the newer, more erosive smokeless powder ammunition at the time. The principle of the polygonal barrel was proposed in 1853 by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer and entrepreneur. Whitworth experimented with cannons using twisted hexagonal barrels instead of traditional round rifled barrels, and patented the design in 1854. In 1856, this concept was demonstrated in a series of experiments using brass howitzers. The British military, however, rejected Whitworth's polygonal designs. Afterwards, Whitworth adopted the concept on small arms, believing that polygonal rifling could be used to create a more accurate rifled musket to replace the Pattern 1853 Enfield. During the American Civil War, Whitworth's polygonally rifled Whitworth rifle was successfully used by the Confederate States Army marksmen (known as the Whitworth Sharpshooters) to terrorize Union Army artillery crews. The muzzle- loading Whitworth rifle is often called the \\"sharpshooter\\" because of its superior accuracy compared to other rifled muskets of its era (far surpassing the breechloading Sharps rifle used by the Union Army), and is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle. The Whitworth Sharpshooters killed multiple high-ranking Union officers, most famously Maj Gen. John Sedgwick, who was fatally shot at a range of during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. The last service rifles to use polygonal rifling were the British Lee‚ÄìMetford rifle, named after its proprietary Metford rifling; and the Japanese Arisaka rifles designed by Col. Arisaka and Col. Nambu. The Lee- Metford rifle turned out to be a failure after the switch to the erosive Cordite proved too much for the smooth and shallow Metford rifling, which had been designed to reduce barrel fouling for black powder ammunition. When the Metford rifling design was dropped, the Lee‚ÄìMetford became the Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle in favour of Enfield type rifling, which was deep-grooved for longer service life. On the other hand, the Arisakas were manufactured extensively for the Imperial Japanese Army from 1897 to 1945 with no excessive rifling erosion problems, as the Japanese having adopted a better, non-erosive rifle powder. During World War II, polygonal rifling emerged again in the German MG 42 general-purpose machine guns, as an outgrowth of a cold-hammer forging process developed by German engineers prior to the outbreak of the war. The process addressed the need to produce large quantities of more durable gun barrels in less time than those produced with traditional methods,Barrels and Bullets: Conventional Versus Polygonal Rifling by Dennis Cantrell 06/08/2010 as the MG 42's infamously fast rate of fire tended to overheat the barrel quickly and thus warranted frequent barrel changes. The MG 42 successor, the Rheinmetall MG 3 machine gun, can also have polygonal rifling. Heckler & Koch was the first manufacturer to begin using polygonal rifling in modern small arms like the G3A3 battle rifle and several semi automatic hunting rifles like the HK SL7.SL7 Polygonlauf, Vielfl√§chenlauf by Lutz M√∂ller (German) Companies that utilize this method today include Tanfoglio, Heckler & Koch, Glock (Gen 1-4), Magnum Research, ƒåesk√° Zbrojovka, Kahr Arms, Walther and Israel Weapon Industries. Polygonal rifling is usually found only in pistol barrels, and is less common in rifles; however, some extremely high end precision rifles like the Heckler & Koch PSG1 and its Pakistani variant PSR-90, and the LaRue Tactical Stealth System sniper rifle use polygonal bores. The term \\"polygonal rifling\\" is fairly general, and different manufacturers employ varying polygonal rifling profiles. H&K;, CZ and Glock use a female type of polygonal rifling similar to the bore shown above right. This type has a smaller bore area than the male type of polygonal rifling designed and used by Lothar Walther. Other companies such as Noveske (Pac Nor) and LWRC use a rifling more like the conventional rifling, with both of each land's sides being sloped but having a flat top and defined corners; this type of rifling is more a canted land type of rifling than polygonal rifling. Advantages Hexagonal polygonal rifling. A number of advantages are claimed by the supporters of polygonal rifling. These include: *Not compromising the barrel's thickness in the area of each groove as with traditional rifling, and also less sensitive to stress concentration-induced barrel failure. *Providing a better gas seal around the projectile as polygonal bores tend to have shallower, smoother edges with a slightly smaller bore area, which translates into more efficient seal of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet,Peter Alan Kasler - Glock: The New Wave in Combat Handguns, p. 138 slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities and slightly increased accuracy. *Less bullet deformation, resulting less frictional resistance when the bullet travels through the barrel, which helps to increase muzzle velocity. The lack of sharp surface deformation on the bullet (rifling marks) also reduce drag in flight. *Reduced buildup of copper or lead within the barrel, as there are no sharp rifling edges to \\"shred\\" into the bullet surface and no pronounced corners that can accumulate foulings difficult to clean, which results in easier maintenance. The reduced fouling also theoretically translates to a simpler \\"copper equilibrium\\" profile, which is potentially beneficial to accuracy. *Prolonged barrel life, as the thermomechanical stress upon the riflings are spread over a larger area, hence less wear over time. However, precision target pistols such as those used in Bullseye and IHMSA almost universally use traditional rifling, as do target rifles. The debate among target shooters is almost always one of cut vs. button rifled barrels, as traditional rifling is dominant. Polygonal rifled barrels are used competitively in pistol action shooting, such as IDPA and IPSC competitions. Part of the difference may be that most polygonal rifling is produced by hammer forging the barrel around a mandrel containing a reverse impression of the rifling. Hammer forging machines are tremendously expensive, far out of the reach of custom gunsmiths (unless they buy pre-rifled blanks), and so are generally only used for production barrels by large companies. The main advantage of a hammer forging process is that it can rifle, chamber, and contour a bored barrel blank in one step. First applied to rifling in Germany in 1939, hammer forging has remained popular in Europe, but was only later used by gunmakers in the United States. The hammer forging process produces large amounts of stress in the barrel that must be relieved by careful heat treatment, a process that is less necessary in a traditionally cut or button rifled barrel. Due to the potential for residual stress causing accuracy problems, precision shooters in the United States tend to avoid hammer forged barrels, and this limits them in the type of available rifling. From a practical standpoint, any accuracy issues resulting from the residual stresses of hammer forging are extremely unlikely to be an issue in a defense or service pistol, or a typical hunting rifle. Forensic firearms examination Polygonal rifling prevents the forensic firearms examiner from microscopically measuring the width of land and groove impressions (so-called \\"ballistic fingerprinting\\") because the polygonal riflings have a rounded profile instead of well-defined rectangular edges, which causes few noticeable surface deformations. In the FBI GRC file, the land and groove widths for these firearms are listed as 0.000. However, it must be noted that forensic identification of firearms [in court-cases, etc.] is based on microscopic examination of tooling marks on the surface of the bore, produced by the manufacturing process and modified by the drag of bullet jackets on that same surface. Thus the bore surface of individual firearms is always unique. Lead bullets and polygonal rifling The Austrian firearm manufacturer Glock advises against using bare lead bullets (i.e. with no jacketing) in their polygonally rifled barrels, which has led to a widespread belief that polygonal rifling is not compatible with lead bullets. Firearms expert and barrel maker, the late Gale McMillan, has also commented that lead bullets and polygonal rifling are not a good mix. Neither H&K; nor Kahr explicitly recommend against lead bullets in their polygonal rifled barrels, suggesting that there might be an additional factor involved in Glock's warning. Kahr warns that lead bullets can cause additional fouling and recommends special attention to cleaning after their use. While H&K; doesn't insist on a copper jacket, at least one well-documented catastrophic incident in an H&K; pistol may be related to this issue. Furthermore, Dave Spaulding, well-known gun writer, reported in the February/March 2008 issue of Handguns Magazine that when he queried H&K; about their polygonally rifled barrels that they commented: \\"It has been their experience that polygonal rifling will foul with lead at a greater rate than with conventional rifling.\\" One suggestion of what the \\"additional factor involved in Glock's warning\\" might be is that Glock barrels have a fairly sharp transition between the chamber and the rifling, and this area (known as the \\"throat\\") is prone to lead buildup if bare lead bullets are used. This buildup may result in failures to fully return to battery, causing the gun to fire with the case not adequately supported by the chamber and the breech not fully locked, leading to a potentially dangerous case failure. However, since this sharp transition is found on most autopistols this speculation is of limited value. The sharp transition or \\"lip\\" at the front of the chamber is required to headspace the cartridge in most autopistols. Another possible explanation is that there are different \\"species\\" of polygonal rifle and perhaps Glock's peculiar style of polygonal rifling may be more prone to lead fouling than the particular styles employed in the H&K; and Kahr barrels. \\"Leading\\" is the buildup of lead in the bore that happens in nearly all firearms firing high velocity lead bullets. This lead buildup must be cleaned out regularly, or the barrel will gradually become constricted resulting in higher than normal bore pressures. In the extreme case, increased discharge pressures can overwhelm the material strength of the barrel and result in a catastrophic failure, and the gun blows open in the shooter's hand causing severe injuries.

It is very small but has the claim of being the highest surveyed town in South Australia. It serves as a base for large acre pastoralists and tourism. The town is just north of the Flinders Ranges National Park, is 60 kilometres north of Wilpena Pound History=Indigenous people This land belonged to the Adnyamathanha tribe, of Indigenous Australians prior to Europeans. They were Stone Age hunter-gatherers and inhabited much of the area (including Wilpena Pound to the south and other areas to the north). One of their unique customs was burn offs (controlled bushfires) to promote plant growth in the future seasons.  European settlement  The first European settlement around the current Blinman, was firstly of Angorichina Station. This land was taken up for sheep farming in the 1850s. A shepherd employed by the station, Robert Blinman, discovered a copper outcrop on a hot December day in 1859. Blinman gambled some of his money on the presence of more underground copper and received a mineral application in 1860. On 1 January 1861, Blinman and three friends, Alfred Frost, Joe Mole and Henry Alfred, received the lease for the land that became Blinman.Blinman South Australia History Accessed 9/1/07 Mining was successful in the first year and the mine became known as Wheal Blinman. The original four leaseholders sold their mine in February 1862, for about 150 times the purchase price. The new owners were the Yudnamutana Copper Mining Company of South Australia, who also owned a rich deposit north of Blinman. The mine was very successful during the 1860s and the site became permanent, with buildings being constructed and more miners moving to the area, some from the Burra mine. The hardest problems at the time were the transport of Ore and the finding of water. Over the next 20 years, railways were developed and wells were sunk at regular intervals making settlement easier. Family life was hard in the early days. Both water and firewood had to be brought from long distances from the mine. This job was left to the women and their elder children while the men were working. Many pregnancies failed in the early years and there were several deaths reported from inflammation of the lungs. With the original tent settlement being very close to the mine, it was very hard to escape the fine dust generated. A hotel and post office were first opened in Blinman in 1863. In 1864, a government surveyor laid out 162 allotments about three km from the mine. This was named Blinman. The population was about 1,500 by 1868 and the first school opened that year. Decent shops in the main street developed in 1869. The striking of regular water in the mine the same year secured a regular water supply for the town. Mining continued until 1918 when the ore ran out. The busiest time for the mine was 1913-1918 with a town population of 2,000. The total ore removed was about 10,000 tonnes.Walkabout - Blinman , Accessed 13/1/07 Administrative area history The locality of Blinman consists of land occupying the northern end of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Carr and includes the government towns of Blinman and Blinman South which according to the official source, do \\"still exist\\" and which are located about apart along the Flinders Ranges Way. The government town of Blinman was surveyed in January 1864 without an official government proclamation and was named after Robert Blinman. The government town of Blinman North was surveyed in July 1867 on nearby land and also was not the subject of an official proclamation. In 1986, the former Blinman was renamed Blinman South, and the former Blinman North was renamed Blinman. In October 2003, the locality of Blinman was created, incorporating both towns within new boundaries. On 26 April 2013, additional land was added to the locality. Heritage listings Blinman has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Blinman Dome Diapir * Blinman Mine and Mine Manager's Cottage * Mine Road Dwelling and Dugout  Attractions  Tourists travel to this area to enjoy the Outback of South Australia and to see the ancient geology of the area. The town is close to Brachina Gorge and Parachilna Gorge. These two rarely have flowing water in them. Also nearby are the Blinman Pools. The town is a stop off on the way to Arkaroola. The copper mine at one end of the town is another attraction. The town itself boasts a pub, general store, a church and a cafe/gallery. There are tennis courts, a golf course and a cricket pitch, though they see sporadic use. Fuel is not available.

Netnod is owned by the foundation TU-stiftelsen (Stiftelsen f√∂r Telematikens utveckling). Netnod operates six Internet exchange points (IXPs) in five different cities where Internet operators can connect and exchange traffic (peer). The Netnod IX has among the highest amount of traffic per peer in Europe and is fully IPv6 enabled. At the Netnod IXPs, Netnod provides a variety of value adding services such as the RIPE Internet Routing Registry (IRR), Bredbandskollen (a consumer broadband speed test), slave services for several DNS TLDs, the DNS root server i.root-servers.net, as well as distribution of official Swedish time through NTP. These services are provided as part of Netnod's AS number AS8674. Netnod also manages a variety of DNS services. Netnod provides anycast and unicast slave service to TLDs worldwide through its DNSNODE product. Netnod is also the operator of i.root-servers.net, one of the 13 logical DNS root name servers in the world. Some of the services above were previously offered through ‚ÄúAutonomica‚Äù, which was a fully owned subsidiary of Netnod. However, in 2010, Autonomica merged with Netnod, leaving the company with the single name Netnod.  History  The predecessor to the TU Foundation / Netnod was the D-GIX, an Internet exchange point that was established at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm and operated by KTHNOC. D-GIX had been one of the first IXes that were established in Europe, and quite successful at that. In 1996 a report by a committee, ) had listed infrastructure that was critical for the operation of the Internet in Sweden. Among the critical infrastructure listed was a robust and reliable Internet exchange. A number of factors led KTH as well as the Swedish ISPs to conclude that a separate legal entity would be a better operational format. After legal consultations, and seeing that the Swedish government seemed keen to play a role in the infrastructure operation, the Swedish ISPs decided to found the TU Foundation. The initial capital came from a government set up foundation, the Knowledge Foundation, KK-stiftelsen, one of the largest Swedish research foundations. The idea behind the ownership model with the foundation was that it would guarantee independence from the operators as well as from the government. Linkage to the operational community comes from the fact that the Swedish university network SUNET appoints one of the board members, and the Swedish Operator Forum appoints two of the Netnod board members. The TU- Foundation established the operational company Netnod to run the IX. In the beginning Netnod had no staff of its own and all operations were outsourced to the Swedish military. In 2001, Netnod created fully owned a subsidiary called Autonomica. Autonomica was to run the operations for Netnod (who then as well as now, do not have any staff of its own) as well as run the i.root- servers.net on behalf of NORDUnet and do Internet related research. In the beginning the staff mainly focused on DNS and management and the operations continued to be outsourced to the military. However, finally in 2002 Autonomicas staff grew considerably and the contract with the military was ended. Operations is today done entirely by Netnod staff.  Autonomica  Autonomica Ab is a fully owned subsidiary of NetNod that operates several critical infrastructure pieces on the Internet. Autonomica was founded in 1998, as a subsidiary to NetNod. The Swedish Operator Forum had for a while been discussing extending the operations of NetNod to include common infrastructure services, as well as taking on staff. It was decided that NetNod would form a separate entity for the operation of the Internet Exchange Point and that that would also be chartered to do research in Internet Technology with a main focus on DNS. Autonomica was set up with three staff, one responsible for co-ordination of the operation of the IXes and two that were moved from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It was also agreed between the Swedish University Network SUNET, and Autonomica that Autonomica would take over the responsibility for running the i.root- servers.net. In addition to that, Autonomica was also to operate the .SE slave servers at each of the four original Netnod Exchanges. As Netnod's parent is a non-for profit foundation, so is Autonomica. All surplus will be handed to the foundation to be used as grants for \\"good for the Internet\\" projects. Autonomica was originally to focus on \\"research\\". The work came to focus on what can best be described as engineering and applied research, as often is the case with Internet related technology, such as the work in the IETF. Autonomica staff has since the start been very active in the IETF and among other things co-chaired the IETF DNSOP working group, multi6 working group (now closed), shim6 working group and the v6ops working group. Autonomica staff has also served on the IAB. The work done by Autonomica has mainly focused on DNSSEC and Autonomica staff has written many Internet Drafts and RFCs on DNSSEC issues and deployability. Recently a lot of work and presentations has been done on the topic of deploying IPv6 in production environment. Autonomica staff are also frequently involved in presenting and chairing sessions in operational conferences such as RIPE, APRICOT /APNIC, SANOG, MENOG and NANOG. Autonomica has also helped run several workshops and initiatives among the Swedish Operators. Autonomica provides several for free services for the good of the Internet, such as i.root-servers.net, one of the 13 Root-servers, and NTP servers tied to UTC. Autonomica also finances its operation by sharing the platform used for Anycast of the i.root-servers.net with several TLDs that make use of the platform.  Redundancy and physical security  From the beginning, as was cited in the Internetutredningen report, the IX operated by Netnod was considered as critical national infrastructure. Netnod therefore in 1997 agreed with the Swedish telecommunications regulator to locate the IX equipment in government operated secure telecommunications bunkers. In addition, it was agreed that operations should not be dependent on Stockholm alone. Netnod therefore established IXes in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malm√∂ and Sundsvall. All of these locations were in the government bunkers, as opposed to co-location facilities as the case in most other countries. The exchanges are independent and not linked, so operators connected in one city will only see other operators connected in the same city. However, most of the larger Swedish providers are connected at all four cities. Netnod since 2004 also operates an IX in Lule√•.  Technology  The first D-GIX was a 10 Mbit/s switch. By the time D-GIX was replaced by Netnod the exchange point consisted of two FDDI switches in Stockholm and one was also installed in Gothenburg. Around 1998, the FDDI circuits were filled and traffic was heavily impacted by head-of-line blocking. At a Swedish Operator Forum meeting the alternatives were discussed. The options were basically two. The new Gigabit Ethernet standard, and a standard developed by Cisco called Spatial Reuse Protocol, SRP. The decision to go with SRP was basically based on the fact that at the time Gigabit Ethernet and SRP had roughly the same cost. SRP also did not have the issue of head-of-line blocking, and SRP had a larger MTU size than what Gigabit Ethernet had at the time. So the Swedish operators decided that Netnod should implement SRP. The SRP rings installed were running at 2x622Mbit/s in each city. It wasn't soon until the 2x622Mbit/s was not enough. Netnod then proposed to the operators to migrate to SRP 2x2.5Gbit/s, which was also installed. The larger operators all moved to the new SRP rings, but the smaller operators wanted a cheaper method. By 2000, Gigabit Ethernet was starting to become mass-market and the price had dropped compared to SRP. Gigabit Ethernet had by then also implemented jumboframes. Netnod said they were willing to implement Gigabit Ethernet, but wanted 8 operators to promise to sign up to cover the costs. In the meantime, some operators went off and created an alternative, Ethernet based IX, SOL-IX. However, Netnod managed to get their 8 customers quite fast and built out Gigabit Ethernet at all cities. For 2 years, the old FDDI exchange (that was still operational) was connected to the Ethernet switches, but by the end of 2002, all SRP and FDDI equipment had been migrated away from. Today the Netnod platform consists of single chassis Gigabit Ethernet switches at each location. Operators are connected with either 1Gigabit, 10Gigabit or 100Gigabit Ethernet, with a clear trend of operators moving to 10 Gigabit Ethernet connections. As of 2012 Netnod also offers remote peering through a reseller program, Netnod Reach.

His given name was Rashid Ahmad; Abu Masud was his kunya. His heritage can be traced back to a famous companion of the prophet Muhammad, namely Ayub Ansari (who died in 674). Ayub Ansari had hosted the prophet in his home in Medina city, when he made hegira (migration) to Medina city in 622. Biography Rashid Ahmad was born on Monday, 6 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1244 AH (1826 AD) in Gangoh, Saharanpur District, British India (in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India). He was born in the mahallah of Sarai, close to the tomb of Abdul Quddus Gangohi. Both his father Maulana Hidayat Ahmad and his mother Karimun Nisa belonged to Ansari Ayyubi families, claiming descent from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. His ancestral village was Rampur, but his grandfather Qazi Pir Bakhsh had settled in Gangoh. Hidayat Ahmad was an Islamic scholar connected to the Waliullahi tradition, and in tasawwuf (Sufism) an authorized khalifah (successor) of Shah Ghulam Ali Mujaddidi Dihlawi. He died in 1252 AH (1836) at the age of 35, when Rashid was seven. A few years later Rashid's younger brother Sa'id Ahmad also died, at the age of nine. After the death of Hidayat Ahmad the responsibility for Rashid's upbringing fell to his grandfather Qazi Pir Bakhsh. He also had four maternal uncles: Maulana Muhammad Naqi, Maulana Muhammad Taqi, Maulana Abdul Ghani, and Maulana Muhammad Shafi. He was especially close to Abdul Ghani, who took on a fatherly role for him. He also had a close friendship with his younger cousin, Abun Nasr, son of Abdul Ghani's. Rashid Ahmad received his elementary education from a local teacher, Miyanji Qutb Bakhsh Gangohi. He read the Qur'an in Gangoh, probably at home with his mother. Then he studied the primary Persian books with his older brother Inayat Ahmad. He completed Persian studies in Karnal with his maternal uncle Muhammad Taqi, and also partly with Muhammad Ghaus. Afterwards he studied the primary books of Arabic grammar (sarf and nahw) with Muhammad Bakhsh Rampuri, on whose encouragement he then traveled to Delhi in pursuit of knowledge in 1261 AH (1845), at the age of 17. After arriving in Delhi he studied Arabic with Qazi Ahmaduddin Punjabi Jehlami. Afterwards he attended the classes of different teachers before becoming a pupil of Mamluk Ali Nanautawi, a scholar of the Shah Waliullah line, and a professor at Delhi College. It was in this period that Rashid Ahmad met and developed a close companionship with Mamluk Ali's nephew, Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi. Both were private pupils of Mamluk Ali. After he completed his studies with Mamluk Ali, he stayed a few more years in Delhi to study under other teachers. He became a pupil of Mufti Sadruddin Azurdah, with whom he studied some books of the ulum-i aqliyah (rational sciences). He studied the books of hadith and tafsir under Shah Abdul Ghani Mujaddidi. Shah Ahmad Sa'id, the older brother of Shah Abdul Ghani Mujaddidi, was also among his teachers. After four years in Delhi, Rashid returned home to Gangoh. He married Khadijah, daughter of his uncle Maulana Muhammad Naqi, at the age of 21. It was not until after his marriage that he memorized the Qur'an. He then travelled to Thana Bhawan, where he gave bay'ah (allegiance) at the hand of Haji Imdadullah in the Sufi path. He remained in Imdadullah's company and service for 42 days. When he prepared to leave for Gangoh, Imdadullah held his hand and gave him permission to take disciples. While Nanautawi and Gangohi are often mentioned as co-founders of Darul Uloom Deoband, Rizvi writes that there is no historical evidence that Gangohi played a role in its establishment in 1283 AH. However, due to his close relationship with Nanautawi and others involved, it is unlikely that he was unaware of its founding. Rizvi cites a record of Gangohi's written inspection of the madrasah on 3 Rajab 1285 AH as the earliest evidence for his formal relationship with the madrasah. It was also common for graduates of the madrasah to attend Rashid Ahmad's hadith lectures in Gangoh. In 1297 AH, after the death of Qasim, Rashid was made sarparast (patron) of Darul Uloom Deoband. From 1314 AH he was also sarparast of the Darul Uloom's sister madrasah, Mazahir Uloom Saharanpur.Profiles of many founders of Deoband including Rashid Ahmad Gangohi on darululoom-deoband.com website Retrieved 16 August 2018 He died on a Friday, 8 Jumada II 1323 AH (1905 AD) after the adhan (call to prayer) of Jumuah prayer.Profile of Rashid Ahmad Gangohi on haqislam.org website Published 14 February 2010, Retrieved 16 August 2018 See also * Muhammad Mian Mansoor Ansari * Majid Ali Jaunpuri * Hussain Ahmed Madani * Al-Muhannad 'ala al-Mufannad NotesReferencesExternal links * Books Collection Category:Hanafis Category:Maturidis Category:Deobandis Category:Hadith scholars Category:19th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Indian Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:People from Saharanpur district Category:1826 births Category:1905 deaths ","title":"Rashid Ahmad Gangohi"},{"id":"3567637","text":"Charles Creighton (22 November 1847 ‚Äì 18 July 1927) was a British physician and medical author. He was highly regarded for his scholarly writings on medical history but was widely denounced for disputing the germ theory of infectious diseases. Biography Creighton was born in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the oldest son of Alexander Creighton and Agnes Brand Creighton. He received a scholarship to attend the University of Aberdeen and received his M.A. in 1867. He then enrolled as a medical student and passed his M.B. and M.S. exams in 1871. After graduation, he studied for a brief time with Karl von Rokitansky in Vienna and Rudolf Virchow in Berlin. He was awarded his M.D. in 1878.Cook, G. C. (2000).

After returning from Berlin in 1872, Creighton worked in London as a hospital registrar until his appointment in 1876 as demonstrator of anatomy at University of Cambridge. Over the next five years he wrote his first book, Bovine Tuberculosis in Man (1881), and published several articles on anatomy in the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology. He became co-editor of the journal in 1879.Dolman, Claude E. (1981) \\"Creighton, Charles\\" Dictionary of Scientific Biography.

For the remainder of his life he worked independently on his studies and lived alone. Between 1881 and 1883 he published a three-volume translation from German of August Hirsch's Handbook of Geographical and Historical Pathology. His most significant work, A History of Epidemics in Britain, took several years to complete and the two volumes were published in 1891 and 1894. In 1918 Creighton moved to Northamptonshire, England where he lived until his death in 1927. Anti-vaccination Creighton was an anti- vaccinationist.

Creighton argued that vaccination was poisoning of the blood with contaminated material, which could provide no protection from disease. Two articles he wrote for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on pathology (1885) and vaccinations (1888) cast doubt on the existence of germs and the efficacy of vaccines. He was widely condemned for these views by leading medical journals. He continued to express his unorthodox and unpopular anti-vaccination views in The Natural History of Cowpox and Vaccinal Syphilis (1887) and Jenner and Vaccination (1889).

Most Jewish translations appear in bilingual editions (Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish). Jewish translations often reflect traditional Jewish exegesis of the Bible; all such translations eschew the Christological interpretations present in many non-Jewish translations.The motivation for specifically Jewish versions in English is summed up in the Britannica as follows: \\"Though Jews in English-speaking lands generally utilized the King James Version and the Revised Version, the English versions have presented great difficulties. They contain departures from the traditional Hebrew text; they sometimes embody Christological interpretations; the headings were often doctrinally objectionable...\\"; see \\"Jewish versions\\".\\"The repeated efforts by Jews in the field of biblical translation show their sentiment toward translations prepared by other denominations. The dominant feature of this sentiment, apart from the thought that the Christological interpretations in non-Jewish translations are out of place in a Jewish Bible, is and was that the Jew cannot afford to have his Bible translation prepared for him by others.\\" \\"Preface\\" to the 1917 JPS Translation Jewish translations contain neither the books of the apocryphaThe books of the apocrypha became part of the Greek scriptures of Hellenistic Jews (the Septuagint) and eventually of the Church, but were not included in the Hebrew proto-masoretic tradition of the Pharisees and the early rabbis. With some minor exceptions, these books were not preserved at all in the Jewish tradition, and their survival is due to their preservation by the Church. The classic scholarly study of Jewish canon as reflected in the Jewish sources, focusing on the background for the selection of books found in the masoretic tradition, is Sid Z.

An online summary of some of Leiman's findings appears online here. nor the Christian New Testament. Background English Bible translation has been common among Christians, particularly since the 16th- century Reformation, producing dozens of modern translations and versions in English.For a discussion of the Hebrew text's centrality in Judaism (of all denominations) and thus the popularity of bilingual versions in public worship, versus the centrality of translations in Christianity, see Why are Christians satisfied with English-only Bibles? and responses to it: Christianity is cross-cultural and cross-linguistic and Parallel Bibles: S. Bagster & Sons'. But equivalent translation efforts have been less widespread among Jews. This is partially due to the fact that English became a major spoken language among Jews only in the era since the Holocaust. Before then, even Jews in English-speaking countries were still part of an immigrant culture to a large extent, which meant that they could either understand the Hebrew Bible in its original language to a certain degree or, if they required a translation, were still not fully comfortable in English. Many translated Bibles and prayer books from before the Holocaust were still in Yiddish, even those published in countries like the United States. A further reason is that often those Jews who study the Bible regularly still do so, to a greater or lesser extent, in its original language, as it is read in the synagogue. Even those who require translations often prefer a bilingual edition. Nevertheless, Jewish translations of the Bible to English have become far more widespread, especially since the 1980s, and have been made available in numerous complementary versions and styles. An example verse Exodus 20:7‚Äì9a (8-10a): is variously translated: * Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it. Six days shall you serve and do all your [creating] work, and the seventh day is a Sabbath to God, your God. On it you shall not perform any kind of [creating] work... (Hirsch, 19th century) * Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work... (JPS Tanakh, old, 1917) * Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it. Six days shall you work and accomplish all your work; but the seventh day is Sabbath to HASHEM, your God; you shall not do any work... (ArtScroll, 1976) * Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. You can work during the six weekdays and do all your tasks. But Saturday is the Sabbath to God your Lord. Do not do anything that constitutes work... (The Living Torah, 1981) * Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the LORD your God: you shall not do any work... (JPS Tanakh, new, 1985) * Remember / the Sabbath day, to hallow it. / For six days, you are to serve, and are to make all your work, / but the seventh day / is Sabbath for YHWH your God: / you are not to make any kind of work... (Everett Fox, Schocken, 1995) * Remember the sabbath day to hallow it. Six days you shall work and you shall do your tasks, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your God. You shall do no task... (Robert Alter, The Five Books of Moses, 2004) Isaac Leeser translation Isaac Leeser The first American Jewish English translation of the Torah, and subsequently of the entire Tanakh, was the 19th century effort by Isaac Leeser. Leeser began with a five-volume, bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish edition of the Torah and haftarot, The Law of God (Philadelphia, 1845). His translation of the entire Bible into English was completed as The Twenty-four books of the Holy Scriptures in 1853 (commonly called The Leeser Bible). In 1857 he re-issued it in a second (folio-size) edition, with abridged notes.Full scans of Leeser's Hebrew- English edition of the Torah and haftarot, his Hebrew edition of the masoretic Bible (1848), and numerous original editions and reprints of his translation of the entire Tanakh into English can all be found here. Until the 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation, the Leeser translation was the most important Jewish English translation. It was widely used in North American synagogues and reprinted in England.\\"Preface\\" to the 1917 JPS Translation A modern writer notes that despite its longevity, Leeser's translation was \\"wooden\\" and \\"devoid of literary distinction\\". He concludes that \\"it is perhaps the existence of Leeser's work rather than its merits that marks it as a noteworthy achievement\\". Abraham Benisch translation Following upon the Leeser translation, and partially simultaneously with it, was the Anglo-Jewish translation by Abraham Benisch: Jewish School and Family Bible, which was published in England in four sequential volumes from 1851 to 1861.The four original volumes can be found here. Benisch's translation of the Torah was published in five volumes, with the Hebrew and English on facing pages. In each volume the text of the Torah is followed by haftarot and the Sabbath prayers.Most of the set is available here.

The Friedl√§nder edition is similar in style to the King James Version but diverges primarily in places where the King James translation reflects a Christian interpretation that is at odds with the traditional Jewish understanding. While it never gained wide popularity, it influenced the editors of the first JPS edition, and is cited as the basis for a revised translation found in the Koren Hebrew-English edition. The Jewish Family Bible is currently available in a facsimile edition from Sinai Publishers. Jewish Publication Society translations The translations of the Jewish Publication Society of America (JPS) have become the most popular English translations of the Hebrew Bible. JPS has published two such translations. The 1917 JPS translation. Old JPS (1917) The first JPS translation was completed in 1917 by a committee led by Max Margolis and was based on the scholarship of its day. Its literary form was consciously based on that of the King James Version; Margolis, a non-native speaker of English, felt that was the proper standard of language that Jews should adopt for their translation. The Old JPS translation was used in a number of Jewish works published before the 1980s, such as the Pentateuch and Haftaroth edited by J. H. Hertz and the Soncino Books of the Bible series. The translation committee included Cyrus Adler, Solomon Schechter, Kaufmann Kohler, Samuel Schulman, and David Philipson.Greenspoon, Leonard J. 1988. A Book \\"Without Blemish\\": The Jewish Publication Society's Bible Translation of 1917. The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, Vol. 79.1, pp. 2, 8. However, Schechter and Jacobs died before the translation was completed.Greenspoon, Leonard J. 1988. A Book \\"Without Blemish\\": The Jewish Publication Society's Bible Translation of 1917. The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, Vol. 79.1, p. 11. Some of the copies had been printed with a serious printing error. A typesetter dropped a tray of type for first chapter of Isaiah and had incorrectly reset the type.Greenspoon, Leonard J. 1988. A Book \\"Without Blemish\\": The Jewish Publication Society's Bible Translation of 1917. The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, Vol. 79.1, pp. 2. New JPS (1985) The bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish edition of the New JPS translation The 1917 translation was felt to be outdated by the 1950s, and a new effort developed that involved cooperation between numerous Jewish scholars from a variety of denominations. The translation of the Torah was started in 1955 and completed in 1962. Nevi'im was published in 1978 and Ketuvim in 1984. The entire Tanakh was revised and published in one volume in 1985, and a bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish version appeared in 1999 (also in one volume). The translation is usually referred to as the \\"New JPS version\\", abbreviated NJPS (it has also been called the \\"New Jewish Version\\" or NJV). The translators of the New JPS version were experts in both traditional Jewish exegesis of the Bible and modern biblical scholarship. The translation attempts in all cases to present the original meaning of the text in a highly aesthetic form. The translation is not a word-for-word translation and is described by its publisher as being \\"in the spirit of Saadia\\". The New JPS version is adapted for gender-neutral language in The Torah: A Modern Commentary, revised edition (2005, Union for Reform Judaism, ), the official Torah commentary of Reform Judaism, where it appears together with the work of translator Chaim Stern. NJPS is also used in Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary (2001, Jewish Publication Society, ), the official Torah commentary of Conservative Judaism. It is the base translation for The Jewish Study Bible (2004, Oxford University Press, ). NJPS is also the basis for The Contemporary Torah: A Gender-Sensitive Adaptation of the JPS Translation (2006, JPS, ), also known as CJPS. The JPS Bible, a pocket paperback edition of the New JPS version was published and made available as of 2008 by the Jewish Publication Society as well as an illustrated children's Bible as of 2009. Since 2017, the bilingual Hebrew-English edition of the JPS Tanakh (1985 translation) has been digitalized and is available online for free on the website Sefaria. The Holy Scriptures First published in 1916, revised in 1951, by the Hebrew Publishing Company, revised by Alexander Harkavy, a Hebrew Bible translation in English, which contains the form Jehovah as the Divine Name in Exodus 6:3, Psalm 83:18, and Isaiah 12:2 and three times in compound place names at Genesis 22:14, Exodus 17:15 and Judges 6:24 as well as Jah in Psalm 68:4. The use of the divine name Jehovah was and still is very unusual for a Jewish Bible, although this Bible never gained the popularity of the JPS Tanakh, Alexander Harkavy has been remembered for his contributions to Jewish literature and the development of modern Yiddish. This Bible's translation style is comparable to the 1917 JPS Tanakh. The Jewish Bible for Family Reading In 1957 Joseph Gaer produced an abridged translation called The Jewish Bible for Family Reading. Influenced by biblical source criticism and the documentary hypothesis, Gaer moved all \\"duplications, specifications, detailed descriptions of rituals and genealogies\\" to a summary in an appendix; made a separate appendix summary of the Torah's \\"principal laws;\\" and omitted \\"all obvious redundancies.\\"Joseph Gaer, \\"The Bible: Our Inheritance\\", The Jewish Bible for Family Reading, Thomas Yoseloff, 1957. Intended for the English reader with little or no knowledge of Hebrew, the text of The Jewish Bible for Family Reading is organized in brief sections with descriptive titles (such as \\"The Story of Creation\\" and \\"Isaac Takes a Bride\\") without the verse numbers that are typical of Bible translations. The Koren Jerusalem Bible The Koren Jerusalem Bible (not to be confused with the Catholic translation with a similar title) is a Hebrew/English Tanakh by Koren Publishers Jerusalem. The Koren Bible was the first Bible published in modern Israel,and the first Hebrew Bible designed, edited, printed, and bound by Jews in nearly 500 years. As recorded in the inner title page of each edition, followed by mention of the announcement by Knesset Speaker Kadish Luz (1965) that \\"all Presidents of the State of Israel will hereafter be sworn into office on this Bible\\" (the Koren edition). distinguished for its accuracy and beauty, and one of the most widely distributed Hebrew editions ever published. The English translation in The Koren Jerusalem Bible, which is Koren's Hebrew/English edition, is by Professor Harold Fisch, a Biblical and literary scholar, and is based on Friedl√§nder's 1881 Jewish Family Bible, but it has been \\"thoroughly corrected, modernized, and revised\\".Jerusalem Bible (Koren) The Koren Jerusalem Bible incorporates some unique features: *The paragraphing of the English translation parallels the division of the parashot in the Hebrew version on the facing page. Chapter and verse numbers are noted only in the margin (as in the Hebrew version). *The names of people and places in the translation are transliterations of the Hebrew names, as opposed to the Hellenized versions used in most translations. For example, the Hebrew name Moshe is used instead of the more familiar Moses.Koren Publishing *It uses Koren Type, created by typographer Eliyahu Koren specifically for The Koren Bible, and is a most accurate and legible Hebrew type. The Koren Jerusalem Bible is sometimes referred to as The Jerusalem Bible, Koren Bible, the Koren Tanakh, or Tanakh Yerushalayim (Hebrew for Jerusalem Bible). Living Torah and Nach Perhaps the first Orthodox translation into contemporary English was The Living Torah by Aryeh Kaplan which was published in 1981 by Moznaim Publishing. After Kaplan's death in 1983, The Living Nach was translated in the same style by various authors.Ari Mark Cartun, An Annotated Bibliography of Translations and Commentaries on the Torah and Bible, Congregation Etz Chayim, 2006 The Living Torah is available online.http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp Kaplan's translation is influenced by traditional rabbinic interpretation and religious law, an approach followed by many later Orthodox translators. It also reflects Kaplan's interest in Jewish mysticism.Leonard J. Greenspoon, \\"Jewish Translations of the Bible\\" in The Jewish Study Bible, Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, eds. Oxford University Press, 2004. The Living Torah is also notable for its use of contemporary, colloquial English. For example, it reverses the usual distinction between \\"God\\" and \\"Lord\\", noting that in modern English \\"God\\" is more appropriate for a proper name. One writer cites these examples, emphasizing Kaplan's modern translation: * Shemot (Exodus) 20:8‚Äì10 ‚Äî Remember the Sabbath to keep it holy. You can work during the six weekdays and do all your tasks. But Saturday is the Sabbath to God your Lord. * Vayikra (Leviticus) 18:7 ‚Äî Do not commit a sexual offense against your father or mother. If a woman is your mother, you must not commit incest with her. * Vayikra 19:14 ‚Äî Do not place a stumbling block before the [morally] blind. * Vayikra 19:29 ‚Äî Do not defile your daughter with premarital sex. Judaica Press Judaica Press, an Orthodox Jewish publisher, has published a multi- volume English translation. The Judaica Press Complete Tanach with Rashi is a bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish translation of the Bible that includes Rashi's commentary in both Hebrew and English. The English translations were made by A. J. Rosenberg.Judaica Press Tanach with Rashi The Complete Tanach with Rashi is available online. Although the Pentateuch has not been fully published in hardcopy (Genesis [in three volumes] and Exodus [in two volumes] only), Judaica Press also published a set of 24 bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish volumes of Mikraot Gedolot for Nevi'im and Ketuvim, published as Books of the Prophets and Writings. As in traditional Mikraot Gedolot, the Hebrew text includes the masoretic text, the Aramaic Targum, and several classic rabbinic commentaries. The English translations, by Rosenberg, include a translation of the Biblical text, Rashi's commentary, and a summary of rabbinic and modern commentaries.Judaica Press Prophets & Writings Judaica Press has also published other English translations and translations of other commentaries, most notably Samson Raphael Hirsch's German translation and commentary. ArtScroll Tanach series In 1976 Mesorah Publications, an Orthodox publisher, began publishing a series of bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish books of the Bible under its ArtScroll imprint. The ArtScroll Tanach series includes introductions to each book and a running commentary based on classic rabbinic interpretation.B. Barry Levy, \\"Our Torah, Your Torah, and Their Torah: An Evaluation of the ArtScroll Phenomenon\\" in Truth and Compassion: Essays on Religion in Judaism, Howard Joseph, Jack N. Lightstone, and Michael D. Oppenheim, eds. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1983. The Torah volumes were collected, revised, and published in a lone Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish bilingual volume as the Stone Edition of the Chumash (1993) with a short commentary in English. This Chumash also includes haftarot, Targum, and Rashi. The whole Tanach was published as the Stone Edition of the Tanach (1996). The English translation in the ArtScroll series relies heavily on the interpretation of Rashi and other traditional sources and religious law. Some critics have said that this approach sometimes results in an English rendering that is as much an explanation as it is a translation. In this regard, one critic likened the ArtScroll volumes to \\"non-literal\\" targumim, which interpreted as well as translated the Bible. One distinctive feature of the ArtScroll series is the way in which it renders the four-letter name of God, . Most English translations represent this name by the phrase \\"the Lord\\"; ArtScroll uses the Hebrew word \\"Ha-Shem\\" instead. Ha-Shem, literally \\"the Name\\", is an expression often used by Orthodox Jews to refer to God. The ArtScroll series has become very popular in the Orthodox Jewish community and is in use among non-Orthodox Jews as well. Robert Alter translation In 2018 Robert Alter completed his translation of the Hebrew Bible, The Hebrew Bible: A Translation with Commentary. Installments of the translation were released over the course of more than two decades. Alter's goals included preserving the artistry of the Hebrew language in the English translation. A previous milestone was his 2004 publication of The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary. Alter aimed to reproduce in his translation the \\"slight strangeness\\", \\"beautiful rhythms\\", and \\"magic of biblical style\\" of the original Hebrew that he felt had been \\"neglected by English translators\\".Robert Alter, \\"The Bible in English and the Heresy of Explanation\\", The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary, W. W. Norton, 2004. One way in which Alter tried to accomplish this was by using the same English equivalent in almost every instance that a Hebrew word appears in the Torah. As one reviewer noted, \\"if a Hebrew adjective is translated as 'beautiful,' it won't next be rendered as 'pretty' or 'attractive.' This is important because it allows the reader to detect narrative and imagistic patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed\\".Michael Dirda, \\"The Five Books of Moses\\", The Washington Post, October 24, 2004. Reviewer John Updike noted Alter also \\"keep[s] the ubiquitous sentence-beginning 'and,' derived from the Hebrew particle waw; he retains emphatic repetitions, as in 'she, she, too' and 'this red red stuff.'\\"John Updike, \\"The Great I AM: Robert Alter‚Äôs new translation of the Pentateuch\\", The New Yorker, November 1, 2004. Accessed via . Torah translations Because the Torah is read in a yearly cycle in the synagogue, there are many Jewish translations of the Torah only (without Nevi'im and Ketuvim). Such a translation is sometimes called a chumash, particularly when it is published in a bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish edition. Everett Fox Everett Fox translated the Torah (The Five Books of Moses, 1995) for Schocken Press. Fox's approach to translation was inspired by the German translation prepared by Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig, and he describes his work as an \\"offshoot\\" of theirs. His translation was also guided by the principle that the Bible \\"was meant to be read aloud\\". Fox's translation is printed in blank verse, and the personal and place names are transliterated versions of the Hebrew names.Everett Fox, \\"Translator's Preface\\", The Five Books of Moses, Schocken, 1995. Writer John Updike cited some of these qualities as faults in Fox's translation, describing Fox as \\"an extremist after Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig\\" who \\"liberally coins compound adjectives like 'heavy-with- stubbornness' and verbs like 'adulter'\\" and noted that Fox renders the seventh commandment as \\"You are not to adulter\\". Another reviewer, echoing Updike's comments, wrote that \\"Fox's use of hyphenated phrases seems to be [modeled] after the German habit of compounding nonce words, a device used frequently by Buber and Rosenzweig in their German translation. The results seem less [strange] in German than in English, and it may be questioned whether such 'strangified' English gives the reader a true impression of what in Hebrew is really quite ordinary.\\"Michael D. Marlowe, \\"The Five Books of Moses: A New Translation by Everett Fox\\", Bible Research, September 2002. Chaim Miller Chaim Miller's chumash is a translation whose text incorporates Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson's \\"novel interpretation\\" of Rashi's commentary, which was delivered in a series of public talks that began in 1964 and continued for more than 25 years.Chaim Miller, Rashi's Method of Biblical Commentary, Chabad.org The translation, which was sponsored by Meyer Gutnick and is called \\"The Gutnick Edition Chumash\\", is published in a bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish edition that includes a running commentary anthologized from classic rabbinic texts. It also includes the haftarot, mystical insights called \\"Sparks of Chassidus\\", a summary of the mitzvot found in each parashah according to Sefer ha-Chinuch, an essay on public reading of the Torah, and summary charts.Gutnick Edition Chumash, World Jewish News Agency. According to Miller's foreword, unlike most other translations, the Gutnick edition does not intersperse transliterations among the translations; this is intended to make the text more reader-friendly. However, the translation does includes Rashi's commentary in parentheses, and the foreword explains that these are Rashi's words and not a translation of the chumash.Jewish Press review of The Gutnick Edition Chumash The publication of the 5-volume series by Kol Menachem, Gutnick's publishing company, was completed in 2006. Richard Elliott Friedman In 2001 Richard Elliott Friedman released his Commentary on the Torah, featuring a new translation intended to \\"reflect more closely the words of the Hebrew\\" rather than \\"the translators' judgments of what the original Hebrew says.\\"Richard Elliott Friedman, \\"Commentary on the Torah\\", Harper San Francisco, 2001 Partial translations=Translations of individual books of the BibleMenachem Mendel Kasher= In 1951, Menachem Mendel Kasher translated the book of Genesis and his commentary, Torah SheBaal Peh. =Everett Fox= In addition to his translation of the Torah, Fox has translated the books of Samuel (Give Us a King!, 1999), and subsequently all of the Early Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, 2014). =Kehot Publication Society= Kehot Publication Society has started a translation of the Torah, and as of March 2007 has completed the books of Shemot (Exodus) and Bamidbar (Numbers). The volumes, titled Torah Chumash Shemos and Torah Chumash Bemidbar, are bilingual Hebrew‚ÄìEnglish translations that include a running commentary based on Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson's interpretation of Rashi's commentary. The project is supervised by editor-in- chief Moshe Wisnefsky. Incomplete translationsDavid Rosenberg= In 1977, David Rosenberg, a poet, former editor-in-chief of the Jewish Publication Society, and Visiting Lecturer in Creative Writing at Princeton University, translated the book of Job and released the resulting volume as Job Speaks. It was preceded by his translation of psalms, \\"Blues of The Sky\\" (Harper) and followed by \\"Lightworks: The Book of Isaiah\\". Later, he translated parts of Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy that were deemed to have been written by the Documentary hypothesis J writer, also known as the Yahwist, author of the Bible's oldest strand, and released this volume as The Book of J in 1990, with commentary by American literary critic Harold Bloom. This book sold very well, and in its wake Rosenberg published A Poet's Bible, a poetic translation of several books of the Old Testament and its related apocrypha, in 1991, which won the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Prize for 1992, the first American translation of the Bible to ever win a major literary award. It was followed by \\"The Lost Book of Paradise: Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, a translation of various Edenic texts, including Song of Songs, Genesis and apocrypha, in 1993, and \\"The Book of David,\\" a poetic interpretation of 2nd Samuel and the original author. Rosenberg worked on A Literary Bible: An Original Translation, a secular, poetic version of the Jewish scriptures. It has been widely reviewed in literary journals, including The New York Times Book Review by Frank Kermode. =The Bible Unauthorized= In 1942 A. H. Moose published a volume titled The Bible Unauthorized that included a translation of the first few chapters of Bereshit (Genesis) and a \\"treatise\\" reproduced here on chabad.org that \\"proved\\" the existence of God, the Biblical account of creation, and other parts of the Bible. Moose claimed that \\"the real content of the Bible differs greatly from the many erroneous translations\\" that preceded his, and that his was \\"likely the first accurate translation\\".A. H. Moose, The Bible Unauthorized, Rainbow Publishing, 1942. Portions of the book are available online at Judaism.com and Judaism Online.

He was a medical educator, particularly in surgical residency training, and was known for his research in orthopedics, intestinal obstruction, and vascular surgery. He was appointed first Professor and Chief of Surgery at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1925 where he served until his death in 1952 from a hemorrhagic stroke. Training and professional career Barney Brooks was born in Texas in 1884, received his B.S. from the University of Texas in 1905, and graduated from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1911. While at Hopkins, he worked for two years as a high school science teacher to supplement the cost. He did his internship in surgery under William Halsted but was not offered an appointment as surgical resident, so he completed his residency at The Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, after which he joined the surgical staff at Washington University School of Medicine. In 1925 Brooks was appointed Vanderbilt University Hospital's first Professor and Chief of Surgery, in part due to a strong recommendation from Halsted, despite the fact that Halsted had denied him a residency position years earlier. At both at Washington University and Vanderbilt Brooks established productive laboratories in surgical pathology. At Vanderbilt Brooks introduced an Amphitheater Clinic, in which medical students were called down to answer questions on the case being presented, an intense and unforgettable experience for the students. Leisure and Health Brooks was an avid golfer who disregarded the limitations of inclement weather. When it was too dark to golf, he was known to play bridge. He suffered from hypertension for many years resulting in complications of congestive heart failure beginning in 1949, a left-sided stroke resulting in right hemiplegia in 1951, and finally a fatal right-sided cerebral hemorrhage in 1952.

Its advertising tagline was: \\"Honeymoon's over. It's time to get married.\\" Screenwriter Julius J. Epstein was nominated for an Oscar for adapting the story from the 1968 novella Witch's Milk by Peter De Vries. Epstein later adapted another De Vries novel for the film Reuben, Reuben.  Plot  Tillie Schlaine is introduced to Pete Seltzer at a party. Her friends Gertrude and Burt are the hosts and attempting to fix her up. Pete is a confirmed bachelor with eccentric habits. When he isn't doing odd motivational research for a San Francisco firm, he plays ragtime piano, and makes bad puns. He periodically pops in and out of Tillie's life, going days without calling, but showing up spontaneously at her door. When they finally make love, he learns Tillie is a virgin. It appears Pete might still be seeing other women, but when he gets a promotion at work, Tillie announces it's time to get married. They do, then buy a house, and have a baby boy. Pete's affairs, however, apparently continue, Tillie even needing to discourage one of his young lovers at lunch. Years go by until one day, 9-year-old son Robbie is stricken with a fatal illness. Pete tries to shield the boy by keeping him in what Tillie calls \\"a world of nonsense\\", but the inevitable death destroys Tillie's religious faith, and ruptures their marriage. Tillie abstains from sex, while Pete turns to drink and takes an apartment. Tillie's depression is alleviated a bit by a friendship with Jimmy, who is gay, but willing to marry her if that would make Tillie happy. When she and Jimmy conspire to make Gertrude reveal her true age at long last, the result is a public brawl between the two women. Tillie ends up in a sanitarium. Her life has come to a standstill until Pete turns up one day. When she sees the way their son's death affects him, after his years hiding it, Tillie and Pete leave side by side.

From 1958 until 1968 she was assistant professor in the department of geology at Comenius University, Bratislava. Since her retirement from the Department of Mineral Resources, New South Wales, Australia in 1987, Scheibner has been active in the anti-vaccination field, writing and giving lectures opposing vaccines and vaccinations. A number of critics have questioned her qualifications, research abilities, and honesty.  Education and career  Viera Scheibner was born in Bratislava (formerly Czechoslovakia, now Slovak Republic). In 1953, Scheibner studied medicine for one year at Masaryk University in Brno (Faculty of Medicine). She did not complete her studies, and obtained no medical qualifications. She then enrolled in the Faculty of Sciences (Geology), and in 1954 transferred to the Comenius University in Bratislava where she graduated in 1958 under prof. D. Andrusov. During 1958‚Äì1961, she became a lecturer in the Department of Geology and Palaeontology of the Comenius University, Bratislava and was also a Senior Lecturer 1962‚Äì1967, at the Department of Geology and Palaeontology at Comenius University. Scheibner was awarded a doctorate in Natural Sciences (RNDr.) from the Comenius University in Bratislava in 1964. In 1967‚Äì1968 she served as Senior Associate Professor (Docent) at the Department of Geology and Palaeontology of Jan Amos Comenius University, Bratislava. In 1968, Scheibner together with her husband Ervin Scheibner emigrated to Australia and assumed a position as a micro-palaeontologist with the Geological Survey of New South Wales, Department of Mines, later becoming the Department of Mineral Resources. The primary emphasis of Scheibner's work in Australia with the NSW Department of Mines was the study of the Cretaceous and Permian Foraminifera of the Great Australian Basin in New South Wales. She also studied the South Australian and Carnarvon Basins in Western Australia, South Africa and the Indian Peninsula, and the Permian Foraminifera of the Sydney Basin. From 1972 to 1976 Scheibner was invited to participate in the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) conducted under the auspices of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The results of these studies were published in the Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). Views on vaccines=Sudden infant death syndrome Scheibner began claiming that there is a link between vaccination and SIDS in the early 1990s, and in a book Vaccination... published in 1993. In the book and subsequently, she has speculated that \\"vaccination is the single biggest cause of SIDS\\". However data shows that since she began making her claims, vaccination rates for Birth to 2-years component of the Immunisation Schedule in Australia increased from 53% in 1990 to 92% in 2006, while SIDS deaths fell by 81% over the same period. A 2007 meta-analysis found that vaccines halve the risk of SIDS. Scheibner claimed that when Japan paused their Pertussis vaccination program in 1974, SIDS deaths disappeared in the country. However, Victorian medical practitioner Stephen Basser said that the studies Scheibner cited did not support her statements and that she had omitted information [from the studies] which did not support her position, including data showing pertussis mortality in Japan increased 800% in the five years following the pause in Pertussis vaccination. Shaken baby syndrome Scheibner claims that injuries and death attributed to shaken baby syndrome, including retinal bleeding, broken bones, fractured skulls and detached retinas are actually caused by vaccination although no science supports this claim.  Criticisms  Dr Stephen Basser has written an extensive critical review of \\"the quality of the science of ... Scheibner\\" entitled Anti-immunisation scare: The inconvenient facts. One of his criticisms involves a conclusion Scheibner makes regarding a potential correlation between SIDS and immunisation in Japan. After review of her principal sources and her resultant conclusion, he states that her analysis of the sources \\"is at best sloppy, and at worst blatantly dishonest.\\" Overall, he found that her claims - in particular in regard to measles vaccinations and the DPT vaccine - are not supported by scientific evidence, and concludes that \\"the gaps in her research in this area call into question her objectivity and cast doubts on her ability to speak as an expert witness\\". In addition, an extensive critique of her claims and qualifications has been published in a 2005 article in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics. Two of the authors of that article had also previously described Scheibner's book Vaccination: 100 years of orthodox research shows that vaccines represent an assault on the immune system as \\"highly inaccurate\\" in a 2000 article in the journal Pediatrics. Commissioner William Carter, Q.C., who was hearing a Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission enquiry in which Viera Scheibner was called as a witness, dismissed her claims on the subject of vaccines, finding that he was unsatisfied with her formal qualifications and professional experience, which he found did not \\"properly equip her to provide a valid professional opinion on the complex subject of immunology\\".. As a result, he was unwilling to accept her evidence in the enquiry. In 2001, Brian Pezzutti criticised Viera's anti-vaccination campaigning in the NSW Legislative Council, describing Scheibner as providing \\"misleading information\\", and highlighting her March letter to the Medical Observer which \\"makes claims that are not supported by the documentation she referred to\\". Pezzutti stated that it was \\"very important for people to realise that the information provided by Dr Scheibner is not accurate\\". In 1997, the Australian Skeptics awarded her the \\"Bent Spoon Award\\". This award is presented annually to the Australian \\"perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of pseudoscientific piffle\\": : \\"The unanimous choice of the judges was Dr Viera Scheibner for her high profile anti-immunisation campaign which, by promoting new age and conspiracy mythology and by owing little to scientific methodologies or research, poses a serious threat to the health of Australian children.\\"  Publications  * 1993 Vaccination: 100 years of orthodox research shows that vaccines represent an assault on the immune system, * 2000 Behavioural Problems in Childhood,  See also  * List of vaccine topics  References  External links  * Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Slovak non-fiction writers Category:Slovak geologists Category:Anti-vaccination activists Category:Australian people of Slovak descent Category:People from Bratislava Category:Micropaleontologists Category:Slovak paleontologists Category:Masaryk University alumni ","title":"Viera Scheibner"},{"id":"3567747","text":"Hernando (Boy) Alano (born March 20, 1941 in Manila) is a Filipino actor and former child actor.

The length of the church is 40 meters, breadth 30 meters and height 45 meters. The church has 2,000 seats and is thus the second biggest wooden church in Finland. The bell tower has two bells, a smaller one from 1765 and a larger one from 1906. The altar painting was done by Johan Kortman in 1893. The organ was originally made by Jens Zachariassen in 1906 (25 stops). In 1981, the Organ Factory of Kangasala (Kangasalan urkutehdas) made a new organ (33 stops) using 20 stops from the original organ. The first church in Hein√§vesi was a small chapel, built in 1748.

The garden is located in Belgrade's municipality of Stari Grad and is an administered by the University of Belgrade's Biology School. It has been declared a natural monument in 1995 and a cultural monument in 2007.  Location  Jevremovac is located in the westernmost part of the Palilula neighborhood, but after the changes of the municipal administrative borders in 1952, 1955 and 1957, it didn't become part of the municipality of Palilula but of Stari Grad. It is bounded by the Boulevard of despot Stefan and the streets of Takovska, Dalmatinska, Palmotiƒáeva and Vojvode Dobrnjca.  Botanical garden = History  The botanical garden was founded in 1874 by the decree of the Ministry of Education of the Kingdom of Serbia, at the suggestion of the botanist Josif Panƒçiƒá, who also became its first manager. Original lot assigned to Panƒçiƒá was on the bank of the Danube, in the neighborhood of Dorƒáol. Lots were abandoned by the ethnic Turks who left Belgrade after Turkish military garrison left the city, too, in 1867. City donated 1,400 ducats and Panƒçiƒá arranged it, bit by bit. Terrain was adapted, and an embankment on the Danube was constructed. Panƒçiƒá was pleased that the lot was in the vicinity of the downtown and the Kalemegdan Park, so that Belgraders can visit the garden with ease. The lot was parceled into several separate garden areas, a house for the gardener was built and the garden was officially opened in 1880. However, proximity of the garden to the Danube didn‚Äôt bode well for the development of the garden due to the flooding, despite the embankment. Panƒçiƒá applied for another patch of land, but died in 1888. One month after his death, in October 1888, major flood destroyed almost everything Panƒçiƒá planted. A year later, in 1889, even bigger flood inundated the remnants of the garden under a water one meter deep and destroyed everything that survived from the previous flood. Only some specimen, transferred to the garden of the Red Cross, survived. The garden became unusable. In Panƒçiƒá‚Äôs honor, in 1889, king Milan Obrenoviƒá donated the estate (former orchard and vineyard, inherited from his grandfather Jevrem Obrenoviƒá) to the Great School in Belgrade for the purpose of the construction of new botanical garden, provided that it be named \\"Jevremovac\\" (Serbian for \\"Jevrem's garden\\"), after his grandfather. At the time, the estate was on the outskirts of Belgrade, but soon city spread further from it, leaving the garden as an urban oasis. It exists to this day at the same location and under the same name and gave its name to the small surrounding neighborhood. Apart from its founder, Josif Panƒçiƒá, very important for the development and growth of Jevremovac was its longtime manager (1906‚Äì1934), Nedeljko Ko≈°anin under whose supervision botanical garden lived its 'golden age'. Present manager (2011) is prof. Petar Marin. After World War II, new Communist authorities suppressed public usage of word Jevremovac, so it was simply known as \\"botanical garden\\" until the 1990s when Jevremovac came into common usage again. Also, arboretum was very neglected for decades (number of plants was reduced from 4,000 to 2,500) and only recently began its partial renovation and beautification. It now hosts 60,000 visitors a year, and is the second most visited natural monument in Serbia, after the mountain and national park Kopaonik. Magnolias in Jevremovac  Arboretum  Jevremovac in Belgrade, Japanese garden Quercus trojana, Botanical garden Jevremovac The arboretum spreads over the area of of open space and hosts 2,500 different plant species. That includes over 250 species of trees and bushes including local, European and exotic plants. The total plant population now includes about 500 trees, bushes and herbaceous plants. Curiosity is a 150 years old oak Quercus trojana, believed to be a remnant of the vast oak woods common in this area. The oak itself is declared a natural monument. Actually, there are trees which are natural offspring of the trees which made forest in the original Obrenoviƒá garden, which was cleared when the garden was formed. They include Turkey oak, ash, beech and pedunculate oak. Some are originating from the 1960s. Among numerous other, later planted species, there are giant sequoia, ginkgo biloba, Mexican palm, ephedra, etc. Besides the open space, the arboretum also includes a greenhouse and the Institute of Botany's premises (administrative building, herbarium, library, lecture hall and laboratories). In front of the administrative building, a bust of the former manager Nedeljko Ko≈°anin was erected in 2006, celebrating 100 years of his appointment. As the majority of garden is in the open, the birds are nesting in the canopies. Most abundant are the crows and nightingales. Parts of the arboretum are European garden and a Japanese garden, which was opened on 18 May 2004. The Japanese garden is created by Vera and Mihailo Grbiƒá, landscape architects, and covers an area of . The garden includes artificial water flow over the cascades and the central pond with water lilies. The pond is filled from the natural spring, located almost below the ground. European garden was opened in 2006. The arboretum is open to visitors from May 1 to November 1 (09.00 a.m. ‚Äì 07.00 p.m.).  Greenhouse  The greenhouse, built in 1892, covers an area of . The parts of the greenhouse were transported from Germany, and it took 6 month to reassemble the object. At the time of its construction, it was one of the biggest greenhouses in this part of Europe. Over 1,000 species of tropical and sub-tropical plants are being nursed, including Canary Island Date Palm, European Fan Palm, and Peruvian cactus (Cereus peruvianus). The greenhouse is protected by the law for its architectural values. It consists of two wings, which are connected via the central dome. It was reconstructed in 1970. After partially collapsing in June 2005, it was thoroughly reconstructed, that is, completely deconstructed and then built again, from 2012 to 3 October 2014. Some of the exhibits in the greenhouse are wild banana tree, coffee tree and numerous orchids. There is a collection of 400 cacti species.  Herbarium  The herbarium, founded in 1860 and named after Josif Panƒçiƒá, accommodates rich collections of plants originating from the Balkan peninsula and the rest of Europe containing around 120,000 herbarium sheets and over 300,000 dried specimens. It includes 16,000 sheets originally gathered by Panƒçiƒá himself and specimens of some species which are extinct today.  Library  The library is one of the oldest and the largest in this part of the world. It was founded in 1853 at the Belgrade Lyceum, where Panƒçiƒá was a professor at the time. Apart from 200 scientific and professional magazines it also accommodates over 6,000 books, including Pliny the Elder‚Äôs Natural History, printed in 1562.  Underground  During one of the reconstructions of the administrative building, two underground rooms with oval-shaped ceilings were accidentally discovered when a wall collapsed. They are assumed to be part of Belgrade‚Äôs lagums, vast web of underground corridors which spread beneath the surface of the city. As the temperature, even at the highest, never goes over 20 Celsius, it was used as a huge refrigerator where food and wine were cooled and preserved for the royal court, which is why they are called \\"King‚Äôs ice- cellars\\". They cover and have a draining well at the center which drained the water from melted ice. Ice itself was brought during the cold winters when the Danube would freeze. Food was kept in the layers of ice and straw. Due to the high humidity and moisture, electricity can‚Äôt be introduced, so they are not opened for public. Another lagum is close to the greenhouse. During the both World Wars, it was used as a shelter, but today is also inaccessible because it is flooded by the underground water. During the creation of the Japanese garden, a flow of underground water was discovered near lagum at the depth of 92 meters. Water is of an excellent quality and is used for watering plants in the garden and for filling artificial ponds.  Panƒçiƒá gallery  In 1994 construction of an object, which covers , began by the Ministry of Culture. The legal permits weren't obtained, so only the concrete skeleton was built by 1995 when the construction was halted. By this time, already DM1 million was spent on the project. The object was covered with the temporary wooden roof and left to the elements. 2019-2020 surveys showed that, apart from the rotten wooden cover, the object was in excellent shape. In May 2020 it was announced that the object will be legalized, finished and adapted into the gallery of Josif Panƒçiƒá. Exhibits will include his personal belongings, works, books, herbarium from the 1850s and digitalisation of his complete legacy. There are also plans for several small, science-promoting laboratories within the object, zoological and botanical collections, seed bank of Serbian autochthonous plant species and auditorium for 190 people. When the project is greenlighted, it should be finished in only 2 months.  In popular culture  Jevremovac is also a place where exhibitions, concerts, theatre shows and fashion shows are held. Movies, which used the settings of the garden include We Are Not Angels (1992), Obituary for Escobar (2008) and Montevideo, God Bless You! (2010), while their music videos shot here Leo Martin and Legende.  Neighborhood  The First Town Hospital, built in 1868 The neighborhood is wider than the garden itself. It is bounded by the streets of Bulevar despota Stefana on the north (dividing it from the neighborhoods of Stari Grad and, further, Viline Vode), Cvijiƒáeva on the west (Profesorska Kolonija), Takovska on the southeast and south (Stara Palilula, Ta≈°majdan), Svetogorska on the southwest (Dva Bela Goluba) and Palmotiƒáeva (Kopitareva Gradina). The First Town Hospital, built in 1868, the first building purposely to serve as a hospital in Belgrade, is located in the neighborhood. Other public buildings include elementary school \\"Vuk Karad≈æiƒá\\" and Belgrade Institute for Urbanism.  Major features  First Town Hospital = House of Filip Filipoviƒá = The House of Filip Filipoviƒá at 37 Takovska Street. It was built in c. 1900, declared a cultural monument in 1984 and demolished in 2018 The house at 37 Takovska Street, the House of Filip Filipoviƒá, was declared a cultural monument in 1984. It was a semi-detached ground floor house (\\"twin house\\"), quite common in the suburbia of Belgrade, including Palilula, at the time. It was built in c. 1900. After 1912, a top Communist official and elected mayor of Belgrade in 1920 Filip Filipoviƒá lived in the house. It was declared a cultural monument only because of the historic value, not architectural one. By 2018 the house was completely neglected and became derelict. The Institute for the protection of the monuments allowed it to be demolished and for a 6-storey hotel to be built instead. The house was demolished in the autumn of 2018. However, the investor didn't follow the construction and safety laws. They usurped the pedestrian sidewalk and placed a tower crane on it, right above the underground waterworks grid. Additionally, they encased in concrete the waterworks and other communal infrastructure, walling it in into the load-bearing wall of the future building's foujndation. After two bursts of the water pipes in December 2018, the second time right below the crane, water undermined the base of the crane which tilted. This became a major city news as the streets were closed, police blocked the area, neighborhood was cut from the water supplies and residents of the surrounding buildings were resettled. It took almost two days for the communal services to dismantle the leaning crane. The pipes continued to burst in the next period.

He commanded the Wellington Infantry Battalion during the Gallipoli Campaign, and was killed in action during the Battle of Chunuk Bair. Born in England, Malone emigrated to New Zealand in 1880 and joined the New Zealand Armed Constabulary. After two years service in the Taranaki region, he worked at Opunake and later took up farming on land he bought with his brother near Stratford. He studied to become a lawyer and worked in New Plymouth in partnership with other lawyers but later set up his own practice in Stratford. A volunteer in New Zealand's militia, he helped raise the Stratford Rifle Volunteers. When the militia was abolished and replaced with the Territorial Force, he was made commander of 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles). Following the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and was appointed commander of the Wellington Infantry Battalion. He led the battalion through training in Egypt and during the Gallipoli Campaign until his death at Chunuk Bair in Gallipoli. Early life William George Malone was born in Lewisham, a village in Kent, England, the second of five children of Louisa and Thomas Malone. His father was a chemist who worked in London for the photography pioneer Henry Fox Talbot. Thomas Malone died in 1867 at the age of 44, which placed his family in reduced financial circumstances. William Malone was initially educated at St. Joseph's College in Clapham, London before receiving further schooling at Marist boarding schools in both England and France, and becoming fluent in French. After completing his education in 1876, he became an office worker in London. His military career began with his enlistment with the City of Westminster Rifle Volunteers, and he also served for a time in the Royal Artillery Volunteers. Life in New Zealand Malone immigrated to New Zealand in January 1880. His older brother, Austin, had previously moved to New Zealand and was serving in the New Zealand Armed Constabulary. A month after his arrival, Malone joined his brother in service with the Armed Constabulary. Both brothers were based at Opunake, in the Taranaki region. Malone took part in the storming of the village of Parihaka on 5 November 1881. Malone left the Armed Constabulary after two years service and became involved in surfboats which unloaded cargo at Opunake. With his brother, who had left the Armed Constabulary in November 1880, he eventually bought a large block of bush country near Stratford and took up farming. Within a few years, his land had been converted into productive farmland. By this time, his mother and two sisters had also immigrated to New Zealand to join them in Stratford. He was also involved in the local militia, the Stratford Rifles. In 1886, Malone married Elinor Lucy (n√©e Penn). The couple would eventually have five children, a daughter and four sons. As well as supporting his young family he found time to take an active role in the Stratford community. He was a member of the Hawera County Council as well as the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board. From 1890, in addition to his farming, Malone also worked as a land agent. Later, he helped found the Stratford County Council and served as its first clerk and treasurer from 1891 to 1900. Malone took up the study of law, becoming a solicitor in 1894 and a barrister five years later. In 1903, the same year that he and his family moved to New Plymouth, he formed a partnership dealing mostly with land transactions with James McVeagh and W. D. Anderson. The partners would open several law offices around the Taranaki region. On 18 June 1904, Malone suffered the loss of his wife Elinor in childbirth. Their baby son also died. The following year, Malone married Ida Katharine Withers, and would go on to have three more children. Ida had been a friend of Elinor's and had also tutored the Malone children. Malone became politically active and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent Liberal in a by- election for the electorate in 1907; of the three candidates, he came last. The following year, Joseph Ward, the leader of the Liberal Party, invited Malone to be the party's candidate in the general election. He declined; Malone had views that in some respects were incompatible with those of the Liberal Party, and he instead stood as an independent. Although unsuccessful, he gained nearly 30% of the electorate vote. In both 1907 and 1908, he was defeated by the conservative politician Henry Okey, who was to hold the Taranaki electorate until his death in 1918. In 1911, after selling his share of the law practice, Malone returned to Stratford. He started his own law firm in partnership with another practitioner. With a reduced work load, he began focus on his other interests, which included the military. Malone participated in New Zealand's militia, the Volunteer Force. In 1900, he helped raise the Stratford Rifle Volunteers, one of many units formed in the enthusiasm for the military during the Second Boer War, with himself as its captain. When he moved to New Plymouth in 1903, he relinquished his command. As a result of a request by his Volunteer Force battalion commander, Malone was made adjutant of the 4th Battalion of the Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle Volunteers. In 1905 he was second-in-command and by 1910, and now a lieutenant-colonel, he was the commander of the battalion. The following year, the Volunteer Force was abolished and replaced with the Territorial Force. Malone was placed in command of a new Territorial unit, the 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles). It was during this time that he introduced the use of the \\"lemon squeezer\\" hat to the Territorial Force. By having his troops push out its crown and indenting its sides, the hat mirrored the outline of Mount Taranaki, thereby providing a link for the regiment to its parent region, and, more practically, allowed rain to easily run off the hat. In later years, the lemon squeezer hat was formally adopted by the New Zealand Military Forces. First World War Malone had been convinced for some time that war was on the horizon and prepared himself accordingly. He studied military history and practices intensively, and underwent a physical fitness and conditioning programme in preparation for military service. This reputedly included his sleeping on a military camp bed. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service either in New Zealand or overseas. Well regarded by his superiors in the Territorial Force, he was made commander of the Wellington Infantry Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). The battalion embarked from Wellington in October 1914 for Egypt, and upon arrival, was primarily engaged in training before it was deployed along the Suez Canal late in January 1915 to support Indian troops stationed to guard against a rumoured Turkish attack. Three weeks of sentry duty ensued for the battalion before it returned to Cairo. Gallipoli By this time, the New Zealand and Australian Division, under the command of Major General Alexander Godley, was being formed for operations in the Dardanelles, and the battalion was attached to the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, one of the two infantry brigades (the other was the Australian 4th brigade) that formed the bulk of the division. In April, the division, now part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) embarked for Gallipoli. The Wellington Battalion was landed at Anzac Cove on the afternoon of 25 April, and made its way up to Plugge's Plateau. Colonel Malone at Quinn's Post, 1915 On 27 April, the battalion was called upon to reinforce positions held by the Australian 2nd Battalion along a feature that would later be known as Walker's Ridge. A Turkish counterattack had been launched, threatening the flank of the ANZAC position. By nightfall, Malone had established a new defensive line along the ridge although he was frustrated by the poor decisions by the commander of 2nd Battalion, Colonel George Braund. Malone believed Braund's actions had wasted the lives of his men. He consequently made a request to the acting commander of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, Brigadier General Harold Walker that the Wellington Battalion take sole charge of the position, a request which was approved. In the following days, Malone worked his men hard to improve the defensive positions and ensure the stability of the Walker's Ridge positions. In early May, the ANZAC positions had sufficiently stabilised such that the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was transferred to Cape Helles for operations there. Malone led his battalion during the Second Battle of Krithia, during which he came into conflict with his brigade commander, Colonel Francis Johnston, who had taken over command of the brigade from Walker. Johnston ordered a bayonet charge by the Wellington Battalion although Malone pointed out to Johnston the lack of flanking support for such a charge. Johnston was a British Army officer seconded to the NZEF, and in his private correspondence, Malone was beginning to express frustration at the inflexibility of such officers in the face of a fluid battlefield situation. Malone was later mentioned in dispatches for his work at Cape Helles. By late May, the brigade was back at ANZAC Cove and in reserve. On 1 June, the Wellington Battalion moved into the front lines, taking over Courtney's Post, previously held by the Australian 4th Brigade. Malone was post commander, and it was planned that he would stay in command at Courtney's Post while his battalion rotated with the Otago Infantry Battalion in eight-day spells. He immediately set about improving the position, which overlooked the Turkish lines. As well as rectifying the position's neglected field works, he established a squad of snipers and this proved instrumental in gaining ascendency over the Turks in no-man's land. Malone had impressed his senior commanders with his efforts at Courtney's Post and on 9 June the Wellington Battalion was tasked with holding Quinn's Post, previously held by the Auckland and Canterbury Infantry Battalions, both of which were exhausted from offensive operations. Quinn's was a more exposed position than Courtney's and had been neglected defensively. With the Turkish trenches often only away, Quinn's Post was a weak spot in the ANZAC lines. Malone immediately set about rectifying this. Terraces and dugouts were built and extensive sandbagging protecting the previously exposed areas of the position were erected. He implemented measures to dominate the no-man's land between the opposing forces at Quinn's, ordering construction of machine gun posts and loops to try and increase his men's ability to direct firepower onto the enemy. Although he placed high demands on his men, he was well respected for he also showed concern and interest in their welfare. His efforts at Quinn's Post did not go unrecognised. The commander of the ANZAC Corps, General William Birdwood complimented Malone on his work. Battle of Chunuk Bair The plan for the assault on Chunuk Bair, 8 August In August, plans were in place for the Allied forces to break out of the ANZAC foothold. Key to this was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade commenced its assault on Chunuk Bair, the crest of the range, along what was known as Rhododendron Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched in daylight rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Battalion when it attacked at 10:30am. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, then ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. According to Christopher Pugsley, writing in 1984, Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. However, in 2018, New Zealand military historian Ian McGibbon challenged the \\"myth\\" that Malone refused a direct order to make a daytime attack. He states that Malone and Johnston both disagreed with the order from Godley, the divisional commander, for the Auckland Battalion to attack in daylight. Johnston had acquiesced and ordered the attack to proceed. McGibbon said that the claim that Malone refused his superior officer's orders was based solely on the 1981 recollections of Charlie Clark, then aged 93. According to Clark, a soldier in the Wellington Battalion who was present at the battle, immediately after the failed attack by the Aucklanders, Malone advised his commander that he was not taking the Wellington Battalion up the hill in daylight. McGibbon argues that Clark was in fact referring to an argument Malone had earlier in the day with Johnston's brigade major, Major Arthur Temperley, who was junior to Malone. At dawn, when the Wellington Battalion first arrived at Rhododendron Ridge, Temperley wanted Malone to take his men up the slope to Chunuk Bair. It was this request that Malone refused, preferring to establish defensive positions instead while awaiting nightfall. In the early hours of 8 August, supported by the 7th Battalion of the Gloucesters and by extensive artillery and naval fire, the Wellington Battalion succeeded in capturing Chunuk Bair with relatively little resistance. By this stage, Malone's battalion was the only intact battalion in the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. He set about securing the crest of Chunuk Bair, but it proved difficult to deepen the relatively shallow Turkish trenches that had been captured by his men, and the work was made even more difficult as the sun rose, allowing the Turks on neighbouring Hill Q to focus their gunfire on the positions occupied by the Wellingtons. The Gloucesters, also on the crest, were forced to retreat to the reverse slope. The Turkish gunfire caused heavy casualties amongst the infantry holding Chunuk Bair, but crucially also prevented substantive reinforcements from reaching the crest in daylight. Instead, those soldiers that made it up Chunuk Bair tended to be positioned on its rearward slopes and thus had difficulty observing any approaches made by the Turks. Malone continued to co-ordinate the defences but a portion of the crest was lost. He remained in constant action, and led bayonet charges to counter numerous Turkish attacks. The trenches on the crest became filled with the bodies of dead, further reducing what little cover was available. In the early evening, at around 5 pm, Malone was killed in his headquarters trench by friendly fire, either from supporting artillery or possibly naval gunfire. Reinforcements, in the form of the Otago Battalion and two squadrons of the Wellington Mounted Rifles arrived later that evening, and the remnants of Malone's battalion withdrew, having suffered 690 men killed or wounded of its original complement of 760. Malone, along with 300 of his men, has no known grave. Two days later, Chunuk Bair, now held by British units, was lost to the Turks. With the battalion out of the line, a memorial service for Malone was held on 21 August. The service was attended by nearly all of the surviving men of the battalion. Malone was also mentioned in despatches for his leadership during the August offensive. Malone was survived by his wife Ida and his eight children. Although initially well provided with income from his farming estate, the depression of the 1920s impacted on the earnings of the farmland and Ida struggled financially. She eventually moved to England with her three children and a daughter from Malone's previous marriage and died there in 1946. His four oldest sons all served in the NZEF, and one, Maurice, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Another son, Edmond, received the Military Cross while serving with the Wellington Regiment on the Western Front. He died on 6 April 1918, a few days after being wounded. Legacy After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, while his bravery was not questioned, Malone initially came in for criticism of his handling of the defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and there were a number of crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion. In New Zealand, Malone's death was widely reported and keenly felt, particularly in the Taranaki region. The soldiers of the Wellington Regiment held their former commander in high regard and paid for the construction of the Malone Memorial Gate, white marble gates at the entrance to King Edward Park in Stratford. The gate, one of New Zealand's largest war memorials that commemorates an individual soldier, was officially opened on 8 August 1923 in front of a large crowd. The gate is the scene of an annual ceremony held on 8 August to commemorate the memory of Malone. A fictionalised colonel based on Malone was a major character in a 1982 play written by Maurice Shadbolt, Once on Chunuk Bair, which told the story of the Wellington Battalion's battle of 8 August. In 1992, the play was filmed as Chunuk Bair. A plaque in his honour was unveiled in the New Zealand Parliament's Grand Hall in 2005.

A member of the Trpimiroviƒá dynasty, he reigned with the help of his ban, Varda. John the Deacon (d. 1009) called him \\"Surinja\\" (), adopted in Croatian historiography as \\"Suronja\\", meaning \\"dark man\\" or \\"cold man\\", probably due to his temper. He was the oldest son of king Stephen Dr≈æislav, from whom he received the title of duke, and was designated as his successor. Biography=Rebellion After the death of their father, his brothers Kre≈°imir III and Gojslav started organizing a rebellion against him since Svetoslav rejected sharing power over the kingdom. The brothers had asked Bulgarian emperor Samuil for aid, even though the emperor was at war with the Byzantine Empire. In the war, the Byzantines were supported by Venice and Svetoslav Suronja, who had continued his father's policy. Samuil had accepted the revolters' invitation and attacked Croatia in 998, which started the last of three Croatian-Bulgarian wars. In his rampage, he took all of Croatian Dalmatia up to Zadar after which he ended his rampage, returning home to Bulgaria through Bosnia. Samuil gave all the territory he took to the revolters Kre≈°imir and Gojslav. Using this newly gained territory and further Bulgarian aid, the brothers overthrew their elder brother, Svetoslav Suronja, and became rulers of Croatia. War with Venice Svetoslav's reign was particularly unpleasant for the Dalmatian cities, as they were occasionally raided and pillaged by his supporters. The cities asked the Venetian Republic for help in autumn of 999, which encouraged Venice to make a pact with the Byzantine Empire in order to secure the cities for themselves.Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá, Povijest Hrvata u vrijeme narodnih vladara, 1925, Zagreb Using events like the casus belli, the Venetian Doge Pietro II Orseolo launched a campaign in Dalmatia against Croatia in 1000. During May, Croatia lost the islands Cres, Lo≈°inj, Krk and Rab to the Doge, who was eventually received in Zadar and recognised as its master. Svetoslav sent envoys to the city offering peace, but the Doge declined and decided to further his campaign. From here the island Pa≈°man was taken and, with negotiations, the city of Biograd. Svetoslav's descendant, Dmitar Zvonimir, later became the Croatian king in 1074.

It is one of the ten communes located on the √éle de R√©. History= Fortifications  Ditch and fortifications in Saint Martin de R√© Saint- Martin-de-R√© has extensive fortifications, reflecting the strategic importance of the √éle de R√©. During the Huguenot Rebellions of the 1620s, Cardinal Richelieu ordered that the island be fortified as a counterweight to the Protestant nearby city of La Rochelle on the French mainland. This included a citadel at Saint Martin. After La Rochelle had been subdued, Saint-Martin's fortification were largely demolished to remove its potential threat to royal power. In 1627, an English invasion force under the command of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham attacked the island in order to relieve the Siege of La Rochelle. After three months of combats in the Siege of Saint-Martin-de- R√© against the French under Marshal Toiras, the Duke was forced to withdraw in defeat. Later, in the 1670s, the French engineer, Vauban was commissioned to review and overhaul the island's defences and, as a result, Saint Martin was enclosed by extensive and modern walls and embankments. This was done in three major phases ending in 1702 and the end result was an enclosed town capable of housing the island's population for a long siege. Prison gate in Saint-Martin  Prison to the penal colonies  Between 1873 and 1938, the prison in Saint-Martin de Re kept prisoners before they were shipped to the penal colonies in French Guiana or New Caledonia. See penal colonies on Re Island . Population The population of the commune has remained steady since 1800, although it was considerably larger during the French Revolution and dipped below 2000 from the 1920s to the 1940s. The commune is the third-largest town on the island. With La Flotte, it forms a small urban area with 5531 inhabitants in 2008, which places it as the 11th-largest metropolitan area in Charente-Maritime and the largest on the island.

For Acts passed until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700 and the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701‚Äì1800. For Acts passed from 1801 onwards see List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a short title; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896). Before the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793 came into force on 8 April 1793, Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed.

Carfree cities greatly reduce petroleum dependency, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, automobile crashes, noise pollution, urban heat island effect and traffic congestion. Some cities have one or more districts where motorized vehicles are prohibited, referred to as car-free zones. History Many older cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa were founded centuries before the advent of the automobile. Many continue to have carfree areas in the oldest parts of the city ‚Äì especially in areas where it is impossible for cars to fit, e.g., in narrow alleys. In 1996, a theoretical design for a carfree city of one million people was proposed by J.H. Crawford and further refined in his books, Carfree Cities and Carfree Design Manual. The Masdar City autonomous PRT (Personal Rapid Transit) network runs underground and within buildings, allowing street spaces to be pedestrian only, whilst maintaining the benefits of personal motor transit. In 2006, Abu Dhabi's redevelopment agency released the masterplans for Masdar City, designed to be a highly sustainable and fully planned city. The plans were also focal on ground level street spaces being pedestrian only spaces, with no personal motor vehicles being permitted within the city confines. Thus, aiming to be a walkable city, and using fully electric, and autonomous, personal rapid transit for traveling greater distances. As part of the city council's 2014 Urban Mobility Plan, Barcelona has implemented its 'superblock' designs, wherein pedestrian-only spaces are created, encompassing the interior streets of nine city blocks (four, in some outer suburbs). Politics Some proposed car-free cities are government planned and funded, such as Masdar City and Tianfu New Area near Chengdu in China,http://www.businessinsider.com/china-is-building-a-nearly-car-free- city-2012-11?op=1 while others are planned privately such as The Venus Project designs. In places without roads there is no need for a road tax.  Effects = Advantages  The direct benefits of car-free urban designs are mainly in mitigating the negative effects found in many cities, such as poor air quality from pollutants as a result of the combustive process used in many motor vehicles, noise pollution and ground vibrations from the engine and vehicle use, and reduction of the urban heat island effect. Another would be the obvious reduction of pedestrian and cyclist collisions. The indirect benefits are predominantly to do with the revitalisation of the space triggering encouragement for people to be more physically active, whether to commute, exercise or for leisure. This in turn can help lessen the implications that come with mental health and the segregation and isolation caused by car dependent societies. Another obvious indirect effect is an enhanced sense of community, or belonging, as well as perceived 'ownership'. This can mitigate sociological tension, and further enhance public wellbeing. Braess' paradox states that \\"for each point of a road network, let there be given the number of cars starting from it, and the destination of the cars. Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favorable to him, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.\\"  Disadvantages  Car-free designs limit transport options. Cities vary in their degree of automobile dependency, and urban structure tends to follow a concentric zone model. Thus, people living in suburbs and exurbs might gain little benefit and lose convenient access to the inner city, in redevelopment schemes for central and wealthy residential areas. Process An existing city can be made a car-free city by strategic closures of streets and squares to car traffic and reserving them to exclusive pedestrian use. This is often done in practice by means of physical barriers (i.e. traffic bollards). These barriers can be fixed or movable (in which case, some traffic -i.e. public transport, vans which need to restock outlets in towns, garbage trucks, ...) are still allowed to pass but personal car access remains barred. Opening and closing of such barriers is often done manually, through an electronic passCarbon Zero: Imagining Cities that can save the planet by Alex Steffen, page 54 but can even be done by means of ANPR camera's connected to the barrier system.ANPR bollard system exampleANPR bollard system example 2 Often, parkings are created at the outskirts of the city to allow people to park their car there, and/or take an alternative means of transport into town (\\"park and ride\\"). After the closing down of streets and squares to personal car traffic, a pedestrian and bicycle network gradually emerges and joins several parts of the city. Similarly, prompted by the same need to avoid conflicts with car traffic and enhance pedestrian movement, pedestrian networks have emerged below street level (underground city) or above road-level to connect large downtown areas as in the Minneapolis Skyway System. For new areas on the fringe of cities or new towns, two new complementary ideas have emerged. The concept of Filtered Permeability (2007) and a model for planning towns and subdivisions - the Fused Grid (2003). Both focus on shifting the balance of network design in favor of pedestrian and bicycle mobility. Examples The city of Venice serves as an example of how a modern city can function completely without cars. This design was unintentional as the city was founded over 1,500 years ago, a long time before the invention of the automobile. Visitors who drive to the city or residents who own a car must park their car in a carpark outside of the city and then proceed either by foot or train into the city. The predominant method of transportation in the city is by foot, however motorised waterbuses (vaporetti) which travel the city's canals are also available. Other examples of carfree places are Mackinac Island and Paquet√° Island, where cars are banned and the main transportation is by means of horses, bicycles, and boats. The design for Masdar City adopted a car-free philosophy as part of its fundamental basis of being an eco-city. Personal cars are eliminated from the street spaces, in favour of a walkable city design, and use of its autonomous personal rapid transit network for public transportation over greater distances. The Great City, in China, is another example of a newly- developed city, designed with the fundamentals of a car-free city in mind. Several cities are partially closed to vehicular traffic. In Ghent, Belgium, the entire city heart, 35 hectares, is almost car-free: public transport, taxis and permit holders may enter but not exceed 20 km/h. In Str√∏get, Copenhagen, there is a large downtown car-free shopping area. In Oslo, cars are completely banned in some streets, and it also removed more than 700 curbside parking spots and replaced them with bike lanes, plants, tiny parks, and benches. It sees this as a major step toward a vision of a car-free city center.What happened when Oslo decided to make its downtown basically car- free?What happens when a city bans cars from its streets?Oslo Is (Almost) Car- Free ‚Äî And Likes It That Way See also * Ban on on-street parking * Bicycle City * Car-Free Days * Car-free movement * Effects of the car on societies * Jan Gehl * In town, without my car! * List of car-free places * Pedestrian zone * Modal shift * Smart city * Sustainable transport * Transit mall ReferencesFurther reading * Hart, Stanley I. & Alvin L.

Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a short title; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896). Before the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793 came into force on 8 April 1793, Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed. Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed. 1720-1729=1720 (7 Geo. 1 St. 1) * Bankrupts Act 1720 c. 31 * Bath Highways, Streets, etc. Act 1720 c. 19 * Bridlington Piers Act 1720 c. 16 * Buckinghamshire Roads Act 1720 c. 24 * Crown Lands - Forfeited Estates Act 1720 c. 22 * Debts Due to the Army Act 1720 c. 30 * General Pardon Act 1720 c. 29 * Highgate and Chipping Barnet Road Act 1720 c. 18 * Jedburgh Beer Duties Act 1720 c. 25 * Journeymen Tailors, London Act 1720 c. 13 * Land Tax Act 1720 c. 4 * Ledbury Highways Act 1720 c. 23 * Marylebone Road Act 1720 c. 26 * Mutiny Act 1720 c. 6 * National Debt Act 1720 c. 5 * Pension Duties Act 1720 c. 27 * Quarantine Act 1720 c. 3 * River Dane: Navigation Act 1720 c. 17 * River Kennet, Berkshire : Navigation Act 1720 c. 8 * River Weaver: Navigation Act 1720 c. 10 * Rivers Mercy and Irwell: Navigation Act 1720 c. 15 * Rye Harbour Act 1720 c. 9 * Saint George's Chapel and Street Lighting, Yarmouth Act 1720 c. 11 * Shoreditch Highways Act 1720 c. 32 * Silk Manufacturers Act 1720 c. 12 * South Sea Company Act 1720 c. 1 * South Sea Company Act 1720 c. 2 * South Sea Company Act 1720 c. 28 * Taxation, etc. Act 1720 c. 20 * Trade to East Indies, etc. Act 1720 c. 21 * Watchett (Somerset) Harbour Act 1720 c. 14 * Woollen, etc., Manufactures Act 1720 c. 7 17217 Geo. 1 St. 2= * National Debt Act 1721 =8 Geo. 1= * Aberdeen Commissary Court Records Act 1721 c. 28 * Bridport, Dorset, Harbour Act 1721 c. 11 * Charterhouse Governors (Quorum) Act 1721 c. 29 * Commerce with Certain Countries Act 1721 c. 8 * Customs, etc. Act 1721 c. 18 * Eden River, Cumberland (Temporary Tolls for Improvement) Act 1721 c. 14 * Elgin Beer Duties Act 1721 c. 7 * Game Act 1721 c. 19 * Hertford Highways Act 1721 c. 9 * Highgate and Hampstead Highways Act 1721 c. 5 * Importation Act 1721 c. 12 * Judgments, Wales and Counties Palatine Act 1721 c. 25 * Land Tax Act 1721 c. 1 * Lotteries Act 1721 c. 2 * Mutiny Act 1721 c. 3 * National Debt Act 1721 c. 20 * National Debt Act 1721 c. 22 * Nottingham and Leicester Highways Act 1721 c. 13 * Piracy Act 1721 c. 24 * Quakers Act 1721 c. 6 * Quarantine Act 1721 c. 10 * Salt Duties, etc. Act 1721 c. 4 * Salt Duties, etc. Act 1721 c. 16 * Sevenoaks Grammar School and Charity Act 1721 c. 31 * Shipwrecked Mariners Act 1721 c. 17 * Silk Subsidies, Various Duties, Import of Furs, etc. Act 1721 c. 15 * South Sea Company Act 1721 c. 21 * South Sea Company Act 1721 c. 23 * Westminster (Water Supply) Act 1721 c. 26 * Whitechapel Highways Act 1721 c. 30 * York Butter Trade Supervision Act 1721 c. 27 1722 (9 Geo. 1) * Aberdeen Records Act 1722 c. 25 * Attainder of Bishop of Rochester Act 1722 c. 17 * Attainder of George Kelley Act 1722 c. 16 * Attainder of John Plunket Act 1722 c. 15 * Buckinghamshire Highways Act 1722 c. 13 * Continuance of Acts, 1722 c. 8 * Copyholds Act 1722 c. 29 * Criminal Law Act 1722 c. 22 (the so-called \\"Black Act\\") * Customs Act 1722 c. 21 * Dover Harbour Act 1722 c. 30 * Dunstable Roads Act 1722 c. 11 * Edinburgh Beer Duties Act 1722 c. 14 * Fortifications-Portsmouth.

Trained during the 1930s at Prague's Charles University, Venhoda spent the war years as choral director and organist at the city's Strahov (Dominican) monastery; a book he published in 1946, called Method of Studying Gregorian Chant, drew on this experience. He first achieved an international reputation for his LP discs with the Madrigalists, which began appearing in the early 1960s and continued till the mid-1970s. These discs, mostly for the Supraphon label, included a great many world premiere recordings of composers such as Dufay, Ockeghem, Obrecht, and Jacobus Gallus, as well as of more frequently performed masters such as Palestrina, Lassus, Monteverdi, Dowland, Tallis, and Orlando Gibbons. Sometimes they included Venhoda himself at the organ. He concentrated - a singular feat, given the Czech Communist regime's ideology - upon sacred works. Venhoda's approach indicated his German artistic influences: choral singing which emphasized rich chest-voice production; invariably Teutonic renderings of Latin (quoniam would become kvoniam, and Agnus would become Agg- nus, for example); tempi which inclined to the leisured and majestic; above all, profuse doubling of the vocal parts by instruments, such as became unfashionable with the advent of a cleaner, \\"whiter\\" sound from later, English or English-influenced, early-music groups like the Tallis Scholars. Nevertheless, Venhoda's legacy remains a valuable one, as can be discerned from the power and intensity of those all too few Venhoda performances which have been transferred to compact disc. The Prague Madrigalists continue to this day, and are now led by Italian-born Damiano Binetti. Further reading * Holmes, John L. (1982). Conductors on Record. London: Gollancz. .

For Acts passed up until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700 and the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, 1701‚Äì1800. For Acts passed from 1801 onwards see List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a short title; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896). Before the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793 came into force on 8 April 1793, Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed. Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed. 1740-1749=1740 (14 Geo. 2) * Bridges Act 1740 c. 33 * Bubble Schemes, Colonies Act 1740 c. 37 * Caddington Church.

Ludwig, 2081 Timothy 4:1-4: Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: Early history The first mention of a Christian sect of this name occurs in Iren√¶us.Iren√¶us, Against Heresies: I, xxviii) They are mentioned more than once by Clement of Alexandria,Paedagogus, II, ii, 33; Stromata, I, xv; VII, xvii who saysStromata 7 that they are named from \\"Temperance\\". Hippolytus of Rome refers to them as \\"acknowledging what concerns God and Christ in like manner with the Church; in respect, however, of their mode of life, passing their days inflated with pride\\"; \\"abstaining from animal food, being water- drinkers and forbidding to marry\\"; \\"estimated Cynics rather than Christians\\". On the strength of this passage it is supposed that some Encratites were perfectly orthodox in doctrine, and erred only in practice. Origen says they did not acknowledge St. Paul‚Äôs Epistles.Origen Contra Celsum, Book V, Chapter 65 Later history Somewhat later this sect received new life and strength by the accession of a certain Severus,Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica, IV, xxix after whom Encratites were often called Severians. These Severian Encratites accepted the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospels, but rejected the Book of the Acts and cursed St. Paul and his Epistles. But the account given by Epiphanius of the Severians rather betrays Syrian Gnosticism than Judaistic tendencies. They rejected marriage ‚Äì declaring women and sex the work of SatanCyclop√¶dia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 9 John McClintock, James Strong Baker Academic; 2nd edition ‚Äì and also intoxicants, calling wine 'drops of venom from the great Serpent'.(H√¶r., xiv) Epiphanius states that in his day Encratites were very numerous throughout Asia Minor, in Pisidia, in the Adustan district of Phrygia, in Isauria, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Galatia. In the Roman Province and in Syrian Antioch, they were found scattered here and there. They split up into a number of smaller sects of whom the Apotactics were remarkable for their condemnation of private property, the Hydroparastat√¶ or Aquarii for their use of water instead of wine in the Eucharist. Suppression In the Edict of 382, Theodosius pronounced the sentence of death on all those who took the name of Encratites, Saccophori, or Hydroparastat√¶,https://www.studylight.org/encyclopedias/mse/s/saccophori.html and commanded Florus, the Magister Officiorum, to make strict search for these heretics, who were, in his view, Manich√¶ans in disguise.

The 1,170-mile (1,883 km) trail was created in 1986 as part of the National Trails System Act and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The trail traverses through portions of the U.S. states of Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana and connects 38 separate sites across these four states that commemorate significant events that took place as the Nez Perce tried to escape capture by the U.S. Cavalry. The sites are part of the National Park Service's Nez Perce National Historical Park, managed overall by the National Park Service, with some sites managed by local and state affiliated organizations. History A band of 750 Nez Perce warriors accompanied women, children and elders; the entire band numbered more than 2,900. They were parties to the Treaty of Walla Walla with the U.S. Government, and fought numerous engagements with the 7th Cavalry. Their maneuvers had several objectives: To avoid the initial violence they faced when trying to surrender to the 7th Cavalry and proceed to the reservation; to evade the 7th cavalry and reach a territory of the US where they could continue their traditional lifestyle; to escape to Canada. Beginning near Wallowa Lake in eastern Oregon, the Nez Perce headed east into Idaho. They crossed Lolo Pass into Montana and fought a major battle at what is now known as Big Hole National Battlefield. After that, the Nez Perce continued traveling south and east, back into Idaho and then into Wyoming entering Yellowstone National Park near West Yellowstone, Montana. The tribe left the park crossing Sylvan Pass and followed the Clarks Fork River back into Montana. From there the Nez Perce headed almost straight north for Canada and almost made it. The Nez Perce were near starvation and exhaustion after fighting their last battle north of the Bear Paw Mountains, less than 40 miles (64 km) from the Canada‚ÄìUS border, when they surrendered to U.S. authorities. Chief Joseph is widely credited with leading the Nez Perce on this journey. He served as a camp supervisor and guardian, who was entrusted with handling the logistics of camp and travel, and taking care of the women and children. At the time of the surrender, Chief Joseph was the most prominent surviving leader among the group; he decided it was time to surrender. A few members of the tribe did reach Canada, but the vast majority were relocated to Kansas and Oklahoma for eight years before being allowed to relocate to the reservation in Idaho, near their ancestral home. Trail description Nez Perce National Historic Trail reader board The trail passes through numerous National Park Service managed areas, National Forests, and Bureau of Land Management Public Lands. While Oregon was already a state, the other three states the trail now passes through were still merely territories. None of the forest lands were managed by the federal government, but Yellowstone National Park was created 5 years before the Nez Perce journey. The trail also passes through privately owned property and it is best advised to obtain permission to enter these areas from local landowners. Little of the trail is actually a foot trail although much of the journey can be closely followed by roads. Attempts are underway to continue to preserve right of way to allow greater access for visitors.

Inverse polymerase chain reaction (Inverse PCR) is a variant of the polymerase chain reaction that is used to amplify DNA with only one known sequence. One limitation of conventional PCR is that it requires primers complementary to both termini of the target DNA, but this method allows PCR to be carried out even if only one sequence is available from which primers may be designed. Inverse PCR is especially useful for the determination of insert locations. For example, various retroviruses and transposons randomly integrate into genomic DNA. To identify the sites where they have entered, the known, \\"internal\\" viral or transposon sequences can be used to design primers that will amplify a small portion of the flanking, \\"external\\" genomic DNA. The amplified product can then be sequenced and compared with DNA databases to locate the sequence which has been disrupted. The inverse PCR method involves a series of restriction digests and ligation, resulting in a looped fragment that can be primed for PCR from a single section of known sequence. Then, like other polymerase chain reaction processes, the DNA is amplified by the temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase: # A target region with an internal section of known sequence and unknown flanking regions is identified # Genomic DNA is digested into fragments of a few kilobases by a usually low-moderate frequency (6-8 base) cutting restriction enzyme. # Under low DNA concentrations, self-ligation is induced to give a circular DNA product. # PCR is carried out as usual, with primers complementary to sections of the known internal sequence.* Finally the sequence is compared with the sequence available in the data base. It is used in case of chromosome crawling. *Note: although the figure suggests that the circularized ligation product is digested prior to PCR, this is not the case. PCR does not require linear products and the use of another restriction enzyme to cut the known sequence could also cut within the unknown region, resulting in a failed PCR.

That day, he had been laid off from work. Coleman's case drew national and worldwide attention before and after his execution because of his repeated claims of innocence. Appeals were supported by the anti death-penalty movement. After his death, his was the second case nationally in which DNA evidence was analyzed of an executed man.Maria Gold and Michael D. Shear, \\"DNA Tests Confirm Guilt of Executed Man\\", Washington Post, 12 January 2006; Quote: \\"The testing in Coleman's case marks only the second time nationwide that DNA tests have been performed after an execution. In 2000, tests ordered by a Georgia judge in the case of Ellis W. Felker, who was executed in 1996, were inconclusive.\\"; accessed 26 May 2017 In January 2006, Virginia Governor Mark Warner announced that testing of DNA evidence had conclusively proven that Coleman was guilty of the crime. Crime Wanda McCoy, 19, was attacked in her home in Grundy on March 10, 1981. She was raped, stabbed to death, and nearly beheaded from severe neck wounds. As there was little sign of a struggle, police believed that she had allowed her attacker into the house. Her sister's husband, Roger Coleman, had access to the house and was quickly considered a suspect; he had previously been convicted of attempted rape. Coleman had reported to work that night but left after his shift was dismissed. Physical evidence at the McCoy house included a fingerprint on the front screen door, a pry mark on the front door molding, and bloodstains inside the house. The victim had broken fingernails; cuts on her hands; and a dark, dusty substance on her body. Flecks of blood found on Coleman's pants were determined to be the same blood type as the victim's. At the time, DNA testing was not available. Case At a jury trial in 1982, Coleman was convicted of rape and first-degree murder of McCoy. The prosecution for the case, led by Commonwealth Attorney Michael McGlothlin, asserted: * The lack of forced entry showed that McCoy knew her attacker. * Coleman had been previously convicted of attempted rape. * A hair found on McCoy's body was determined to be similar to Coleman's. * Blood found on Coleman's clothes was McCoy's blood type. * A fellow prisoner said that Coleman had privately confessed the crime to him. Coleman's defense maintained: * The pry mark on the door indicated forced entry. * DNA tests of the semen found on the victim's body implicated more than one person. * The prosecution said that there was no struggle, but the victim had cuts, a bruise in her arm, and broken fingernails. * Coleman had a documented alibi, and several witnesses gave affidavits. State appeals Coleman's initial appeal in 1983 to the Virginia Supreme Court was denied,Coleman v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 31 (1983) and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.465 U.S. 1109 (1984) Coleman filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court for Buchanan County, Virginia, raising several federal constitutional claims for the first time. A two-day evidentiary hearing was held, and the court denied all of Coleman's claims. On September 4, 1986, the court entered its final judgment. Coleman appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed on the motion of the Commonwealth since his notice of appeal had not been filed in time. The Virginia Supreme Court requires for a notice of appeal to be filed within 30 days of entry of the final judgment.Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:6 Coleman's notice of appeal was filed on October 7, which was 33 days after the circuit court had entered its judgment. Federal petition for habeas corpus Coleman petitioned in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia for a writ of habeas corpus. However, federal courts may generally not review a state court's denial of a federal constitutional claim if the denial is based on a state procedural default that is both independent of the federal claim and sufficient to support the prisoner's continued custody.Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991) Court's opinion Since Coleman was in procedural default of his appeal in state court, that was independent of his federal constitutional claims. That was considered adequate to support his continued custody, and he was ineligible for relief in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. Although finding that Coleman was in procedural default, the District Court addressed all of his claims and found them without merit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling, as did the US Supreme Court in 1991. Controversy and execution In 1990, Coleman's DNA was tested. He was found to be within the 2% of the population who could have committed the crime.\\"Tests Reaffirm Coleman's Guilt\\", Richmond Times- Dispatch, 12 January 2006. Some argued that DNA and blood tests combined reduced this figure to 0.2%.\\"DNA: Virginia Executed the Right Man,\\" CNN.com, 12 January 2006. While he was on death row, Coleman continued to claim his innocence. Because of increasing efforts by opponents of the death penalty in the United States, an international audience became interested in his case. Time magazine featured Coleman on its May 18, 1992 cover.Coleman on the cover of Time Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder received 13,000 calls and letters about Coleman from around the world, nearly all in favor of clemency. Wilder arranged a secret last-minute polygraph test for Coleman, who failed. Coleman was executed May 20, 1992 by electric chair. He shared his final meal with James McCloskey, executive director of Centurion Ministries, a group that had been working to prove Coleman's innocence. His final words were, > An innocent man is going to be murdered tonight. When my innocence is > proven, I hope America will realize the injustice of the death penalty as > all other civilized countries have. My last words are to the woman I love. > Love is eternal. My love for you will last forever. I love you, Sharon. > (Sharon Paul was a college student and the girlfriend of Coleman whom he had > met by mail during prison.)Law & Disorder. John Douglas and Mark Olshaker. . > (2013) In 1998, Chicago lawyer John C. Tucker published May God Have Mercy (), detailing his efforts to save Coleman from the death penalty. DNA testing post-execution Centurion Ministries and four newspapers, including the Washington Post, sought to have DNA evidence from the case re-examined in 2000. That year was the first instance of a court ordering DNA testing of a man who had been executed for rape and murder: Ellis Wayne Felker in Georgia. The results were inconclusive. In 2002, the Supreme Court of Virginia declined the request. Centurion Ministries subsequently appealed to Virginia Governor Mark Warner. On January 5, 2006, Warner ordered the retesting of Coleman's DNA evidence, which was sent to the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto, Canada. It determined that his DNA matched that of semen found at the crime scene, with no exclusions, and that there was only a 1-in-19-million chance of a random match. On January 12, 2006, Warner's office announced that the test results conclusively confirmed Coleman's guilt. Aftermath Supporters who believed Coleman's innocence had expected DNA tests to exonerate him, but they were profoundly disappointed. Some death penalty opponents had believed that evidence of an innocent man's execution would have a profound impact on the death penalty debate in the United States, where people on death row had been known to have been exonerated. If Coleman had been proven innocent, it would have contributed to anti-death penalty support. Death penalty supporters argued that Coleman's case showed that the criminal justice system was functioning in having guilty people convicted and executed, and that there was no move to abolish imprisonment even though someone might be mistakenly convicted.

For Acts passed from 1801 onwards see List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain did not have a short title; however, some of these Acts have subsequently been given a short title by Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (such as the Short Titles Act 1896). Before the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793 came into force on 8 April 1793, Acts passed by the Parliament of Great Britain were deemed to have come into effect on the first day of the session in which they were passed. Because of this, the years given in the list below may in fact be the year before a particular Act was passed. From the session 38 Geo. 3 onwards, \\"Public Acts\\" were separated into \\"Public General Acts\\" and \\"Public Local and Personal Acts\\". 1780‚Äì1789=1780 (20 Geo. 3) * Aberystwyth Harbour Act 1780 c. 26 * Appropriation Act 1780 c. 62 * Audit of Public Accounts Act 1780 c. 54 * Banbury Road Act 1780 c. 67 * Bedford and Buckingham Roads Act 1780 c. 68 * Bounty on Corn Act 1780 c. 31 * Burford to Preston Road Act 1780 c. 76 * Chatham - Fortifications Act 1780 c. 49 * Completion of Somerset House Act 1780 c. 40 * Continuance of Acts Act 1780 c. 4 * Continuance of Acts Act 1780 c. 5 * Continuance of Laws Act 1780 c. 19 * Customs Act 1780 c. 7 * Customs Act 1780 c. 25 * Customs Act 1780 c. 30 * Denbigh Flint and Carnarvon Roads Act 1780 c. 97 * Derby and Nottinghamshire Roads Act 1780 c. 74 * Devon Roads Act 1780 c. 79 * Duties on Malt, etc. Act 1780 c. 35 * East India Company Act 1780 c. 56 * East India Company Act 1780 c. 58 * Exportation Act 1780 c. 46 * Exportations, etc. Act 1780 c. 59 * Finding of the Longitude at Sea Act 1780 c. 61 * Fisheries Act 1780 c. 60 * Gloucester Roads Act 1780 c. 70 * Gloucester Roads Act 1780 c. 84 * Gloucester Roads Act 1780 c. 93 * Goswell Street, Middlesex Act 1780 c. 48 * Guildford to Farnham Road Act 1780 c. 96 * Hamptonshire and Dorset Roads.

As a player Oakes notably played in the Premier League for Aston Villa and in the Football League for Scarborough, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Cardiff City. Oakes is currently a league cricketer, appearing as a wicket- keeper and batsman for various Oldham clubs in the Saddleworth League, including Delph & Dobcross, Moorside and also East Lancashire Paper Mill in Radcliffe, Bury. Career=Aston Villa Oakes began his career in Aston Villa's youth system. He played nineteen games for Gloucester City in 1992‚Äì93 and then had a loan spell at Scarborough in 1994 playing one league game. He finally got his chance to appear in Villa's first team at the start of the 1996‚Äì97 season. He made his debut on 17 August 1996 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday, aged 22, deputising for the injured Mark Bosnich. Bosnich's injury record, and speculation he would be leaving to join Manchester United, gave Oakes opportunities over the next three seasons and he amassed 60 appearances in total for the club. He also won seven England Under-21 caps during his spell at Villa Park. However, after the club recruited David James following Bosnich's departure in 1999, Oakes requested a move. Wolverhampton Wanderers Oakes made the short journey to First Division club Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 1999 for ¬£500,000, and soon ousted long-serving Mike Stowell as number one at Molineux. He remained as the first-team goalkeeper until September 2002, when he suffered a shoulder injury and was replaced by rookie Matt Murray. Oakes was honoured with a medal during the 2003 Football League First Division playoff final/play-off success against Sheffield United at the Millennium Stadium in May 2003. However, the fortunes of the two keepers turned in August 2003, when Murray sustained a back injury, and Oakes stepped into the breach for Wanderers' inaugural Premier League campaign. He performed admirably in what was a tough season, but was controversially replaced by new signing Paul Jones in January 2004. Oakes regained his place in October 2004, post-relegation, but lost his place through injury in October 2005, to Stefan Postma. Although Postma was later released, Murray's return to fitness meant that Oakes continued as deputy in 2006‚Äì07. He was given a free transfer in May 2007 after 220 appearances in total. Upon his release, Oakes drew praise from his former colleague Murray, stating that \\"I learned a lot from him and he has always been very supportive of me. Whoever signs him is going to have a top keeper.\\" Cardiff City In July 2007, Oakes signed for Cardiff City on a one-year deal, linking up his former Wolves manager Dave Jones. He began the season on the bench but moved into the starting XI after several errors from the on-loan Ross Turnbull. With Turnbull returning from loan back to Middlesbrough, Oakes found his only competition to be Irishman David Forde and continued in the number one spot. However, Kasper Schmeichel was taken on loan from Manchester City in late October, which relegated Oakes to the bench, save one Football League Cup game at Liverpool. After Schmeichel returned to his parent club in early January, Oakes was called upon again by Cardiff, but Peter Enckelman was swiftly signed on loan from Blackburn Rovers for the rest of the season. Oakes chose to retire at the season's conclusion, his final involvement being as a substitute in their FA Cup Final game against Portsmouth. Coaching career Oakes worked as goalkeeping coach for Wrexham between 2008 and 2015, and between 2017 and 2018. After a year with Walsall, he returned to Wrexham in 2019. Personal life He is the son of former Manchester City footballer Alan Oakes.

He is best known as the mastermind of the \\"Great Escape\\" from Stalag Luft III in 1944, but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently murdered by the Gestapo. Birth and early life Bushell was born in Springs, Transvaal, South Africa, on 30 August 1910 to English parents, Benjamin Daniel and Dorothy Wingate Bushell (n√©e White). His father, a mining engineer, had emigrated to the country from Britain and he used his wealth to ensure that Roger received a first class education. He was first schooled in Johannesburg, then aged 14 went to Wellington College in Berkshire, England. In 1929, Bushell then went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, to study law. Keen on pursuing non-academic interests from an early age, Bushell excelled in rugby and cricket and skied for Cambridge in races between 1930 and 1932, captaining the team in 1931. Skiing One of Bushell's passions and talents was skiing: in the early 1930s he was declared the fastest Briton in the male downhill category. After the war he had a black run named after him in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in memory of his efforts to organise the Swiss-Anglo ski meetings. He additionally won the slalom event of the annual Oxford-Cambridge ski race in 1931. At an event in Canada, Bushell had an accident in which one of his skis narrowly missed his left eye, leaving him with a gash in the corner of it. Although he recovered from this accident, he developed a dark drooping in his left eye as a result of scarring from his stitches. Bushell became fluent in French and German, with a good accent, which became extremely useful during his time as a prisoner of war. Career Wing Commander Robert Stanford Tuck. RAF Auxiliary and legal career Despite his sporting prospects, one of Bushell's primary wishes was to fly. In 1932 he joined No. 601 Squadron Auxiliary Air Force (AAF), which was often referred to as \\"The Millionaires' Mob\\" because of the number of wealthy young men who paid their way solely to learn how to fly during training days (often on weekends). He was commissioned on 10 August 1932 and promoted to flying officer on 10 February 1934, and flight lieutenant on 20 July 1936. Although Bushell was pursuing a career with the RAF, he was not hampered in his attempts to become a barrister-at-Law of Lincolns Inn, London. From the outset of his legal career, many commented on his ability as a lawyer, particularly in criminal defence. After a period, Bushell was appointed to military cases in prosecuting RAF personnel charged with various offences. These often involved pilots charged with dangerous flying. In October 1939, acting as assistant to Sir Patrick Hastings, he successfully defended two RAF pilots, John Freeborn and Paddy Byrne, court martialled after the friendly fire incident known as the Battle of Barking Creek. Byrne would later be incarcerated with Bushell at Stalag Luft III. From left: Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, Leutnant Eberhardt (German security) and Paddy Byrne (fellow POW) Regular military career Bushell was given command of No. 92 Squadron in October 1939. His promotion to squadron leader was confirmed on 1 January 1940. During the squadron's first engagement with enemy aircraft on 23 May 1940, while on a patrol near Calais, to assist with the Dunkirk evacuation, he was credited with damaging two Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter aircraft of ZG 26 before being shot down himself, probably by future ace Oberleutnant G√ºnther Specht. He crash-landed his Spitfire on German-occupied ground and was captured before he had a chance to hide. Bushell became a prisoner of war and was sent to the Dulag Luft transit camp near Frankfurt with all the other captured aircrew. Prisoner of war Stalag Luft III mockup. On arrival at Stalag Luft he was made part of the permanent British staff under the senior British officer Wing Commander Harry Day. The permanent staff's duty was to help newly captured Allied aircrew to adjust to life as a prisoner of war. Escape, which was regarded as an important duty of all prisoners of war of officer rank, was never far from his mind and, fortunately, he was in good company with Day and Fleet Air Arm pilot Jimmy Buckley. Day placed Buckley in charge of escape operations, with Bushell as his deputy. The three of them formed the escape committee responsible for all escape attempts. First escape The permanent staff of the camp started several escape tunnels, one of which was completed in May 1941. Bushell was given a place in the tunnel, but elected to escape on the same day as the tunnel break by cutting through the wire surrounding a small park in the camp grounds. His decision for not using the tunnel was to allow him an earlier get away, thus enabling him to catch a particular train. The exact date of the escape is not known, but is believed to have occurred in June 1941. Bushell hid in a goat shed in the camp grounds and, soon as it was dark enough, he crawled to the wire and made good his escape. Bushell was recaptured on the Swiss border, only a few hundred yards from freedom, by a German border guard. He was treated well and returned to Dulag Luft before being transferred to Stalag Luft I with all the 17 others who had escaped in the tunnel (including Day and Buckley). Bushell was at Stalag Luft I for only a short period before being transferred to Oflag X-C at L√ºbeck. At this camp he participated in the construction of another tunnel, but this was abandoned unfinished when the camp was evacuated. Second escape All British and Commonwealth officer POWs were removed from the camp on 8 October 1941 and were entrained for transfer to Oflag VI-B at Warburg. During the night of 8/9 October 1941, the train stopped briefly in Hannover, where Bushell and Czechoslovak Pilot Officer Jaroslav Zafouk jumped from the train and escaped, unnoticed at the time by the German guards. Earlier in the journey, six other officers had escaped by jumping off the train while it was moving slowly; one was immediately recaptured and one officer was killed when he fell under the wheels. Bushell and Zafouk made their way to Prague in occupied Czechoslovakia. Using Zafouk's contacts, they made contact with the Czech underground movement. They stayed in 'safe houses' while arrangements for their onward journey was being made. However, luck was not with them, and following the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in May 1942, the Germans launched a massive manhunt for the assassins; during the round-up, Bushell and Zafouk were arrested. Both were interrogated by the Gestapo and were very roughly treated. Bushell was eventually sent to Stalag Luft III at Sagan, arriving there in October 1942. Zafouk was sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz. Bushell took over control of the escape organisation from Jimmy Buckley, who was being transferred to another camp. He became known as \\"Big X\\" of the camp escape committee and was the mastermind behind the mass escapes that occurred from the camp. During his stay with the Gestapo, he had witnessed the terror and suffering of many at the hands of the Nazis and developed an intense hatred for them. His plan was to strike back at the Germans as best he could ‚Äì by organising mass break-outs from the POW camps he was in. One of them became known as the \\"Great Escape\\", which planned to allow 200 men to escape on a single night. The Great Escape In the spring of 1943, Bushell masterminded a plot for a major escape from the camp. Being held in the north compound where British airmen were housed, Bushell as commander of the escape committee channelled the escape effort into probing for weaknesses and looking for opportunities. Falling back on his legal background to represent his scheme, Bushell called a meeting of the escape committee in the camp and not only shocked those present with its scope, but injected into every man a passionate and driven determination to put every energy into the escape. He declared, The simultaneous digging of these tunnels would become an advantage if any one of them were discovered by the Germans because the guards would scarcely imagine that another two could be well under way. The most radical aspect of the plan was not merely the scale of the construction, but also the sheer number of men that Bushell intended to pass through these tunnels. Previous attempts had involved the escape of anything up to a dozen or twenty men, but Bushell was proposing to get over 200 out, all of whom would be wearing civilian clothes and possessing a complete range of forged papers and escape equipment. It was an unprecedented undertaking and would require unparalleled organisation. As the mastermind of the Great Escape, Bushell inherited the codename of \\"Big X\\". The tunnel \\"Tom\\" began in a darkened corner of a hall in one of the buildings. \\"Harry\\"'s entrance was hidden under a stove. The entrance to \\"Dick\\" had a concealed entrance in a drainage sump. More than 600 prisoners were involved in their construction. End of \\"Harry\\" tunnel showing how close the exit was to the camp fence Tom was discovered in August 1943 when nearing completion. Bushell also organised another mass breakout, which occurred on 12 June 1943. This became known as the Delousing Break, when 26 officers escaped by leaving the camp under escort with two fake guards (POWs disguised as guards) supposedly to go to the showers for delousing in the neighbouring compound. All but two were later recaptured and returned to the camp, with the remaining two officers being sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz for attempting to steal an aircraft. After the discovery of Tom, construction on Harry was halted. but it resumed in January 1944. On the evening of 24 March, after months of preparation, 200 officers prepared to escape. But things did not go as planned, with only 76 officers managing to get clear of the camp. Roger and his partner Bernard Scheidhauer, among the first few to leave the tunnel, successfully boarded a train at Sagan railway station. They were caught the next day at Saarbr√ºcken railway station, waiting for a train to Alsace, which had been annexed from France by Germany in 1871, but had since been returned to France after the First World War. Bushell and Scheidhauer were murdered three days later by members of the Gestapo, including Emil Schulz, helped by others. This was a breach of the Geneva Convention and thus constituted a war crime. The perpetrators were later tried and executed by the Allies. Fifty of the 76 escapees were killed in the Stalag Luft III murders on the personal orders of Adolf Hitler.

Gravestone of R.J.Bushell in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland Bushell was posthumously mentioned in despatches on 8 June 1944 for his services as a POW. This award was recorded in the London Gazette dated 13 June 1946. Memorials Bushell Green in Bushey is named in his honour, one of a number of streets in the area named after Battle of Britain pilots. Bushell's name also appears on the war memorial in Hermanus, South Africa, where his parents spent their last years and where they were buried.http://www.hermanusonline.mobi/hermanus- history/places-of-interest/war-memorial In 2017 a memorial was erected close to the location of his murder outside what is now Ramstein Air Base. In 1934, Bushell had fallen in love with Georgiana Curzon, but her father forced her into an unhappy marriage with someone else. For years after Bushell's death, Curzon placed an \\"In Memoriam\\" advertisement in The Times of London on his birthday, saying \\"Love is Immortal, Georgie\\". Words in similar vein are referred to in an articleSimon Pearson, \\"The love life of the Great Escaper,\\" August 12, 2013, The Times. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-love-life- of-the-great-escaper-vsd06z5zvq8 in The Times in 2013, by Simon Pearson, about Bushell's lovers. Pearson remarked that he had some years before, while working at The Times, come: > . . . across a memorial notice in the archive, which marked the anniversary > of Roger Bushell‚Äôs birth and celebrated his life.

Coalescence is the process by which two or more droplets, bubbles or particles merge during contact to form a single daughter droplet, bubble or particle. It can take place in many processes, ranging from meteorology to astrophysics. For example, it is seen in the formation of raindrops as well as planetary and star formation. In meteorology, its role is crucial in the formation of rain. As droplets are carried by the updrafts and downdrafts in a cloud, they collide and coalesce to form larger droplets. When the droplets become too large to be sustained on the air currents, they begin to fall as rain. Adding to this process, the cloud may be seeded with ice from higher altitudes, either via the cloud tops reaching , or via the cloud being seeded by ice from cirrus clouds. In cloud physics the main mechanism of collision is the different terminal velocity between the droplets. The terminal velocity is a function of the droplet size. The other factors that determine the collision rate are the droplet concentration and turbulence.

It was a long process by which Islam, though long rejected, was gradually accepted by the majority of the population. On the other hand, Iranians have maintained certain pre-Islamic traditions, including their language and culture, and adapted them with Islamic codes. Finally, these two customs and traditions merged as the \\"Iranian Islamic\\" identity.Iran in History by Bernard Lewis. The Islamization of Iran was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran's society: The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine and art became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization. Integrating a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the \\"crossroads of the major cultural highways\\",Caheb C., Cambridge History of Iran, Tribes, Cities and Social Organization, vol. 4, p305‚Äì328 contributed to Persia emerging at the forefront of what culminated as the \\"Islamic Golden Age\\". Iranian culture after Islam=Persian policies after the Islamic conquest After the Islamic conquest of the Sassanid Empire, during the 90-year long reign of the Ummayad dynasty, the Arab conquerors tried to impose Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. HajjƒÅj ibn Yusuf was not happy with the prevalence of the Persian language in the divan and ordered that the official languages of the conquered lands be replaced by Arabic, sometimes by force.Cambridge History of Iran, by Richard Nelson Frye, Abdolhosein Zarrinkoub, et al. Section on The Arab Conquest of Iran and . Vol 4, 1975. London. p.46 Accounts of violent suppression of Persian culture under the Ummayads emerge two or three centuries after their fall, in the writings of Abu al-Faraj al-IsfahaniKitab al-Aghani (ÿßŸÑÿßÿ∫ÿßŸÜ€å), vol 4, p.423 and Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´.The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries (ÿßŸÑÿ¢ÿ´ÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßŸÇŸäÿ© ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßŸÑŸäÿ©), pgs.35‚Äì36 and 48. However, after the reign of the Umayyads, Iran and its society in particular experienced reigning dynasties who legitimized Persian languages and customs, while still encouraging Islam. Moreover, there was close interaction between Persian and Arab leaders, particularly during the wake of the Samanids who promoted revived Persian more than the Buyids and the Saffarids, while continuing to patronize Arabic to a significant degree.The History of Iran By Elton L. Daniel, pg. 74 There are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as setting up the \\"dhimmah\\" to increase taxes from the dhimmis to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and by discouraging conversion.Fred Astren pg.33‚Äì35 Islam, during the Umayyad Caliphate, was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of mawali. Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues. Notable Zoroastrian converts to Islam included Abd-AllƒÅh Ibn al-Muqaffa ø, Fadl ibn Sahl and Naubakht Ahvazi. Islamization policies During the following Abbassid period an enfranchisement was experienced by the mawali and a shift was made in political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empireTobin 113‚Äì115 and c. 930 a requirement was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire be Muslim. Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the Arabian Peninsula into the new territories. After Persia was conquered, the Muslims offered relative religious tolerance and fair treatment to populations that accepted Islamic rule without resistance. It was not until around 650, however, that resistance in Iran was quelled. Conversion to Islam, which offered certain advantages, was fairly rapid among the urban population but slower among the peasantry and the dihqans (landed gentry). The majority of Iranians did not become Muslim until the ninth century. Landowners who peacefully submitted to Islam were granted more land. Having effectively been recognized as dhimmis under the Rashidun Caliphs, on the terms of annual payment of the Jizya, Zoroastrians were sometimes left largely to themselves, but this practice varied from area to area. Before the conquest, the Persians had been mainly Zoroastrian. The historian Al-Masudi, a Baghdad-born Arab, who wrote a comprehensive treatise on history and geography in about 956, records that after the conquest: This general statement of al Masudi is fully supported by the medieval geographers who make mention of fire temples in most of the Iranian towns.E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam 1913‚Äì1936 By M. Th. Houtsma Page 100 Also, Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg.170‚Äì180 Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrian, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis. At times, Muslim leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer with promises of money and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg.125‚Äì258 Later, the Samanids, whose roots stemmed from Zoroastrian theocratic nobility, propagated Sunni Islam and Islamo-Persian culture deep into the heart of Central Asia. The first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century. Richard Bulliet's \\"conversion curve\\" and relatively minor rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric Umayyad period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural Abassid period which saw the Muslim population go from approx. 40% in the mid 9th century to close to 80% by the end of 11th century. The emergence of Iranian Muslim dynasties has great effect on changing religion as Seyyed Hossein Nasr says.Nasr, Hoseyn; Islam and the pliqht of modern man These dynasties have adopted some Persian language cultural values and adapted them with Islam. Shu'ubiyya and Persianization policies Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization. Arabs and Turks participated in this attempt.Richard Frye, The Heritage of Persia, p. 243.Rayhanat al- adab, (3rd ed.), vol. 1, p. 181.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Seljuq\\", Online Edition, (LINK), p.47 In the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the Ummah created a movement called Shu'ubiyyah in response to the privileged status of Arabs. Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Aramaeans are attested.Enderwitz, S. \\"Shu'ubiyya\\". Encyclopedia of Islam. Vol. IX (1997), pp. 513‚Äì14. Citing as its basis Islamic notions of equality of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving Persian culture and protecting Persian identity, though within a Muslim context. It was a response to the growing Arabization of Islam in the earlier centuries. The most notable effect of the movement was the survival of Persian language, the language of the Persians, to the present day. The Abbasids also held a strong pro-Iranian campaign against the Ummayads in order to get support from the Persian population. After their establishment as Caliphs, holidays such as Nowruz for example were permitted after a decades- long suppression by the Ummayad rulers. The Abbasids, in particular al-Mamun, also actively promoted the Persian language. The Samanid dynasty who defeated the Saffarids, and called themselves descendants of Sassanid Eran spahbod Bahram Chobin. The Samanid dynasty was the first fully native dynasty to rule Iran since the Muslim conquest, and led the revival of Persian culture. The first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals. Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Afghan origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian. The Shi'a Buyid rulers, adopted a similar attitude in this regard. They tried to revive many of the Sassanid customs and traditions. They even adopted the ancient Persian title of Shahanshah (King of Kings) for their rulers. After the rise of the Safavid dynasty, Twelver Shia Islam became the official state religion and its adoption imposed upon the majority of the Iranian population. Iranian influence on Islamic culture and civilization According to Bernard Lewis: > \\"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained > Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, > different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new > element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable > of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic > civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in > every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of > Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant > contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, > a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian > Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas > and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle > East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. > The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of > Vienna.\\" Persians had a great influence on their conquerors. The caliphs adopted many Sassanid administrative practices, such as coinage, the office of vizier, or minister, and the divan, a bureaucracy for collecting taxes and giving state stipends. Indeed, Persians themselves largely became the administrators. It is well established that the Abbasid caliphs modeled their administration on that of the Sassanids.Hamilton Gibb. Studies on the civilization of Islam. Princeton University Press. 1982. p. 66 The caliphs adopted Sassanid court dress and ceremony. In terms of architecture Islamic architecture borrowed heavily from Persian architecture. The Sassanid architecture had a distinctive influence over Islamic architecture. Iranians, since the beginning had interest and sincere efforts in compiling the study of Arabic etymology, grammar, syntax, morphology, figures of speech, rules of eloquence, and rhetoric. Arabic was not seen as an alien language but the language of Islam and thereby Arabic was widely accepted as an academic and religious language and embraced in many parts of Iran. It was for the sake of the Qur'an and Islam that books of philosophy, mysticism, history, medicine, mathematics, and law had been written or translated into this language. Persians also contributed greatly to Arabic learning and literature. The influence of the Academy of Gundishapur is particularly worthy of note. Early Islamic era Iranian art: Ewer from 7th century Persia. Cast, chased, and inlaid bronze. New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. The New Persian language written in the Arabic alphabet with a some modifications was formed in the ninth century in eastern Iran and came to flourish in Bukhara, the capital of the Persian Samanid dynasty. Persian language, because of its strong support from Abassid rulers condoning the language became one of the universal Islamic languages, next to Arabic. The most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or live in Iran including most notable and reliable Hadith collectors of Shia and Sunni like Shaikh Saduq, Shaikh Kulainy, Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim and Hakim al-Nishaburi, the greatest theologians of Shia and Sunni like Shaykh Tusi, Imam Ghazali, Imam Fakhr al- Razi and Al-Zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Nasƒ´r al-Dƒ´n al-T≈´sƒ´, the greatest Shaykh of Sufism like Rumi, and Abdul-Qadir Gilani. In 1377, the Arab sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, narrates in his Muqaddimah:Translated by F. Rosenthal (III, pp. 311‚Äì15, 271‚Äì4 [Arabic]; R.N. Frye (p.91) > \\"It is a remarkable fact that, with few exceptions, most Muslim scholars ... > in the intellectual sciences have been non-Arabs, thus the founders of > grammar were Sibawaih and after him, al-Farsi and Az-Zajjaj.

This situation continued in the cities as long as the Persians and > Persian countries, Iraq, Khorasan and Transoxiana (modern Central Asia), > retained their sedentary culture.\\" One Abbasid Caliph is even quoted as saying: > \\"The Persians ruled for a thousand years and did not need us Arabs even for > a day.

Brill. 1960 p. 29 Social relations Patrick Clawson states that \\"The Iranians chafed under Umayyid rule. The Umayyids rose from traditional Arab aristocracy. They tended to marry other Arabs, creating an ethnic stratification that discriminated against Iranians. Even as Arabs adopted traditional Iranian bureaucracy, Arab tribalism disadvantaged Iranians.\\"Patrick Clawson. Eternal Iran. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005. , p. 17. Contemporary Islamist thinker Morteza Motahhari writes: > \\"If we pay a little attention to the prejudice and discrimination practised > by some of the caliphs with regard to their attitude towards their Arab and > non-Arab subjects and to Ali ibn Abi Talib's defence of the criteria of > Islamic equality and impartiality concerning Arabs and non-Arabs, the truth > of the matter will become completely clear.\\" The Arab conquerors, according to many historians, formed \\"a ruling aristocracy with special rights and privileges, which they emphatically did not propose to share with the mawali\\".Clement Daniel Dennett. Conversion and the Poll Tax in Early Islam. Harvard University Press. Also reprinted under title \\"Islamic taxation: two studies\\" , 1973. p. 38 Some rulers, such as Hajjaj ibn Yusuf even went as far as viewing the Mawali as \\"barbarians\\", implementing harsh policies such as branding to keep the subjects in check.Wellhausen, J. The Arab Kingdom and its Fall. 2000 New York: Routledge. Vol. 7 in a series/set p.153 The case of Hajjaj is particularly noteworthy as many reports have come down to us from his racial policies and iron tactics in governing the provinces. And yet many skeptics point to the fact that some of these reports were written by Abbasid era writers who may have had a skewed view of their predecessors. However Hajjaj was not the only case of cruelty against the Mawali.Browne, Edward. Islamic Medicine, 2002, p. 16, The non- Iranian appointee of the Caliph in Isfahan for example cut off the heads of any of the Mawali who failed to pay their taxes,Cambridge History of Iran, by Richard Nelson Frye, Abdolhosein Zarrinkoub, et al.

Colonel James Norwood, not to communicate with anyone about his experiences at Abu Ghraib. Perceiving the threat of charges and the gag order as part of a larger \\"cover- up\\", Provance spoke with the media, hoping they would investigate where the military was apparently failing to. His top secret security clearance was suspended and he was administratively \\"flagged\\" (a career hold) for 16 months, until he was given an Article 15 (non-judicial punishment). This began with the May 18, 2004 broadcast of ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, where he said, \\"there's definitely a cover-up...people are either telling themselves or being told to be quiet...many people are probably hiding and wishing to God that this storm passes without them having to be investigated [or] personally looked at\\".ABCnews.go.com According to the Stars and Stripes, Provance, \\"still speaks passionately about his dedication to the Army and condemns the few leaders above him\\". Provance told them, \\"I would never speak out against the Army, that's not what I'm doing...the Army is an awesome organization that I respect and honor...it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out\\".Estripes.com On May 26, 2004 former Vice President Al Gore referred to Provance during a speech at New York University, as the Abu Ghraib scandal evolved into a heated political debate, with the Presidential election coming up that November.Moveon.org On June 15, 2004, Jerry Fleishman wrote a profile of Provance for the Los Angeles Times.latimes.com \\"Provance speaks in a near-whisper, but he possesses a steely defiant streak\\". It was reported that he studied to be a Christian Pastor at Holmes College of the Bible in Greenville, South Carolina, \\"quitting...after raising too many questions about faith and fundamentalism\\". He then joined the US Army, enlisting in Air Defense Artillery, later tried out for Special Forces, and then reclassified into Military Intelligence. Despite his circumstances as a result of the Abu Ghraib investigations and scandal, \\"he reveres the spirit of the combat soldier\\", and worried that this was now in jeopardy. The Berlin, Germany newspaper Tageszeitung also wrote a profile. Taz.de On July 5, 2004 the German news program \\"Report Mainz\\" broadcast an interview with Provance, where he revealed that children were detained at Abu Ghraib. In response, the Norwegian government joined the Red Cross and Amnesty International in protest.Aftenposten.no Jon Ronson published the book The Men Who Stare at Goats, later made into a motion picture in 2009. Provance, under the name \\"Joseph Curtis\\" to protect his identity at that time, is in a chapter named \\"The Haunted Hotel\\". Television's Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), as a part of its documentary program, Frontline (U.S. TV series), features Provance's perspective in the documentary \\"The Torture Question\\", in October 2005. Congressional testimonies Sometime between September 3-17, 2004, Provance was sent to Washington D.C. to speak with members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and their staff, in preparation for a Congressional hearing of Major General Fay's investigation.original.antiwar.com Initially his chain of command resisted the summons, but eventually were ordered by higher command to comply. It has not been made public what happened during these meetings.Coverage in Army Times On February 14, 2006, Provance testified before Congress alongside Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer (intelligence officer) from the US Army, Michael German from the FBI, and Russell D. Tice from the NSA. He testified that at his Article 15 proceeding in July 2005, he was threatened with up to ten years in military prison if he did not accept the terms of punishment. He accepted the terms, and for \\"disobeying a lawful order\\", he was demoted in rank. He also testified about many other things before unknown or not as detailed.Humanrightsfirst.info Congressman Chris Shays (R-CT), the committee chairman, said to Provance, \\"I just want to say to you it takes a tremendous amount of courage with your rank to tell a General what they may not want to hear, and people like you will help move our country in the right direction. And so this full committee thanks you for what you have done.\\"Fas.org On May 15, 2006, Provance's interview with Report Mainz was selected among other news stories in its forty-year broadcasting history for recognition. He gave an update on that television event, describing the psychological consequences of his experiences, and how exceptional it was that both the Republican and Democrat political parties both grew to support him .SWR.de On July 6, 2006 the New York Times reported that the House Committee on Government Reform issued a subpoena to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld because he had not responded to a March 7, 2006 request for information regarding Provance's demotion and testimony.NYtimes.com Four months later, Rumsfeld resigned, citing Abu Ghraib as his \\"darkest hour\\", and ignored the subpoena. Post Army Provance was honorably discharged from the United States Army in October 2006 in Heidelberg, Germany.

In February 2007, Provance appeared in a HBO documentary, Ghosts of Abu Ghraib, where he describes the prison as, \\"Apocalypse Now meets The Shining.\\" An extended interview is included in the DVD release.Amazon.com He later wrote an article about his experience at a screening of the film in Washington DC, criticizing Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who had also been in attendance for a post-screening discussion with Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), for changing his opinions of Abu Ghraib since he'd been in contact with him.Coldtype.net Tara McKelvey published the book, \\"Monstering: Inside America's Policy of Secret Interrogations and Torture in the Terror War\\", which includes Provance's story most in-depth. She describes him as, \\"unconventional...a keen sense of injustice\\".Amazon.com The New York Times, in a book review July 2007, reported, \\"if the United States still has a chance of winning the battle for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world, then we have people like Provance to thank\\".NYtimes.com On September 20, 2007 Provance was given the Sam Adams Award for \\"integrity in intelligence\\" at the American University.Scott Horton, Harpers.org, 21 September 2007, Sam Adams Award to Sam Provance He described missing the Army \\"more than anything else\\", and that after having lost his friends and family, speaking to the media was not worth it on a personal level.Afterdowningstreet.org On August 29, 2007, Provance published an article about the court-martial of Lt. Col. Steven L. Jordan, titled, \\"Army Adds Farce to Abu Ghraib Shame\\". Jordan only received a reprimand in spite of multiple charges. Provance claims the trial was a sham and the latest example of the cover-up of the scandal. He praised the initial investigator, Major General Antonio Taguba, who had since retired, and according to Seymour Hersh said, \\"I assumed they wanted to know. I was ignorant of the setting...I had been in the Army 32 years by then, and it was the first time that I thought I was in the Mafia.\\" On January 5, 2008, an interview with Provance was broadcast on the Democracy Now! television program with Amy Goodman.Democracy Now, Democracynow.org He spoke of the troubles he was facing post-military and other details of the Abu Ghraib scandal. He lamented that \\"even to this day...there's been nobody else that has had their conscience bother them to come forward and say, look, this is what was really going on, and that it wasn't just these MP's, and that these MP's were really doing what they were told\\".

Provance was a named member of this think tank. www.pmicasebook.com On July 11, 2008, Provance gave an interview on Chicago Public Radio, www.wbez.com saying he wished he had exhausted more \\"official channels\\", but that it is speculation to say if that would have changed anything. He wanted to discuss things more with his leadership, but having reprimanded him for bizarre things like not doing his superior's laundry or not washing vehicles with water they were rationing, he felt they could not be trusted. He wanted to testify on behalf of the military police at their trials, but like in Lynndie England's case, her lawyers were erroneously told he could not be found. He compared his plight to Serpico, but instead of meeting the same fate, says he still loves being a soldier and could return to the Army, though he fears his career would be sabotaged by \\"higher-ups\\" who might fear he has ulterior motives. On October 22, 2009, Provance was given a letter of commendation signed by former President Jimmy Carter and 15,000 others, for his \\"uncommon courage in defending the rule of law and standing up against torture\\".

On May 7, 2013, the documentary, \\"Doctors of the Darkside\\";amazon.com \\", produced and directed by Martha Davis, is dedicated, \\"to Sam Provance and the courage to bear witness\\", and is screened internationally to raise awareness of \\"the critical role of physicians and psychologists in detainee torture\\".doctorsofthedarkside.com On September 10, 2013, photographer Jo Metson Scott published the book The Grey Line, which documents, \\"a reflection on the war told from the perspective of Britain and American soldiers who have spoken out against the invasion\\". Provance is featured on the front cover, and a synopsis of his story is in the book. On March 18, 2014, the war movie \\"Boys of Abu Ghraib\\" was released. It is a fictional story loosely based on the soldiers and events of the Abu Ghraib scandal, which explores the moral dilemmas and philosophical struggles often expressed specifically by Provance and other soldiers who were there. On November 13, 2016, Provance published an article on OpEd News , entitled \\"The Ethics of Whistleblowing\\". He goes into further details behind his intentions and motives in his case, as well as speculating those of others involved. It is also revealed that he re-entered the US Army in 2010, to remain \\"an agent of change\\", where he now serves in Psychological Operations (PSYOP).

Biography Tobing was a gospel singer when she signed up for the first season of Indonesian Idol, leading to some criticism since she was not considered an amateur. She was expected to represent Indonesia in the Asian Idol and World Idol competitions, but disagreement arose with the idol show management, Indomugi Pratama, and her recording company, BMG Indonesia, insisting that as an artist she should not only have obligations but also have rights. During a press conference in November 2004, the team of Indomugi Pratama, BMG Indonesia, RCTI, and FremantleMedia, who hold the license of the Indonesian Idol program, claimed they were not sending Tobing to any Asian or World Idol because of this. They considered her disobedience as her failure to behave as a good idol. In March 2005, Tobing terminated her contract with BMG Indonesia which, in September 2004, released her Idol album Terima Kasih. At her press conference, Tobing and her lawyer stated that the reason she had long been treated unfairly, BMG Indonesia had never informed her about the selling of the album and did not give her any royalties.

According to Tobing's father, BMG Indonesia had been informed about this during the parents' interview with BMG when she advanced to the finals. It became big news when Octopus Record published her old record, The Song Of Joy, around the same time as the release of Terima Kasih, her Idol album, and during her dispute with Indomugi Pratama and BMG Indonesia. The Song of Joy was recorded from 1998 to 1999, but had not been released until September 2004. According to Octopus Record, they had asked permission from BMG to release Tobing's old records. They also offered to buy the recording master from BMG so there would be no competition, but BMG refused. The incidents between some finalists and the show management, Indomugi Pratama, had actually occurred previously. One of the Top 4, Helena Andrian, canceled her contract and had to withdraw from the competition shortly before the grand final, causing her to be hastily expelled in the middle of the night from the apartment provided for the finalists. According to Adrian, around 2‚Äì3 weeks before the grand final, the finalists were suddenly asked to sign a new contract with a new show management, Indomugi Pratama, with little time to consult or think about the contents, and little information was provided regarding their future management program. Among the clauses with which she disagreed were that all finalists were bound to Indomugi Pratama until three months after the grand final, when Indomugi Pratama would then decide who would stay with them for the following three years. Afterwards, Indomugi Pratama would still continue to receive royalties for a total of 15 years.

In 2017 it was granted landmark status by the American Society for Horticultural Science.  History  The land was originally purchased in 1917. Rutgers Gardens‚Äîthen called \\"Horticultural Farm No. 1\\"‚Äîhoused the Experiment Station's peach-breeding program, although ornamental displays were also established in the early 1920s in conjunction with ongoing ornamental research. In 1930, the farm featured more than 600 varieties of dahlias and iris, including test gardens developed in coordination with the Dahlia Society of New Jersey and the American Iris Society. Trials of gladiolus were also established, in cooperation with the New Jersey Gladiolus Society. These and other displays were opportunities to showcase selected and developed varieties in cooperation with community organizations. Around this time, a shrub display garden containing over 200 species and numerous varieties was established, which remains one of the oldest surviving sections of the existing collection (which was expanded between 1930 and 1950). Some of the oldest hollies at Rutgers Gardens were planted in the late 1930s, and expanded through the 40s, 50s, and into the 60s, as part of an active breeding program. Many of these make up the foundation of what is now a significant collection. A 1936 photo of Horticultural Farm No. 1 shows a series of nine display gardens, of which the bearded iris display was the precursor to the current Donald B. Lacey Display Garden, originally constructed in 1964. Later additions and removals of plant, as well the establishment of various new ornamental and tribute gardens, have shaped Rutgers Gardens into its current form.Rutgers Gardens late in seasonThe name of Rutgers Gardens is strongly associated with that of Bruce \\"Doc\\" Hamilton. In the 1990s, despite strong opposition, Rutgers University planned to sell Rutgers Gardens for urban development. In 1993, Dr. Bruce Hamilton, Rutgers professor, accepted responsibility for directing the Gardens' management and funding. Thanks to his dedication, to generous supporters, and to the work of many volunteers, the Gardens survived for everybody's enjoyment. Rutgers Gardens was once managed by its director, Bruce Crawford, and Laura Lawson, chair of Rutgers' Department of Landscape Architecture. Still a self-supporting entity, the funds necessary for maintaining the gardens, purchasing equipment and materials, supporting salaries, and providing public programs are raised through facility rentals, special events, membership dues and donations. Every Friday, there is a farmer's market that attracts local business owners from across the county. Things that can be purchased include honey, Hungarian Rolls and dried mangos.  Collections and features  Current collections and features include: * American Hollies - one of the largest collection of American Hollies in the United States, including selections from Dr. Elwin Orton's Ilex opaca breeding program. * Bamboo Forest - a large grove of bamboo (Phyllostachys nuda), originally planted in the 1950s, with a winding path by a small stream. * Donald B.

The collection started in the 1930s and now includes Cornus kousa, Davidia involucrata, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, and Rhododendron mucronulatum. * Rain Garden - The intent was to develop a garden with positive environmental aspects, yet that remained attractive throughout the year with minimal maintenance. It contains a water feature with a 750-gallon cistern that is recharged via the rain water from the roof of a shed located 30' uphill of the garden. The water is circulated through the water feature via a pump at the bottom of the cistern through a series of bogs, over a waterfall and back into the cistern. The waterfall above the cistern is essential for permitting aeration of the water. Two layers of 2\\" thick filter material lie above the cistern to capture any sediment and debris that would otherwise accumulate in the cistern., Rutgers Gardens.

It leased a line from Woodburn to Stayton from the Southern Pacific Transportation Company in February 1993, as well as a branch from Geer west to Salem (partly abandoned in 1995Union Pacific Railroad, Short Line Railroad Directory: Willamette Valley Railway, accessed February 2009),Railroad Retirement Board, Employer Status Determination: Willamette Valley Railway Company, 1993 and purchased the property in 1996.STB Finance Docket No. 32684, 1996 The company also leased a line between Albany and Mill City in 1993, but transferred the lease to the Albany and Eastern Railroad in October 2000.STB Docket No. AB-435 (Sub- No. 2X), November 16, 2007Edward A. Lewis, American Shortline Railway Guide, 5th Edition, Kalmbach Publishing, 1996, , p. 335 History Willamette Valley Railway began in 1980, when Mike and David Root were in search of a shortline railroad to operate. They located an eight-mile shortline between Willamina and Grand Ronde, and purchased the railroad from International Paper. They resurrected a former name of the railroad, the Willamina and Grand Ronde Railway (W&GR;). The railroad rostered a single Alco S-1 locomotive and began hauling lumber from the sawmills in Grande Ronde and Fort Hill to its connection with the Southern Pacific in Willamina. Within a few years, the line from Fort Hill to Grande Ronde was abandoned; however, operations between Willamina and Fort Hill continued until the mid-1990s when the railroad was sold to Hampton Lumber Sales, the owner of the Fort Hill Lumber Company. Hampton chose to contract with Willamette & Pacific Railroad, who now operated the line into Willamina, which ran trains into Fort Hill on an as-needed basis. Shortly after purchasing the W&GR;, the Root brothers also acquired a three-mile branchline in Independence. The railroad was the remnant of the Valley and Siletz Railroad which had been previously abandoned south and west of Independence. The railroad was acquired from Boise Cascade, which used the railroad to access its timberlands in Oregon's Coast Range as well as a sawmill located in Valsetz. This railroad was renamed the Willamette Valley Railroad. The railroad now rostered an EMD GP9 locomotive and two EMD SW1200 locomotives, all of Southern Pacific heritage. One of the SW-1200 locomotives was repainted into a scheme reminiscent of Southern Pacific's Shasta Daylight passenger train and lettered \\"Willamette Valley\\". In Independence, the railroad maintained a locomotive shop to repair its fleet of locomotives as well as for other railroads. In approximately 1988, the company took on a new name‚ÄîRail-West‚Äîand began to operate the Port of Tillamook Bay Railroad, a 90-mile line between Banks and Tillamook. This line was purchased from Southern Pacific by the Port of Tillamook Bay, and Rail-West became a contract operator on behalf of the port. This arrangement lasted until the early 1990s when the Port of Tillamook Bay began operating the railroad itself. In 1992, Southern Pacific announced that it would begin the process of leasing its branchlines throughout western Oregon to shortline operators. While it was often rumored that the Willamette Valley/Willamina & Grande Ronde Railroads would take over the entire Willamina Branch, the combined company instead became the operator of the West Stayton, Geer and Mill City Branches. The Willamette & Pacific Railroad began operating the Westside and Willamina Branches which connected the two rail lines owned by Willamette Valley Railroad. The newly expanded railroad acquired two EMD SD9s and one GP9 locomotive from the Southern Pacific to help operate the new lines. Within a few years, the railroad acquired three EMD GP35 locomotives also from Southern Pacific. The Geer Branch, which was often seen as a \\"short-cut\\" from Salem, was redundant and was abandoned in 1995. The eastern portion of the branch exists to this day and is used for car storage, however much of the western portion of the branch has been removed and in some cases the original grade built over with new development (especially at the very western end, near Salem's Amtrak station. The softball field for Willamette University is located where the original junction once existed.) In 1996, the Willamette Valley Railway converted its lease into a purchase, and now fully owned the former Southern Pacific branches it had leased only three years previously. In 1998, the Albany and Eastern Railroad leased the Sweet Home Branch from the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF). This line connected with the existing Albany-Lebanon-Mill City line at Lebanon and continued southeasterly to Sweet Home. Since the 1930s BNSF and its predecessors used trackage rights between Lebanon and Albany, and was a steam powered branch off of the otherwise electrified Oregon Electric Railway. At the same time BNSF leased its \\"Oregon Electric\\" line from Salem to Eugene to the Portland and Western Railroad. Shortly after taking over the Sweet Home Branch, Mike and David Root had split their railroad into two properties‚Äîthe Willamette Valley Railway which consisted of the former West Stayton Branch, and the Albany and Eastern Railroad consisting of the former Mill City and Sweet Home Branches. Also around this time, the two Root brothers bought out their other partner, George Lavacot. George retained ownership of the two SD9 locomotives as well as the remaining trackage in Independence, now scaled back to one-half mile connecting the railroad shop with the interchange yard with the Portland and Western Railroad. The track south of the shop was abandoned and today there are no shippers or industries on this line. George uses the shop to maintain his two SD9 locomotives as well as house a steam locomotive with the hopes of restoring it. In August 2008, Mr. Lavacot sold one of the SD9 locomotives, numbered 4433, to the Portland & Western Railroad; while retaining locomotive 5399 painted in a Southern Pacific \\"Black Widow\\" heritage paint scheme.

It is located in the former city of North York. It is a teaching hospital with emergency and intensive care services, maternity and other services. Services are delivered at the main facility opened in 2015, located at the intersection of Wilson Avenue and Keele Street and close to the Keele Street exits of Highway 401. Services are also delivered at two other facilities in the vicinity. History Humber River Hospital is the merged facility of three previous hospitals: Humber Memorial Hospital on Church Street in the former town of Weston, the York-Finch Hospital and the Northwestern General Hospital. The three hospitals were part of the Humber River Regional Hospital health nework. Construction on the facility began in October 2011 on the site of a former Ministry of Transportation Ontario parking lot on Keele Street north of the 401 highway. The Plenary Health Care Partnerships consortium was the builder of the hospital. The new hospital was designed by HDR Architects, engineered by WSP and built by PCL. The new hospital opened in 2015. Ambulatory and Urgent Care services remained open at the York-Finch site, and the Humber Memorial site re-opened in 2016 to provide dialysis, out-patient physiotherapy and the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) wound and skin clinic on a temporary basis. The Finch site is known as the \\"Reactivation Centre\\" and the Church Street site is known as \\"Humber Clinics.\\" The Keele Street site was sold to the Daniels Corporation developer, which plans to build a new neighbourhood on the site. Part of the hospital's mission is to be innovative. In 2017, the hospital opened its \\"Command Centre\\" that was built in collaboration with GE Healthcare. It includes a Wall of Analytics to improve efficiency throughout the hospital and improve wait times and other issues. The hospital is North America's first fully digital hospital.

A comedic sometimes sad yet straight forward novel that captures the humor of life in boarding school, through the diary of John 'Spud' Milton. The book is written in the style of a diary. The story begins on the morning of Spud's first day at a private boarding school, following his year and experiences with the often eccentric characters found in the school environment. The diary also follows Spud's family life. A sequel, titled Spud: The Madness Continues, was released in mid-2007. It details Spud's second year of boarding school and trip to England paid by Wombat, his crazy grandmother. In June 2009, the third book in the Spud series was released. Titled Spud: Learning to Fly. This book details Spud's third year at a school based on Michaelhouse, where he is now back at school and Pike returns for Post-Matric years and is a prefect. Pike being made a prefect means the Crazy Eight are vulnerable and cannot do anything without getting in trouble. The fourth and final book in the series, detailing Spud's Matric year, was released August 2012, under the title \\"Spud: Exit, Pursued by a Bear.\\" After commercial success in South Africa (it won the 2006 Booksellers award), the United States saw a release of this book 2007. It is now available in North America. Characters Crazy Eight The Crazy Eight consists of the eight boys in Spud's year and house at school. *John 'Spud' Milton - (nicknamed ‚ÄúSpud‚Äù by his housemates because he is a Late bloomer). The protagonist. Possessing a dry sense of humour and acid wit, Spud often writes of his discontent for his life, due to the major embarrassment he gets from having deranged parents, a senile grandmother and being part of one of the most notorious gangs in the school. Frequent topics of complaint are his spudness, his low self-esteem and various personal matters, such as his shaky relationship with his girlfriend, Mermaid. Being surrounded by madness often makes him question his own sanity. Spud also writes of his acting aspirations, and has two major school plays ‚Äì Oliver! and A Midsummer Night's Dream, as well as a humiliating house play, and having directed a fourth. Despite his pessimism regarding his looks and spudness, his biggest surprise is the number of girls he attracts ‚Äì by the final book, he has attracted the attention of at least six girls. Due to his parents' difficult financial situation, he got into the school through a scholarship. * Robert 'Rambo' Black - The (self-appointed and self-nicknamed) leader of the Crazy Eight. He is known for having a public affair with Eve, the drama teacher and wife of his housemaster, and his exceptionally brutal ways. He is described as being very muscular and has black hair. In his third year, he starts to become a kinder and much more protective person, and is often seen to threaten the second years with punishment if they make any attempts at initiating the first years. * Charlie 'Mad Dog' Hooper ‚Äì A fierce and ruthless thug-like boy so named because of his hunting habits. A talented cricket bowler (has no co-ordination for batting) due to his scare tactics and high speed bowling, he appears to view Spud as a close friend, as he often includes him in hunting trips and forces him to hike with him a lot of the time, although Spud often expresses fear of him. In several entries, he cries at the idea of never seeing Spud again. In the second book, he spends a lot of time on the phone with Spud when he is expelled. Based on what Spud writes of him, he can scare anyone into submission simply by wielding his knife, and it is mentioned at some point that he has Dyslexia. After the gang visit his farm in Learning to Fly, Spud never mentions him again. * Henry \\"Gecko\\" Barker ‚Äì Spud's sickly but smart best friend. He is often sick or injured and sent to the sanitorium. Spud describes him as a thin and extremely pale boy, at one point commenting that \\"there have to be healthier looking corpses.\\" He passes away towards the end of the original novel, after contracting cerebral malaria while on holiday in Mozambique. In later years, Spud occasionally reflects on Gecko's introverted and often insightful personality in later books, often around the anniversaries of his death. * Alan \\"Boggo\\" Greenstein ‚Äì a very peverted boy with a bad case of acne. Although Spud expresses open contempt for his pick-up abilities, he is still very successful with girls and, Spud occasionally mentions several relationships that Boggo is in. A frequent topic of humour in Spud's diaries is his being caught masturbating, and having to endure the school's notorious humiliation policy whenever he enters the dining hall. He is close friends with Fatty, and somewhat friendly with Rambo, as Spud often writes of comments he makes to this effect. He does not bully people like Rambo and Mad Dog, who are very physical with their bullying, but more verbally. He is actually quite intelligent and this is evident throughout the series with his witty comebacks and one-liners, and his clever money- making schemes which, to Spud's surprise, often work. * Vern \\"Rain Man\\" Blackadder - Spud's deranged cubicle mate, who has a strange relationship with his housemaster's cat. His bizarre behaviour leads Spud to wonder if he is surrounded by madness (as he already has deranged parents and a senile grandmother), and wonders if being surrounded by madness is an indication of becoming mad. Spud at one point writes that he may have become deranged because his father died when he was young. Although Spud finds him annoying, he nevertheless grows to respect him after he punches the school bully, Leonard Pike, in the face. * Simon Brown - an exceptional sports star with braces, about whom Spud expresses intense dislike because of his arrogance and short-temperedness. He is absent for a significant portion of Learning to Fly, and when he returns, Simon's excuse is that he had feigned a nervous breakdown in order to play in an English cricket league, though Spud is convinced that his nervous breakdown was genuine. At the end of his third year, he becomes Head of House (which Rambo says he had deliberately avoided due to the responsibilities required). * Sidney \\"Fatty\\" Smitherson-Scott ‚Äì an obese boy who eats almost anything (once an old rugby boot) and is one of Spud's friends in the series. He is also an eating champion and local celebrity, having won several eating competitions. According to Spud, he got his nickname from Head of House 'PJ' Luthuli, who had a lisp and couldn't pronounce the name \\"Sidney Smitherson-Scott.\\" Fatty, due to his weight, struggles with a lack of attention from girls, although he finally forms a relationship near the end of Learning to Fly, with a 13-year-old girl named Penny, for which he receives a lot of stick from his peers. Although he starts to diet extensively while in a relationship with Penny, she eventually breaks up with him, and he reverts to his gluttonous ways. *Alexander Short ‚Äì Replaces Gecko in Madness Continues. He is forced to leave the school, fairly early on after it emerges that his dad has been breaking the law. Spud develops an intense dislike of him, both because he is rude, arrogant and unfriendly, and because he is replacing Gecko, which Spud sees as a personal affront to him. * Roger the Cat ‚Äì After Alexander Short leaves the school, the Crazy Eight decide to add Vern's beloved cat to the team. The cat, very much like Vern, exhibits traits of madness. In Exit, Pursued by a Bear, Spud writes that he has been banished to Sparerib's brother's farm, to Vern's distress. *Garth Garlic ‚Äì a Malawian student who replaces Mad Dog. Fatty often relies on him for chocolate, since his father is the managing director of Nestl√© Malawi. Spud often writes of the insufferable Garlic's incessant talking (specifically about Malawi), and how he persists with it even after being advised by Spud to keep quiet (Spud claims he has 'verbal diarrhea'). Nevertheless, Spud finds him becoming a friend. Garlic took the Crazy Eight on a trip with him to Lake Malawi near the end of 'Exit, Pursued by a Bear.' Girls * Debbie or \\"the Mermaid\\" - Spud's first girlfriend and first love. She is described as being very beautiful with blonde hair and big green eyes, hence her nickname. In the first book Spud writes of her growing depression after her father moves out. She is very fickle and has little respect for Spud's heart, twice breaking up with him on Valentine's Day - the first time after having won a beauty competition and finding a more attractive boyfriend, and the second time to become a born- again Christian and establish a close relationship with a 29-year-old cricket umpire named Gavin. These events are a frequent topic that Spud writes about in his diary, and although it appears that he lacks the self-esteem to confront her about this, he eventually finds the strength in the third book, firmly telling her that \\"I don't think we can be friends anymore,\\" although this incident brings her out in tears. Despite these breakups, she continues to hold feelings for him, and he frequently writes of their strained interaction. Their relationship eventually reignites permanently after she breaks up with Gavin in Exit, Pursued by a Bear, and she becomes Spud's date to Matric Dance. Despite their continued relationship, her poor alcohol tolerance prevents them from engaging in intimacy, which becomes a source of frustration to Spud. * Amanda - Spud's second love. She is two years older than Spud and was cast in a leading role in the play Oliver!. Spud is enamoured by her, repeatedly describing her resemblance to actress Julia Roberts, but expresses his guilt over this, as he still loves Debbie. Spud is bemused when she refers to him as her \\"boy toy\\" in the second book, due to her being in a relationship with a second-year varsity boy. She invites him to go on vacation with her during summer holidays, but his mother does not allow him. Spud writes that she has called him a 'coward,' and a 'mother lover' for this. While at a social at Saint Joan's, Spud discovers that she is head girl of her house, and he is summoned to visit her. There, she kisses him, much to his surprise. Later, while he and the other cast members of A Midsummer Night's Dream at Wrexham College in Pietermaritzburg, she sends him a painting, painted by her father, of her in the nude, which astonishes the head teacher overseeing Spud's group. Although he considers asking her to be his Matric Dance date, Spud appears to have severed all ties with her in Exit, Pursued by a Bear, after learning she had slept with Rambo on New Year's Eve, although he holds no ill feeling towards Rambo. * Christine - a girl slightly older than Spud who is something of a slut, and who seems to have taken a shine to Spud. When she acts in the school's production of Oliver!, she makes repeated advances on Spud, and occasionally succeeds in kissing him. Despite this, Spud is disgusted and slightly disturbed by her - this is exacerbated when, while at a party at her house with Gecko (with whom she formed a relationship in order to get close to Spud), she lures him into her bedroom and forcibly tries to get him to have sex with her. Based on his writings, Spud is the only boy in the entire series who turns down her advances, despite her persistence, suggesting he may be the only boy in the series she has genuine feelings for. She continues to make advances on Spud when he goes to the Matric dance with Mermaid (Christine had gone with Boggo). * Penny and Brenda - two thirteen-year-old girls Spud meets at Wrexham College in Learning to Fly. He first describes Brenda as \\"looking slightly Spanish,\\" and says of Penny \\"She had that look about her that she might be stunningly beautiful in five years time.\\" Spud writes of Penny and Fatty's developing romance over the course of his time at Wrexham, the stick he gets from his peers because of this, and his efforts to start remodelling himself to suit Penny. He later reverts to his gluttonous ways after the two eventually break up in Exit, Pursued by a Bear. Brenda, Penny's best friend, has an obvious crush on Spud, but he has no interest in her at all. * Sarah Silver - a pretty young girl Spud kissed at a social in Exit, Pursued by a Bear. After the social, she continues to stalk him through many letters and telephone calls, which he ignores, having been freaked out by her mildly disturbing personality and perverse sense of humour. * Leanne - an attractive girl Spud briefly hooks up with at a hotel while holidaying with his parents. Although they don't meet again, Spud remembers his time with her fondly, and it gives him enough of a confidence boost to get back together with the Mermaid, and to ensure he keeps her. Other Students * Mbuelo Paul Johannes \\"PJ\\" Luthuli - Spud's head of house and friend. He is also the chairman of Spud's Sunday Night club, African Affairs. He is also said to have a lisp, as seen when he attempts to pronounce Fatty's real name (he promptly gives him his nickname). He leaves the school at the end of The Madness Continues. * Julian - A very camp Matric prefect whose favourite hobby is photographing the behinds of all the first years when they are beaten by Sparerib. Spud's Head Chorister. He is also very sensitive around Spud. He leaves the school midway through The Madness Continues. * Bert - Julian's sidekick and implied boyfriend. * Leonard Pike - Spud's (and the Crazy Eight's) nemesis. He is often seen to be bullying most of the students, and often members of the Crazy Eight. He enjoys flashing himself to the members of the Crazy Eight, but this is often written off as being part of his behaviour. However, it is suggested that he has a homosexual crush on Spud, as he makes a sexual advance towards him at the end of the first book. He shows up in Learning to Fly and is made a prefect, much to the horror of the group, as they cannot do anything without getting into trouble because of him. After he is de-prefected midway through the year, he suspects Spud ratted on him for his possession of illicit items (Spud was actually doing some work for Viking). In his very final appearance, he corners Spud at the cricket nets and, to Spud's shock, proceeds to passionately kiss him, confirming that he has a crush on him. As Spud recovers from this turn of events, Pike walks away, with his last words to Spud simply being \\"Something to remember me by.\\" * Devries - Pike's sidekick. * Geoff Lawson - A friend of Spud's in a different house. He went to his farm on various occasions throughout the books. * Grant \\"Earthworm\\" Edwards - Spud's prefect, and slave master, although he is usually very kind. Teachers * Mr Edly, (The Guv) - English teacher and U/14A Cricket coach, has very interesting teaching methods and swears a lot. Befriends Spud, mostly due to his interest in literature, and his sharing a name with John Milton, one of his favourite poets. * Mr John Riley Crispo - The elderly history teacher. Spud reminds Crispo of himself when he was young and takes a likeness to him. He does not teach the history syllabus as he is supposed to, but rather recounts his experiences in The Second World War. After he dies, Spud sings at his funeral. * Mrs Wilson, (Eve) - Drama teacher. Plays Nancy the prostitute in the school play Oliver!. She cheats on her husband with Rambo. So nicknamed because \\"Eve came from Adam's sparerib.\\" * Mr Richardson (Viking) - Play director, who has directed many school plays, including Oliver! and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Referred to by Spud as \\"resident school Hitler,\\" in second book. He replaces Sparerib as housemaster of Spud's house in Learning to Fly. The same book gives his first name as Victor. * Mr Glockenshpeel, (The Glock) - Headmaster. Nicknamed because of how dangerous he can be, as well as his strange name. * Mr Wilson (Sparerib) - Spud's housemaster. Nicknamed because he lost a rib to bone cancer (although the boys believed he lost it in a lion attack in the Kruger National Park). He leaves his post as housemaster after Rambo is returned to school in The Madness Continues, although he remains a teacher at the school. * Mr Lilly - Under 14 D/E rugby coach and Spud's art teacher. His pacifism usually results in many losses for his team. * Reverend Bishop - The deranged school chaplain. Lacks self-esteem and is incredibly gullible, as shown when he believes that Fatty has had an epiphany. This may be due to his domineering wife. * Mr Lambert (Mongrel) - Spud's Physical Education teacher. He is a former Rhodesian Bush War veteran and harbours racial grudges, which he takes out on all the boys in his class, especially ones who are overweight. Nicknamed because according to Spud, a mongrel \\"best describes an animal that has no brains, no fear and no mercy.\\" He is a temporary (and extremely brutal) substitute for Viking as head of Spud's house during Learning to Fly. Fortunately, as Spud is joining Viking's play cast, he does not experience Mongrel's regime. * Mr van Vuuren - Spud's implied racist Afrikaans teacher. * Mr Norm Wade (Salamander) - Spud's implied racist English teacher in second book. Named because he has long legs and short arms. He is Spud's cricket coach in Learning to Fly and is renamed \\"Norm (I don't believe in spinners) Wade.\\" * Mr Lennox - Mr. Crispo's replacement as history teacher. After joining the school, he forms a society called \\"African Affairs,\\" which discusses the political struggle in South Africa. He is forced to dismantle it in Learning To Fly after it loses all its members with the exception of Spud and Rambo. * Mr Sykes (Psycho) - Spud's mathematics teacher. * Mr Hall - First team rugby coach and Adventure Club teacher. He apparently once threatened the team with a revolver on his hip, according to Bert, when they played Kings College, the schools big rival. * Mr Bosch - Spud's Geography teacher in 'Learning To Fly.' A naturalist at heart, he is said to have a beautiful wife (Boggo reporting that 'if Eve is a six and a half, [Mrs Bosch] is a nine'). Family * Dad - an alcoholic who is also a washerman. Appears to be completely deranged and paranoid, and regularly attempts (often unsuccessfully) to hide his racist beliefs. He is usually drunk. And later buys a dog named Blacky. * Blacky - the new family pet, who is taught to bark at black people. Although the Dad mistreats Blacky, he genuinely loves the dog. * Mom - Spud's mother who is also an alcoholic in denial. She constantly threatens to move out of the house. * Wombat - Spud's grandma on his mother's side. She is usually delirious, senile and also drunk. Also throughout the entire series she encourages Spud to \\"spread his wild oats\\", despite him being a 'spud'. She has an odd habit of referring to Spud as \\"David,\\" and his father as \\"Roy.\\" Film adaptation A film adaptation, directed by Donovan Marsh, was released in South Africa on 3 December 2010. The film stars South African-born Australian actor Troye Sivan as Spud and with John Cleese as The Guv. The film was a massive success in South Africa, topping the box office, despite the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 at the same time. The film was later nominated for six South African Film and Television Awards, including Best Feature Film and Best Actor in a Feature Film (Troye Sivan). Following the success of the first film, production of a sequel, Spud: The Madness Continues, was confirmed in May 2012, for a July 2012 shoot. It was released in 2013. In 2014, a third film, Spud 3: Learning to Fly, was released on 28 November.

The buildings were erected and occupied by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE) of 1911-1914, led by geologist and explorer Sir Douglas Mawson. Mawson's Huts are rare as one of just six surviving sites from the Heroic Era of Antarctic exploration. The Australasian Antarctic Expedition was the only Heroic Era expedition organised, manned and supported primarily by Australians. The huts included a magnetograph hut, used to measure variations in the south magnetic pole; an absolute magnetic hut, which was used as a reference point for studies in the magnetograph hut; and the transit hut, an astronomical observatory. The most important building at the site is the winter living quarters, known as \\"Mawson's Hut\\". This pyramid-roofed hut was home to the eighteen men of the AAE main base party in 1912, and the seven (including Douglas Mawson) who stayed on for an unplanned second year in 1913. The hut combines two sections - the living quarters and the workshop, prefabricated in Sydney and Melbourne respectively, and shipped to the site for construction in 1912 by the AAE team.  Radio  Using a wireless relay station on Macquarie Island, it was possible to contact the Australian mainland by radio. The AAE was the first expedition that had this possibility. Meteorological observations got transmitted by the system continuously. It was the first use of radio on the Antarctic continent.  The main hut  The main hut included facilities for eighteen men but it only measured , an area of . The adjoining workshop measured , an area of . On three sides the building is surrounded with wide verandas. The Verandas were used for many different things including housing the sled dogs. The main hut contains a kitchen, a laundry, a storage and a sleeping room.  Conservation and heritage recognition  Australian National Heritage Site. Expeditions undertaken by the Australian government (through the Australian Antarctic Division since the late 1970s) and private non-profit conservation organisations (notably the two Project Blizzard expeditions of 1984/85 and 1985/86, and the Mawson's Huts Foundation since 1997) have carried out conservation research, surveys and work on the huts. In addition to archaeological recording, removal of snow from inside the huts and ongoing maintenance, recent interventions (1998 and 2006) have been to encapsulate the failing timber roofs with new timber over-cladding in order to weatherproof the interiors. The site is recognised under the Antarctic Treaty as a Historic Site & Monument (HSM 77) since 1972, and placed within an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 162) and an Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA 3) in 2004. It is also on the Australian National Heritage List, Commonwealth Heritage List and the defunct Register of the National Estate. The Australian Antarctic Division and the Australian Minister for the Environment & Water Resources released for public comment a new management plan for the Mawson's Huts Historic Site in July 2007. The plan set out the principles that guided activities to preserve the heritage values of the site in the lead-up to the centenary of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition.  Travel to Mawson's Huts  Chimu Adventures operate a voyage to Mawson's Huts every year from Hobart, Tasmania. The voyages generally stop at Macquarie Island en route and return via the New Zealand sub Antarctica islands.

It was adapted from the cyberpunk role- playing game Shadowrun by FASA, and was developed by BlueSky Software. The game is the second video game adapted from Shadowrun, and has a more open ended style of gameplay than its 1993 Super NES counterpart, Shadowrun by Beam Software. Gameplay Shadowrun's battle gameplay Shadowrun offers the player an open style of gameplay, where one controls the main character, Joshua, in third person perspective during both exploration and combat. Battles are real time, and although of varying difficulty, tend to be relatively short. Initially, the player is restricted to a single area of the game, but shortly gains access to almost all other areas. Access to other areas is accomplished primarily by taxi, although various restrictions and other modes of travel also exist, such as requiring a visa or bypassing the visa check with the use of a helicopter. As in most role-playing video games, the characters' skills and attributes can be improved. However, Shadowrun uses a unique \\"Karma\\" system, which allows full character customization. Karma, roughly equivalent to experience, is earned for successfully completing a run, killing enough enemies, or advancing the game's plot. Karma is then spent on specific stats as determined by the player. To earn money and Karma, the player must participate in shadowruns, illegal jobs provided by pseudo-anonymous contractors who are, within the legal boundaries of their work, referred to simply as Mr. Johnsons. Mr. Johnsons usually are corporate liaisons who want their bosses' dirty work done without compromising them. All Mr. Johnsons work in backroom booths in different clubs and bars through the city. Depending on the Johnson, they will randomly offer different types of jobs such as raiding gang hangouts, search & retrieval, extractions, courier missions, ghoul hunting, or Matrix runs. Each mission will vary on the specifics to meet the requirements and location such as Megacorp headquarters or even the LoneStar's main building. Different Mr. Johnsons have varying levels of difficulty and pay for their jobs, which can be influenced by the player's negotiation statistic. (Note: In this game, the term \\"Mr. Johnson\\" is used where the word \\"fixer\\" would be used in the tabletop game. In the tabletop game, the player would know the handle of his fixer but the actual client would remain anonymous, hence \\"Mr. Johnson.\\" In this video game, the fixers are known both by their handles and \\"Mr. Johnson,\\" while also revealing the clients‚Äô names to the player.) At the start of the game, the player can choose for Joshua to be either a samurai, a decker, or a gator shaman. These only determine Joshua's beginning statistics and equipment; samurai begin focused on combat, deckers on use of the Matrix and electronics, and shamans on the use of magic. Over the course of the game, the player may choose to continue to focus on one particular skill or set of skills or branch out into other areas; however, only characters who choose to start as a shaman (and allied mages) can use magic and getting too many \\"cyberware\\" implants will reduce its effectiveness. To help the player make things easier during hard shadowruns, Joshua can also recruit other characters to help him in his shadowruns. These are called shadowrunners, and can also be customized as Joshua can. The price of hiring a shadowrunner depends on the duration of the contract, as well as the runner's attitude toward the player. Shadowrunners can be hired for a single run or for a lifetime for ten times the price. The player can only directly control one character at a time; other characters (including Joshua) are controlled by the computer's AI. If the player completes the mission successfully and the shadowrunner was signed on for one job, they return to their location and can be hired back cheaper than before. If the squad is wiped out, however, the runner will be upset and charge more for their services. The primary method of combat in Shadowrun is the use of firearms, although magic plays a significant role in combat in both an offensive and defensive capacity. Shadowrun keeps track of ammunition; if a character runs out they may have to resort to melee. The use of magic, on the other hand, is kept in check by damaging the player for casting high-level spells: the player can mitigate or even eliminate this through the use of items, or by reducing the success chance and/or power of the spell. While virtually useless when used by untrained, physically weak characters, with high skills and strength-boosting cyberware and implanted close-combat weapons (like spurs or hand razors), melee combat can be highly effective against most enemies all the way to the end of the game. Grenades are also available, though their effectiveness relative to other methods of combat is limited. A variety of shops exist throughout the game, providing guns and modifications, cyberware, spells and spell upgrades, cyberdecks and utilities, and other miscellaneous items. In addition to the numerous shops in the game, the player can collect a variety of contacts who provide the player with information, services, or (frequently illegal) goods. Through these contacts Joshua late in the game can join either The Mafia or Yakuza. In Seattle, there are three local racial gangs that have well-defined territories: Halloweeners (humans of Redmond Barrens), Eye-Fivers (elves of Penumbra District) and Orks (orcs of Puyallup Barrens). The player can visit each of these gangs, and pay to speak with their leaders (or be asked to do so, depending on his reputation). There, Joshua can ask for protection from the gangs' random attacks, as well as for the phone number of their allegiance bosses. After Joshua's reputation has been highly upgraded, and after he obtains the numbers of these bosses, he can contact the Yakuza and Mafia, and pledge loyalty to either one of them himself, obtaining specific benefits and exclusive items and discounts. On the other hand, Lone Star, the ubiquitous private security force contracted by the government to provide police services, can not be contacted directly. The Matrix Shadowrun's Matrix system gameplay In tone with the Shadowrun pen-and-paper universe, certain characters can also explore the Matrix, a global computer network that can be accessed through cyberterminals. It is there that the player, in a third- person perspective, can hack networked systems for various purposes. However, in order to do so, a series of intrusion countermeasures must be dealt with, the difficulty of which is proportionate to the system being attacked: the high-end systems of law enforcement and influential corporations will be significantly more difficult to break than that of a nameless hotel. The cyberdeck carried by Joshua can be used by any shadowrunner and, like real computers, has a variety of statistics, such as memory, storage, and loading speed. These can be improved individually through upgrades or all at once by purchasing a more advanced model. Primarily, the cyberdeck's use, aside from entering the Matrix, is to hold various utilities to hack the networks properly (such as Masking, Attack, and Analyzing programs) and to save data downloaded from the Matrix itself. While inside the Matrix, the interface changes. The shadowrunner who entered it is replaced by a persona, the character's reflection in the cyberworld, which navigates the network. Networks are made up of a series of nodes: geometric shapes representing different facets of the system, such as the CPU or data stores. Each node has a different function: the CPU, for example, can cancel system alerts and crash the entire system. The difficulty of defeating a particular node is determined by its color. Each node is (usually) protected by intrusion countermeasures called IC (pronounced \\"Ice\\"). These are designed to forcibly dump the persona from the system by various means, sometimes resulting in the decker taking physical damage in the real world, to the point of being incapacitated. IC appear as different figures covering the nodes and have different effects depending on their type. Matrix runs consist of stealing or erasing data, or crashing a system via the CPU. During corporate infiltrations, the player can use internal cyberterminals to shut off the building's security, making the run easier. In addition to its role in shadowruns, the Matrix can be used as a direct source of income by pilfering data from systems and selling it. Files sell for a semi-random price based on the system of origin and difficulty rating of the node the data was stolen from; a single file can sell for as much as 12,000 nuyen, or turn out to be completely worthless. Plot=Setting The game is set in the Shadowrun universe, in the 2050s. A time where the blending of technology and human flesh is common; it is around the time the Matrix, a huge computer network, came online, with the ability to jack into its cyberspace directly. It was also a time of magic renewal: a phenomenon known as The Awakening occurred, where magic returned into the world. Sorcery was once again possible, and slowly and seemingly at random humans began to mutate into orcs, dwarves, elves or trolls. This time of upheaval was not without political conflicts: mega-corporations began to control the world. But with their magic, native shamans threatened them and the world geography came to a complete change. The Amerindians and Elves reclaimed an area called Salish-Shidhe, close to the free city of Seattle, a major city in the newly formed United Canadian and American States. Shadowrun's story takes place in these areas, both the wilderness of the Salish-Shidhe and the pollution of Seattle, controlled by mega corporations. Seattle itself is divided in many areas: * Redmond Barrens: Dark slums only active because of the Shiawase Atomics Nuclear Plant and the Hollywood Correctional Facility, as well as a few other generic shops. The Halloweeners gang resides there. * Downtown Seattle: The city center, with many bars and corporation buildings. Lone Star, Seattle's police, patrols every hour to ensure order. The Space Needle lies here. * Penumbra District: A high-class area; only top clubs and corporate buildings can be found in this district. It also houses Lone Star's offices, as well as the Eye-Fivers gang. * Renraku Arcology: An enclosed city on the power of Renraku Corporation, built inside a pyramid. Many top-class shops can be found here, as well as the massive Renraku offices. Renraku uses their own security team to keep order in their Arcology. * Puyallup Barrens: Home to the Ork's gang, as well as factories, black market stores, a number of shady bars and hotels. * Council Island: Neutral lands between the city and the wilderness, and usually peaceful. Orks and humans have an embassy where they live without hatred or discrimination. A bar, stores and a clinic can also be found in the Island. It also has a post where citizens can ask for a visa to enter the Salish-Shidhe. * Salish-Shidhe Indian Lands / Elven Lands of Sinsearach: Amerindians and elves live in peace with nature in these savage and dangerous lands. Many dangerous creatures can be found here, as well as the occasional hunting party. The Salish-Shidhe and Sinsearach are connected through a complex network of caves that house many paths and secrets. A visa is needed to (legally) travel to the Salish-Shidhe. * Ellisia's Tomb: The last resting place of the founder of the Sinsearach and the \\"greatest elven hero\\", it lies deep within the Salish Shide and the Sinsearach, its exact location lost with time. It can not be accessed until the end of the game. The corporations that exist within this Shadowrun's world are Lone Star Security Services (law enforcement agency in the city of Seattle), Fuchi Industrial Electronics (cyberterminals and Matrix technology), Mitsuhama Computer Technologies (computers and robotics), Ares Macrotechnology (weapons and defense industries), Aztechnology (magic equipment) and Renraku Computer Systems (computer technology). Story Shadowrun's story begins on January 31, 2058 in Seattle, United Canadian and American States. In the wilderness of the newly reclaimed Amerindian lands of the Salish-Shidhe, a small team of shadowrunners is brutally ambushed by unknown forces. The massacre is over quickly, but is captured in video by one of the slain member's cybereyes; the video is recovered and made national news. The last man to die in the video was a shadowrunner known as Michael, Joshua's brother. Joshua spends his last nuyen and flies to Seattle, vowing to avenge his brother's death. He arrives at Sea-Tac Airport and traces back Michael's last credstick transaction to \\"Stoker's Coffin Motel\\", in the Redmond Barrens. Joshua travels there to inquire about his brother, only to be told by the owner that Michael never paid his bill and in fact has some belongings being held. He strikes a deal with Joshua, and by beginning to do small shadowruns for a small-time Mr. Johnson, called Gunderson, he gains enough money to pay his brother's bills. In Michael's belongings, he finds three \\"holopix\\": one of a young woman, Tabatha Shale; of an Amerindian, David Owlfeather, and of Seattle General Hospital Dr. Heaversheen. There is also a low grade cyberdeck, along with a credstick containing 500 nuyen. From there, the story divides into three branches that the player can go through in any order, either separately or at once. Each branch gives the answer to three main questions: who killed Michael, and under whose orders; what was Michael's last shadowrun; why was Michael killed. Because of the sandbox style of gameplay and the non- linear story, the entire mystery is not revealed until the three main branches are totally completed. Once they are, the plot slowly arises: * Decades before Michael's death, the Salish-Shidhe lands were reclaimed by a number of Amerindians and Elven heroes; among them was a man known as Ellisia, who founded an elven Council, the Sinsearach, to protect the wilderness from the city's corruption. * After Ellisia's death, his body was sealed in a mausoleum with a number of magical artifacts to prevent the misuse of Ellisia's magic power. * It is then that an ancient free spirit entity called Thon, begins a plot to fully penetrate this world using Ellisia. Free spirits are cursed, as Thon needed to replenish his life force or his form in this world would cease to exist. In order to stay alive, Thon seeks out magical artifacts and in destructive rituals, absorbs their energies. With the power of Ellisia's body and artifacts, Thon could become a physical entity. * Thon begins to use two Mr. Johnsons, Vigore & Jarl, to carry out his plans for him, * A mega- corporation, Renraku, becomes involved with Thon through Vigore, a corporate support at the time. Renraku begins to work with the free spirit in a top- priority project, \\"Project THON\\". The project's leader is Mako Sochou, but he soon is blinded by Thon's promises and betrays Renraku, being replaced by Ito Ogami. Renraku itself plans on manipulating Thon, being the only ones with a map to Ellisia's Tomb. * By this point, Sinsearach Council member Harlequin sets on a mission to stop Thon from desecrating Ellisia's Tomb and being freed again. To do this, Harlequin asks his apprentice Frosty to hire a Mr. Johnson, Caleb Brightmore, to organize a small team of shadowrunners to go into Ellisia's Tomb and destroy Thon's magic source. Michael is employed in this team. * Ito Ogami sends a Renraku Strike Team to kill Michael's team; Harlequin is left powerless without his team. Joshua's mission and investigation eventually leads him to Harlequin himself; but it is not after he completes all stories that the ends meet and he can finally reach Ellisia's tomb, the final stage of the game. Characters=Protagonists *Joshua is the game's protagonist and the player defines much of his personality. However, most of the time he's a casual and somewhat aggressive male, his speech laced with street slang; his perspective, often with bits of sarcasm and irony, drives the game. In the game, Joshua's goal is to avenge and solve the mystery of his brother's death, a goal he can only achieve by making a name for himself as a shadowrunner. *Michael is Joshua's older brother. Not much is revealed about his personality, but Michael was close and protective over Josh. Michael was an elite shadowrunner, and he and his friends were brutally massacred during a fatal shadowrun by an unknown ambush force. Joshua vows to avenge him. *Ricky is a modest and somewhat weak dwarf rat shaman. He lived in the city for most of his life, but he had no purpose, mostly because \\"everybody was larger than him\\". At some point, the Rat totem reached out to him, showing him that violence was not the only way to success. Ricky's skills are few and only useful for sneaking around. He starts shadowrunning to save enough to get out of Redmond Barrens, where he resides. *Winston Marrs is an ex-policeman troll samurai, named after the Roman god of war, who appears to be obsessed with violence and loves to shoot guns. So, in order to \\"get paid for shooting at people\\", he joined Lone Star, the Seattle police. However, he did not pass his studies and was kicked out of Lone Star. Because of that, Winston holds an understandable grudge against the police. As a Troll, he can become an incredibly effective melee fighter. Winston is playful and lighthearted, and should the player employ him frequently, he develops an affection toward Joshua (\\"you're the boss, Josh!\\") *Trent Delisario is a university dropout human mage. At university, Trent studied magic, but only learned what he calls \\"parlor tricks\\". Aspiring for a greater control over the astral plane, he moves to Penumbra District hoping to learn new skills as he shadowruns. Trent appears to know some Japanese, and is helpful and polite, being the only character in the whole game that gives a vidphone number for free. *Petr Uver is a dwarf decker. Previously employed at a division of the Stuffer Shack, he learned his way around cyberdecks and The Matrix, and soon became displeased with the meager pay of his job. Stealing a cyberdeck, he moved to Puyallup Barrens in order to become a shadowrunner and win easy money. *Walking Bear is an ork bear shaman, born human in Seattle. She had a happy childhood, until the phenomenon of the Awakening turned her into an ork. Humans began to discriminate against her, so she escaped into the wilderness, where a group of Amerindians taught her the way of the shamans. She soon discovered her potential with the Bear, which she identifies with because of their protective desires. Walking Bear's goal is to protect her tribe, and in order to do so, she works as a shadowrunner to make money for them. *Phantom is an ex-corporate elf decker. He once worked for an unnamed company that trained him to hack the Matrix. However, he was fired without any pension when an anti-metahuman group demanded the removal of jobs for other races, claiming that they were stealing them from \\"the pure\\". As an act of revenge, he used his Matrix training to steal money from his employers' accounts, and began a career as a shadowrunner. He knows Japanese and claims to have made quite a name for himself in cyberspace. *Ilene Two Fists is a convict human samurai, who was a friend of the Sinsearach Council. She traveled to the Redmond Barrens looking for adventure after leading a safe life. She quickly finds herself with two other shadowrunners against the Ares Corporation with promises of money, but is betrayed when her partners leave her behind after tripping an alarm while trying to infiltrate an Ares facility. Ilene ends up in the Hollywood Correctional Penitentiary, and is eventually rescued by Joshua during the story. She is quick, both talking and fighting. *Freya Goldenhair is an elf mage. A member of the Cascade Crow tribe, she discovered she had latent magic powers as a child, but her tribe viewed hermetic mages as heretics (as opposed to shamans, that work within the limits of nature). Freya ran away, ending up in the city and working with a radical political group, which hired her to assassinate corporate officials. Her job proved easy and worth the effort, but she soon grew tired of the group's control and broke away from them, becoming a shadowrunner. Freya is flamboyant. *Rianna Heartbane is an elf decker, whose last name is a pseudonym she took from an ancient elven leader that prophesied the Matrix as \\"a place where everything and nothing exists; a place where war is fought and blood is shed without weapons.\\" Rianna has been shadowrunning against the Corporations since a very young age, and she feels that it is her personal mission to stop them from gaining any more power than they already have. *Stark is a human samurai, and the only surviving member of Michael's massacred party. He was raised in the Amerindian lands, and is proud of his heritage, swearing to protect it no matter what. When he heard that strangers were entering the Salish Shidhe, he traveled to the city to investigate the reasons behind this invasion. There, he met Michael, and the two became fast friends, until they both engaged in the fatal shadowrun to stop the invaders. Although not very bright, he is caring and affectionate. At the time of the story's beginning, Stark is agonizing in the depths of the Salish Shidhe, and it's up to Joshua to revive him. Stark will join your team provided you have room, and comes with a decent amount of cyberware and weapons. Antagonists *Thon is a free spirit ‚Äì an elemental whose summoner was killed ‚Äì from ancient times, who can only retain his form in reality by seeking magical artifacts and absorbing their energies in destructive rituals, the only way he can replenish his life force. Thon is alive, but barely so, as he is running out of artifacts. With his followers, Thon plans to desecrate the elven hero Ellisia's tomb to use Ellisia's body and artifacts to become a physical entity. *Mako Sochou is a Renraku executive, and the first leader of \\"Project THON\\", a plot to manipulate the information Thon needs to locate Ellisia's tomb, in order to use Thon for Renraku's interests. However, Mako betrays Renraku, and is swiftly replaced. *Ito Ogami is the second leader of \\"Project THON\\". He is known for being cold blooded, and is the one who sent the Strike Team to kill Michael's team. After defeating Ogami, Joshua gains access to Ogami's personal portion of Matrix space, which contains valuable mission information and valuable datafiles. While Ito's system can be repeatably hacked, it still requires a considerable Computer skill and a good deck to hack, as most of the important nodes are Red category (hardest) and are guarded by various forms of black IC (pronounced \\"ice\\") (intrusion countermeasures which attack the decker's physical body directly). Other characters *Harlequin is a member of the Sinsearach Council, whose name comes from the tattoos on his face. He knows of Thon's existence and intentions to desecrate elven lore to become fully alive, and carries out a plan to stop him, which results in Michael's death. Joshua eventually meets him, and they team up to stop Thon. He originally appeared in the Shadowrun RPG, in a campaign book of the same name. Harlequin is an immensely powerful elven mage, but does not directly aid Joshua or join his party in the final confrontation with Thon. *Frosty or Jane Frost, is another member of Sinsearach, and an apprentice (of sorts) of Harlequin. It is she that organizes Michael's shadowrun, and guides him to her master. As with Harlequin, she originally appeared in the RPG (in the Harlequin campaign as well). *David Owlfeather is an Amerindian Salish-Shidhe ranger, who is very knowledgeable about the wilderness' geography and lore. He was also one of Michael's friends, and one of the last people to see him alive. *Spirit Eyes, also known as \\"The Most Wise One\\", is an Amerindian elder with blank eyes. He possesses immense magical powers, and through a complex ritual, he can determine the identity of Michael's killer, and make an image of him appear in front of Joshua. *Licourtrix is a feathered serpent dragon, that lives deep in the Salish Shidhe caves, away from civilization. At one point in the game, Joshua must rescue Licourtrix from a Renraku Strike Team that seeks to kill him. Licourtrix, in an omniscient fashion, pledges loyalty to Joshua, promising to aid him one time, and only the one time he truly needs it. *Ellisia was an ancient elven hero, that helped reclaim the Salish Shidhe lands for the elves and Amerindians. Ellisia founded the Sinsearach Council to protect and defend the Salish Shidhe, and according to the game's mythology, is considered by elves as one of the greatest heroes of all history. After Ellisia's death, his body, still possessing magical powers, and a number of magical artifacts were sealed in a large mausoleum made of orichalcum to prevent their misuse. *Mortimer Reed, a mid-level Johnson who operates out of the Big Rhino in the Penumbra District. *Vigore & Jarl offer mid-level runs and specialize in acquisitions. They operate from the Wanderer in the Puyallup Barrens, and are secretly in league with Thon. While posing and operating as Mr. Johnsons, they are covertly keeping track of Joshua's activities. Reception GamePro criticized the game's \\"small and muddled\\" graphics, \\"tinny\\" sounds, tedious and awkward control system, and repetitive gameplay. However, they remarked that the game would appeal to fans of traditional RPG gameplay while offering a change of setting from the RPG stereotype of medieval fantasy. Electronic Gaming Monthly described the game as \\"engrossing, with excellent overhead action sequences, and plenty of areas to explore\\", and five reviewers scored it 40 out of 50 (average 8 out of 10). Legacy In 2012, Harebrained Schemes announced that they would be producing a new Shadowrun title, Shadowrun Returns, to be funded through Kickstarter. As a result of the Kickstarter appeal reaching a 1.5 million dollar target, creator Jordan Weisman announced that the game would now feature an additional storyline tying in the new game with both the Sega Genesis and the Super NES versions of the game. This extra content was initially available only to backers, with general availability some time after release.Shadowrun Returns Update #10, on Kickstarter, accessed March 27, 2012 ReferencesExternal links * *Shadowrun at GameFAQs Category:1994 video games Category:BlueSky Software games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Genesis-only games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Shadowrun video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games scored by Sam Powell Category:Video games set in the 2050s Category:Video games set in Seattle Category:Cyberpunk video games ","title":"Shadowrun (1994 video game)"},{"id":"3568025","text":"Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital (formerly York Central Hospital) is a hospital in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada and one of three in York Regional Municipality. Mackenzie Health in Richmond Hill is part of the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) Hospital Partnerships. History Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital was founded in 1963 in Vaughan Township as York Central Hospital, close to the suburb of Richmond Hill, and incorporated into Richmond Hill following the amalgamation of the town in 1973. Funded by both local donations and public money, the hospital opened less than a half mile (800 metres) from the old commercial downtown of Richmond Hill. Since its inception, the hospital has undergone several expansions to cope with the rapid population growth of Richmond Hill, the latest of which was completed in 2009. In September 1974, it opened a 300-bed extension. In 2012, in conjunction with managing the construction of the Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital and to grow health care services in the area, the hospital was renamed Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital; both hospitals would be administered by Mackenzie Health, a new regional healthcare services provider. 2003 SARS outbreak In 2003, hospital workers contracted Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a patient who had been transferred from Scarborough Grace Hospital, which prompted the closing of the hospital on March 28. The hospital's emergency room and maternity ward reopened on April 19. Inpatients were required to have their body temperature checked twice daily, and those who had SARS-related symptoms such as a fever or respiratory issues were isolated and required to have a chest X-ray. All pneumonia patients were treated in isolation until a pulmonologist could assess them to eliminate SARS as a cause. Locations The Hospital occupies four adjoining buildings in central Richmond Hill, with a total of five floors in each building. *A Wing - The southernmost building contains the Centre for Continuing Care and Rehabilitation (CCCR). *B Wing - Douglas H. Storms Memorial Wing *C Wing - Dr. James Langstaff Memorial Wing, Main hospital entrance *D Wing - The newest building is the Town of Richmond Hill Wing. This building contains the Emergency Room, the ICU and the Main Dialysis unit. The Vaughan Satellite Dialysis Unit of Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital's Regional Dialysis Program is located at 9401 Jane Street. Patients referred to this unit must be medically able to receive dialysis away from the hospital and find this location more convenient. The unit consists of 33-station renal dialysis units, including a nephrology out-patient clinic. Services The hospital has one of two dialysis centres in York Region, and received a new 1.5T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit in 2005. * Ambulatory Care Services * Continuing Care Program * Diagnostic Imaging * District Stroke Centre * Emergency Medicine Program * Laboratory Medicine * Long Term Care * Magnetic Resonance Imaging * Medicine Program * Mental Health Program * Rehabilitation Services * Surgery Program * Woman and Child Program * York Region Dialysis Program References Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1963 Category:Hospitals in the Regional Municipality of York Category:Hospitals established in 1963 Category:Buildings and structures in Richmond Hill, Ontario Category:1963 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital"},{"id":"3568036","text":"Mestre Amen Santo is an Afro-Brazilian mestre (master) of the acrobatic martial art of capoeira.

This makes the algorithm more efficient and less sensitive to user defined parameters than canonical SA. These are in the standard variant often selected on the basis of experience and experimentation (since optimal values are problem dependent), which represents a significant deficiency in practice. The algorithm works by representing the parameters of the function to be optimized as continuous numbers, and as dimensions of a hypercube (N dimensional space). Some SA algorithms apply Gaussian moves to the state, while others have distributions permitting faster temperature schedules. Imagine the state as a point in a box and the moves as a rugby-ball shaped cloud around it. The temperature and the step size are adjusted so that all of the search space is sampled to a coarse resolution in the early stages, whilst the state is directed to favorable areas in the late stages. Another ASA variant, thermodynamic simulated annealing, automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the energy difference between the two states, according to the laws of thermodynamics.

The gardens are situated on 6.5 acres. Adjacent to the gardens is a Victorian house, the Walther House. The house is open to the public and is home to a museum shop and headquarters for the Citizens Committee that oversees the gardens. Following financial problems in 2008 and 2009, ownership of the gardens was transferred to Essex county, who bought the Walther House for $1.1 million in order to give the gardens a better financial standing. The county then leased the gardens back to the Presby Memorial Iris Gardens for $1. While Essex County owns the property, the actual iris beds are maintained without taxpayer funds. Rather, they are maintained by private donations and volunteer effort.http://www.baristanet.com/2009/02/county_to_acquire_iris_gardens.php  Description  The Gardens are in a park-like setting and open to the public without charge. Donations, however, are greatly appreciated. Each year Presby has over 10,000 visitors. Normally, the blooming season is May 14 to June 4. Check the Presby website (see External Links below) for the exact status of the current season. The gardens were established in 1927 to honor Frank Presby, a noted horticulturalist and a founding member of the American Iris Society. This world-class collection now includes approximately 10,000 individual plants, representing 6 species and over 3,000 different named varieties of irises. It is the largest non-commercial garden dedicated to irises in the world.  Vandalism  In August 2005, 157 historic rhizomes were vandalized. One year later, Montclair Police were tipped off to the culprits who were later arrested and sentenced.

Biography Peter Wright was born in Slipton, Northamptonshire, one of twelve children. Peter was still young when his father died. He had to work in a country solicitor's office at Thrapston in his home area.\\"Blessed Peter Wright, SJ\\", The Jesuits - Singapore After spending ten years with the solicitor he enlisted in the English army in the Low Countries, but finding that he did not care for military life, he deserted after a month and went to Brabant. Having drifted away from his faith in his youth, he visited the English Jesuits in Li√®ge and asked to be reconciled to the Church. He then visited Ghent and for two years attended the college of the Jesuits. In 1629 he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Watten. After studying philosophy and then theology at Li√®ge, he was ordained a priest there in 1636 and after a further period at Li√®ge was sent to serve at the English College of St. Omer. From 1638-1644 he served as chaplain to Colonel Sir Henry Gage's English regiment in the service of Spain, based near Ghent.Wainewright, John. \\"Ven. Peter Wright.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 21 Feb. 2014 When Gage returned to England in the spring of 1644 to aid King Charles I, Wright went with him, first to Oxford and then to the relief of Basing House, the seat of John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester. He administered the sacraments to the dying Gage on 11 January 1645. After this Wright became the marquess's chaplain, first in Hampshire and later in the London house. Wright was seized there by a band of pursuivants who burst in on Candlemas day, 2 February 1651. Committed to Newgate, he was brought to trial before Henry Rolle, Lord Chief Justice, sitting with justices Philip Jermyn and Richard Aske and others, at the Old Bailey on 14‚Äì16 May. Something of the atmosphere of the times should be clear when it is recalled that Charles I had been put on trial and subsequently been executed on 30 January 1649. The evidence at Wright's trial was provided by the informer Thomas Gage, apostate brother of the late Sir Henry and a renegade Dominican priest. Thomas Gage had met Wright in the years when he was a military chaplain and testified against him. The whole scene, about which numerous details have survived, was little like a modern court of law and bizarre moments included the Parliamentarian Lord Chief Justice rebuking the half- deranged informer for speaking disrespectfully of his Royalist soldier brother. Wright was condemned under the statute 27 Eliz., c. 2. for being a Catholic priest in England, and sentenced on Saturday 17 May to being hanged, drawn and quartered. His execution at Tyburn, London on a hot Whit Monday, 19 May 1651, took place before over twenty thousand spectators. In the period of the trial and the days after his execution, Wright was if not popular, at least a respected figure in public opinion. The sheriff's officers also seem to have been relatively well disposed to him and he was allowed to hang until he was dead, being thus spared the agonies of being eviscerated alive. Peter Wright was beatified by Pope Pius XI on 15 December 1929. His feast day is 19 May.

Biography Born in Vienna, he was first trained in church music by Wilhelm M√ºck, organist of Vienna's Stephansdom (St. Stephen's Cathedral). He then combined work as r√©p√©titeur and choirmaster at the Vienna Volksoper with further study at the Vienna Academy of Music under Bruno Seidlhofer (piano, organ, harpsichord) and Friedrich Reidinger (music theory and composition) while serving in the military, mostly as a medical aide. In 1945, he both graduated from the Academy and was appointed organ teacher there. He was promoted to professor in 1957. Heiller's career after World War II is an uninterrupted list of concerts, lectures, records, jury service at contests, and professional honors. In 1952 he won the International Organ Competition in Haarlem, the Netherlands, and toured both Europe and the United States, where his organ recitals at Harvard University (on the then new C.B. Fisk instrument in Memorial Church) ‚Äî still available on a 4-CD boxed set ‚Äî were particularly appreciated. A few years before this, he had released a set of recordings for Vanguard of many of Bach's larger organ works on a majestic Marcussen instrument in Sweden. His two Haydn Society LPs, from the early 1950s, of Joseph Haydn's Symphonies 26 (\\"Lamentation\\") and 36 and Symphonies 52 and 56, are distinguished for their forthright conciseness and straightforwardness, without gratuitous ritardandi or other tempo changes not requested by Haydn in the score. Successive Austrian governments bestowed on Heiller every artistic award in their power, including the Vienna Culture Prize (1963), the Vienna Cross of Honor for Arts and Science (1968) and the Grand Austrian State Prize (1969). Offered the conductorship of the Vienna State Opera he declined in order to concentrate on keyboard playing, although near the end of his life he said he was looking forward to conducting more. Heiller recorded most of his large repertory, which ranged from Giovanni Gabrieli and Dieterich Buxtehude through Bach to Max Reger and Heiller's good friend Paul Hindemith. Romantic works interested him much less than Baroque and 20th-century material. In whatever works he performed he displayed formidable technique, immense rhythmic strength and, in particular, a rare talent for clarifying and maintaining the momentum of the most complex polyphonic passages with what sounded like effortless ease. He also composed from his teens onward. His works, influenced by Hindemith and Frank Martin, were often dodecaphonic, and never achieved anything like the acclaim of his performances, but he was prolific and composed much music for his own instrument, including an organ concerto (1963) and what may be the only concerto ever written for organ and harpsichord (1972). He died unexpectedly and prematurely in Vienna at the age of 55, collapsing after choking on food, from what was thought to be a heart attack. His notable pupils include Monique Gendron, Judy Glass, Yuko Hayashi, Grant Hellmers, Monika Henking, Wolfgang Karius, Jan Kleinbussink, Bernard Lagac√©, Douglas Lawrence, Brett Leighton, Peter Planyavsky,Anton Heiller.

Geography Palavas is a seaside resort, some six km south of Montpellier, at the Gulf of Lion and the Mediterranean. It lies on a strip of sand dunes that separates two lakes, the √âtang de l'Arnel and the √âtang du M√©jean, from the sea. Its neighbouring communities are Lattes, P√©rols, Mauguio and Villeneuve-l√®s-Maguelone. The village center is located at the spot where the river Lez flows into the sea through a canalized section. Northwards, it stretches until Mauguio. Southwards, expansion is halted by a military area and an area used by the Ifremer.  Climate  The city has a Mediterranean climate. The summer is warm and dry and the winter mild and humid. History The village originated as a fishermen's village who sold their catch on the markets of Montpellier. The Ancien R√©gime used the village as a coastal defence, building the Redoute de Ballestras. The historical train from Montpellier to Palavas, now exhibited in Montpellier From the beginning of the 19th century, local tourists and seasonal activities were drawn to the village. When in 1872 a local train to and from Montpellier started service, seaside tourism really took off. This train operated until 1968 and was painted by Albert Dubout. PopulationEconomy The mainstay of Palavas' economy is tourism. It is one of the most popular places in this part of France's coastline. In the film The Triplets of Belleville (Les Triplettes de Belleville), there is a song about the village. Apart from strolling, bathing and tanning there are also two museums: one dedicated to Albert Dubout and one dedicated to the local train to Montpellier. The 45m high former local water tower can be seen from afar and features a revolving restaurant on top and a congress centre.

The ITSEC was first published in May 1990 in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom based on existing work in their respective countries. Following extensive international review, Version 1.2 was subsequently published in June 1991 by the Commission of the European Communities for operational use within evaluation and certification schemes. Since the launch of the ITSEC in 1990, a number of other European countries have agreed to recognize the validity of ITSEC evaluations. The ITSEC has been largely replaced by Common Criteria, which provides similarly-defined evaluation levels and implements the target of evaluation concept and the Security Target document. Concepts The product or system being evaluated, called the target of evaluation, is subjected to a detailed examination of its security features culminating in comprehensive and informed functional and penetration testing. The degree of examination depends upon the level of confidence desired in the target. To provide different levels of confidence, the ITSEC defines evaluation levels, denoted E0 through E6. Higher evaluation levels involve more extensive examination and testing of the target. Unlike earlier criteria, notably the TCSEC developed by the US defense establishment, the ITSEC did not require evaluated targets to contain specific technical features in order to achieve a particular assurance level. For example, an ITSEC target might provide authentication or integrity features without providing confidentiality or availability. A given target's security features were documented in a Security Target document, whose contents had to be evaluated and approved before the target itself was evaluated. Each ITSEC evaluation was based exclusively on verifying the security features identified in the Security Target.  Use  The formal Z notation was used to prove security properties about the Mondex smart card electronic cash system, allowing it to achieve ITSEC level E6, the highest granted security-level classification.Susan Stepney, David Cooper, and Jim Woodcock, An Electronic Purse: Specification, Refinement, and Proof.

The company grew from an acquisition of an existing logging railroad in 1897, and merged with the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway (the \\"Frisco\\") in 1971. The company was also known as the \\"Port of Mobile Route.\\" History John Taylor Cochrane acquired the Seaboard Railroad, a 6-year-old 33-mile narrow-gauge logging line, in a foreclosure sale in 1897. Separately, Cochrane was approached by the citizens of Carrollton, Alabama to build a short-line connecting railroad for their town. It seems that in 1897, the Mobile and Ohio Railroad chose to route through Pickens County, Alabama by way of the town of Reform, Alabama ‚Äî rather than the county seat of Carrollton ‚Äî and the town needed to connect to Reform. Thus the Carrollton Short Line Railway was chartered, and built in 1900. Through mergers, acquisition of trackage rights, and the building and reconstruction of track, these two railroads eventually joined under the name of the Alabama, Tennessee and Northern Railroad, and the line was completed all the way from Reform to the port of Mobile, Alabama. By 1948, the Frisco had purchased controlling interest, and operated it as a separate entity until 1971, when the line was absorbed into the parent company. In 1925, ATN reported 15 million ton-miles of revenue freight on 187 miles of line; in 1967, 543 million ton-miles on 214 route-miles. In 1950, under the auspices of the ATN, the Frisco began freight service to and from, and on Blakeley and Pinto Islands by way of two car floats across the Mobile River. The service was continued after the SLSF was merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad, until about 1994.

Background  Particularly, XG is focused on the development of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) demonstration and capability as well as the evaluation of three fundamental principles, namely: the principle of \\"Do No Harm\\"; \\"Add Value\\" principle; and, DSA devices development that provide equivalent reliability and service. The first principle involves the design of DSA radios in a way that does not interfere with viable links while the second maintains that DSA radios offer positive benefit after all the overhead costs and resources are considered. In the Wireless World Research Forum of 27 October 2003, Preston Marshall, program manager of DARPA XG Program, said \\"The primary product of the XG program is not a new radio, but a set of advanced technologies for dynamic spectrum access.\\"  Projects and initiatives  From 2006 to 2008, DARPA held numerous XG program demonstrations such as the experiment that involved the deployment of a field of conventionally deconflicted wireless links that included typical military, public safety, and civilian point-to-point links, covering several kilometers. In 2006, an XG technology was deployed in a field trial and demonstrated a robust networking capability amid challenging mobile scenarios. The program is also engaged in the development of architectural framework, protocol design, and building prototypes for DSA networks. One of its notable projects is the One Shot XG system, which is being developed to improve the accuracy of military snipers by calculating variables such as crosswind condition, maximum effective range of the weapon, and weapon alignment.

Originally nomads, they came to be known as Maldharis after settling in Junagadh district (mainly Gir Forest). \\"Maldhari\\" is an occupational term which refers to people from a variety of castes and communities. The literal meaning of Maldhari is keeper (dhari) of the animal stock (mal). They are notable as the traditional dairymen of the region, and once supplied milk and cheese to the palaces of rajas.  Etymology  The word \\"Maldhari\\" can be loosely translated into English as \\"herdsman\\". derives from the Gujarati language words maal (animal stock) and dhari (owner/keeper). Hence, the one who owns animals, breeds them and/or herds them is called Maldhari. Culture Maldharis are descendants of nomads who periodically came from Pakistan, Rajasthan and other parts of Gujarat, and finally settled in the Banni grasslands.P Their major communities include Sindhi Sunni Muslims and Vadhas. These semi-nomadic herders spend eight months of the year criss-crossing sparse pasturelands with their livestock including sheep, goats, cows, buffalo, and camels in a continual quest for fodder. During the monsoon season, the Maldhari generally return to their home villages as more new grass grows closer to home during the rains. For villages in some areas, weddings are traditionally held just one day each year, on Krishna Janmashtami (Lord Krishna‚Äôs birthday), which falls in the midst of the monsoon. Some girls in some regions are kept from going to school and expected to spend the early years of their life stitching elaborate garments for their wedding day, or, if they have been married off as children, as many are, for the ceremony performed when each moves in with her husband, normally when she is in her early twenties. Communities In different regions, the Maldharis belong to different castes. The Gir Forest National Park is home to around 8,400 Maldharis as of 2007. The majority of the Maldharis in Gir belong to Charan, Rayaka and Rabari castes. Minority castes include Koli, Kathi, Bawa, Meghwal and Makranis. The Maldharis of Gir, Alech and Barda have included among the Scheduled Tribes since 1956, although these castes are not classified as Scheduled Tribes outside the forest areas. Lifestyle The pastoral Maldhari community live a simple life. They live in small mud houses deep in the forests, with no electricity, running water, schools or access to healthcare. They earn a living by producing milk from their cattle. They have developed a local breed of buffalo that is well known in India for its high productivity and strong resilience to the harsh conditions of the Banni. The Banni Buffalo was recognized as the 11th breed of buffalo in the country in 2010, the first one to be registered post independence. The breed registration process was carried out through the Maldharis themselves. They grow vegetables and collect wild honey. Their main sources of cash income are sale of high quality ghee, milk, wool, animals and handicrafts. They trade their produce in the local market for essential items like food grains. Most are unable to count or use money and are illiterate. Jewelry Their jewelry and clothing portray the Maldharis' sense of identity and tradition. It symbolizes their beliefs and ideals. Men wear gold hoops and buttons in their ears. On their milking hands, many wear silver rings embossed with the Siva lingam. The milk that dribbles over the ring is an offering to the god, replacing the need to make oblations at a temple. Maldhari women's ears are folded and stretched with a large amount of hanging silver. Their wrists are sheathed in heavy, hourglass-shaped bracelets, carved from elephant tusks. However, many wear plastic replicas for everyday use. They keep the more precious ivory originals stored in cans filled with vegetable oil. The oil keeps them from cracking and makes them easier to slip on. Such ornamentation disguises the poverty in which they live. It is worn as a status symbol to impart an impression of wealth upon which their family honor depends.

Historically part of Glamorgan, Treherbert is a former industrial coal mining village which was at its economic peak between 1850 and 1920. Treherbert is the upper most community of the Rhondda Fawr and encompasses the districts of Blaencwm, Blaenrhondda, Tynewydd and Pen-yr-englyn.  Pronunciation  'Tre-Herbert' or 'Tre Herbert' is correctly pronounced as in 'Tray Herbert' 'Tre' translated from Welsh language means 'settlement'. ‚ÄòHerbert‚Äô was the surname of the Earls of Pembroke, a dynasty of local magnates. History There is evidence of settlements in the Rhondda dating back to Celtic times, but prior to the Industrial Revolution and the advent of coal mining the villages of Treherbert, Tynewydd, Blaenrhondda and Blaencwm consisted of a number of isolated rural farms and scattered homesteads. In 1841 there were only 218 people residing in the 'Middle hamlet of Treherbert', which had risen to 1,203 by 1861.Rhondda Cynon Taf In August 1845, the trustees of the Marquess of Bute bought the Cwmsaerbren farm from William Davies for a fee of ¬£11,000 to sink the first steam coal pit in the Rhondda valley. A trial pit was sunk from 1850, but progress was slow because all equipment was carried over rough tracks by horse and cart from the Taff Vale Railway's then terminus at Dinas. In April 1853 the first seam of what was called the Bute Merthyr Colliery was struck at a depth of 125 yards, and production was begun in early 1855. Parish records showed the first use of the name Treherbert from January 1855, commemorating the Herbert earls of Pembroke, one of the ancestors of the Marquess of Bute.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg746 The first 38 wagons of steam coal were transported from the newly extended Taff Vale Railway station at Gelligaled (Ystrad) to Cardiff Docks on 21 December 1855. Installation of the railway line facilitated the rapid expansion of the village, and the need to build new houses, the first rows of which were built at Bute Street, Dumfries Street, and Baglan Street. Transport The main road in the northerly direction out of Treherbert is the A4061 Rhigos Mountain Road towards Hirwaun and the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road. It was built as a relief project for unemployed miners and opened in November 1929. Railway Treherbert railway station is the last stop on the Transport for Wales Treherbert line, which runs from the capital city, Cardiff. Prior to the Dr Beeching plans in the 1960s the railway line continued from Treherbert through Tynewydd to Blaencwm. From here it turned left at Pen Pych into Blaencwm. In Blaencwm, the line descended into a single-track tunnel under Mynydd Blaengwynfi, emerging in the village of Blaengwynfi in the nearby Afan valley. The journey took approximately 8 minutes. Sport Treherbert is home to rugby union club Treherbert RFC. The team is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and was founded by local colliers in 1879. Treherbert also produced one of Wales' first rugby league teams, Treherbert RLFC, playing for just two seasons between 1908 and 1910. Treherbert is also home to Welsh darts player Wayne Warren. Music Treherbert Band is one of the longest established bands in the South Wales area. It was originally formed around 1897 as Treherbert Drum and Fife Band, later becoming a brass band associated to the Glenrhondda Colliery. Following the closure of the colliery, the band continued but was renamed variously the Upper Rhondda Band, Treherbert & District Silver Band, Treherbert Band, and now Treherbert & District Band. The band has enjoyed many successes in competition, at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the Mineworkers Open, the National Championships of Great Britain and Wales' annual national competition, the Welsh Regional Championships. During the 1990s the band gained promotion from the fourth section right through to the elite Championship division, and became Welsh League Champions in 2002, Welsh Regional Champions in 2003 and Runner Up Welsh Regional Champions in 2007. In 2011 the band became National Eisteddfod Third Division Champions, Runner Up Welsh Regional and Runner Up South Wales Miner's Eisteddfod Champions.

The APC protein is a negative regulator that controls beta-catenin concentrations and interacts with E-cadherin, which are involved in cell adhesion. Mutations in the APC gene may result in colorectal cancer. APC is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Tumor suppressor genes prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that may result in cancerous tumors. The protein made by the APC gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in particular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth. The human APC gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 in band q22.2 (5q22.2). The APC gene has been shown to contain an internal ribosome entry site. APC orthologs have also been identified in all mammals for which complete genome data are available.  Structure  The full-length human protein comprises 2,843 amino acids with a (predicted) molecular mass of 311646 Da. Several N-terminal domains have been structurally elucidated in unique atomistic high-resolution complex structures. Most of the protein is predicted to be intrinsically disordered. It is not known if this large predicted unstructured region from amino acid 800 to 2843 persists in vivo or would form stabilised complexes - possibly with yet unidentified interacting proteins. Recently, it has been experimentally confirmed that the mutation cluster region around the center of APC is intrinsically disordered in vitro.  Role in cancer  The most common mutation in colon cancer is inactivation of APC. When APC does not have an inactivating mutation, frequently there are activating mutations in beta catenin. Mutations in APC can be inherited, or arise sporadically in the somatic cells, often as the result of mutations in other genes that result in the inability to repair mutations in the DNA. In order for cancer to develop, both alleles (copies of the APC gene) must be mutated. Mutations in APC or Œ≤-catenin must be followed by other mutations to become cancerous; however, in carriers of an APC inactivating mutations, the risk of colorectal cancer by age 40 is almost 100%. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by an inherited, inactivating mutation in the APC gene. More than 800 mutations in the APC gene have been identified in families with classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis. Most of these mutations cause the production of an APC protein that is abnormally short and presumably nonfunctional. This short protein cannot suppress the cellular overgrowth that leads to the formation of polyps, which can become cancerous. The most common mutation in familial adenomatous polyposis is a deletion of five bases in the APC gene. This mutation changes the sequence of amino acids in the resulting APC protein beginning at position 1309. Another mutation is carried by approximately 6 percent of people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish heritage. This mutation results in the substitution of the amino acid lysine for isoleucine at position 1307 in the APC protein (also written as I1307K or Ile1307Lys). This change was initially thought to be harmless, but has recently been shown to be associated with a 10 to 20 percent increased risk of colon cancer.  Regulation of proliferation  The (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) APC protein normally builds a \\"destruction complex\\" with glycogen synthase kinase 3-alpha and or beta (GSK-3Œ±/Œ≤) and axin via interactions with the 20 AA and SAMP repeats. This complex is then able to bind Œ≤-catenins in the cytoplasm, that have dissociated from adherens contacts between cells. With the help of casein kinase 1 (CK1), which carries out an initial phosphorylation of Œ≤-catenin, GSK-3Œ≤ is able to phosphorylate Œ≤-catenin a second time. This targets Œ≤-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation by cellular proteasomes. This prevents it from translocating into the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor for proliferation genes.Leber, M. F., Efferth, T.\\"Molecular principles of cancer invasion and metastasis (Review)\\". International Journal of Oncology 34, no. 4 (2009): 881-895. https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo_00000214 APC is also thought to be targeted to microtubules via the PDZ binding domain, stabilizing them. The deactivation of the APC protein can take place after certain chain reactions in the cytoplasm are started, e.g. through the Wnt signals that destroy the conformation of the complex. In the nucleus it complexes with legless/BCL9, TCF, and Pygo The ability of APC to bind Œ≤-catenin has been classically considered to be an integral part of the protein's mechanistic function in the destruction complex, along with binding to Axin through the SAMP repeats. These models have been substantiated by observations that common APC loss of function mutations in the mutation cluster region often remove several Œ≤-catenin binding sites and SAMP repeats. However, recent evidence from Yamulla and colleagues have directly tested those models and imply that APC's core mechanistic functions may not require direct binding to Œ≤-catenin, but necessitate interactions with Axin. The researchers hypothesized that APC's many Œ≤-catenin binding site increase the protein's efficiency at destroying Œ≤-catenin, yet are not absolutely necessary for the protein's mechanistic function. Further research is clearly necessary to elucidate the precise mechanistic function of APC in the destruction complex.  Mutations  Familial Adenomatous Polyposis of the intestine Mutations in APC often occur early on in cancers such as colon cancer. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have germline mutations, with 95% being nonsense/frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons. 33% of mutations occur between amino acids 1061-1309. In somatic mutations, over 60% occur within a mutation cluster region (1286‚Äì1513), causing loss of axin binding sites in all but 1 of the 20AA repeats. Mutations in APC lead to loss of Œ≤-catenin regulation, altered cell migration and chromosome instability.  Neurological role  Rosenberg et al. found that APC directs cholinergic synapse assembly between neurons, a finding with implications for autonomic neuropathies, for Alzheimer's disease, for age-related hearing loss, and for some forms of epilepsy and schizophrenia.

Nested polymerase chain reaction (Nested PCR) is a modification of polymerase chain reaction intended to reduce non-specific binding in products due to the amplification of unexpected primer binding sites. Polymerase chain reaction Polymerase chain reaction itself is the process used to amplify DNA samples, via a temperature-mediated DNA polymerase. The products can be used for sequencing or analysis, and this process is a key part of many genetics research laboratories, along with uses in DNA fingerprinting for forensics and other human genetic cases. Conventional PCR requires primers complementary to the termini of the target DNA. The amount of product from the PCR increases with the number of temperature cycles that the reaction is subjected to. A commonly occurring problem is primers binding to incorrect regions of the DNA, giving unexpected products. This problem becomes more likely with an increased number of cycles of PCR. Primers Nested polymerase chain reaction involves two sets of primers, used in two successive runs of polymerase chain reaction, the second set intended to amplify a secondary target within the first run product. This allows amplification for a low number of runs in the first round, limiting non-specific products. The second nested primer set should only amplify the intended product from the first round of amplification and not non-specific product. This allows running more total cycles while minimizing non-specific products. This is useful for rare templates or PCR with high background. Processes The target DNA undergoes the first run of polymerase chain reaction with the first set of primers, shown in green. The selection of alternative and similar primer binding sites gives a selection of products, only one containing the intended sequence. The product from the first reaction undergoes a second run with the second set of primers, shown in red. It is very unlikely that any of the unwanted PCR products contain binding sites for both the new primers, ensuring the product from the second PCR has little contamination from unwanted products of primer dimers, hairpins, and alternative primer target sequences.

Created by Doris Duke herself, the aerial view confirms they were larger than the New York Botanical Garden's Haupt Conservatory, and were open to the public from 1964. They were closed by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation on or before May 25, 2008 and the plant material was donated to public gardens throughout the United States. History The Chinese Garden, showing serenity bridge over koi stream Duke Gardens were part of the Duke Farms estate built by James Buchanan Duke, founder of the American Tobacco Company and benefactor of Duke University. Duke Farms is located on U.S. Route 206, south of the Somerville Circle, in Hillsborough Township in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. The Gardens were designed and installed by Doris Duke herself, therefore several alternative names are used: The Doris Duke Indoor Display Gardens at Duke Farms, Duke Farms Indoor Display Gardens, The Doris Duke International Display Gardens, The Duke Gardens Foundation. Officially, the Gardens were The Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc, a 501(c)(3) Private Operating Foundation established 1960. Miss Duke developed these exotic display gardens in honor of her beloved father James Buchanan Duke, Inspired by DuPont's Longwood Gardens, each of the eleven Duke Display Gardens is a full-scale re- creation of a garden theme, country or period. Display construction began in 1958. Miss Duke both designed the displays and labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days. In 1960 she donated of her estate, including the greenhouses, to the Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc. The Duke Farms website stated that \\"Doris Duke had long been personally involved in the construction, repair and remodeling of her properties, and she was directly involved in the physical design of the Indoor Display Gardens. Although she lacked specific botanical knowledge, she had a clear vision of the spaces and features she wanted to create. According to the New York Post, she designed all but one of the gardens, incorporating her interests in color, design and fragrance.\\" (Following the closure, this text is no longer present on the website ). Doris Duke continued her involvement with her gardens throughout her life, bringing designers with her to modify them during the summer season when they were closed to tourists. In the 1970s she added extensive night-lighting, and introduced public tours of the gardens at night. A rediscovered image of the \\"stunning nightlighting of the French Gardens\\" was used as one centerpiece of social protest against the closure. Description of the gardens Duke Gardens formed four sides of a quadrangle, and took at least one hour to view. The entry fell on the side formed by a Conservatory designed by Horace Trumbauer and constructed 1909-17. The other three sides were formed by greenhouses in styles that are still manufactured. The greenhouse over the English Garden was installed in the 1990s. Duke Gardens were visited in the following sequence: * Central entry into an Italian courtyard - statues amid lush plantings in the Romantic style, including a replica of Antonio Canova's sculpture The Three Graces. * Colonial Garden - representing gardens of the South Atlantic United States, with camellias, azaleas, magnolia, and crepe myrtle. * Edwardian Garden (Fern and Orchid House) - ferns and orchids * French Parterre - flowers planted in a geometric parterre. * English Gardens - five miniature gardens, including a topiary; a rock garden and herbaceous borders; an Elizabethan knot garden of the 16th and 17th centuries; and an 18th-century succulent garden. * American Desert - cacti and succulents, including barrel cactus, giant aloe, and crown of thorns, with desert apple, aloe vera, mother-in-law's tongue, etc. * Chinese Garden - koi stream and rock formations, with bamboo, camphor trees, bleeding heart, hybrid tulips, and jasmine. * Japanese Garden - tea house with bonsai trees, red maples, etc. * Indo-Persian Garden - water course, fountains, and carved marble screens, with orange trees, Mediterranean cyprus, and a Persian rose garden. * Tropical Garden - tropical trees and vines. * Semi-Tropical Garden - papyrus, fiddlehead ferns, Bird of Paradise, etc. Closure and removal of Duke Gardens The French Garden on the day before closure.

In March 2008 Duke Farms announced \\"an expansive and bold new vision for the property, in which it will refocus its programs and operations to become an environmental showcase and learning center. The first major change will be the conclusion in May 2008 of tours of the 11 indoor display gardens\\". Although the Duke Farms website states that \\"The Indoor Display Gardens reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of Doris Duke, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding\\", representatives of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF) more recently stated that the Gardens are \\"perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption.\\" \\"The jewel-like gardens will remain open until May 25, after which they will be dismantled. According to DDCF sources, the day of the display gardens is past. They consume an inordinate share of financial and staff resources, they would require a very expensive modernization, and they no longer reflect the vision of Duke Farm‚Äôs future. A video record has been made for archival purposes.\\" The current garden tours are closing partly to use the building as a staging area for plants, while the other conservatory building is emptied and renovated, officials said. As for the plants there, [Executive Director Tim] Taylor said some may be used in the new gardens, though the concept will be different. \\"It will not be replicated in terms of the gardens of the nations. We'll put a different spin on them, and come up with a logical connecting story of native horticulture to exotic horticulture,\\" he said. Leftover plants will be donated to other botanical and display gardens, Taylor said. \\"We're not destroying anything.\\" In April 2008, opposition to the closure and dismantling of the Display Gardens started to emerge. Open letters appeared in the local press. A website, www.SaveDukeGardens.org was established, allowing protest emails to the Trustees. A usergroup to display images of the Gardens, \\"Save Duke Gardens\\" was formed on the photography web service flickr.com . The ongoing web campaign has received local and metropolitan coverage, and resulted in hundreds of letters to the eleven DDCF Trustees behind the decision: Joan E. Spero, (President), Nannerl O. Keohane (Chair), John J. Mack (Vice Chair), Harry Demopoulos, Anthony Fauci, James F. Gill, Anne Hawley, Peter A. Nadosy, William H. Schlesinger, John H.T. Wilson and John E. Zuccotti. Other gardens on Duke Farms site The Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc, established in 1959 and now part of Duke Farms Foundation, must \\"maintain a horticultural and botanical establishment for the purpose of scientific experimentation and public education and enjoyment\\". With closure of Duke Gardens, the Duke Farms Foundation created new indoor and outdoor display gardens as part of Duke Farms. Indoor gardens are presented in the renovated Lord & Burnham conservatory (c.1900), now known as the Orchid Range . Duke Farms opened to the public on May 19, 2012.

History The name derives from the image of a white label on the packaging that can be filled in with the marketer's trade dress. Common use White label production is often used for mass-produced generic products including electronics, consumer products and software packages such as DVD players, televisions, and web applications. Some companies maintain a sub-brand for their goods, for example the same model of DVD player may be sold by Dixons as a Saisho and by Currys as a Matsui, which are brands exclusively used by those companies. Some websites use white labels to enable a successful brand to offer a service without having to invest in creating the technology and infrastructure itself. Many IT and modern marketing companies outsource or use white-label companies and services to provide specialist services without having to invest in developing their own product. Most supermarket store brand products are provided by companies that sell to multiple supermarkets, changing only the labels. In addition, some manufacturers create low-cost generic brand labels with only the name of the product (\\"Beer\\",\\"Cola\\", etc.). Richelieu Foods, for example, is a private label food manufacturing company producing frozen pizza, salad dressing, sauces, marinades, condiments, and deli salads for other companies, including Hy-Vee, Aldi, Save-A-Lot, Sam's Club, Hannaford Brothers Co., BJ's Wholesale Club (Earth's Pride brand), and Shaw's Supermarkets (Culinary Circle brand). Smaller banks sometimes outsource their credit card or check processing operations to larger banks, which issue and process the credit cards as white label cards, typically for a fee, allowing the smaller bank to brand the cards as their own without having to invest in the necessary infrastructure. For example, Cuscal Limited provides white label card and transactional products to Credit Unions in Australia; Simple (formerly BankSimple) issues bank accounts and debit cards operated by The Bancorp Bank and BBVA Compass in the United States. In Southern California, City National Bank is the largest check processor in that half of the state, because in addition to checks issued by its own customers, CNB processes checks for the customers of more than 60 smaller Southern California banks. Many software companies offer white label software to agencies or other customers, including the possibility to resell the software under the customer‚Äôs brand. This typically requires functionalities such as the adaptation of the software‚Äôs visual appearance, multi-customer management and automatic billing to the end-customers based on usage parameters. Vinyl records Another use of white labels began during the disco era on promotional copies of vinyl records. Before records were to be released to the public, often before official artwork was designed and printed, promotional copies were sent out in a white sleeve to DJs to solicit radio and nightclub play, in an effort to build hype and gauge public interest by the record labels, ultimately to better estimate manufacturing quantities. This created a situation where certain respected or well-connected DJs would have exclusive copies of material, immediately increasing demand on certain big records.

In this early period (13th and 14th century), \\"Tatar\\" was not an ethnonym but a general term for the armies of Genghis Khan‚Äôs successors. The First Tatar settlements in Bulgaria may be dated to the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century, when military units persecuted in the wake of dynastic feuds in the Golden Horde defected to Bulgarian rulers (Pavlov, 1997). From the late 14th to the late 15th century, several groups of Tatars settled in the Bulgarian territory (then under Ottoman rule) for various reasons. The settlers, probably nomads, eventually adopted a sedentary way of life and, in some areas, survived as compact communities for more than two centuries. The records show that the Tatars were inclined to raid villages and resist authority, and were therefore resettled among the local, just as restive, populations in Thrace. The Tatars were assigned special messenger and military missions, and were incorporated into the Ottoman military administration. This fact, along with their small number, the closeness between the \\"Tatar\\" and local Ottoman Turkish language, and the common religion, led to the eventual loss of group Tatar identity. Unlike the situation in Thrace, the ethnic composition of Dobruja attests to the existence of a large Tatar community from the 15th to the 20th century. The Ottoman conquest of Bessarabia created conditions for the constant migration of Tatars from the Northern Black Sea region to Dobruja in the 1530s and 1540s. The 18th century saw the beginning of a radical change in the ethnic composition of the northern Black Sea region as a result of Russian invasions. Between 1783, when the Crimean Khanate was annexed to Russia, and 1874, there were several waves of emigration from the Crimea and Kuban, and a considerable number of Crimean Tatars settled in the Bulgarian lands. The Tatars who live in Bulgaria today are descended precisely from those immigrants, who kept their identity. The largest wave of emigration was during and after the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856). Of the approximately 230,000 Tatars who emigrated from 1854 to 1862, about 60,000 settled on Bulgarian territory (Romanski, 1917, p. 266). The majority dispersed in Northern Bulgaria especially in Dobruja, on the plains near the Danube River and in the area of Vidin. The mass settlement of Tatars in the Bulgarian lands led to the establishment of traditional relations between Bulgarians and Tatars. Contrary to the Circassian immigration, Bulgarian National Revival society did not disapprove of the settlement of Tatars. The Tatars themselves were in a state of ethnopsychological shock but, in all likelihood thanks to their nomadic past, succeeded in adapting to \\"the alien world\\". This first period in the modern history of the Tatar group in Bulgaria (1862‚Äì1878) was characterized by economic and environmental adjustment to the new realities and the consolidation of all Kipchak-speaking refugees. The development of the Tatar group and its identity after Bulgaria‚Äôs 1878 Liberation was determined by political factors. On the one hand, the host country changed. Having settled in the Ottoman Empire, the Tatars, who had not changed their ethnic and ecological environment, suddenly found themselves in another political organism - Bulgaria, a state that differed greatly from its predecessor. This came as another ethnopsychological shock to the Tatars and prompted a new wave of emigration. Even those who remained in Bulgaria - about 18,000 people most of them in the areas with Turkish populations in northeastern Bulgaria found it hard to achieve a balance, and many of them eventually emigrated to Turkey. The second factor of ethnic changes was the nascent Crimean Tatar national \\"renaissance\\" and differentiation in the late 19th and early 20th century. Notably, the national idea of the Tatars developed at a time when the majority of them were beyond the boundaries of their historical homeland. Since the national idea was immature among the Crimean Tatars, they were susceptible to assimilation which, in the Bulgarian conditions, was effected not by the nation-state but by another ethnic group - Bulgarian Turks. Other factors also accounted for the specificity of each period in the history of the Tatars in Bulgaria. In the post-Liberation period (1878-1912/1918), there were generally no major changes in the Tatar group - there was no large-scale emigration, and the process of ethnic consolidation continued. The period from the Treaty of Neuilly to the Treaty of Craiova (1919‚Äì1940) saw a number of radical changes. Southern Dobruja, home to two-thirds of Bulgaria‚Äôs Tatar population, was annexed to Romania. The Tatars found themselves in a state with large Tatar populations around Medgidia, Mangalia and K√∂stence (Constan≈£a). On the other hand, the start of this period coincided with a short-lived Tatar nation-state in the Crimea and the constitution of the Turkish secular state. Modern Tatar nationalism embraced Pan-Turkism arid turned to Ankara for support as a result of Kemalist propaganda. This period saw large-scale Tatar emigration to Turkey and the establishment of a circle around the magazine \\"Emel\\" (1929-1930 in Dobrich), which used Pan-Turkic slogans as a cover for the promulgation of Turkish policies. Arguably, this was the beginning of the political Turkification of Tatars (Antonov, 1995). The general tendencies remained the same in the next period (1940 to the early 1950s), except that Bulgaria recovered Southern Dobruja, whose Tatar population had decreased by half. In the communist period, collectivization and industrialization destroyed the traditional lifestyle of the Tatars too. The natural but slow assimilation into the Turkish community endogamy was no longer possible considering the small number of the Tatar population - was intensified by modernization. There was also a socioeconomic factor the desire to take advantage of the privileges which the communist authorities granted to the Turkish community. The communist regime pursued inconsistent policies towards the Tatars. It originally adopted Moscow‚Äôs attitude to the Crimean Tatars, officially ignoring their presence in Bulgaria (they were last mentioned in the 1956 census, before reappearing as late as 1992). In 1962, the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party‚Äôs Central Committee proposed taking action against the Turkification of Gypsies, Tatars and Bulgarian Muslims. The measures included study of the ethnic origins of Bulgaria‚Äôs Tatars. This attested to a new policy: accentuating the community's ethnocultural specificity in an effort to highlight and restore the distinction (blurred as a result of Turkification) between Tatars and Turks. The reforms in the 1990s have led to a restoration of Islamic Turkic names and the creation of conditions for normal contacts with relatives in Turkey, as well as for independent cultural and educational activities. There have been signs of a rebirth of Tatar identity. Ethnonym In the last census (December 1992), 4,515 people (2,045 urban and 2,470 rural residents (4)) identified as Tatars. The ethnonym plays a main role in Tatar self-identification We are called Tatar, but we don‚Äôt know when we came [to those lands] (5). The Crimean Tatars (Qirim Tatarlari, Tatarlar), against the background of the impressive popularity of the term as an ethnicon in Eurasia, were the first to adopt it as an ethnonym after Genghis Khan wiped out the original Tatars. Due to the specificity of the Crimean Tatar ethnic genesis, other ethnonyms arc also in use; they have now lost their concrete ethnic content and are, rather, a memory, perception, pejorative name, a supplementary term and, very rarely, a group indicator: Nogay, Tat, Kazan, Kipchak, Laz, Kazakh. They are used as a modifier of the general ethnonym, for instance, Nogay Tarari. Informants have the most clear perception of the Nogay as a separate group of a distinct type of people (prominent cheekbones and inure Mongolian), dialect (\\"truer Tatar\\"), livelihood (horse-breeding), and even character. In fact, the most differentiated group are the Tats, the informants know who they are and they themselves identify as such. Their distinction is based on their dialect. Informants claim that there are Kazan Tatars in Bulgaria, they are \\"fatter\\". They have only heard about Kipchaks. Laz Tatars reportedly speak a language similar to Turkish. The Kazakhs are perceived as a \\"tribe\\" related to the \\"Don Kazakhs\\" (Cossacks), which, however. is Muslim. The more prosaic version is that \\"Kazakh\\" is a \\"nickname\\": \\"We call a \\"Kazakh\\" someone who is headstrong, stubborn\\". Apart from the ethnic terms, Tatars are also divided into subgroups distinguished by territorial origin: Kerisler (from Kerch), Shongarlar (from Chongar), Orlular (from Or; Russian Perekop) There is also a subdivision of Tatars identified by a personal name - \\"Sora Tatari\\", from the name of the tribal chief and Tatar epic hero Chora Batyr (Tasheva. 1975. pp. 2‚Äì73). The pejorative term Tatar Sengenesi (\\"Tatar Gypsy\\") refers to a particular group of Tatars in Bulgaria (for example, a family from the village of Golyamo Vranovo, Rousse district), which probably came from Karachai. As regards the ethnonym as a marker of ethnicity, there are traces of internal ethnic differentiation among the Tatars as part of - and, at the same time, in opposition to their collective identity. The Turks and the Bulgarians have come to use the popular term \\"Tatar\\" as a stereotype (6) rather than an ethnonym. The influence of folklore and, later, of historical texts, is indicative in this respect. In Bulgarian folklore, \\"the Tatars\\" are a symbol of the strange and the unknown, and have pejorative connotations (Antonov.1995). Unlike those who do not know any Tatars in real life, those who do have a positive attitude to them. The negative attitude is associated with the ethnonym of the Tatars, and not with the other markers of their group identity. Origins The Crimean Tatar ethnos originated on the territory of the Crimean peninsula and inland steppes in the 14th and 15th century. The main ethnic components that were successively incorporated into the new ethnos were the ancient indigenous populations (for example -Bat-Bayan's protobulgarians), the Kumans and, finally, the Kipchakized Mongol clans. Due to the slave trade and the military campaigns for the capture of slaves, economic mainstays of the Crimean khanate - other ethnoses also contributed to the Tatar genotype. The Tatars in Bulgaria were formed as a group with a common identity as a result of the ethnic consolidation of the immigrants: Crimean Tatars proper, Nogay. Karachai and the distinct group of the Tats. Their consolidation was based on the close languages, common destiny and political idea of belonging to the former Crimean khanate and respective ethno-social formations. The Tatars associate their common descent with the idea of a homeland: \\"we are all from the Crimea\\", \\"the Crimea is the homeland of our ancestors\\" - as well as with their knowledge about its history and the destiny of their own people. The Tatars stress their specific anthropological type. They regard it as a main marker of Tatar identity‚Äô, second only to the language. For example, Tatars from Golyamo Vranovo say that those from Vetovo are \\"truer Tatars\\" not only because their language is \\"purer\\", but also because they have \\"larger heads and slit eyes. The Tatars also differ from the others in that most of them are \\"dark-eyed\\", with a \\"broad, flat face\\". Their neighbours likewise regard the specific appearance as a main distinctive feature of the Tatars. They talk of a \\"Tatar face\\". Language Crimean Tatar is a Kipchak language from the Western Turkic language group which, however, has been strongly influenced by Oguz through Ottoman Turkish. The Tatars in Bulgaria speak various local dialects developed in a foreign linguistic environment. This process is very complicated and has continued to the present day, On the one hand, the idiolects of speakers of the main dialects are modifying and tending to become standardized, with a particular dialect prevailing in a particular population centre but strongly influenced by other dialects (Boev, 1971, p. 81). Along with the standardization of the Kipchak dialects of refugees, there was a process of Oghuzation too. This process can be traced back to the pre-emmgration Oghuz tradition in the literary Crimean Tatar language (Boev, 1971, p. 94). After the Tatars settled in the Bulgarian lands, the influence of Ottoman Turkish on the vernacular intensified. The Tatar language was at a sadvantage the official language was Ottoman Turkish, and did not develop a literary variant (Boev, 1964, pp. 81‚Äì2). After the Liberation, the process intensified to the point of linguistic assimilation, mainly because Tatars and Turks communicated in Turkish and, later, because most children were sent to Turkish rather than Tatar schools (Boev, 1964, p. 2 Boev, 1971, p. 109). In 1910, 546 Tatars from Southern Dobruja cited Turkish as their native language. The choice of Turkish in the past few years has also been largely determined by the fact that the Tatars do not have access to Crimean Tatar literature and read the available Turkish books. The boom of Turkish satellite television has also affected the Tatar language. For a considerable section of the Tatar community. Tatar remains a means of communication among elderly people only. Children understand but do not speak the language. The Tatars started learning Bulgarian even before the Liberation (Kanitz, 1932. p. 141). When Southern Dobruja was under Romanian rule, the Tatars went to Romanian schools and, according to Bulgarian sources, learnt Romanian very quickly. Bulgarian was spoken by the males in their social contacts and at work. Today, even the most elderly Tatar women understand Bulgarian. The Tatars in contemporary Bulgaria are trilingual, but there is a strong tendency towards the replacement of Tatar by Turkish. The Tatars regard the Tatar language as a distinctive feature of their collective identity and ethnic differentiation from the others: \\"We don‚Äôt speak either pure Turkish or [pure] Bulgarian - we are Tatars\\". The main marker of Tatarlik \\" Tatar ethnicity \\" is the Tatar language. This is also illustrated by a Tatar proverb. A Tatar who does not speak Tatar with Tatars is not worthy of his mother‚Äôs milk (7). The Tatars qualify the loss of the Tatar language as a loss of ethnicity: \\"Where the Tatars were a minority they have been assimilated. The Young no longer speak Tatar, yet in the past some Turkish women who married Tatars would eventually forget Turkish\\"; \\"The Tatars have now mixed [...] The language is also mixed\\"; \\"We have mixed. We speak almost Turkish [only]. Few Tatars have remained\\". Informants say that intermarriage leads to ethnic assimilation because that is thc easiest way to lose the Tatar language. Still, there are people of Tatar origins who neither speak nor understand Tatar, yet have the self-awareness of \\"true Tatars\\" - probably in combination with a prioritized Turkish self-awareness. There is an interesting form of maintaining the lexical stock of Tatar dialects and of demonstrating Tatar ethnicity: when they meet, Tatars from different population centres will \\"test\\" each other on typical Tatar words. Bulgarians or Turks who speak Tatar also test the Tatars and declare themselves truer Tatars if the latter fail to give the right answer. This indicates that non-Tatars also regard language as an important ethnic marker of the Tatar community. Religion The Tatars are Sunni Muslims. For them religion is an important, but not a main ethnic marker because it is identical to that of the Turks. Islam is seen as a basis of the community of all Muslims. Informants from the Tatar, as well as from other groups, tend to regard religion in general as a consolidating factor: \\"Tatars, Turks, Bulgarians - all are children of God\\". The Tatars consider themselves good Muslims. The better educated and younger Tatars regard the Turks as fanatics and themselves as moderates - which they believe is an advantage. Respondents distinguish the two communities by the Islam-based segregation of women in the case of the Turks and the absence of such discrimination among the Tatars, as well as by the attitude to the Christians and the Alevites. The Tatars are tolerant towards the Alevites (Shias) while the Turks (who are Sunni) are not. The other communities do not consider religion as a main distinctive feature of Tatar identity either, but rather as something that associates the Tatars with the Turks: \\"(they are) Muslims like the Turks\\". The Tatar Muslim community (where it is large enough) has its own institutional and ritual practices independent of the Turks. The Tatars celebrate religious holidays in their own esoteric circle and worship God in their own mosques. The Tatars built mosques of their own even right after they settled on Bulgarian territory, and this institution has survived in the population centres with larger Tatar communities. The \\"Tatar mosque\\" (for instance, in Vetovo) is a natural centre not only of religious, but also of socio-political life, a place for social contacts and internal demonstration of ethnicity. A map of the Crimea, the Tatar national flag arid photos of prominent Tatars usually hang on the walls; there are books too. Livelihood The special status of the first Tatar settlers in the Ottoman Empire led to the emergence of a professional community designated as \\"Tatars\\" messengers and guides of strangers - which was eventually dissociated from the Tatar ethnicity. This is a classical case of the adoption of an ethnonym as a name of a profession. Contemporary Tatars do not distinguish themselves from the other communities on the basis of occupation, but memories of the traditional livelihood have survived in their self-perception: \\"The Tatars used to be horse-breeders, they produced riders\\"; \\"They loved horses, they used to decorate them - with tassels\\". In the late 19th and early 20th century, the traditional occupation of Tatars in the countryside was agriculture and in the towns, small-scale trade and various crafts: cartage, candle-making, furriery, butchery, coffee- making, bow production, barbering. According to Bulgarian sources, Tatar carters were famous for their skills. Some Turkish carters would even claim that they were Tatars. This stereotyping from the recent past has undoubtedly influenced contemporary attitudes to the Tatars. Symbols Informants say that \\"the old flag of the Tatars was a horse tail‚Äô‚Äô. The modern one is the golden mark of the Ghirais on a blue-green background. It can occasionally be seen on badges and streamers. Tatar leaders have a tape of the \\"national anthem\\" too. The now \\"traditional\\" Tatar festivals have come to play the role of symbols. From 1990 to 1996, such festivals were held in Onogur (Dobriƒç district), ƒåerkovna (Silistra district) Vetovo (Ruse district). KƒÉpinovo, Jovkovo and Topola (Dobriƒç district). There were three ours of folk ensembles from Northern Dobruja which identified as \\"Tatar\\", but most of their performances were in Turkish. The festivals are seen as a distinct demonstration and symbol of Tatar identity. The poem 'I am Tatar', which every younger Tatar knows by heart, is often recited. Traditional Culture The original Tatar cultural tradition was lost in the course of modernization, but elements of the Islamic tradition have survived. The Tatars know and remember, but do not practice their traditional culture. Informants remember typical Tatar elements in the design of houses and costumes (Tatar women did not wear veils) which, however, were abandoned in the process of modernization. Today Tatars cite traditional food as a marker of their identity: \\"The Turks adopted Tatar food too, but they can‚Äôt prepare it and don‚Äôt like it\\"; or the proverb \\"The right of the Tatar is meat and rakia\\". Tatar legends also associate ethnicity with food. Here is how a story explains the death of entire Tatar villages after the settlement: \\"they fell sick because they weren‚Äôt used to the food. They were used to meat, but the Turks ate tarhana [dried ground dough] only - Tatars can‚Äôt do without meat\\". There are special customs for preparing certain dishes, which are therefore seen as traditional Tatar fare. Most informants believe that the Tatar holidays and customs are original. A smaller part do not think that they are very different from the Turkish, since both are Muslim. The process of extinction of traditional culture has intensified: \\"We came here long ago, nor are we pure Tatar families only - so that‚Äôs how Tatar customs have become of secondary importance and are thus eventually forgotten Informants cite the following unique Tatar holidays: Nawrez, the Tatar first day of spring and, in the past, New Year; Tepres, the Tatar St. Sophia‚Äôs Day and, in some villages, St. George‚Äôs Day; and Qidirlez, the Tatar St George‚Äôs Day. They always cite Tatar elements in other rituals - noting, for instance, that \\"the Turks don‚Äôt have that\\". History Contemporary Tatars know little about their history in terms of events, dates and specific figures and phenomena. They have not had any particular historical education. The Tatar community does not have its own educational institutions. The earliest signs of a Tatar presence in history are believed to be the uprising of Ivailo and the figure of Chaka: \\"There was a Bulgarian tsar who was a Tatar - Chaka; that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been telling them, but they won‚Äôt believe me\\". The name of this \\"Bulgarian tsar\\" is also cited as Chakatai and Isai. This example illustrates the Tatar awareness of the historical contribution of their ethnic. One informant elevates this to Tatar universalism: \\"There are Tatars everywhere. The Turks are Tatars too. There are [Tatars] in China too [...] Do you know who invented the trousers? The Tatars\\". Such cases are rare. For most Tatars, the milestone event in their history is the emigration from the Crimea. They recount the reasons for the emigration (wars, dynastic feuds), the quest for suitable places for settlement (they had to be fertile, to be like the Crimea) the problems of adjustment (other hostile people, strange trees, other seasons). The memories of emigration to Turkey and the performance of Tatar folk ensembles also play an important role in preserving the Tatar ethnicity. That is how the main points of reference in Tatar ethnic history have been formed. Knowledge of history is an element of the general attainments of the Tatar intellectual elite, whereas the ordinary people have only a vague idea of their past. Value System This marker is directly associated with the notion of the ethnic character or mentality. The Tatars have a clear concept of character traits which they believe arc typical of their identity: \\"There is a difference between Turks and Tatars. A big difference. Our folks - men, women - will get together, sit down, but here the men will sit apart from the women [...] And our Tatars are very hospitable, you know. It‚Äôs in them. If you are stranded in a village, you‚Äôll never have to spend the night in the Street [...] We don‚Äôt care if somebody‚Äôs Bulgarian or Turkish - no we don't. We‚Äôre a democracy, I tell you\\". \\"The Tatars will always help each other. For example, relatives, friends, neighbours will pool efforts [...] Everybody helps in the building of a house - both men and women. The women-folk of Turks don‚Äôt go out at all\\". \\"The Tatar is cunning and clever, he won‚Äôt give in to blackmail and manipulation. He builds networks [...] When two Tatars meet, they become sort of family\\". \\"The Tatars will soon make up after a quarrel. When Turks quarrel, they won‚Äôt speak to each other for years\\". Those statements of informants convey the general idea of a \\"Tatar character\\". The main character traits are associated with tolerance in relations among individuals, the genders and ethnic communities, cleverness, hospitality, mutual help. The following positive traits are also believed to be typically Tatar: quick adoption of new developments; diligence; moderateness; persistence; friendliness; patience; courage. The community‚Äôs value system is based not only on the accentuation of the positive, but also on the admission of negative character traits. The Tatars sometimes say they are fickle. Tatars will not keep their word, they are easily carried away and make big promises which they don‚Äôt keep: \\"I‚Äôve broken my word\\". In addition, the Tatar is maybas - literally, \\"greasy head\\", i.e. headstrong. Menmenlik is another bad quality\\" - demonstrative individualism which takes the form of self-congratulation. The more critical also say that Tatars tend to be vindictive, malicious and miserly. The quoted statements show that the Tatars are capable of self-observation and self- analysis as an ethnic group. Their self-perception is stereotyped hut not lop- sided. The group‚Äôs self-portrait specifies the distinction from the others, the own value system and the individual‚Äôs emotional bond with the community. The specificity or the Bulgarian attitude to the Tatar identity is nest manifested in comparisons with the Turks. The Tatars are always said to be superior: they are better educated, cleverer, more accomplished and hospitable, and work harder. By contrast, the Turks tend to see the Tatars as bad and aggressive. In general, Bulgarian society hardly knows anything about the Tatars. Yet those who do, appreciate the Tatar specificity and identity for what they are worth. The main reason why the general public is not familiar with the Tatars is that the latter have for years deliberately and naturally gravitated towards the Turkish community. Having no high culture and institutions maintaining the Tatar identity, the Tatar ethnic community has been reproducing in a traditional environment. A cultural-educational association of Tatars in Bulgaria, Asabay (Kinship), based In Silistra and chaired by Ziya Ismail, was set up in 1993. In 1996, Ismail was replaced by Alkin Hassan, and the headquarters moved to Dobrich. The association has not undertaken any considerable projects to date and remains but a symbol of the Tatar presence in Bulgarian public life. The Tatars are perceived as part of Bulgarian society. They regard the Crimea as their \\"ancestral homeland\\", but Bulgaria as their own native country. Despite the demographic crisis and very real threat of gradual and natural extinction of the Tatar community, the past six or seven years have seen a sort of renaissance of Tatar identity. This renaissance might contribute to the survival of the Tatar ethnic group in Bulgaria.

The recombination rate within hotspots can be hundreds of times that of the surrounding region. Recombination hotspots result from higher DNA break formation in these regions, and apply to both mitotic and meiotic cells. This appellation can refer to recombination events resulting from the uneven distribution of programmed meiotic double-strand breaks.  Meiotic recombination  Meiotic recombination through crossing over is thought to be a mechanism by which a cell promotes correct segregation of homologous chromosomes and repair of DNA damages. Crossing over requires a DNA double-stranded break followed by strand invasion of the homolog and subsequent repair. Initiation sites for recombination are usually identified by mapping crossing over events through pedigree analysis or through analysis of linkage disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium has identified more than 30,000 hotspots within the human genome. In humans, the average number of crossover recombination events per hotspot is one crossover per 1,300 meioses, and the most extreme hotspot has a crossover frequency of one per 110 meioses. Genomic rearrangements Recombination can also occur due to errors in DNA replication that lead to genomic rearrangements. These events are often associated with pathology. However, genomic rearrangement is also thought to be a driving force in evolutionary development as it gives rise to novel gene combinations. Recombination hotspots may arise from the interaction of the following selective forces: the benefit of driving genetic diversity through genomic rearrangement coupled with selection acting to maintain favorable gene combinations. Initiation sites DNA contains \\"fragile sites\\" within the sequence that are more prone to recombination. These fragile sites are associated with the following trinucleotide repeats: CGG-CCG, GAG-CTG, GAA- TTC, and GCN-NGC. These fragile sites are conserved in mammals and in yeast, suggesting that the instability is caused by something inherent to the molecular structure of DNA and is associated with DNA-repeat instability. These fragile sites are thought to form hairpin structures on the lagging strand during replication from single-stranded DNA base-pairing with itself in the trinucleotide repeat region. These hairpin structures cause DNA breaks that lead to a higher frequency of recombination at these sites. Recombination hotspots are also thought to arise due to higher-order chromosome structure that make some areas of the chromosome more accessible to recombination than others. A double stranded-break initiation site was identified in mice and yeast, located at a common chromatin feature: the trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Recombination hotspots do not seem to be solely caused by DNA sequence arrangements or chromosome structure. Alternatively, initiation sites of recombination hotspots can be coded for in the genome. Through the comparison of recombination between different mouse strains, locus Dsbc1 was identified as a locus that contributes to the specification of initiation sites in the genome in at least two recombination hotspot locations. Additional crossing over mapping located the Dsbc1 locus to the 12.2 to 16.7-Mb region of mouse chromosome 17, which contains the PRDM9 gene. The PRDM9 gene encodes a histone methyltransferase in the Dsbc1 region, providing evidence of a non-random, genetic basis for recombination initiation sites in mice. Rapid evolution of the PRDM9 gene explains the observation that human and chimpanzees share few recombination hotspots, despite a high level of sequence identity. Transcription associated recombination Homologous recombination in functional regions of DNA is strongly stimulated by transcription, as observed in a range of different organisms. Transcription associated recombination appears to be due, at least in part, to the ability of transcription to open the DNA structure and enhance accessibility of DNA to exogenous chemicals and internal metabolites that cause recombinogenic DNA damages. These findings suggest that transcription-associated recombination may contribute significantly to recombination hotspot formation.

The work was likely composed in 1723 but the date of its first performance is unknown.  History and text  American Bach scholar William H. Scheide suggested that the work was written for a Michaelmas celebration.Scheide, William H. 'Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft' BWV 50: Doppelch√∂rigkeit, Datierung und Bestimmung.' (Leipzig, 1982: Bach-Jahrbuch) However, the exact dates of composition and first performance are unknown. The work has fascinated Bach scholars because of questions about its provenance. No autograph sources exist, and the earliest copies extant do not mention Bach's name. In 1982, Scheide argued that the existing version (for double choir) is an arrangement by an unknown hand of a lost original for five voices by J. S. Bach. His argument was based on irregularities in BWV 50's part-writing, which are highly unlike the writing of Bach. In 2000, the American performer and scholar Joshua Rifkin argued that a more plausible solution of this puzzle is that the author of BWV 50 was not Bach at all, but an unknown (but highly gifted) composer of the era. The suggestion is controversial.Rifkin, Joshua. \\"Siegesjubel und Satzfehler. Zum Problem von Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft (BWV 50)\\" (Leipzig, 2000: Bach-Jahrbuch ) The prescribed readings for the day were from and ; this movement draws from Revelation 12:10. Its text is \\"'\\".  Scoring  The piece is written for an unusually large orchestra. The score involves two four-part choirs, three trumpets, timpani, three oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. The movement is a chorus, or \\"coro doppio\\".  Music  Like other cantatas for Michaelmas, it features texture layering from the lowest range to the highest, and a contrapuntal representation of \\"battles and massing armies\\". It is in two distinct sections and uses fugal techniques. The movement begins with a \\"strong declaration in unharmonized octaves\\", pairing the low strings with the bass voice of the first choir. A rhythmic shift creates a \\"floating, turn-around feeling\\" before the tenor line enters, followed by alto and soprano. As this choir shifts into rhythmic counterpoint, the second choir, trumpet, and oboes enter. The movement also incorporates call-and-response, military-like tattoos, and an inversion of the previous order of thematic entry. The final twelve bars adopt a chromatic style not heard earlier in the piece.  Recordings  * Berliner Philharmonischer Chor / Berliner Philharmoniker, Carl Schuricht. J. S.

It inhabits Central America from south-east Mexico (mostly the Yucat√°n Peninsula), to Costa Rica, where it is common and not considered threatened. It lives in fairly open habitats such as forest edge, gallery forest and scrubland. It is more conspicuous than other motmots, often perching in the open on wires and fences. From these perches it scans for prey, such as insects and small reptiles. White eggs (3‚Äì6) are laid in a long tunnel nest in an earth bank or sometimes in a quarry or fresh-water well. Its name originates from the turquoise color of its brow. It was first declared as the official national bird of El Salvador in 1999, where the bird is known as Torogoz. A Torogoz in Joya de Ceren Mayan ruins in El Salvador The bird is long and weighs . It has a mostly grey-blue body with a rufous back and belly. There is a bright blue strip above the eye and a blue-bordered black patch on the throat. The flight feathers and upperside of the tail are blue. The tips of the tail feathers are shaped like rackets and the bare feather shafts are longer than in other motmots. Although it is often said that motmots pluck the barbs off their tail to create the racketed shape, this is not true; the barbs are weakly attached and fall off due to abrasion with substrates and with routine preening. Unlike most bird species, where only males express elaborate traits, the turquoise- browed motmot expresses the extraordinary racketed tail in both sexes. Research indicates that the tail has evolved to function differently for the sexes. Males apparently use their tail as a sexual signal, as males with longer tails have greater pairing success and reproductive success. In addition to this function, the tail is used by both sexes in a wag-display, whereby the tail is moved back-and-forth in a pendulous fashion. The wag- display is performed in a context unrelated to mating: both sexes perform the wag-display in the presence of a predator, and the display is thought to confer naturally selected benefits by communicating to the predator that it has been seen and that pursuit will not result in capture. This form of interspecific communication is referred to as a pursuit-deterrent signal. The call is nasal, croaking and far-carrying. The turquoise-browed motmot is a well-known bird in its range and has been chosen as the national bird of both El Salvador and Nicaragua. It has acquired a number of local names including guardabarranco (\\"ravine-guard\\") in Nicaragua, Torogoz in El Salvador (based on its call) and p√°jaro reloj (\\"clock bird\\") in the Yucat√°n, based on its habit of wagging its tail like a pendulum. In Costa Rica it is known as momoto cejiceleste or the far-less flattering p√°jaro bobo (\\"foolish bird\\"), owing to its tendency to allow humans to come very near it without flying away.

R. W. Bosanquet of Rock Hall, Alnwick, Northumberland. He was educated at Eton College, and took first class honors in Natural Science and Mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford, and later became a fellow of St. John's College. He was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn, London but worked mainly tutoring at Oxford, notably for the Natural Science School, and later was Professor of Acoustics at the Royal College of Music. He was a musician and an authority on organ construction, and published a number of experimental and theoretical papers on acoustics, electromagnetism and astronomy. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1871 and Fellow of the Royal Society in 1890. Bosanquet developed classes for musical tunings used mapping pitches in a coordinate arrangement he called a generalized keyboard, contrasting with Henry Ward Poole's and Colin Brown's keyboards which were based on symmetry of key relationships. The keyboard was demonstrated in two instruments loaned permanently to the South Kensington Museum in 1876: a 4-octave harmonium tuned in 53 equal temperament with 84 keys per octave built by T. A. Jennings in 1872‚Äì3, and a 3-octave generalized keyboard organ built in 1875 with 48 notes per octave tuned to Hermann von Helmholtz' approximate just intonation (schismatic temperament) or 36 notes per octave tuned in quarter-comma meantone selected by means of draw stops. In 1877, speculating on papers about Indian ≈õrutis, he relaxed the arrangement to permit mapping 22 equal temperament. He also invented a sensitive polariscope working independent of direction. Well Temperament versus Equal Temperament: Marpurg is most likely at the source of a two-centuries misunderstanding that J. S. Bach would have been using the equal temperament for the performance of \\"Das Wohltemperirte Clavier\\", because of his publication \\"Versuch √ºber die musikalische Temperatur\\", 1776, This misunderstanding was only much later first challenged by Robert Holford Bosanquet in \\"An Elementary Treatise on Musical Intervals and Temperament\\" 1876, pp. 29‚Äì30, but this position did not acquire fame. The above position of Bosanquet, that a distinction should be made between \\"well temperament\\" and \\"equal temperament\\" was rediscovered by H. Kelletat, and thoroughly defended and analysed historically in \\"Zur musikalischen Temperatur\\", 1960, especially p. 32\\\\. Thanks to this publication by H. Kelletat, almost all musicologists subscribe to this distinction nowadays. In 1890 he retired to Tenerife, spending summers in England. He died at his home called \\"El Castillo\\" (The Castle), near Los Realejos town, Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain) in 1912.  References Further reading *Obituary.

The sign weighs and is held together by of concrete. It stands tall and is capable of displaying a maximum temperature of , both of which are a reference to the temperature record. History It was built in 1991 by the Young Electric Sign Company of Salt Lake City, Utah for Willis Herron, a local Baker businessman who spent $700,000 to build the thermometer next to his Bun Boy restaurant. Its height -- 134 feet -- was in honor of the 134-degree record temperature set in nearby Death Valley on July 10, 1913. Soon after its construction, 70-mph winds snapped the thermometer in half, and it was rebuilt. Two years later, severe gusts made the thermometer sway so much that its light bulbs popped out. Concrete was then poured inside the steel core to reinforce the monument. Herron sold the attraction and restaurant to another local businessman, Larry Dabour, who sold it in 2005. In September 2012, the owner at that time, Matt Pike, said that the power bill for its operation had reached $8,000 per month and that he turned it off due to the poor economy. In 2013, the thermometer and accompanying empty gift shop were listed for sale. The family of Willis Herron (who died in 2007) recovered ownership of the property in 2014 and stated their intention to make it operational again.

Description As a community and ward Ystrad contains the neighbouring district of Gelli. Ystrad is a former coal mining village which was once housed the most profitable collieries belonging to the Cory brothers. Ystrad is long and narrow, a main road where most amenities can be found, and a series of smaller residential streets lined with the terraces associated with the area. The majority of housing stock is the classic South Wales valleys terrace with infills of new build. The Rhondda Fawr River runs through the village, separating it from Gelli on the southern bank. Like most former coal mining communities in the South Wales Coalfield, Ystrad is remarkably self-contained. There is a very strong community in Ystrad Rhondda - a common feature of these mining towns. The Ystrad Rhondda railway station is on the Rhondda Line opened by British Rail. Religion The Church of St Stephen, Ystrad Rhondda (Church in Wales) The oldest Baptist chapel in the Rhondda, and originally known as Ynysfach Chapel, Nebo was located at Ystrad. It was demolished in the early 1980s. The Church of St Stephen is part of the Church in Wales Parish of Trealaw with Ystrad Rhondda with Ynyscynon in the Diocese of Llandaff. The church was built in 1895-1896. Governance The Ystrad electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Ystrad community and elects two county councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council.

It is surrounded by the ƒåabraƒè nature reserve. Origins First mentioned in 1276, Litava Castle, as it was called then, due to its position on top of the Litava Valley and its river, possesses a dominating position. It along with other (sentry) castles were built to protect the roads that traveled the area to the northern Hungarian mines (now in central Slovakia) that were booming at the time. The castle was the residence of the Ders of Hunt-Poznan who are noted as being in the area from 1256. This originally sentry castle first mentioned in 1276 was built to guard the road leading to many northern Hungarian mining towns. In the 16th century it was rebuilt to the counter-Turk fort, which successfully resisted all Turkish raids. The Koh√°ry family acquired the castle in the 17th century. They later moved into the more comfortable manor house in Sv√§t√Ω Anton and had the castle burned in 1812. The Castle has been decaying ever since. In the 14th Century the castle is recorded as becoming the residence of Mathias Cs√°k, around 1342 the castle began to be expanded into a more suitable fortification than in previous times. Some time later Cabrad was conquered and taken over by Jan Jiskra of Brandys, who was marching with his Hussite forces. Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus came and re-claimed the castle in 1462. House of Lords and Bandits In the early part of the 16th Century Cardinal Tam√°s Bak√≥cz took over the castle and invested in its refurbishment and further expansions. He was one of the richest men in Hungary and the country's highest clerical official at that time. All the work took place around 1520. Peter Bakoc his nephew, inherited the castle after his uncles passing‚Äîalong with his wealth, after Bakoc, his sister and brother-in-law took over the residence. In 1547 the castle was taken seized by the knight Melichar Balassa and his bandit retinue, until the king forced him out a year later in '48. Italian Engineering In 1585, fears of Ottoman advances were rising in the country and vast fortification works were initiated, led by the Italian fortress architect G. Ferrari. This is possibly why the Ottoman army failed in both its attempts during the years 1585 and 1602. After these events the castle became part of the King's fiefdom, which he rewarded in 1622 to noble Peter Kohary, for his outstanding actions and efforts in fighting the Ottomans. The 17th Century was a relatively peaceful time for Cabrad Castle, going through the anti-Habsburg rebellions without much event or issue. But also around this time the road which was the castle's reasoning began to lose its importance. Set to blaze In 1750 the Koh√°ry family gave up on the ƒåabraƒè castle as their residence. The family kept it for a time as just a summer home until Ferencz J√≥zsef Koh√°ry de Cs√°br√°g put the castle to blaze in 1812. Since then it has remained the ruin that it is today, slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding forests.

Rapidly advancing battery technology allows smaller and longer-lasting batteries to be placed into the space of the original batteries. Modifications of this type can be technically challenging and will almost certainly void any manufacturer warranty and have the potential to damage the modified device permanently. Popular modifications Many PDAs are not suitable for modification or do not require it; the newest devices include advanced high-capacity batteries, whilst some devices cannot be dismantled without permanent damage. The Palm Tungsten T3 came with a built-in 900 mAh rechargeable Lithium ion battery. The T1 and T2 also used a 900 mAh battery, but because of the upgraded Palm Tungsten T3 processor the battery life is significantly reduced. The modest battery life is the largest criticism of the Tungsten T3 compared to other Palm models. One of the most popular handhelds of all time, the Palm Tungsten T3 is a typical candidate for battery modification. The Tungsten T5 however, included a much newer battery and is therefore a much less likely candidate for replacement, at least not yet. Much fuss has been made over the issue of the iPod's built-in li-ion battery and the fact that it is not designed to be replaceable. Some have similar concerns over their handhelds' batteries and decide to try and remedy the problem themselves, just as was done on the iPod before Apple started offering extended warranties: in fact, Apple iPod replacement batteries have become somewhat of a favourite for use as external replacements/additions. Replacing the internal battery A popular method discussed extensively on the brighthand.com and spug.net for modification have involved opening the case and removing the original 900mAh battery and replacing it with various higher-capacity batteries, or simply replacing it because of age (a replacement battery costs a small fraction of the manufacturer's battery- replacement charge). Several people have successfully documented replacing the built-in Lithium ion battery with a higher-capacity battery, increasing time the T3 can be used without charging. . Batteries of 1100mAh are available that fit just fine. However, disassembling the case is complicated by 5 small metal tabs, not mentioned by most online instruction pages: two on each side, and one on the back just above the docking connector, which must be released as one of the first disassembly steps (for example, by inserting a very thin shim and pushing it gently down, while pulling the bottom panel down enough to clear it). The biggest problem when upgrading the T3 battery to even higher capacity, however, is that there is limited space within the handheld shell for a larger battery. Hence, modification typically requires some crushing of the replacement battery to make it fit and/or irreversible modification to the internal components of the shell (for example the stylus holder). Another problem is that Lithium-Ion batteries require a regulator circuit to regulate battery charge preventing damage, and so replacement batteries either require a built-in one or a grafted regulator circuit added. The battery replacement process Many guides have been written on the battery replacement process, including many users of popular PDA forums such as brighthand.com and spug.net . Many companies that supply PDA parts also provide their own guides for battery replacement; these are usually less radical and require little or no actual modification. Most guides include a clear disclaimer explaining the dangers involved and the definite loss of warranty from the vendor/manufacturer. Specific examples of step-by-step guides can be found below in the links section. External power modifications PalmOne released a Power2Go modification which allows the palm device to receive charge from an external battery pack. Many cheap alternatives are available from online electronics stores and auctions such as eBay. These devices usually supply power from four AA size batteries, allowing for more flexibility in storage capacity as exhausted batteries can be replaced as required. Homemade devices with higher mAh power supplies have been made by some enthusiasts to increase the external charge. These can either plug directly into the Palm Universal Connector (on older handhelds), the Palm Multi-Connector or hard-wired directly into the device's power terminals on the motherboard. Clock speed reduction As the T3 uses a 400MHz processor, using the same 900mAH battery from the T1 and T2 just doesn't cut it. The best way to extend the battery life of a T3 easily, is to use underclocking software like PXA clocker, Lightspeed or Warpspeed. This can give about 5-6 hours of runtime. However users who uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi extensively will find that even with underclocking, battery life is still rather short as wireless usage tends to use more power.

He began his career with St Mirren before moving to English club Blackburn Rovers for a ¬£300,000 fee in 1999. After only making one first team appearance at Blackburn, he joined Livingston in 2002 and won the Scottish League Cup with them in 2004. he subsequently played for Sheffield Wednesday and Falkirk before rejoining Livingston in 2012. He joined Alloa Athletic in June 2015 where he spent one season before signing for Cowdenbeath. O'Brien announced his retirement on social media at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. After playing for Scotland at under-21 level, O'Brien tried unsuccessfully to switch nationality to represent South Africa, the country where he was born. Club career=Early career Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, O'Brien started his career at Scottish club St Mirren, where he progressed through the youth ranks, before making his debut as a 16-year-old during season 1997‚Äì98. After only just reaching double figures in appearances for the first-team, he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of around ¬£300,000 in 1999. O'Brien moved back on loan for the rest of the season, and scored his first and only goal for St Mirren with a free-kick against Hamilton Academical. He made only one first-team appearance for Blackburn Rovers during his time at Ewood Park in an English League Cup match against Portsmouth before leaving the club for Livingston in 2002. O'Brien blamed his lack of first-team action on a clause in his contract, saying that a league appearance would mean Blackburn had to pay St Mirren an extra ¬£300,000. Livingston In September 2002, O'Brien moved back to Scotland after Scottish Premier League side Livingston agreed a deal to sign him and his teammate David McNamee from Blackburn Rovers. In 2004, he helped Livingston to their first major national honour by becoming an integral part of the Scottish League Cup winning side on 14 March 2004. O'Brien's excellent form for Livingston saw him attract interest from other clubs such as Aberdeen, Hearts and clubs south of the border. In total he made 119 league appearances for Livingston in all competitions and scored 16 goals. Sheffield Wednesday On 14 July 2005, O'Brien signed for English Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on a three-year contract after the midfielder rejected a new contract offer from Livingston. He scored his first goal for the club on 18 March 2006 in a 2‚Äì0 home win against Preston North End. He featured strongly in his first season at the club making 47 appearances in all competitions, but played less the following season after manager Paul Sturrock left, making only 22 appearances. He made 35 appearances in season 2007‚Äì08, but he was released at the end of the season after the expiry of his three-year contract. Falkirk O'Brien returned to Scotland once more by signing for Falkirk. He scored his first and what turned out to be only Falkirk goal in a 4‚Äì1 win over Hamilton on 27 September 2008. He spent three seasons at Falkirk before being released in 2011. Return to Livingston After a one-year absence from the game, O'Brien spent a trial period with Airdrie in August 2012. Despite the North Lanarkshire club keen to secure his services, O'Brien moved on and returned to his former club Livingston. Initially, O'Brien played as a trialist in the club's reserve matches to regain his fitness before signing a short-term contract on 22 November 2012. He made his second debut for Livingston on 17 November 2012 in a 2‚Äì1 home win over his former club Falkirk. After the expiry of his contract at the end of December 2012, he signed on again until the end of the season. A stand out performer for the club during his first season back, he was voted Livingston's 2012‚Äì13 Player's Player of the year. On 4 June 2013, O'Brien signed a new two-year contract with the club, keeping him at Almondvale until the summer of 2015. Alloa & Cowdenbeath After three seasons with Livingston, O'Brien transferred to Scottish Championship rivals Alloa Athletic in June 2015 where he spent one season before moving to Scottish League Two side Cowdenbeath. After a season with Cowdenbeath, O'Brien announced his retirement from football at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Coaching career After attaining his UEFA B Licence, O'Brien took up the role of youth coach with Cowdenbeath in February 2017, whilst also continuing in his playing role for the club. International career O'Brien was capped at under-21 level for Scotland. His application to switch nationalities in order to represent South Africa was rejected by FIFA in 2005, as he was too old to apply.

This produces biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. HO was first described in the late 1960s when Raimo Tenhunen demonstrated an enzymatic reaction for heme catabolism. HO is the premier source for endogenous carbon monoxide (CO) production. Indeed, monitored small doses of CO are being studied for therapeutic benefits. Heme oxygenase Heme oxygenase is a heme-containing member of the heat shock protein (HSP) family identified as HSP32. HO-1 is a 32kDa enzyme contains 288 amino acid residues. HO is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, though it has also been reported in the mitochondria, cell nucleus, and plasma membrane. HO catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin/bilirubin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. Though present throughout the body, HO has significant activity in the spleen in the degradation of hemoglobin during erythrocyte recycling (0.8% of the erythrocyte pool per day), which accounts for ~80% of the heme derived endogenous CO production. The remaining 20% of heme derived CO production is largely attributed to hepatic catabolism of hemoproteins (myoglobin, cytochromes, catalase, peroxidases, soluble guanylate cyclase, nitric oxide synthase) and ineffective erythropoiesis in bone marrow. HO enzymes are degraded via ubiquitination. In humans three isoforms of heme oxygenase are known. Heme oxygenase 1 Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a stress-induced isoform present throughout the body with highest concentrations in the spleen, liver, and kidneys. HO-1 is a 32kDa enzyme containing 288 amino acid residues which is encoded by the HMOX1 gene. A study has found levels of HO-1 in lung tissue were directly related to infection with Tuberculosis or infection-free areas, and knockout mice were found susceptible, showing the essential role of this enzyme.https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-11-enzyme-immune-cells- essential-role.html Heme oxygenase 2 Heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) is a constitutive isoform that is expressed under homeostatic conditions in the testes, endothelial cells and the brain. HO-2 is encoded by the HMOX2 gene. HO-2 is 36 kDa and shares 47% similarity with the HO-1 amino acid sequence. Heme oxygenase 3 A third heme oxygenase (HO-3) is considered to be catalytically inactive and is thought to work in heme sensing or heme binding. HO-3 is 33 kDa with greatest presence in the liver, prostate, and kidneys. Microbial heme oxygenase Heme oxygenase is conserved across phylogenetic kingdoms. The European Bioinformatics Institute's InterPro taxonomy database indicates there are 4,347 bacteria species, 552 fungi species, and 6 archaea species expressing a HO-1-like enzymes. Microbial HO homologues use different abbreviation such as HMX1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hmu O in Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Chu S in Escherichia coli. A critical role of the prokaryotic HO systems is to facilitate acquisition of nutritional iron from a eukaryotic host. Some HO-like prokaryotic enzymes are inactive or do not liberate CO. Certain strains of Escherichia coli express the non-CO producing Chu W isoform, whilst HO-like enzymes in other microbes have been reported to produce formaldehyde. The human microbiome contributes to endogenous carbon monoxide production in humans. Reaction Heme oxygenase cleaves the heme ring at the alpha-methene bridge to form either biliverdin or, if the heme is still attached to a globin, verdoglobin. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. The reaction comprises three steps, which may be: The reference does not give the exact stoichiometry of each reaction. :: :: :: The sum of these reactions is: : If the iron is initially in the +2 state, the reaction could be: : The degradation of heme forms three distinct chromogens as seen in healing cycle of a bruise This reaction can occur in virtually every cell; the classic example is the formation of a contusion, which forms different chromogens as it gradually heals: (red) heme to (green) biliverdin to (yellow) bilirubin. In terms of molecular mechanisms, the enzyme facilitates the intramolecular hydroxylation of one meso carbon centre in the heme. Inducers HO-1 is induced by countless molecules including heavy metals, statins, paclitaxel, rapamycin, probucol, nitric oxide, sildenafil, carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide-releasing molecules, and porphyrins. Phytochemical inducers of HO include: curcumin, resveratrol, piceatannol, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, dimethyl fumarate, fumaric acid esters, flavonoids, chalcones, ginkgo biloba, anthrocyanins, phlorotannins, carnosol, rosolic acid, and numerous other natural products. Endogenous inducers include i) lipids such as lipoxin and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; and ii) peptides such as adrenomedullin and apolipoprotein; and iii) hemin. NRF2 inducers with downstream HO-1 induction include: genistein, 3-hydroxycoumarin, oleanolic acid, isoliquiritigenin, PEITC, diallyl trisulfide, oltipraz, benfotiamine, auranofin, acetaminophen, nimesulide, paraquat, ethoxyquin, diesel exhaust particles, silica, nanotubes, 15‚Äêdeoxy‚ÄêŒî12,14 prostaglandin J2, nitro-oleic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and succinylacetone.  Roles in physiology  Heme oxygenase expression is induced by oxidative stress, and in animal models increasing this expression seems to be protective. Carbon monoxide released from heme oxygenase reactions can influence vascular tone independently or influence the function of nitric oxide synthase. Endogenous carbon monoxide The first detection of CO in humans was in 1949. Sj√∂strand determined that CO originated from the alpha- methene carbon of heme, setting the stage for the molar ratio between hemin degradation and CO production to be established. HO is the main source of endogenous CO production, though other minor contributors have been identified in recent years. CO is formed at a rate of 16.4 ¬µmol/hour in the human body, ~86% originating from heme via heme oxygenase and ~14% from non-heme sources including: photooxidation, lipid peroxidation, and xenobiotics. The average carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) level in a non-smoker is between 0.2% and 0.85% CO- Hb (whereas a smoker may have between 4% and 10% CO-Hb), though geographic location, occupation, health and behavior are contributing variables. Among these, the microbial HO system within the digestive tract is believed to contribute to systemic CO-Hb concentrations.

Kelley's cancer therapy Kelley formulated his own ideas about cancer, basing them on those of Max Gerson, and named his treatment \\"non-specific metabolic therapy\\". According to Kelley, cancer is a single disease caused by the lack of certain enzymes. His treatment involves injection of pancreatic enzymes, 50 daily vitamins and minerals, regular administration of laetrile, frequent body shampoos, detoxication using coffee enemas, and a specific diet. Kelley also added prayer and osteopathic manipulations to his treatment regime. In 1971, the American Cancer Society added non-specific metabolic therapy to a list of \\"unproven methods.\\" In 1980, Kelley's most famous patient, Steve McQueen, came to him with a case of inoperable mesothelioma that had not responded to mainstream treatment. As Kelley's regimen was applied to McQueen in Mexico, McQueen was falsely reported to be in remission and his case enjoyed widespread press coverage; People Weekly Magazine called him \\"McQueen's Holistic Medicine Man.\\" McQueen died 3 months later, following an unorthodox operation to excise the growing tumors. Nevertheless, Kelley's regimen was subsequently sought out by many patients with terminal cancer. In 2013 the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center characterized Kelley's therapy as a type of metabolic therapy, like Gerson therapy and Contreras therapy, that shows \\"no evidence of efficacy.\\" According to the Center, \\"findings from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life [...] compared to standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.\\" The coffee enemas that form part of the treatment can have harmful, and possibly deadly, side effects. Later career and life Kelley wrote a book entitled One Answer to Cancer, detailing his experiences as well as his methods. But by the 1980s, he had lost control of his once-thriving organization, and his dental license had been revoked. Kelley died of a heart attack on January 30, 2005 in Arkansas City.

Biography  Lettere e carteggi Born in Piacenza, Giordani originally set out to become a monk. But after having entered into the Benedictine convent of Saint Sixtus at Piacenza in 1797, he eventually changed his mind and abandoned the clerical vocation in favor of his only real love, literature. He looked with extreme favor upon Napoleon Bonaparte and the Napoleonic regime in Italy and, in 1807, he wrote a Panegyric on the Sacred Majesty of Napoleon. The following year he obtained the post of proto-secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts in Bologna which, however, he had to abandon in 1815: with the beginning of the Restoration he became highly suspect for his liberal, republican ideals. In 1816, he began his legendary epistolary exchange with Giacomo Leopardi to whom he eventually paid a visit in 1818, accompanying him, during his first travels outside of the small village of Recanati, to Macerata. He continued visiting him frequently during the following years. Giordani encouraged and helped foster the intellectual development and the further acquisition of knowledge that led to Leopardi's eventual greatness by exposing him to different cultural environments which included the most important groups of writers and intellectuals of the times. They shared a deep and lasting affection and esteem for each other. So much so, that Leopardi once described Giordani as his \\"dear and beneficent paternal image.\\" The inheritance left to him by his father in 1817 assured Giordani's economic independence and, as a consequence, also ensured him a great deal of intellectual independence. He traveled a great deal and settled, at various times, in Piacenza, Bologna and, finally, in Milan, where he became an editor, along with Vincenzo Monti, Giuseppe Acerbi and the geologist Scipione Breislak, of the classicist magazine La Biblioteca Italiana. He felt compelled to leave this position, however, because of an increasing atmosphere of political conflict and antagonism with Giuseppe Acerbi who held firmly Austro-Hungarian sympathies. In Florence, he began subscribing to the liberal magazine Antologia run by Giovanni Pietro Vieusseux. In the year 1825, he managed to get published, in this magazine, a letter to the Marchese Gino Capponi in which he proposed the idea of editing and publishing a collection (Scelta de' Prosatori Italiani) of all the works of the most important writers in Italian history, from Dante to contemporary writers of the time (including Leopardi), in volumes which did not cost more than 24 scudos. Nonetheless, he always maintained a detached and somewhat indifferent attitude toward this magazine because it propounded a vision of a radical renewal of the functions of the intellectual in public life along purely materialistic and commercial lines; the intellectual was to be viewed as a sort of merchant of ideas and an integral, organic part of the process of economic and material rationalization of society and culture along market- lines. Giordani rejected this vision of a market of letters, preferring to stick to his lofty Aristotelean conception of the contemplative and austere poet. After the suppression of the uprisings of 1821, there followed a period of retrenchment. Intellectuals generally abandoned the prospect of revolution in favor of a more moderate, reformist program, and the center of progressive culture moved away from Milan to Florence, and from the magazine Il Conciliatiore to Antologia. The uprisings of 1831 would find the intellectuals absent altogether and even Giordani, as a consequence, found himself something of an outcast in Italian society. In his final years, he lived in Parma, where he was incarcerated for three months in 1834 and where he died in 1848, ironically enough, precisely during the period of the (provisional) success of the anti-Austrian uprisings.  Works  *Description of the Bonaparte Forum, 1806. *On the Poetic Style of the Marchese of Montrone, 1807. *Panegyric on the Sacred Majesty of Napoleon, 1807. *Panegyric to Antonio Canova, 1810. *On the Life and Work of Cardinal Sforza Pallavicino, 1810. *On a Painting of cav.

The Debate Between Classicism and Romanticism  On 1 January 1816, in the first issue of \\"La Biblioteca Italiana\\", Giordani published his own translation of an article of Madame de Stael with the title On the Manner and Utility of Translations, in which de Stael invited Italians to abandon the isolationism and provincialism of their native literary traditions, to abandon their continued reference to a worn and anachronistic mythology in order to move closer to modern foreign literature. This was felt to be a powerful and provocative accusation of backwardness by literate Italians, who were portrayed as a bunch of erudites who, in the words of de Stael, went around \\"continually rummaging in the ancient ashes, in order to find perhaps some grain of gold.\\" \\"An Italian\\" responds to De Stael was the title of the article in which Giordani, in the April edition of the magazine, formulated a strong rejection of de Stael's invitation. What possible help could a bunch of foreign authors offer to the resolution of the most urgent task of any literary Italian, which is, of course, the return to linguistic purity?, asked Giordani. De Stael's article offered him the opportunity to state the fundamental principle of classicism: the existence of a form of perfection in art which, once attained, could only be either lost in decadence or reattained by going back to the perfect works which had already been realized and discovering what it is in them that makes them the most outstanding creations and expressions of the human imagination and creative skill. Italian writers had already been imitating classical poets for centuries and the imitation of modern foreign writers would have resulted in the obfuscation of the Italianity of Italian literary expression. \\"The sciences are capable of infinite progress and are able to find new truths every day which had been previously unknown\\", wrote Giordani. \\" But the progress of the arts is finished when they have found the beautiful and learned how to express it.\\" Perfection, for Giordani, was reached by the Greek and Latin writers and, later, by the Italians. He admitted that there are many tastes, but believed that these tastes are all conformable to the different characters of the various populations and cultures of the world. And it is precisely for this reason that Italian taste, offspring of Greco-Roman taste, is completely extraneous to that of, e.g., the English or the Germans. \\"One can dispute endlessly about whether or not all of that which people admire in English and German poetry is truly beautiful; or if much of it is not, rather false and exaggerated and therefore ugly. But let's suppose that all of it is beautiful; it does not follow that all of it will be beautiful to us Italians, if we mix it in with other things of our own. It is necessary to either cease being Italians, forget our own language, our history, transform our climate and our imagination, or, maintaining these things unchanged, accept that our poetry and our literature must be maintained Italian; but it cannot remain Italian if it is mixed with those northern ideas which have nothing in common and are incompatible with ours....I am not saying that an Italian cannot reasonably desire to learn the poetry and the literature of the northerners, as he can easily do by personally visiting those countries; But I deny that those literatures (beautiful and laudable to those who belong to those countries) can enrich and embellish ours because they are essentially incompatible. It is one thing to go to Japan out of curiosity in order to see almost a different world from ours. It is another thing to come back from there and desire to live like a Japanese among Italians.....Italians should study their own classics, the Latin and Greek writers.....\\" All of these ideas were later to exercise a profound influence over Leopardi, who, notwithstanding his romanticism in style and tone, was, at heart, a deeply committed classicist in holding (and in stating in many parts of the Zibaldone and elsewhere) that the arts, and indeed humanity itself, had systematically degenerated from a high- point in the Greco-Roman past to a point in the modern scientific world in which true beauty was no longer attainable because of the death of the primitive illusions associated with a natural, non-scientific and non- technological world. A year later, however, Giordani would read for the first time the tragedies of Shakespeare and end up powerfully impressed. He wrote: \\"I am reading the works of Shakespeare, which appears to me to be a new world of drama and, like in any new world, I am finding all sorts of things: enormous beauty and substantial misery. But it must be confessed that his delightful creations are great and new.\\" And, in contradiction to his many previous affermations in writings, he added, \\"I think these works would be of enormous profit to Italian poets.!!\\"  Conclusions  In his writings, Pietro Giordani demonstrated a strict adherence to linguistic classicism, to an eloquence balanced and controlled in form. His rhetoric is rarely hollow or empty; there is rigor, participation in cultural and educational problems; there is strong argument against prejudice and obscurantism; there is an aggressive but not thoughtless or banal anti-clericalism; there is an invitation to participate in and comprehend one's own times through the study of history and economics. For this reason, the idea of literature in Giordani, in spite of the common classicist roots, is very different from that of Monti: the literary enterprise must consist in the affirmation of virtue, the search for truth, and civil education. Poetry must not be an otiose pastime, science must be studied before Latin, teaching must integrate both manual and intellectual work, the study of contemporary history must come before that of antiquity. In him, faith in the happiness of humanity, once liberated from prejudices and oppression, alternates with a desolate vision of inevitable human unhappiness without conceding anything to transcendental illusions. This vision solicited Leopardi toward the necessity of dedicating himself to the practical, if not theoretical, overcoming of pessimism, to not letting himself be dominated by a philosophy that inhibits the will. There is, in Giordani, a contradiction between rhetorical education and the urgence of renewal, as there is in his conviction that the only way to achieve cultural progress in Italian society is through finding a stimulus in the lessons of the ancients. But it was the contradiction of Italian history itself that was expressed in him: not finding any elements of progress within an economically backward and social stagnant society, he alluded himself that the indisputable value of Italian literary tradition could be, in and of itself, a progressive factor. This explains perhaps a certain restrictedness of horizons and a provincialism which was never overcome. He himself seems to have been conscious of a certain insuffiency of his work with respect to his capabilities and intellect when he wrote: \\"If they wish to put a stone over these poor bones, I recommend that they write: Pietro Giordani was never known.\\"  Bibliography  *Giordani, Pietro.

Life Le Fort was born in the city of Minden, in the former Province of Westphalia, then the Kingdom of Prussia within the German Empire. She was the daughter of a colonel in the Prussian Army, who was of Swiss Huguenot descent. She was educated as a young girl in Hildesheim, and went on to study at universities at Heidelberg, Marburg and Berlin. She made her home in Bavaria in 1918, living in Baierbrunn until 1939.The Oxford Companion to German Literature \\"Gertrud von Le Fort\\", as found in Answers.com Despite publishing some minor works previously, Le Fort's writing career really began with the publication in 1925 of the posthumous work Glaubenslehre by her mentor, Ernst Troeltsch, a major scholar in the field of the philosophy of religion, which she had edited. She converted to Roman Catholicism the following year. Most of her writings came after this conversion, and they were marked by the issue of the struggle between faith and conscience.Oxford Companion In 1931, Le Fort published the novella, Die Letzte am Schafott (The Last at the Scaffold), based on the 1794 execution of the Carmelite Martyrs of Compi√®gne. An English translation, titled The Song at the Scaffold, appeared in 1933.The original publisher in English was Sheed & Ward of London. In 1947, Georges Bernanos wrote film dialogue to a proposed cinema scenario by Philippe Agostini based on Le Fort's novella, but the screenplay was not filmed at the time. Following Bernanos' death, after discussion with Bernanos' literary executor, Albert B√©guin, Le Fort granted permission for publication of Bernanos' work in January 1949, and gifted her portion of the royalties due to her, as creator of the original story, over to Bernanos' widow and children. Le Fort requested that Bernanos' work be titled differently from her own novella, and Beguin chose the new title Dialogues des Carm√©lites.Gendre, Claude, 'The Literary Destiny of the Sixteen Carmelite Martyrs of Compi√®gne and the Role of Emmet Lavery'. Renascence, 48.1, pp 37-60 (Fall 1995). This formed the basic for the opera by Francis Poulenc from 1956. Le Fort went on to publish over 20 books, comprising poems, novels and short stories. Her work gained her the accolade of being \\"the greatest contemporary transcendent poet\\". Her works are appreciated for their depth and beauty of their ideas, and for her sophisticated refinement of style. She was nominated by Hermann Hesse for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and was granted an honorary Doctorate of Theology for her contributions to the issue of faith in her works.German 115 Fall 2005 USDA Graduate School \\"Gertrud von Le Fort\\" In 1952, Le Fort won the Gottfried-Keller Prize, an esteemed Swiss literary award. Among her many other works, Le Fort also published a book titled Die ewige Frau (The Eternal Woman) in 1934, which appeared in paperback in English in 2010. In this work, she countered the modernist analysis on the feminine, not with polemical argument, but with a meditation on womanhood. In 1939 Le Fort had made her home in the town of Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps, and it was there that she died on 1 November 1971, aged 95.Oxford Companion Selected Works * Hymnen an die Kirche.

Biography Deharme was born in Paris in 1898. Her father was a famous doctor. In January 1925, she visited the Paris Bureau of Surrealist Research.Marguerite Bonnet ¬´ Chronologie ¬ª in ¬´ Andr√© Breton, ≈ìuvres compl√®te, tome 1 ¬ª, Gallimard, 1988, page L As a result of an incident that occurred during her visit, which is recorded in Andr√© Breton's Nadja, she would become known as the \\"dame au gant,\\" or the Lady of the Glove. In 1927 she married Paul Deharme, the radio pioneer who worked with surrealist Robert Desnos. Using the pen name Lisa Hirtz, she published her first book: Il √©tait une petite pie [There was a little magpie] (with 8 pochoirs by Joan Mir√≥) in 1928. Until recently, the legacy of Lise Deharme has been told in the margins of books on Surrealism and Surrealism‚Äôs father, Andr√© Breton. She is remembered as the \\"first impossible mad love dreamed of by Andr√© Breton\\".Barnet, Marie-Claire. \\"To Lise Deharme's Lighthouse: Le Phare De Neuilly, a Forgotten Surrealist Review.\\" French Studies LVII.3 (2003): 323‚Äì334. Print. However, her social and political influence on Surrealism extends far beyond the novel, and beyond her influence as Breton's \\"notorious muse\\". In recent years, historians such as Marie-Claire Barnet, Mary Ann Caws, Ren√©e Riese Hubert, Andr√©a Oberhuber, and Penelope Rosemont, have begun to un-do the \\"reducing\\" of Deharme to \\"a failed love story\\". These scholars have set out to establish a more dynamic conception of Deharme's reputation. In her lifetime, Lise Deharme (1889‚Äì1980), gained \\"celebrity as a hostess\\". Specifically, she was a prolific organizer of Surrealist salons. Man Ray once described Deharme‚Äôs house, where she held her salons, as ‚Äúa rambling affair, filled with strange objects and rococo furniture‚Äù.Man Ray. Self Portrait. Bulfinch Press, 1963. Print. Amidst these rambling salons, Deharme‚Äôs subversive publication, Le Phare de Neuilly, emerged in 1933. Le Phare de Neuilly provided space for radical juxtapositions of works by contributors such as \\"Natalie Barney, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, and Jacques Lacan\\" and was poignantly political and subversive. As the curator of Le Phare, Deharme personally \\"[blended] ethical and aesthetic issues to address the socio-political troubles of the early 1930s\\". In the late 1930s, Deharme collaborated with Claude Cahun on the book Le C≈ìur de Pic. After publishing Le C≈ìur de Pic in 1937 Deharme, alternatively, came to be known in the Surrealist circle as \\"la Dame de Pique\\"Barnet, Marie-Claire. La Femme Cent Sexes Ou Les Genres Communicants: Deharme, Mansour, Prassinos. Bern: Peter Lang, 1998. Print. [the Queen of Spades]. Around this time she was closely connected to Andr√© Breton, Paul Eluard, and Man Ray. She is featured posing in one of Man Ray‚Äôs photographs as the Queen of Spades. Marie Clare Barnet describes the significance of Deharme's new nickname: Le choix du symbole mal√©fique de la Dame de Pique nous sugg√®re donc qu'on aurait tort de rel√©guer ses ouvres dans la rubrique \\"charme fragile\\" de la \\"f√©minit√© f√©line et v√©g√©tale\\". M√©fiance, le charme de l'humour deharmien est plus v√©n√©neux qu'on a pu le laisser entendre, m√™me dans le meilleurs ouvrages de r√©f√©rences. [The choice of the malevolent symbol of the Queen of Spades suggests that we would be wrong to relegate her work to the \\"fragile charm\\" category of \\"feline and floral femininity\\".

The paintings were estimated to be worth approximately C$100 million. On 26 March 2007, the arbiter in the case, retired Supreme Court Justice Peter Cory, ruled that 85 paintings donated to the gallery before opening in the 1950s belong to the gallery, but that 48 paintings transferred after the opening belong to the Beaverbrook Foundation.Rejected Beaverbrook art deal split 78 paintings, CBC News; accessed 14 May 2013 The arbitration ruling was appealed and a settlement was reached in 2010.

Midwinter by William Robinson Midwinter in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent in 1910 and had become one of England's largest potteries by the late 1930s with more than 700 employees.

A large part of this was due to the noted ceramicists and designers who worked for the pottery, including Jessie Tait, Terence Conran, Hugh Casson, John Russell and Peter Scott. The Midwinter Pottery was also an innovator in producing 'accessories' to their basic dinner services and tea sets. The Clayburn Pottery, a sister company to Midwinter, made pieces such as lamp bases that could be added to a Midwinter dinner service. In the 1960s, the Spanish Garden design, which was very successful on dinner ware and tea sets, adorned articles such as a bread bin and chopping board. The costs involved in developing two unsuccessful new ranges weakened the company, and there was a takeover by J. & G. Meakin in 1968. In 1970 Meakin was itself bought out by Wedgwood. Pottery was produced under the Midwinter name from their factory until 1987. Many of the pieces produced by Midwinter in the 1950s and 1960s have become highly collectible, being typical of the styles of those eras.

It lies north- south axis in the line between Yogyakarta Kraton and Mount Merapi. This is in itself is significant to many of the local population, the north‚Äìsouth orientation between the palace and the volcano being of importance. The street is the centre of Yogyakarta's largest tourist district surrounded with many hotels, restaurants, and shops nearby. Sidewalks on both sides of the street are crowded with small stalls selling a variety of goods. In the evening several open-air street side restaurants, called lesehan, operate along the street. This is the street of the artists. Street musicians, painters, and other artists exhibit their creations on this road. Less obvious to the tourist, but more for the local population, side streets, lanes and structures that lead on to Malioboro are as important as the street itself. History Jalan Malioboro (ca.1900-40) Jalan Malioboro at night The street was for many years two-way, but by the 1980s had become one way only, from the railway line (where it starts) to the south - to Beringharjo market, where it ends. The largest, oldest Dutch era hotel, Hotel Garuda, is located on the street's northern end, on the eastern side adjacent to the railway line. It has the former Dutch era Prime Minister's complex, the kepatihan, on the eastern side. For many years in the 1980s and later, a cigarette advertisement was placed on the first building south of the railway line - or effectively the last building on Malioboro, which advertised Marlboro cigarettes, no doubt appealing to locals and foreigners who would see a pun with name of the street with a foreign product being advertised. It does not reach the walls or grounds of the Yogyakarta palace, as Malioboro ceases in name adjacent to the very large market Beringharjo (on the eastern side as well). From this point the street changes name to Jalan Ahmad Yani (Ahmad Yani Street, currently Margo Mulyo Street) and has the former Governors residence on the western side, and the old Dutch Fort Vredeburg on the eastern side. Malioboro Night Festival The festival held annually along Jalan Malioboro until the Monument of General Offensive of First March. Live music, featured music concert, traditional art show, Jembe Percussion, Kumlaka Ethnic, fashion show and other activities are arranged for Malioboro Night Festival.

A graft-chimaera is not a true hybrid but a mixture of cells, each with the genotype of one of its \\"parents\\": it is a chimaera. Hence, the once widely used term \\"graft-hybrid\\" is not descriptive; it is now frowned upon. Propagation is by cloning only. In practice graft-chimaeras are not noted for their stability and may easily revert to one of the \\"parents\\". Nomenclature Article 21 of the ICNCP stipulates that a graft-chimaera can be indicated either by * a formula: the names of both \\"parents\\", in alphabetical order, joined by the plus sign \\"+\\": : Crataegus + Mespilus * a name: ** if the \\"parents\\" belong to different genera a name may be formed by joining part of one generic name to the whole of the other generic name. This name must not be identical to a generic name published under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). For example +Crataegomespilus is the name for the graft-chimaera which may also be indicated by the formula Crataegus + Mespilus. This name is clearly different from √óCrataemespilus, the name under the ICN for the true hybrid between Crataegus and Mespilus, which can also be designated by the formula Crataegus √ó Mespilus. ** if both \\"parents\\" belong to the same genus the graft-chimaera may be given a cultivar name. For example Syringa 'Correlata' is a graft- chimaera involving Syringa vulgaris (common lilac) and Syringa √ó chinensis (Rouen lilac, which is itself a hybrid between S. vulgaris and S. laciniata). No plus sign is used, because both \\"parents\\" belong to the genus Syringa. A graft-chimaera cannot have a species name, because it is simultaneously two species. Although +Laburnocytisus 'Adamii', for example, is sometimes seen written as if it were a species (+Laburnocytisus adamii), this is incorrect. In Darwin's works Charles Darwin ¬´The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication¬ª, 1868 –≥.: > I will therefore give all the facts which I have been able to collect on the > formation of hybrids between distinct species or varieties, without the > intervention of the sexual organs. For if, as I am now convinced, this is > possible, it is a most important fact, which will sooner or later change the > views held by physiologists with respect to sexual reproduction.

She reigned as the second wife of Fuad, King of Egypt. Early life Nazli was born on 25 June 1894 into a family of Egyptian , Turkish and French origin. Her father was Abdur Rahim Sabri Pasha, minister of agriculture and governor of Cairo, and her mother was Tawfika Khanum Sharif. Nazli had a brother, Sherif Sabri Pasha, and a sister, Amina Sabri. She was the maternal granddaughter of Major General Mohamed Sherif Pasha, prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, who was of Turkish origin. She was also a great-granddaughter of the French-born officer Suleiman Pasha. Nazli first went to the Lyc√©e de la M√®re-de-Dieu in Cairo, and later to the Coll√®ge Notre-Dame de Sion in Alexandria. Following the death of her mother, she and her sister were sent to a boarding school in Paris for two years. After returning, Nazli was forced to marry her Turkish cousin, Khalil Sabri. However, the marriage ended in divorce after eleven months. After the separation, she stayed at the house of Safiya Zaghloul, where she met Zaghloul's nephew Saeed Zaghloul; the two were engaged until Saeed broke up with her during his exile with his uncle Saad Zaghloul following the 1919 revolution. Queen The Sultan of Egypt, Fuad I first saw Nazli at an opera performance. On 12 May 1919, Fuad proposed to her, although he was 26 years her senior. On 24 May 1919 Nazli married Sultan Fuad I at Bustan Palace, Cairo. It was the second marriage for both Nazli and Fuad. She later moved to the haramlek in the Abbasiya Palace. She was under pressure from her husband to produce a son, and was warned that she would be confined to the haremlek if she did not do so. After the birth of their only son, Farouk, she was allowed to move into Koubbeh Palace -the official royal residence- with her husband. When Fuad's title was altered to King, she was given the title of Queen. She then had four daughters: Fawzia, Faiza, Faika, and Fathia. Restricted to the palace throughout most of Fuad's reign, she was permitted to attend opera performances, flower shows, and other ladies-only cultural events. As her upbringing had left her remarkably educated, cultured and emancipated for an Egyptian woman of the time, she found this prescribed existence backward and stifling. It was said that whenever the royal couple fought, she was slapped by the king and confined to her suite for weeks. It was also alleged that she tried to commit suicide by overdosing on aspirin. Nazli accompanied the king during part of his four-month tour of Europe in 1927, and was much f√™ted in France because of her French ancestry. With the inauguration of Parliament in 1924, she was among the royal attendees at the opening ceremony, seated in a special section of the guest gallery. Later years Following the death of King Fuad in 1936, her son Farouk became the new King of Egypt, and she became the Queen Mother. Her brother Sherif Sabri Pasha served on the three-member Regency Council that was formed during Farouk's minority. In 1946, Nazli left Egypt and went to the United States for treatment for a kidney ailment. In August 1950, King Farouk deprived the Queen Mother, and her daughter Princess Fathia of their rights and titles. This was due to latter's marriage, which Nazli supported, but was against Farouk's wishes, to Riyad Ghali Effendi, a Coptic Christian. Nazli later converted to Christianity, changing her name to Mary-Elizabeth. In 1955 Nazli purchased, for $63,000, a 28-room mansion in Beverley Hills, where she lived with Fathia, her son-in-law, and their two children, and led an active social life.Snapshots of Hollywood Collected at Random The Milwaukee Sentinel, 18 April 1955 In 1965, Nazli attended the funeral of Farouk, in Rome. Following Fathia's divorce, Nazli moved to a small apartment in Westwood, Los Angeles, where Fathia eventually joined her after temporarily moving to Hawaii.Goodkind, Mike \\"Ex-princess loses last of fortune\\", The Free Lance Star, 21 September 1976 To meet debt demands, in 1975 Nazli sent her principal jewellery to auction at Sothebys, including a magnificent art deco tiara (720 diamonds weighing 274 carats) and matching necklace commissioned in 1938 from Van Cleef & Arpels.Former Queen Selling Jewels, Spokane Daily Chronicle, 28 October 1975 They sold for $127,500 and $140,000 respectively. However, Nazli and Fathia still ended up in bankruptcy court. In 1978, Fathia's jewellery was also sold to meet debts. In 1976, President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, sent a proposal to Queen Nazli and Princess Fathia that passports would be provided to Queen Nazli and Princess Fathia to give them right of return to Egypt. Eventually she settled in the US, due to her painful illness.Queen Nazli refused to return to Egypt and was wearing a cross (reference Queen Nazli by an Egyptian magazine Akher Sa'a = Last Hour) . She died on 29 May 1978 at the age of 83 in Los Angeles, California. Legacy Queen Nazli's art deco necklace reappeared at a Sotheby's sale in December 2015. The Queen ordered the necklace with a matching tiara for her daughter's (Fawzia) wedding. The necklace is formed by 600 round and baguette diamonds arranged in a sunburst motif.

The shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of some 1,000 civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict. By mid- August, after a two-month siege, Liberian president Charles Taylor went into exile and peacekeepers arrived as a result of the siege. Background In early 2003, a rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), emerged in the south, and by the summer of 2003, Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country. Despite some setbacks, by mid-2003 LURD rebels controlled the northern third of the country and was threatening the capital. Timeline On August 14, Rebels lifted their siege of Liberia's capital and 200 American troops landed to support a West African peace force. Women of Liberia The Christian and Muslim women of Monrovia joined forces to create a peace movement called Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace. Thousands of women mobilized their efforts, staged silent nonviolence protests and forced a meeting with President Charles Taylor and extracted a promise from him to attend peace talks in Ghana. The women of Liberia became a political force against violence and against their government. Their actions brought about an agreement during the stalled peace talks. As a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and later helped bring to power the country's first female head of state, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

It also found that the Mascarene parrot line diverged 4.6 to 9 million years ago, prior to the formation of R√©union, indicating this must have happened elsewhere. The cladogram accompanying the study is shown below: Another group of scientists later acknowledged the finding, but pointed out that the sample might have been damaged, and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the genus Coracopsis, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. Hume has expressed surprise by these findings, due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the islands that are believed to be psittaculines. *‚Ä† Mascarinus mascarinus, (Linnaeus 1771) (Mascarene parrot, extinct)  Description  They are notable in the parrot world for their peculiar appearance, which includes extremely truncated bodies with long necks, black to grey feathers and a pink beak. The skin of both female and male vasas turns yellow during the breeding season, and there is often feather loss. However, in females the feather loss can result in complete baldness. Another interesting feature of the females breeding physiology is when her feathers, which are usually black to grey, turn brown without a moult. This is caused by the redistribution of melanin, which is the pigment that makes the vasas' feathers black.  Unusual characteristics  In addition to their appearance they possess aspects of their physiology that make them completely unique amongst parrots. Vasa chicks are known to hatch after only 18‚Äì20 days of incubation, which is highly irregular as parrots of the vasa size range tend to take up to 30 days to hatch. The male vasas' cloaca is able to invert into a hemipenis, which becomes erect during mating ‚Äì a feature unique to the genus. This phallus is associated with prolonged matings enforced by a copulatory tie. Baby vasas possess pads on their beaks which when stimulated prompt a strong feeding response. These pads disappear after only a few weeks, however the feeding or 'weaning' reflex remains unusually strong well into adulthood. Often aviculturalists have to use a syringe to force food into the crops of young vasas as the intensity of the weaning reflex prevents them from being spoon fed. Vasa parrots infected with the debilitating psittacine beak and feather disease are known to turn white, which, during the 1970s when the first wave of birds were exported into Europe and America, resulted in them being mistakenly advertised by importers as albinos.

He was the second son of Kasuya Tadayasu, a retainer of the Bessho clan of Harima Province. He held the title of Naizen no Kami (ÂÜÖËÜ≥Ê≠£). Following the Ch≈´goku campaign, Takenori became a page of Toyotomi Hideyoshi due to the recommendation of Kuroda Kanbei. Takenori achieved notoriety due to his distinguished combat at the Battle of Shizugatake, where he was known as one of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake, and for this distinction he received a stipend of 3,000 koku from Hideyoshi. Also served in the Korean campaign, and subsequently was granted Kakogawa Castle in Harima Province. At the Battle of Sekigahara, he was to be the only one out of the \\"Seven Spears\\" to side with Ishida Mitsunari's \\"western\\" army, and joined in the attack on Fushimi Castle. While his holdings were confiscated after the battle, his family was later allowed a 500 koku stipend, and was given the status of hatamoto under the Tokugawa family's care. Despite this slight restoration of family fortunes, soon after Takenori's death the Kasuya line would end. Today, Takenori's extra-long yari is on display at the Nagahama City Museum, in Nagahama Castle. While greatly famous himself, Takenori had other famous relatives.

Company overview The company was founded in northern Georgia in 1957 by Irving Ostuw as Janyjo Inc. Its operations were originally limited to the manufacture and distribution of adult bedding, primarily tufted bedspreads, and the company added jacquard-woven bedspreads in 1967. The company went public in 1968 on the American Stock Exchange, under the symbol CRW. In 1984, Crown Crafts purchased Decorator Comforters Inc. for $4m, using cash from a loan. By 1988 the company had the largest integrated flocking facility in the US. In 1994 the company's shares were offered on the New York Stock Exchange, again under \\"CRW\\". In 1995, the company began to enter the market for infant and juvenile products through several acquisitions, including \\"Red Calliope\\" for $16m. and Pinky Baby in 1998. Following several years of unprofitability, the company in 2000 remade itself as primarily a marketer of infant and juvenile products. During this time, the company stopped manufacturing adult woven products and began sourcing its infant and juvenile products through foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration in China. The adult bedding division was bought out by a management team, on 23 July 2001. This included the Calvin Klein Home brand (Crown Crafts Designer Inc.) as well as Royal Sateen and Private Label. The new company was called Design Works Inc. The company relocated its headquarters from Atlanta, Georgia to Gonzales, Louisiana in 2002. It also operates a leased distribution center in Compton, California, a sales office in Bentonville, Arkansas, and a Foreign Representative Office in Shanghai, China. The company operates indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Hamco, Inc. and Crown Crafts Infant Products, Inc.

It may refer to measures taken to reduce the harmful effects of hazards that remain in potentia, or to manage harmful incidents that have already occurred. It is a stage or component of emergency management and of risk management. Disaster mitigation An all-hazards approach to disaster management considers all known hazards and their natural and anthropogenic potential risks and impacts, with the intention of ensuring that measures taken to mitigate against one type of risk do not increase vulnerability to other types of risks. Proactive disaster mitigation measures are generally more effective than reactive measures in eliminating or reducing the impacts, but not all disasters are reasonably foreseeable, and when an unforeseen disaster occurs, mitigation is necessarily after the fact. Proactive disaster mitigation measures may be structural or non-structural, and will generally be based on measurement and assessment of the risk and the cost of setting up the measures, and possibly the cost of maintenance. Mitigation planning identifies policies and actions that can be taken over the long term to reduce risk, and in the event of a disaster occurring, minimise loss. Such policies and actions are based on a risk assessment, using the identified hazards, vulnerabilities and probabilities of occurrence and estimates of impact to calculate risks, and are generally planned in cooperation with the stakeholder groups. The principles are applicable to mitigation of risk in general. Planning processes may include: *Stakeholder agreement on actions for risk reduction *Assessment of relative risk and vulnerability *Building partnerships among stakeholders *Increasing awareness of hazards, vulnerabilities and risk *Establishing priorities *Aligning risk reduction and mitigation strategies with other objectives Risk assessment and mitigation measures may include: *Hazard mapping *Flood plain mapping *Land use and zoning practices *Implementing and enforcing appropriate building codes **Reinforced tornado safe rooms **Burying of electrical cables to prevent ice build-up **Raising of buildings in flood- prone areas *Public awareness programs *Insurance programs Index to Wikipedia articles on mitigation Wikipedia has a range of articles on Mitigation in various contexts, including: CommerceEngineeringEnvironment * * in public administration; also, in particular: ** * in emergency management; also, in particular: ** ** ** * Information technology * Mitigation, a kind of defense against security issues in computing, as part of vulnerability management Law * Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, a U.S. federal legislation passed in 2000 that amended provisions of the United States Code related to disaster relief * Mitigation (law), the principle that a party who has suffered loss has to take reasonable action to minimize the amount of the loss suffered * Also in law, mitigating factors may cause a crime to be considered less serious, or provide a reason to make a punishment less severe.

More specifically, the \\"salutogenic model\\" is concerned with the relationship between health, stress, and coping. The term was coined by Aaron Antonovsky,Antonovsky, A. \\"Health, Stress and Coping\\" San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1979 a professor of medical sociology. Antonovsky's theories reject the \\"traditional medical-model dichotomy separating health and illness\\". He described the relationship as a continuous variable, what he called the \\"health-ease versus dis-ease continuum\\". Derivation The word \\"salutogenesis\\" comes from the Latin salus = health and the Greek genesis = origin. Antonovsky developed the term from his studies of \\"how people manage stress and stay well\\"Antonovsky, A. Unraveling The Mystery of Health - How People Manage Stress and Stay Well, San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1987 (unlike pathogenesis which studies the causes of diseases). He observed that stress is ubiquitous, but not all individuals have negative health outcomes in response to stress. Instead, some people achieve health despite their exposure to potentially disabling stress factors. In his 1979 book, Health, Stress and Coping, Antonovsky described a variety of influences that led him to the question of how people survive, adapt, and overcome in the face of even the most punishing life-stress experiences. In his 1987 book, Unraveling the Mysteries of Health, he focused more specifically on a study of women and aging; he found that 29% of women who had survived Nazi concentration camps had positive emotional health, compared to 51% of a control group. His insight was that 29% of the survivors were not emotionally impaired by the stress. Antonovsky wrote: \\"this for me was the dramatic experience that consciously set me on the road to formulating what I came to call the 'salutogenic model'.\\" In salutogenic theory, people continually battle with the effects of hardship. These ubiquitous forces are called generalized resource deficits (GRDs). On the other hand, there are generalized resistance resources (GRRs), which are all of the resources that help a person cope and are effective in avoiding or combating a range of psychosocial stressors. Examples are resources such as money, ego-strength, and social support. Generalized resource deficits will cause the coping mechanisms to fail whenever the sense of coherence is not robust to weather the current situation. This causes illness and possibly even death. However, if the sense of coherence is high, a stressor will not necessarily be harmful. But it is the balance between generalized resource deficits and resources that determines whether a factor will be pathogenic, neutral, or salutary. Antonovsky's formulation was that the generalized resistance resources enabled individuals to make sense of and manage events. He argued that over time, in response to positive experiences provided by successful use of different resources, an individual would develop an attitude that was \\"in itself the essential tool for coping\\".  Sense of coherence  The \\"sense of coherence\\" is a theoretical formulation that provides a central explanation for the role of stress in human functioning. \\"Beyond the specific stress factors that one might encounter in life, and beyond your perception and response to those events, what determines whether stress will cause you harm is whether or not the stress violates your sense of coherence.\\"At everydaypsychology.com: The Sense of Coherence Antonovsky defined Sense of Coherence as:Antonovsky, Aaron. Studying Health vs. Studying Disease, Lecture at the Congress for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Berlin, 19 February 1990. available online from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa : \\"a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one's internal and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable and explicable; (2) the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement.\\" In his formulation, the sense of coherence has three components: * Comprehensibility: a belief that things happen in an orderly and predictable fashion and a sense that you can understand events in your life and reasonably predict what will happen in the future. * Manageability: a belief that you have the skills or ability, the support, the help, or the resources necessary to take care of things, and that things are manageable and within your control. * Meaningfulness: a belief that things in life are interesting and a source of satisfaction, that things are really worthwhile and that there is good reason or purpose to care about what happens. According to Antonovsky, the third element is the most important. If a person believes there is no reason to persist and survive and confront challenges, if they have no sense of meaning, then they will have no motivation to comprehend and manage events. His essential argument is that \\"salutogenesis\\" depends on experiencing a strong \\"sense of coherence\\". His research demonstrated that the sense of coherence predicts positive health outcomes.  Fields of application = Health and medicine  Antonovsky viewed his work as primarily addressed to the fields of health psychology, behavioral medicine, and the sociology of health.

Workplace  The sense of coherence with its three components meaningfulness, manageability and understandability has also been applied to the workplace.Gregor J. Jenny, Georg F. Bauer, Hege Forbech Vinje, Katharina Vogt, Steffen Torp, The Application of Salutogenesis to Work. In: The Handbook of Salutogenesis, 3 September 2016, pp. 197-210. DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-04600-6_20. Meaningfulness is considered to be related to the feeling of participation and motivation and to a perceived meaning of the work. The meaningfulness component has also been linked with Job control and with task significance. Job control implies that employees have more authority to make decisions concerning their work and the working process. Task significance involves \\"the experience of congruence between personal values and work activities, which is accompanied by strong feelings of identification with the attitudes, values or goals of the working tasks and feelings of motivation and involvement\\". The manageability component is considered to be linked to job control as well as to access to resources. It has also been considered to be linked with social skills and trust. Social relations relate also to the meaningfulness component. The comprehensibility component may be influenced by consistent feedback at work, for example concerning the performance appraisal.

The former towns of Auz√©ville-en-Argonne, Jub√©court, and Parois were joined to Clermont-en-Argonne in 1973. Geography The town is located along the old road from Paris to Verdun (RN3), which at this point is closely tracked by the A4 autoroute, on the edge of the Forest of Argonne. It is approximately 15 km to the east of Sainte-Menehould. Clermont's population has declined slightly in the last decade to 1,642 (in 2004), which gives a population density of 24.7 inhabitants per km¬≤. The mechanisation of agriculture that took place during the 20th century left this region, which remains overwhelmingly rural, short of employment opportunities: Clermont's economy has tended to suffer from the drift of working age populations to the towns and cities. History During the Middle Ages, Clermont was the seat of the County of Clermont-en-Argonne in the Holy Roman Empire. It only became French permanently in 1641. The county was abolished in 1790. In 1819, Norwich Duff wrote 'Clermont en Argonne is a very small town situated on the side of a hill on top of which there is a telegraph, a small church, and very extensive and fine views'. The telegraph station was one in line of a semaphore line constructed in the Napoleonic period for the rapid transmission of messages between Paris and Landau; but by 1819 France's eastern frontiers had been much reduced, and the final point of this telegraph line was first Landau and after 1819 Strasbourg. The platform where the Clermont telegraph station stood still exists, as do fine views from it in the direction of Verdun to the east. (A line of trees blocks the former panoramic view to the west.) The telegraph line closed in 1852, the year when the rail road linking Paris to Strasbourg was opened. The Clermont telegraph station was destroyed in or before 1916, when the platform on which it had stood was used as the mounting position for a large gun. Back in 1819 Norwich Duff also recorded that the town 'is said to have manufacturies of paper and glass, but I did not see any of them. Clermont might easily be fortified'. At the foot of the hill, Clermont is still a small town, its centre not radically 'improved' during the 20th century. It boasts (at least) one excellent restaurant.

The game is a modern variation on lawn bowls, from which it is derived. Venues Short mat bowls is played indoors, so it is an all-year sport that is not affected by weather conditions. Because the equipment is transportable and easy to set up, it is particularly appropriate for locations that are also used for other purposes such as village halls, schools, and sports and social clubs; it is even played on North Sea oil rigs. Equipment The ESMBA specify a rink mat length of with a width of . The mat is foam or rubber-backed, and has the required lines permanently marked. A wooden fender is placed at both ends to simulate the 'ditch' and keep the bowls from rolling off the mat. A wooden block sits in the centre of the mat. players have to avoid their bowl contacting the block on their way down the mat. The fine shape of each bowl imposes a 'bias' which causes the bowl to follow a curved route. The 'jack' is the target that sits near the end of the mat. As opposed to its counterparts, short mat uses a super-heavyweight jack that weighs approximately , whereas, indoor bowls use , and long mat (Grass) between Length of play As with most variants of bowls a short mat can have a variable length of play. During club matches where time is at a premium, it is usual for a specific time of play to be selected so that change-overs are within a short period. In serious competition matches, such as organised in UK and Europe by SMPT (Short-mat Players Tour), a specific number of 'ends' are played. In traditional games such as crown green bowls and indoor bowls, winning lead players have the opportunity to place the jack on a central line to the length they wish to play to in the next end. In short mat bowls; the game has been simplified, to allowing the winning skip to simply place the jack on a line determining a preferred the length . How the game is played Short mat bowls is very similar to lawn bowls in that the object is for each player, or team, to take turns rolling bowls (woods) down a mat in an attempt to finally, getting as many of the woods as close as possible and closer to the target the 'jack' than their opponent. The main difference is in the size of the playing area and the presence of the block midway down the rink mat. The presence of the block is to reduce an attempt of players knocking their opponents' woods away from the existing position. Players are encouraged to use the natural bias of the bowls to manoeuvre around the block and any other bowls or indeed, promote an existing bowl. Any woods that touch the block, or land in the ditch area are dead and are removed before the next wood is sent. A bowl which has touched the jack en route to the ditch, remains 'alive' and will count in the scoring. The skill in playing short mat bowls comes from the bias of the wood and the skill of 'delivering a bowl to a position where it either counts in the score or is used as a defender, blocking a route to change positions. Both the performance of the rink mat and the floor surface can vary but preference is for a neutral mats from venue to venues. A general description of different bowls games, including short mat bowls, is maintained at bowls.org.uk. History The origin of the short mat bowls game is uncertain, but one story is that it was first played in Wales by two South Africans who came to work in the area. They had played bowls outdoors in South Africa and, perhaps due to the poor climate and the long close season in Wales, they began to play a simulation of the outdoor game on a strip of carpet in a church hall. Some time later, they moved to Northern Ireland and took the new game with them. Rules and conditions of play were drawn up and the game soon became well established in the Province. It was introduced into England by Irish expatriates, but development was slow until the 1980s when its potential as a low cost sport for people of all ages was realised. The English Short Mat Bowling Association (ESMBA) was formed in 1984, and is now the governing body of the sport in England. The sport is administered in England at two levels, the ESMBA oversee administration of the National Championships and Inter County Championships in addition to running the National Squad. At a more local level, 37 County Associations arrange a series of League, One Day and Knockout competitions within their own geographical area. In 2009, the ESMBA launched a new National Club Championship event, the event featuring teams competing in all-four disciplines (Singles, Pairs, Triples & Fours), with all members being from the same club team. The Final's Day was played at Rugby Thornfield with Kirby Bedon of Norfolk beating Warren Heath of Essex in the final. In 2010, Donnington of Cambridgeshire were the winners followed by Bob Carter of Norfolk in 2011. In 2012, the title was won by a side outside East Anglia for the first time when Cheshire's Morley Green lifted the title. The latest figures show 18,337 ESMBA registered members for the 2016/17 season. The ESMBA rules of the game are followed by the affiliated clubs and also by most others. Most clubs arrange competitions among their own members as well as allowing time for those not wishing to take part in competitions to enjoy informal bowling.

All finite groups are periodic. The concept of a periodic group should not be confused with that of a cyclic group. The exponent of a periodic group G is the least common multiple, if it exists, of the orders of the elements of G. Any finite group has an exponent: it is a divisor of G. Burnside's problem is a classical question, which deals with the relationship between periodic groups and finite groups, if we assume only that G is a finitely-generated group. The question is whether specifying an exponent forces finiteness (to which the answer is 'no', in general). Examples of infinite periodic groups include the additive group of the ring of polynomials over a finite field, and the quotient group of the rationals by the integers, as well as their direct summands, the Pr√ºfer groups. Another example is the direct sum of all dihedral groups. None of these examples has a finite generating set, and any periodic linear group with a finite generating set is finite. Explicit examples of finitely generated infinite periodic groups were constructed by Golod, based on joint work with Shafarevich, see Golod‚ÄìShafarevich theorem, and by Aleshin and Grigorchuk using automata. Mathematical logic One of the interesting properties of periodic groups is that the definition cannot be formalized in terms of first- order logic. This is because doing so would require an axiom of the form :\\\\forall x.\\\\, ((x=e) \\\\lor (x\\\\circ x=e) \\\\lor ((x\\\\circ x)\\\\circ x=e) \\\\lor \\\\cdots) which contains an infinite disjunction and is therefore inadmissible: First order logic permits quantifiers over one type and can't capture properties or subsets of that type. It is also not possible to get around this infinite disjunction by using an infinite set of axioms: the compactness theorem implies that no set of first-order formulae can characterize the periodic groups. Related notions The torsion subgroup of an abelian group A is the subgroup of A consisting of all elements that have finite order. A torsion abelian group is an abelian group in which every element has finite order. A torsion-free abelian group is an abelian group in which the identity element is the only element with finite order. See also *Torsion (algebra) *Jordan‚ÄìSchur theorem References * E. S.

Lesser vasa parrots inhabit the mangrove swamps and evergreen forests of Madagascar and the Seychelles Islands. They eat seeds, blossoms and fruit - especially berries and mangos.

Taxonomy  The lesser vasa parrot was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae; it was given the name of Psittacus niger, meaning \\"black parrot\\". It was later transferred to the new genus Coracopsis in 1826.

A 2011 genetic study found the Mascarene parrot from R√©union to be nested among the subspecies of the lesser vasa parrot from Madagascar and nearby islands, and therefore not related to the Psittacula parrots. It also found that the Mascarene parrot line diverged 4.6 to 9 million years ago, prior to the formation of R√©union, indicating this must have happened elsewhere. The cladogram accompanying the study is shown below: Another group of scientists later acknowledged the finding, but pointed out that the sample might have been damaged, and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the genus Coracopsis, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. Hume has expressed surprise by these findings, due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the islands that are believed to be psittaculines.

The complexity of a modern receiver and the possible range of circuitry and methods employed are more generally covered in electronics and communications engineering. The term radio receiver is understood in this article to mean any device which is intended to receive a radio signal in order to generate useful information from the signal, most notably a recreation of the so-called baseband signal (such as audio) which modulated the radio signal at the time of transmission in a communications or broadcast system. Fundamental considerations Design of a radio receiver must consider several fundamental criteria to produce a practical result. The main criteria are gain, selectivity, sensitivity, and stability. The receiver must contain a detector to recover the information initially impressed on the radio carrier signal, a process called modulation. Wes Hayward, Doug De Maw (ed),Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur, Chapter 5 \\"Receiver Design Basics\\", American Radio Relay League 1977, no ISBN Gain is required because the signal intercepted by an antenna will have a very low power level, on the order of picowatts or femtowatts. To produce an audible signal in a pair of headphones requires this signal to be amplified a trillion-fold or more. The magnitudes of the required gain are so great that the logarithmic unit decibel is preferred - a gain of 1 trillion times the power is 120 decibels, which is a value achieved by many common receivers. Gain is provided by one or more amplifier stages in a receiver design; some of the gain is applied at the radio-frequency part of the system, and the rest at the frequencies used by the recovered information (audio, video, or data signals). Selectivity is the ability to \\"tune in\\" to just one station of the many that may be transmitting at any given time. An adjustable bandpass filter is a typical stage of a receiver. A receiver may include several stages of bandpass filters to provide sufficient selectivity. Additionally, the receiver design must provide immunity from spurious signals that may be generated within the receiver that would interfere with the desired signal. Broadcasting transmitters in any given area are assigned frequencies so that receivers can properly select the desired transmission; this is a key factor limiting the number of transmitting stations that can operate in a given area. Sensitivity is the ability to recover the signal from the background noise. Noise is generated in the path between transmitter and receiver, but is also significantly generated in the receiver's own circuits. Inherently, any circuit above absolute zero generates some random noise that adds to the desired signals. In some cases, atmospheric noise is far greater than that produced in the receiver's own circuits, but in some designs, measures such as cryogenic cooling are applied to some stages of the receiver, to prevent signals from being obscured by thermal noise. A very good receiver design may have a noise figure of only a few times the theoretical minimum for the operating temperature and desired signal bandwidth. The objective is to produce a signal-to-noise ratio of the recovered signal sufficient for the intended purpose. This ratio is also often expressed in decibels. A signal-to- noise ratio of 10 dB (signal 10 times as powerful as noise) might be usable for voice communications by experienced operators, but a receiver intended for high-fidelity music reproduction might require 50 dB or higher signal-to-noise ratio. Stability is required in at least two senses. Frequency stability; the receiver must stay \\"tuned\\" to the incoming radio signal and must not \\"drift\\" with time or temperature. Additionally, the great magnitude of gain generated must be carefully controlled so that spurious emissions are not produced within the receiver. These would lead to distortion of the recovered information, or, at worst, may radiate signals that interfere with other receivers. The detector stage recovers the information from the radio- frequency signal, and produces the sound, video, or data that was impressed on the carrier wave initially. Detectors may be as simple as an \\"envelope\\" detector for amplitude modulation, or may be more complex circuits for more recently developed techniques such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum. While not fundamental to a receiver, automatic gain control is a great convenience to the user, since it automatically compensates for changing received signal levels or different levels produced by different transmitters. Many different approaches and fundamental receiver \\"block diagrams\\" have developed to address these several, sometimes contradictory, factors. Once these technical objectives have been achieved, the remaining design process is still complicated by considerations of economics, patent rights, and even fashion. Crystal radio A crystal radio uses no active parts: it is powered only by the radio signal itself, whose detected power feeds headphones in order to be audible at all. In order to achieve even a minimal sensitivity, a crystal radio is limited to low frequencies using a large antenna (usually a long wire). It relies on detection using some sort of semiconductor diode such as the original cat's-whisker diode discovered long before the development of modern semiconductors. A crystal set receiver consisting of an antenna, a variable inductor, a cat's whisker, and a filter capacitor. A crystal receiver is very simple and can be easy to make or even improvise, for example, the foxhole radio. However, the crystal radio needs a strong RF signal and a long antenna to operate. It displays poor selectivity since it only has one tuned circuit. Tuned radio frequency The tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) consists of a radio frequency amplifier having one or more stages all tuned to the desired reception frequency. This is followed by a detector, typically an envelope detector using a diode, followed by audio amplification. This was developed after the invention of the triode vacuum tube, greatly improving the reception of radio signals using electronic amplification which had not previously been available. The greatly improved selectivity of the superheterodyne receiver overtook the TRF design in almost all applications, however the TRF design was still used as late as the 1960s among the cheaper \\"transistor radios\\" of that era. Reflex The reflex receiver was a design from the early 20th century which consists of a single-stage TRF receiver but which used the same amplifying tube to also amplify the audio signal after it had been detected. This was in an era where each tube was a major cost (and consumer of electrical power) so that a substantial increase in the number of passive elements would be seen as preferable to including an additional tube. The design tends to be rather unstable, and is obsolete. Regenerative Classical regenerative receiver using a single triode vacuum tube. The orientation of the \\"tickler\\" coil was carefully adjusted by the operator in order to vary the amount of positive feedback. The regenerative receiver also had its heyday at the time where adding an active element (vacuum tube) was considered costly. In order to increase the gain of the receiver, positive feedback was used in its single RF amplifier stage; this also increased the selectivity of the receiver well beyond what would be expected from a single tuned circuit. The amount of feedback was quite critical in determining the resulting gain and had to be carefully adjusted by the radio operator. Increasing the feedback beyond a point caused the stage to oscillate at the frequency it was tuned to. Self-oscillation reduced the quality of its reception of an AM (voice) radio signal but made it useful as a CW (Morse code) receiver. The beat signal between the oscillation and the radio signal would produce an audio \\"beeping\\" sound. The oscillation of the regenerative receiver could also be a source of local interference. An improved design known as the super-regenerative receiver improved the performance by allowing an oscillation to build up which was then \\"quenched\\", with that cycle repeating at a rapid (ultrasonic) rate. From the accompanying schematic for a practical regenerative receiver, one can appreciate its simplicity in relation to a multi-stage TRF receiver, while able to achieve the same level of amplification through the use of positive feedback. Direct conversion In the Direct conversion receiver, the signals from the antenna are only tuned by a single tuned circuit before entering a mixer where they are mixed with a signal from a local oscillator which is tuned to the carrier wave frequency of the transmitted signal. This is unlike the superheterodyne design, where the local oscillator is at an offset frequency. The output of this mixer is thus audio frequency, which is passed through a low pass filter into an audio amplifier which may drive a speaker. For receiving CW (morse code) the local oscillator is tuned to a frequency slightly different from that of the transmitter in order to turn the received signal into an audible \\"beep.\\" *Advantages **Simpler than a superheterodyne receiver *Disadvantages **Poor rejection of strong signals at adjacent frequencies compared to a superheterodyne receiver. **Increased noise or interference when receiving a SSB signal since there is no selectivity against the undesired sideband. Superheterodyne Practically all modern receivers are of the superheterodyne design. The RF signal from the antenna may have one stage of amplification to improve the receiver's noise figure, although at lower frequencies this is typically omitted. The RF signal enters a mixer, along with the output of the local oscillator, in order to produce a so-called intermediate frequency (IF) signal. An early optimization of the superheterodyne was to combine the local oscillator and mixer into a single stage called \\"converter\\". The local oscillator is tuned to a frequency somewhat higher (or lower) than the intended reception frequency so that the IF signal will be at a particular frequency where it is further amplified in a narrow-band multistage amplifier. Tuning the receiver involves changing the frequency of the local oscillator, with further processing of the signal (especially in relation to increasing the receiver) conveniently done at a single frequency (the IF frequency) thus requiring no further tuning for different stations. A schematic of a superhet AM receiver. Note that the radio includes an AGC loop in order to maintain the RF and IF stages in their linear region, and to produce an audio output not dependent on the signal power received. Here we show block diagrams for typical superheterodyne receivers for AM and FM broadcast respectively. This particular FM design uses a modern phase locked loop detector, unlike the frequency discriminator or ratio detector used in earlier FM receivers. A schematic of a simple superhet broadcast FM receiver. Note that there is no AGC loop, but simply uses a high- gain IF amplifier which is intentionally driven into saturation (or limiting). For single conversion superheterodyne AM receivers designed for medium wave (AM broadcast) the IF is commonly 455 kHz. Most superheterodyne receivers designed for broadcast FM (88 - 108 MHz) use an IF of 10.7 MHz. TV receivers often use intermediate frequencies of about 40 MHz. Some modern multiband receivers actually convert lower frequency bands first to a much higher frequency (VHF) after which a second mixer with a tunable local oscillator and a second IF stage process the signal as above. Software-defined radio SoftRock RXTX Ensemble SDR Transceiver is a software-defined radio frontend that need a PC with software to demodulate and modulate the I-Q signals. Software-defined radio (SDR) is a radio communication system where components, that have been traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.Software Defined Radio: Architectures, Systems and Functions (Markus Dillinger, Kambiz Madani, Nancy Alonistioti) Page xxxiii (Wiley & Sons, 2003, ) While the concept of SDR is not new, the rapidly evolving capabilities of digital electronics render practical many processes which used to be only theoretically possible.

It is among the best cinemas in Copenhagen and is usually the go-to place for cinephiles in the Danish capital. Imperial is owned by Nordisk Film and is located near Vesterport Station. It has undergone several renewals, the latest of which were completed in September 2013 when Dolby Atmos was installed. It is one of the only big cinemas in Copenhagen which can still project 70 mm film, as well as the only one which can project 4K in 3D.  Renewals  The cinema has undergone several renewals over the years. Among the biggest can be mentioned the change from 1521 to 1179 seats in 1988, with the number of seats being further reduced in 1998 in order to pass the THX-certification. The current projector is Barco's premium model, the DP4K-32B, which was installed in February. This allowed Imperial to project 4K imagery in 3D as the first cinema in Denmark. The latest renewal took place in September 2013 when a new borderless, 40% bigger screen was installed, along with Dolby Atmos and new seats. The number of rows was also reduced from 24 to 21, and the total number of seats went down to 1002.  Technical details = Picture  The main workhorse is the Barco DP4K-32B which was installed in 2012. In order to continue to support the projection of legacy films, as well as newer movies which are not distributed digitally, Imperial still has one of the two Philips EL4001 DP70's, which were first installed back when it first opened in 1957. The screen itself is 18,4 x 7,7 m, in the Todd-AO format. It is slightly curved and among the absolutely biggest screens in Denmark.  Sound  Imperial was THX-certified in 1998. The quality of the sound is reaffirmed twice every year by THX-technicians. Due to the hall's special fan-like shape, Imperial has had many problems with the surround sound system.

Early life Gage was born at Haling, in Surrey, the son of John Gage and Margaret Copley. The family were Catholic and long intermarried with other prominent Catholic families, including that of Sir Thomas More, the former Lord Chancellor. At the age of twelve Henry was sent abroad for a Catholic education at the English Jesuit College in St Omer, where he was a student from 1609 to 1614.Geoffrey Holt, St Omers and Bruges Colleges, 1593-1773: A Biographical Dictionary (Catholic Record Society Publications 69, 1979), p. 109. After spending three years at the English College, Rome, from 1615 to 1618, Gage decided the priesthood was not for him. At the age of 22 he became a professional soldier in the Army of Flanders. Eighty Years War In 1619 Gage enlisted as a gentleman pikeman in the Army of Flanders and initially served in the garrison of Antwerp. In 1622 he obtained a commission as captain of a company in the regiment of the Earl of Argyll. He distinguished himself during the Siege of Bergen-op-Zoom (1622) and the Siege of Breda (1624). In 1625 he was serving as captain in Sir Edward Parham's regiment,A. J. Loomie, \\"Gondomar's Selection of English Officers in 1622\\", English Historical Review 88 (1973), pp. 574-581. but during the Anglo- Spanish War (1625‚Äì1630) he returned to England rather than serve against his native country. During these years his translation of Herman Hugo's Obsidio Bredana, a Latin account of the Siege of Breda, was published in Ghent by Judocus Dooms under the title The Siege of Breda. After 1630 he raised 900 men and returned to Flanders as colonel of his own regiment. He played an important role in breaking the French Siege of Saint-Omer (1638).DNB. He was known for his ability and was described by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, as \\"a man of great wisdom and temper, and one among the very few soldiers who made himself universally loved and esteemed\\".Quoted in George Steinman Steinman, Some Account of the Manor of Haling, in the Parish of Croydon, Surrey (1835), pp. 42-43. He was also noted for his piety (he attended Mass daily) and in the later years in the Low Countries and in England had as his chaplain the Jesuit Peter Wright, later to be sentenced to death on the evidence of Henry's own brother Thomas Gage, an ex-Catholic renegade. In 1630 Gage was given the rank of Captain-commandant of the English regiment in the service of Spain. English Civil War The Siege of Basing House Responding to the King's summons in the English Civil War, Gage organized weapons and munitions from the Spanish king and returned to England, going to the Royalist headquarters at Oxford. On 11 June he took and garrisoned Boarstall House. Basing House In September 1644 an appeal for military assistance came from the garrison of the besieged Basing House. This was the seat of the Catholic John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester, the largest private residence in England, located at Old Basing, by the River Loddon (a tributary of the River Thames), forty miles away from Oxford and south of Reading, Berkshire. The site covered within a mile and half of enclosing walls and earthworks. The 'Old House' was a medieval fortress on a defensive mound and next to it stood the palatial 'New House', five storeys high and with 380 rooms. In November 1643 it had been placed under siege by Sir William Waller's Parliamentary troops. Though this first siege lasted only nine days, in June 1644, the house was besieged again, this time by Colonel Richard Norton, whose use of heavy mortar bombardment led in September to the Marquis's garrison asking Royalist forces at Oxford, forty miles away, for help. There the commander Colonel Henry Gage assembled a relief force consisting of Colonel Hawkins's regiment, a hundred volunteers and various servants. Disguised on the road as Parliamentarians, they managed to break through to Basing House, replenishing the garrison's ammunition and food on 11 September and then escaped by night back to Oxford, swimming their horses across the Kennet and the Thames. For this Colonel Gage received a knighthood. Less than a fortnight after Colonel Gage's relief, Colonel Norton resumed the siege, which seven weeks later, on 19 November, Colonel Gage again relieved. The house was eventually to be heavily bombarded, looted to the tune of some ¬£200,000 and then systematically demolished by Oliver Cromwell in 1645. In the meantime, Gage had also (on 25 October) helped raise the siege of Banbury Castle. Governor of Oxford On Christmas Day 1644 the King made Gage Governor of Oxford, in place of the Catholic Sir Arthur Aston (1590‚Äì1649), thus earning in Aston a bitter enemy who made every effort to discredit him and undermine his authority. The time for this mischief was short, however. The following month Gage was mortally wounded in a skirmish at Culham Bridge near Abingdon on 11 January 1645. Two days later he was given an impressive military funeral at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, where he is buried. His memorial is in the Lucy Chapel, off the South Transept. The Latin inscription reads: A short biography by Edward Walsingham was published as a pamphlet under the title Alter Britanni√¶ Heros: Or, The Life of the Most Honourable Knight, Sir Henry Gage, Late Governour of Oxford, Epitomiz'd (Oxford: Leonard Lichfield, 1645). Family Henry married Mary Daniel, who bore him six children, two sons and four daughters.DNB.

Prior to 1966 Van Moer played with Beveren. He went back to his first club after a spell at Beringen in the early 1980s. He played 57 times and scored 9 goals for the national team between 1966 and 1982, starting in a 1-0 friendly win against Switzerland on 22 October 1966. Van Moer was in the team for the 1970 and 1982 World Cups and for the Euro 1980 in which Belgium finished second. Club career Van Moer began with home town club (Beveren-Waas), then in the third tier of the Belgian League. A move to Royal Antwerp in 1965 was influenced not only by a chance to play in the 1st Division, but by the fact he was already working in that city as an electrician. He made his debut for the club in August 1965 against Union Saint-Gilloise.Profile - FC Antwerp At the end of '66 he won his first Golden Shoe Award, having won his first international cap earlier that year. It was during his 3 years at Antwerp under the guidance of coach Harry Game, that Van Moer, against his wishes, was moved from a wide right role to central midfield, preparing him to eventually succeed to another of Belgium's most celebrated players Jef Jurion, in the national team. Following relegation for Antwerp in 1968, a protracted move to Standard Li√®ge ensued, Van Moer resisting the interest of 1. FC K√∂ln to remain in Belgium, and also Club Brugge KV, with whom he had made a personal agreement. The 150,000 Euros fee for the now established international was at the time a Belgian record. Wonderful domestic success followed at Standard, winning the championship in '69, '70 and '71 and making it a hat-trick of Golden Shoes by winning the award in both '69 and '70. As for his club career, he had left Standard in 1976 and played for the Limburg first division team FC Beringen for a few seasons (he owned a caf√© in the Limburg capital Hasselt). In 1980, after his career had been rekindled, he made a transfer to his original team SK Beveren (which had become Belgian champion in 1979). He stayed there for 2 more seasons and concluded his career in Limburg again at Sint-Truiden, where he became trainer-player. International career Internationally he was a regular too, appearing in the 1970 World Cup Finals and scoring twice in the only game his country won in Mexico, 3-0 vs. El Salvador. Van Moer also played a key role in helping his country qualify for the semi-finals of the European Championship two years later. After Belgium had defended stubbornly in a goalless quarter final, 1st leg in Italy, he scored the opening goal midway through the first half in the return at Anderlecht's Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. But then something was to happen, putting the Belgian's career on hold. On the stroke of half-time, Bertini's lunge resulted in a broken leg for Van Moer, a bitter-sweet day for the home nation who ultimately celebrated a 2‚Äì1 victory. Although he recovered, the leg-break and other injuries restricted his international appearances over the next 3 seasons. By October 1979, aged 34, without an appearance for The Red Devils for four and a half years, international football couldn't have been further from his thoughts. But wily Belgian coach Guy Thys had other ideas. Van Moer was an inspired choice for a Belgian side who had forgotten how to win, as they prepared to take on Portugal in a 'do or die' EC qualifier. Van Moer again came up trumps with the first goal in a 2‚Äì0 win. Van Moer also performed key roles in home and away victories over Scotland, which propelled Belgium to qualification for the Finals tournament in Italy. Striker Horst Hrubesch may have scored two goals to secure final victory for West Germany, but for many the outstanding player of the tournament was the Belgian central midfielder with the seemingly boundless energy. He ran the show in most every game he played, scheming, prompting and holding the ball, never wasteful his performances were as dynamic as they were inspirational as Belgium went all the way to their only major Final. Van Moer was arguably the most influential player in the tournament and indeed at 35, his performances earned him 4th place (equalling the best ever showing by a Belgian) in the Ballon d'Or poll. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Bernd Schuster and Michel Platini finished ahead of him. Van Moer's international career went on for another 2 two years, long enough to appear in another World Cup Finals series. Named captain in the absence of Eric Gerets, for the 2nd Phase game against Poland his international career ended when replaced by Fran√ßois Van der Elst at half- time. Belgium trailed by two at the interval and went on to lose 0‚Äì3, Poland's inspiration coming from Boniek who was the only player to score. Managerial career After he stopped playing football, he became coach with Sint-Truiden, SK Beveren, Assent and FC Diest, before calling it a day, somewhat disappointed by the general professional level of the Belgian football players. He was called by the Belgian Football Union to do some prospective work and became assistant coach to national coach Paul Van Himst in 1995 after a few heavy defeats of the Red Devils. He succeeded Van Himst as a head coach in 1996 for 5 games. However, people in the Football Union and the press were not very delighted by his lack of communicative skills and at the beginning of 1997, he was, in his turn, replaced by Georges Leekens. He has not taken up any managerial tasks since.

Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team (IRT), an incident management team (IMT), or Incident Command System (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.  Description  An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions.Glossary of Terms, The Business Continuity Institute Good Practice Guidelines 2010 Global Edition . thebci.org Retrieved on 2015-09-03. Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. If not managed, an incident can escalate into an emergency, crisis or a disaster. Incident management is therefore the process of limiting the potential disruption caused by such an event, followed by a return to business as usual. Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.  Physical incident management  Incident management is considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards an organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring, and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident. An important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that Incident management is a real time physical activity. The planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident‚Äîbe that a disaster, emergency, crisis or accident‚Äîhas been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization. Efficient physical management of the incident‚Äîmaking best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison‚Äîensure the plan is implemented. National Fire Protection Association states that incident management can be described as, '[a]n IMS [incident management system] is \\"the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents\\". The physical incident management is the real time response that may last for hours, days, or longer. The United Kingdom Cabinet Office have produced the National Recovery Guidance (NRG), which is aimed at local responders as part of the implementation of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (CCA). It describes the response as the following: \\"Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios, it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days ‚Äì rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co- ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (eg fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (eg disruption, media interest)\\". International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is the world's largest developer of international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management, principles and guidelines document ISO 31000:2009 that, \\"Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment\\". This again shows the importance of not just good planning but effective allocation of resources to treat the risk.  Computer security incident management  Today, an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), due to the rise of internet crime, and is a common example of incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world. For example, if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system, the CSIRT would analyze the situation, determine the breadth of the compromise, and take corrective action. Computer forensics is one task included in this process. Currently, over half of the world's hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations (TNCs) take place in North America (57%). 23% of attempts take place in Europe.Hacking Incidents 2009 ‚Äì Interesting Data ‚Äì Roger's Security Blog ‚Äì Site Home ‚Äì TechNet Blogs.

Having a well-rounded Computer Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization, and is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams.  Roles  Incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team (IRT), or an incident management team (IMT). These are often designated beforehand or during the event, and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with, to restore normal functions. The Incident Command System (ICS) is designed to deal with a larger incident involving a respond from multiple agencies. Popular with public safety agencies and jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and other countries, it is growing in practice in the private sector as organizations begin to manage without or co-manage emergencies with public safety agencies. ICS is a command and control mechanism that provides an expandable structure to manage emergency agencies. Although some of the details vary by jurisdiction, ICS normally consists of five primary elements: command, operations, planning, logistics and finance/administration. Several special staff positions, including public affairs, safety, and liaison, report directly to the incident commander (IC) when the emergency warrants establishment of those positions. Another response system is the Gold‚Äìsilver‚Äìbronze command structure, which is used by emergency services in the United Kingdom and other countries. The system has three levels of command: a gold commander sets the overall strategy, a silver commander is in direct charge of those at the scene and bronze commanders direct responders on the ground. An individual agency may use the system, or multiple agencies may use the system as they liaise. A common feature of the ICS and Gold-Silver-Bronze systems is that they create a separate command system to the agencies' usual hierarchy. Usually as part of the wider management process in private organizations, incident management is followed by post-incident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls. This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization, with the view of preventing repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy. This information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy and/or its practical implementation. In the United States, the National Incident Management System, developed by the Department of Homeland Security, integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework. This often results in a higher level of contingency planning, exercise and training, as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident.About the Contingency Planning and Incident Management Division  Homeland Security .

Incident management software systems  Incident management software systems are designed for collecting consistent, time sensitive, documented incident report data. Many of these products include features to automate the approval process of an incident report or case investigation. These products may also have the ability to collect real time incident information such as time and date data. Additionally incident report systems will automatically send notifications, assign tasks and escalations to appropriate individuals depending on the incident type, priority, time, status and custom criteria. Modern products provide the ability for administrators to configure the Incident report forms as needed, create analysis reports and set access controls on the data. These incident reports may have the ability for customization that may best suit the organizations using the systems. Some of these products have the ability to collect images, video, audio and other data. Incident management software systems exist that relate directly to specific industries.  Root cause analysis = Human factors  During the root cause analysis, human factors should be assessed. James Reason conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects of human factors. The study found that major incident investigations, such as Piper Alpha and Kings Cross Underground Fire, made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization. There are two types of events: active failure‚Äîan action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident‚Äîand latent or delayed action‚Äîevents can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering events that then cause the accident. Active failures are unsafe acts (errors and violations) committed by, for instance, the operators of machinery and supervisors of tasks. It is the people at the human-system interface whose actions can have immediate adverse consequences. Latent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation. Their damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors (e.g., the spring tide, the loading difficulties at Zeebrugge harbour, etc.) to breach the system's defences. Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely, the planning, scheduling, forecasting, designing, policy making, etc., can have a slow burning effect. The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed, showing the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening. Better improvement action can be applied, and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again.O‚ÄôCallaghan, Katherine Mary, Incident Management: Human Factors and Minimising Mean Time to Restore , Ph.D. Thesis, Australian Catholic University, 2010.

Its ecclesiastical jurisdiction includes the northern and central parts of the state of Mississippi, an area of . It is the largest diocese, by area, in the United States east of the Mississippi River. It was formerly known as the Diocese of Natchez (1837‚Äì1956) and the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson (1956‚Äì77). Jackson, Mississippi is the episcopal see. History The region which is now the Diocese of Jackson made its first contacts with the Catholic Church through French Jesuit and Capuchin missionaries during the expeditions of La Salle, Marquette, and d'Iberville in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1787, three Spanish priests, Fathers McKenna, White, and Savage, arrived at Natchez from Salamanca and erected three missions in the vicinity. These missions, however, virtually disappeared after the Spanish turned over the area to the United States. Much valuable property was lost to the Church, and the efforts made to recover it were in vain.Charles, Brother. \\"Natchez.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 26 February 2020 The diocese was originally erected as the Vicariate Apostolic of Mississippi, an administrative region of the church separate from the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas (Saint Louis of New Orleans) to which it had previously belonged, and which itself would later become the Diocese of New Orleans on 18 July 1826. At the head of the Vicariate was Louis-Guillaume- Valentin Dubourg, P.S.S., who served less than a year before being appointed bishop of Montauban, France (he would eventually become the archbishop of Besan√ßon). The Vicariate was elevated to the Diocese of Natchez on 28 July 1837. Although the Diocese of Natchez encompassed the entire state of Mississippi, nearly three years passed before John Mary Joseph Chanche, S.S. (1795‚Äì1852), president of St. Mary's College in Baltimore, was appointed as its first bishop on 15 December 1840. Bishop Chanche, like his predecessor, was of French lineage, having been born to parents who had fled to Baltimore from the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), presumably during the Haitian revolution. At his arrival in Mississippi, he found one priest in the diocese, a Father Brogard, who was there only temporarily. Chanche set to work building a diocesan infrastructure. In 1842 Bishop Chanche laid the cornerstone of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows, designed by Robert Cary Long Jr. After the diocesan see was translated to Jackson, this became St. Mary's Basilica. In 1847 the Sisters of Charity of Emmitsburg came to Natchez and established Saint Mary's Orphanage.Namorato, Michael V., The Catholic Church in Mississippi, 1911-1984: A History, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p. 7 Chanche attended the First Plenary Council of 1852, held in Baltimore, Maryland. While returning to Natchez, he died at Frederick, Maryland, presumably of cholera. He had built 11 churches, with a team of 11 priests and 13 attendant missions. A curious series of events regarding the separation of church and state involved the Diocese of Natchez in 1864, during the American Civil War. That year, Bishop William Henry Elder refused to bend to orders from the Federal troops administering Natchez to compel his parishioners to pray for the President of the United States. For this act, Elder was tried, convicted, and then jailed briefly in Vidalia, Louisiana, just across the Mississippi River from Natchez. Elder wrote to President Lincoln explaining that his refusal was not political, but based on the authority of the church to regulate church services. After officials in Washington intervened, Elder was ordered released on 12 August 1864.Character Glimpses of Most Reverend William Henry Elder, D.D., published by Frederick Pustet & Company, New York and Cincinnati, 1911 As of 2006, Elder remains the second-longest-serving bishop in the diocese's history. By the mid-20th century, the capitol of the state of Mississippi, Jackson, had grown to perhaps be a more appropriate center for the administration of the diocese. To reflect this fact, on 18 December 1956 the name was changed to Diocese of Natchez-Jackson. Finally, on 1 March 1977, the diocese was divided, with the southern counties of Mississippi being reorganized as the Diocese of Biloxi. Concurrently, the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson became simply the Diocese of Jackson. Since the relocation of the diocese to Jackson, the Diocese of Natchez has been maintained as a titular see. Sex Abuse In 2006, the Diocese of Jackson, Mississippi, settled a handful of lawsuits with 19 victims with a $5 million settlement which included an average payout of more than $250,000 for each survivor. In August 2019, it was revealed that a 35-year-old man named La Jarvis D. Love was sexually abused at a Franciscan Friar grade school in Greenwood, Mississippi, when he was a boy and that Order attempted to keep him silent in later years by offering him $15,000. Love and Wisconsin- based Franciscan Friar leader James Gannon secretly signed a non-disclosure agreement in January 2019 which insured that the order would give Love a financial settlement. This came in spite of the fact that the Catholic Church agreed to ban non-disclosure agreements. By August 30, 2019 the accused friar's name was revealed to be Paul West and Love's three cousins Joshua Love, La Jarvis Love and Raphael Love also accused him of sexually abusing them in the mid 1990s. On September 3, 2020, it was revealed that West was extradited from Wisconsin to Mississippi earlier in the week and was being held at Leflore County Jail in Greenwood, Mississippi on sex abuse charges. Demographics The first seat of the diocese was Saint Mary Basilica (then Cathedral) in Natchez, whose cornerstone was laid by Bishop Chanche in 1842. The current seat is the Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle in Jackson. Since 1998, however, the church has maintained a minor basilica at the former cathedral in Natchez; it is now formally known as St. Mary Basilica. The Diocese of Jackson encompasses an area of the United States that has historically been (and still is) overwhelmingly Protestant. Only about 2.6% of the residents in the diocese are considered Catholic (about 52,000 Catholics out of a total population of nearly 2 million). The diocese contains 74 parishes and has 79 priests.

Charleston Chew is a candy bar consisting of flavored nougat covered in chocolate flavor coating. It was created in 1925 by the Fox-Cross Candy Company, founded by stage actor Donley Cross and his friend Charlie Fox. The candy was named after the Charleston, a popular dance at that time.The back of the box of Mini Charleston Chews. History The company was purchased in 1957 by Nathan Sloane and later sold to Nabisco in 1980. Although Sloane did not invent the Charleston Chew, he did change the candy's original form, chocolate-covered vanilla nougat. In the 1970s, he introduced such new flavors as chocolate and strawberry. Warner-Lambert purchased Charleston Chew from RJR Nabisco in 1988, then Tootsie Roll Industries purchased the brand from Warner- Lambert in 1993. Flavors and varieties The candy is available in vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry flavors. At one time, there were three additional flavours; banana, grape, and cherry. \\"Mini Charleston Chews\\" are a bite-sized, similarly-shaped version of the candy bar, introduced in 1998. The original packaging for Charleston Chews was a grey box that had the brand name in small red font at the bottom of the box. In science and technology demonstrations Charleston Chew candy bars have been used to demonstrate rheology to students in university geology labs. In popular culture *In the animated sci-fi TV series Futurama, Charleston Chew is frequently mentioned by the head of Richard Nixon, who is the President of Earth. *In the podcast Dungeons & Daddies, Charleston Chew is the favorite candy of the character Darryl Wilson (played by Matt Arnold). They provide emotional support for Darryl in times of stress. *In Season 2 of The Boys (2019 TV series), Annie/Starlight mentions Charleston Chews as one of her ‚Äútop 3 favorite‚Äù sweets *In the 2020 movie The Devil All the Time, after violently assaulting two men who made comments about sexually assaulting his wife, Willard Russell asks his son what kind of candy bar he's going to get at the store.

Description The Seychelles black parrot is entirely dark grey-brown except for greyish undertail-coverts; the dark bill becomes paler during the breeding season.Skerrett, A and Disley, T. 2011 Birds of Seychelles. Christopher Helm It is about 30 cm in length, smaller and paler than the 35 cm lesser vasa parrot. Distribution and habitat Vall√©e De Mai (Praslin, March 2016) The parrot is found only on the island of Praslin, where its main breeding area is limited by the availability of mature palm forest to the Vall√©e de Mai Nature Reserve and the lower part of Fond Peper in Praslin National Park. It has also been recorded (since 1988) on neighbouring Curieuse where it has been seen feeding though there is no evidence of breeding. It inhabits woodland, scrubland and gardens.Catalogue of threatened and extinct bird species in the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam Behaviour=Feeding The parrots‚Äô diet is principally fruit, both wild and cultivated, as well as flowers and buds. Wild foods include the fruits of the endemic palm Vershaffeltia splendida, growing along the river valleys, as well as the flowers of the coco de mer.African Bird Club: The Seychelles Cultivated fruits utilised by the parrots include guava, papaya, mango and bilimbi. Breeding The birds breed in deep cavities of old tree trunks with good cover, where they lay 1-3 eggs.

Ground surveys were undertaken by Trent & Peak Archaeological Trust between 1988 and 1997, leading to small-scale excavations in 2000 with the purpose of determining whether modern-day disturbance causes loss of archaeological deposits. Quarry protest The site has been the focus of a long-running environmental protest. In 1999 Stancliffe Stone Ltd submitted a planning application to re-open two dormant quarries (Endcliffe and Lees Cross) on the wooded hillside beside Stanton Moor. The proposed quarry was only from Nine Ladies, on land owned by Haddon Hall estate and leased to Stancliffe Stone. Aerial view of Stanton Moor A local protest group SLAG (Stanton Lees Action Group) was set up to oppose the quarry. The group was joined by environmental protesters who set up a long-running and controversial protest camp. They built many tree houses, from which the inhabitants were hard to evict. The protesters defied a court eviction order in February 2004, and continued to occupy the site until the winter of 2008‚Äì09. In 2004 the High Court classified the two quarries as dormant. There was an appeal against the decision, but the classification was upheld in June 2005.Earth First!

It had a keynote industry in shoemaking before the late 1940s, followed by a chemical factory and dairy, giving way to its weekly market, tourism, local commuting to elsewhere such as Valenciennes and local shops. Le Quesnoy's inhabitants are known as Quercitains.  Economy  Orchard of Avesnois The town of Le Quesnoy has somehow missed much of the Industrial Revolution. Unlike the neighboring towns of Valenciennes or Maubeuge, iron/steel works did not take hold. The lack of wealth underground and of a major transportation route partly explains this. The authorities, however, took note of this weakness and proposed the Ecaillon canal from Sambre to Scheldt; considered but abandoned because of low water yield in the forest of Mormal. Shoemaking was a major local industry until at least 1945, when a hundred shoemakers were still identifiable. Shoemakers worked at home for a local company (now D√©sir√© Tanis) in rue du Petit Valenciennes in a kind of cottage industry. A glassmaking factory installed near the railway track on the site of the former Intermarch√© collapsed after World War I. In the Bellevue district, the remains of a factory attest to the presence of a former pottery factory. The post-war boom or 'trentes glorieuses' saw industrial development on the outskirts of the town, including the chemical company (Cofradec) and food (Laiterie des 4 Cantons) inaugurated by Charles de Gaulle in 1959. Today, economic activity is mainly based on tourism and local shops. The town with its ramparts, castle ponds and history (including the Revolutionary Armed bivouac and the New Zealanders Monument on the border of Valenciennes) are major attractions. Le Quesnoy is home to many small traders and has a trading area of more than respectable size for a town of less than people. The closure of industrial enterprises (Cofradec, Duarte, dairy products) and services (transport) remains problematic, although there have been some new sources of work such as with the Emig company. The town holds a weekly market on Friday mornings.  Toponymy  Le Quesnoy is first attested in forms accompanied by the Latinized name of its alleged founder, called Haymon or Aymond: Haymon Quercitum (from the Latin quercus, \\"oak\\", a Latin term never imposed in GaulWalther von Wartburg and Oscar Bloch,etymological dictionary of the French language, PUF 1960). It appeared as Caisnetum in romanized charters to try to match the Picard language of the 11th to 14th century and as Haismont-Caisnoit, Le Kaisnoit, Le Caisnoy, Caisnoit and Quesnoyt in property titles of the same period (surveys of Hainaut of Cambrai, and Cond√©). Quenoy is the Picard equivalent of existing alternate French ch√™naie. Picard, as north of the northern Joret line, the group / ca-/ Latin has not evolved as in French quena, formerly Caisne, then Duquesne, \\"oak\\", came from the Latin cassinus and may be linked to Fraxinus (\\"ash\\") of Gallic origin*Cassano.Pierre-Yves Lambert, The Gallic language, 1994 The suffix -oy is the form taken by the Latin suffix -etu(m) in Picard dialect which covers some of northern France and Belgium a few instances elsewhere in the Langue d'o√Øl etu-(m). This suffix is used to denote a set of trees belonging to the same species.  History = Le Quesnoy in the Medieval Period  The origin of the town walls = While not yet a town at the time of Julius Caesar, the region was occupied by the Nerviens. Near the Fauroeulx gate of the town in 1933, Roman pottery was discovered. Under the Merovingian and Carolingian, we find no evidence of a major population centre in the vicinity. However, the historian Jacques de Guise, claims that at that time the town was founded by a brave knight named Aymond, who lived around the year 800: \\"This Aymond was Count of Faumars (Famars) and Ardennes, also by his loyalty to the king, he and all four sons tended the deep wood, where they made a fortress and a place called Carcetus, Le Quesnoy. The legendary story of the epic by Renaud of Montauban \\"the horse Bayard and the four Aymond sons\\" is still known today from the Ardennes forest to the forest of Orleans.\\" Despite this assertion, the historian Valenciennes d‚ÄôOultreman said he could be a character named Aymon: governor of Ponthieu? Furthermore, the historian Jules Duvivier would rather name an ancient Count of Hainaut: indeed, in the 8th century, portions of territories around the present town belonged to the Leudes, fellows of the Frankish kings to whom they were granted. In the 9th century, the region was occupied by the Vikings who settled there along rivers. Around the year 842 at the time of King Charles the Bald, they were blocked at Valenciennes, as the river became too narrow for their boats. Later, the land at Le Queroy became a freehold belonging to the Episcopal mass at Cambrai and by the name ofNoflus, latinized from Novem fluctibus.This is probably the same word of Germanic origin that Neaufles and whose final -fles is the same as ‚Äìaf(f)le and the northern -ofle, which descends from the Germanic alah meaning temple. Finally, 1148, the freehold was sold by the Bishop of Cambrai, Nicolas de Chi√®vres to Count Baldwin IV of Hainaut.E. Mannier, √âtudes √©tymologiques, historiques et comparatives sur les noms des villes, bourgs et villages du d√©partement du Nord A.

Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville de Le Quesnoy, pp. 13‚Äì15 = Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut = In the mid-twelfth century, Count of Hainaut Baldwin IV the builder surrounded the town of Quesnoy with ditches and ramparts and also built in 1150 the castle which became an important the center of the fortifications of the town (now the Centre Cernay and the fire station). This castle had a tower which together with the rest make up a fortress. Alice of Namur, wife of Baldwin IV endowed the castle with a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The castle had a park called \\"Bois du Gard\\" in which encountered deer, fallow deer and wild game. The park extended to the southeast (to Beaudignies and the edge of it is met with a mill near wetlands known as \\"the Pond du Gard\\". Desiring to populate his new fortified town, the Count enacted in 1161 a charter granting privileges to many people: the town prospered and there embraced a ... Mayor, aldermen, men of fiefs, (lawyers), a hostel, a hospital and outside, a leper to accommodate lepers (the disease of leprosy had been reported by the Crusaders from the East). Baldwin and his wife were still living, according to the scrolls, in 1169 in Le Quesnoy. The son of the Count (later Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut) married the said year 1169 in Le Quesnoy Margaret of Alsace, sister of Thierry of Alsace Count of Flanders: the wedding was gorgeous and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa was present in person.Giloteaux p. Abbot, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy, pp. 21‚Äì22; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Brussels, 1944, p. 84. = Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut = Baldwin V of Hainaut inherited in 1171 the title of Count of Hainaut in the death of his father, he was nicknamed The Brave (he was also later Baldwin VIII of Flanders). The new count, however, preferred to remain in Valenciennes rather than Le Quesnoy. In 1184, the count had to struggle against a coalition from the sire of Avesnes, the Count of Brabant and his brother the Count of Flanders : the Hainaut was ravaged on all sides. Unable to defend Le Quesnoy, the Count of Hainaut, with the consent of the inhabitants, burned the town so the attackers could not occupy it: the Quercitains took refuge in their castle and victoriously resisted the assaults of the Count of Flanders. During the siege, Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut was in Mons, collecting and concentrating his troops. The Count of Flanders then came to the ramparts of Mons to try to take the town: it resisted. It was the same for the town of Maubeuge. Meanwhile, at Le Quesnoy, the Lord of Trazegnies who commanded the garrison made a sortie and surprised the Flemish in their camp at Viesly. Peace between the warring parties finally intervened. Le Quesnoy rose from its ruins and became the favorite residence of the Counts of Hainaut who indulged in hunting and maintained a brilliant court. From 1194, Count Baldwin V settled permanently in Le Quesnoy. That same year, Pierre Pitens, the Count's chaplain, founded a small hospital that was equipped with incomes of land: the hospital will be the source of the Abbey of St. Elizabeth, Le Quesnoy (in rue Achille-Carlier in the town) that occupant came from the Augustinian Abbey Pr√©my near Cambrai.P.

Born in Valenciennes in 1171, he later married Marie of Champagne, niece of the King of France ‚Äî at that time there were very close links with France. Philip II of France, King of France, married Isabella of Hainaut, sister of Baldwin VI. It also brought together in his hands the county of Flanders. In 1200, he took the cross (left on a Crusade) and left the regency of his dominions to his brother Philip of Namur, his uncle William and Bouchard IV of Avesnes (tutor to his youngest daughter Margaret II of Flanders). Later he was elected by the Crusaders Emperor of Constantinople, but was captured in 1205 by the Greek allies to the Bulgarians: he never reappeared. He left two daughters, Jeanne and Marguerite P. Abbot.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville de Le Quesnoy, p. 24 ; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1944, pp. 86‚Äì87 = Joan, Countess of Flanders = With no trace of her father Baldwin VI since the year 1205 his eldest daughter, Joan of Flanders (also known as Joan de Constantinople), heiress of Flanders and Hainaut, took the reins of both states: in 1211 she married her cousin Ferdinand of Portugal (choice proposed by the King of France, her uncle) why became through her Count of Flanders. But Flanders was allied with the English and the Germans: there followed a war with the King of France and Joan's husband was taken prisoner until 1227. Joan, who lived in Le Quesnoy castle since her marriage, held various meetings with key figures in the town. However she left the town in 1225, as a minstrel-adventurer, Bertrand de Rays, living in the woods of Glan√ßon, pretended to be her father and intended to retake his land. In 1233, she returned and did improve the hospital in the town founded by Peter Pitens, enlarged the castle (the high Watchtower). Under the castle, extended the cellars and passages that still exist today. Her husband died in 1233 and in 1237 she married a second husband, Thomas of Savoy, who became a benefactor of Le Quesnoy. This served incidentally to improve the breeds of the country by bringing in bulls of Savoy and of Messin. He also brought horses from Italy and Spain, sheep from Catalonia, which yielded fine highly regarded wool, imbuing the drapers of Le Quesnoy with great renown: they mixed them with silk to make fabrics called Sayette. The cloth industry, widespread in Flanders, was also located in the town of Le Quesnoy.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy, pp. 24‚Äì26 ; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1944, pp. 87‚Äì88 = Margaret II of Flanders = In 1244, the death of her older sister who had no offspring, Marguerite of Hainaut and of Flanders (also known as Margaret of Constantinople as second daughter of Baldwin VI of Hainaut) inherited Flanders and Hainaut. She was nicknamed the Black for her dishonorable conduct. From her first marriage in Le Quesnoy in 1212, with Bouchard Avesnes, her teacher she had chosen herself, she had two surviving sons, John and Baldwin of Avesnes. She divorced, for reasons unknown (Bouchard belonged, however, to English stock) and married again in 1223, a knight of Champagne, Guillaume de Dampierre who gave her three sons, and she tried to help (them) by bequest and inheritance: what proved the origin of a quarrel that engulfed Hainaut and Flanders. Louis IX of France, King of France, was called to serve as arbitrator: the king, after taking advice, apportioned Flanders to the Dampierres and Hainaut to the Avesnes. However, despite this wise decision, fighting continued between members of two families. In Le Quesnoy and its environs Margaret Hainaut had, in addition to land, a wealth of manorial rights: duties on goods brought to the market, rights on meat and beer sold, rights over the entry and exit of goods; rights over the number of the mills and ovens, rights over products of rivers etc. She preferred to lease it all through an annual fee: between 1274 and 1277, a citizen of Le Quesnoy called Clarembault settled an annual fee of 2925 pounds. Also, a cartulary of the said Margaret tells us that in Le Quesnoy at that time there were about six hundred properties, and they measured up to 33m long and 13m wide on the road; there were nine bread ovens in the town that residents were subjected to forced labor, such as to provide firewood to the castle, but in return, they could collect dead wood; in case of war the call to Quercitains would be twenty-four hours after that to the Valenciennes.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville de Le Quesnoy, p. 26 ; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1944, pp. 89‚Äì90 = John I of Avesnes = In 1279, John I of Hainaut (or John II of Avesnes), son of another John and Margaret of Holland, son and grandson of Margaret II of Flanders, acceded to the County of Hainaut following the death of his grandmother. He preferred to live in Mons rather than in Le Quesnoy. In perpetual struggle against the Dampierres, he could not so much as collect additional taxes on his middle classes, that they, in desperation, seeing their industries decline, appealed to the Count of Flanders, Dampierre. A truce was concluded on 14 October 1292 through the intervention of the Duke John I of Brabant who was given custody of Le Quesnoy castle, until the conclusion of a peace treaty: the treaty became effective in 1297. But John made the people who had previously dared to make an appeal against him to the Count of Flanders regret their behaviour: many citizens of Hainaut were imprisoned and died in the castle vaults of Le Quesnoy. Drapers and weavers of (with their jobs and know-how) started to flee Le Quesnoy even before 1292, we find some settled in the city of Reims in Champagne.Reglement d‚Äôentre les maistres de la drapperie et les tixerans de drap, faict par arbitres et amiables compositeurs (Acte de sentence de l‚Äô√©chevinage de Reims, concernant les m√©tiers de drapier et tisserands, mars 1292.

NOTE: A sentence of the aldermen of the city of Reims in March 1292, brought order into the business of drapers and weavers of linen: 18 drapers and 32 weavers of linen included in the city, they are almost all foreigners by their nicknames, such as Rethel, Provins, Maubeuge, Valenciennes, Le Quesnoy. The Reims cloth industry, dating from the Roman period, at this time seems to have called in foreign industry and particularly the north (Hainaut, Flanders) whose expertise in this area was known and indisputable as to the quality of draperies produced. John who did not like Le Quenoy, offered it in 1301 by will to his son Raoul de Clermont, Constable of France. He, however, was killed in 1302 in battle of Courtrai. He then left the town in appanage to Gauthier, lord of Enghien and to Jacques de Verchain Seneschal of Hainaut, provided that if his wife Philippa of Luxembourg survived him, the town and its revenues should revert to him, she was widowed in 1304 and it actually reverted to John that year.Abb√© P.

The count in 1314, improved and strengthened the fortifications and, in 1318, in order to promote trade, he allowed wealthy Lombard bankers to settle in the town. In 1327 Philippa of Hainault, his was asked for her hand in marriage by King Edward III of England: the marriage was celebrated in 1328 in York, (England). At that time, William of Hainault had an excellent relationship with Flanders, England and France.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville de Le Quesnoy. = William II, Count of Hainaut = In 1337, William II the Hardy, succeeded his father as Count of Hainault. The Hundred Years War began and being a vassal state of the Holy Roman Empire, the Count was led to take sides with the Flemish and the King of England against France, despite the family ties binding it to the latter. Therefore, 22 May 1340, Le Quesnoy was besieged by John, Duke of Normandy (son of Philip VI of France with the royal troops; the Duke and his father did not accept that Count of Hainaut had rallied to the English. The inhabitants of the town defended themselves. Fortunately, they were well equipped with soldiers, weapons and artillery they had previously equipped the town walls with cannon (\\"batons of fire\\"), machinery and small cannons mounted on carriages which were used against the French attackers led by Marshal Mirepoix. The \\"Chronicles of Jean Froissart\\" mention the siege as follows: \\"(1340) .. Those of the town (= the besieged Le Quesnoy) unleashed against them (= the French troops) guns and machinery that threw large paving tiles. These tiles were generally made of iron, but could also be made of stone and tourniquets fire as they could find at very short notice in places under siege. The horses of the attackers were scared by the noise of the artillery which scattered iron and stone projectiles against them that could cause serious injury (equally to the riders), so they in this case against such weapons had no choice but to withdraw. The French, angry at having been repulsed by the artillery of the town, moved out of spite on the surrounding villages, which they then burned such as Gommegnies, Frasnoy, Ch√¢teau de Potelle, Wargnies-le-Grand, Wargnies- le-Petit.. (Notes 1.) Historians speak of the war machines without surprise, because they were more embarrassing than effective, and that no one foresaw the revolution that would make the discovery of gunpowder. In Europe around the year 1326 in Italy the first weapons loaded with powder were encountered. 2.) This siege is also interesting by the fact that there was no hand to hand combat and a new conception of the war by means of firearms was about to emerge : Artillery will quickly become indispensable to all wars and/or sieges.)\\" = Margaret II, Countess of Hainault = Margaret, in 1345, succeeded following the death in Friesland of her brother William II. In 1345, she granted to foreigners, of whichever countries they might be, the faculty to enjoy the same rights as residents of Le Quesnoy provided that they fix their residence in the town. She married Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor became a widow of her husband in 1347: when she moved to Le Quesnoy where she stayed until the end of her life, and made the castle her preferred home. The cloth industry flourished there at that time: indeed, when the cloth industry of Mons was reorganized in 1352 it called upon clothmaking specialists of Le Quesnoy and a fuller was even called to settle in Mons with his working material.Abb√© P.

But returning from a trip to England in 1358, he was suffering from madness and initially to prevent harm, was imprisoned in The Hague, then in the tower of the Castle of Le Quesnoy, in which he remained for more than twenty years. His brother, Albert, Duke of Bavaria, secured the regency of his States, pending the majority of his son William VI, Count of Holland. Albert of Bavaria did not entertain good relations with particular subjects of Hainaut, he arrested Sir Sohier of Enghien at a banquet and locked him in Le Quesnoy, for causing him umbrage. The peers of Hainaut protested and petitioned the lord of Ligne: in reply, the Duke beheaded the lord of Enghien and seized his lands. In 1365, civil war sparked in Hainaut, which was ended in 1376, by the promise of Albert of Bavaria to found a mass in the church of Le Quesnoy dedicated to the repose of the soul of the lord executed, as well as providing monetary compensation for his orphans.M.-A.

In 1405 he reached his majority and was nicknamed the Good. He was married first wife, Mary, daughter of the King of France, Charles V. His marriage was barren so he contracted a new alliance (12 April 1385) with Margaret, daughter of Philip the Bold, known for this reason, in the history of Le Quesnoy by the name of Margaret of Burgundy. Margaret stood out throughout her life by her good works, and moreover, she had to take an important role in the town. During his reign, William IV granted many privileges including to the bowmen of Le Quesnoy. Le Quesnoy reached its peak of power and fame. The town was well protected and supplied, and was able to sell to the towns of the Somme and others darts, crossbows and guns.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville de Le Quesnoy, pp. 34‚Äì35. ; D. Mathieu, Notes historiques sur l‚ÄôHistoire de la for√™t de Mormal, t.

She was nicknamed The Woman with four husbands as she had an eventful life: the cause of much pain for the town, Hainaut and the other states under her authority. Betrothed at 22 months and at five years to John, Dauphin of France (1398-1417), second son of King Charles VI of France, she would become widowed in 1417. From that time, Jacqueline lived with her mother in the castle. A year later, she married her cousin John IV, Duke of Brabant: the couple did not get along. In 1421, under the pretext of a trip to Bouchain she went to England whose court received her with respect and without waiting for the annulment by the Pope of her marriage to the Duke of Brabant, married Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, brother of King Henry V of England. This was the beginning of a new war: Gloucester and Brabant each claiming their right to rule the territories of Jacqueline. One misfortune often leads to another; and in 1423, the towns of the provost of Le Quesnoy were not spared by the battles between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians: and were spoiled by bands such as \\"thieves de Guise\\", and \\"thieves and brigands of all kinds\\". In 1424, the town, which since 1420 had lost some of its rights, such as the hereditary bailiwick of the V√©nerie stood up against the Duke of Brabant, permitting Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester to occupy the country. Jacqueline directed her governance of Le Quesnoy until 1425. Given the extent of the events caused by her third marriage, she left Le Quesnoy and took refuge in Mons, where she was captured and taken to the home of her cousin Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy in Ghent, which again she escaped. She continued the fight and became victorious: the Duke of Brabant (her second husband) died in 1427. However, her territories declared allegiance to her cousin Philip the Good. In the Treaty of Delft in 1428, she retired to Holland, where she married secretly Frans van Borsele, Stadhouder of Holland, tasked with guarding her (she was 27 years old). On hearing this, her heir and cousin Philip the Good, decided on killing the fourth husband: to save him, Jacqueline gave up her rights over her lands. On the death of Jacqueline in 1436 without issue, Hainaut including Le Quesnoy became, by law, Burgundian possessions. That same year, one of the bands of \\"routiers\\" across France, who had fought the British but now being laid off, commanded by Chabannes and other leaders fought against Hainaut, where it gained a justified nickname of \\"the Skinners\\". The nearby Mormal forest served as a refuge to the inhabitants of the villages of Le Quesnoy, who were not too perturbed; although an expeditionary force formed by Jean de Croy had been beaten by the Skinners, who fortunately withdrew after their victory to Champagne.Abb√© P.

During these hunts, deer were hunted (for their meat of choice, their fur and antlers used for decoration), wolves (due to attacking the sheep), wild dogs (as carriers of rabies) and badgers (as their fur was in great demand). From this forest were also taken the best wild foals (although made quite docile by the presence of man over time) which later would take part in parades to honour the combat of the troops of the Count of Hainaut.G.

Under the Treaty of Delft in 1428 with Jacqueline, Philip the Good of Burgundy became the heir of Hainaut: he officially took possession in 1436 becoming the new Count of Hainault. However he left his aunt, Margaret of Burgundy, the mother of the late Jacqueline, the enjoyment of manors, the income, and the castle of the castle of Le Quesnoy dubbed the \\"Castle of Margaret of Burgundy\\". She set up a perpetual foundation for the poor of the town which at that time stood at 300 gold florins as irrevocable annuity: This annuity endured the centuries, since in 1960 the office of Beneficence of Le Quesnoy continued to manage the donation. Upon her death in 1441, the castle became the residence of successive lords representing the Duke. These lords later became captain- governors then governors. With the advent of these lords, the provost's primarily judicial function was reassigned in their favor. The role of provost dates from 1181 in the reign of Baldwin V. The provost chaired a meeting of 32 \\"jurors of peace\\", of which 16 were selected from prominent citizens of Le Quesnoy and the rest were selected from within the jurisdiction of the provost and had to have land to be eligible. For a decision to be valid 16 jurors had to be present. From 1440, the function of the lord took considerable importance: he was to govern, keep guard of the town (watches day and night), maintain the town's rights, monitor the stipends granted to various officers of the town, and finally account to the Duke of Burgundy he represented. Many parchments of that time are in the departmental archives in Lille mentioning the lords appointed: Jean de Mons, followed in 1446 by Jean Parding; in 1451, the Lord de Haubourdin, in 1459, Guillaume Delcourt/De Le Court, in 1465, Fran√ßois d‚ÄôEst as the first captain-governor in 1469, Jean de Rosembos, Lord of Fromelles. This role continued until the French Revolution In 1442 a fire devastated the town: most homes up to that time were built of wood. In 1444, Philip the Good came to Quesnoy, after defending the town against bands of robbers who operated regularly since 1441 in the region and called \\"skinners, house-robbers and shearers.\\" He also fixed a weekly market on Tuesday and two annual fairs (on the second Monday of Lent and on 25 October, Saint Crispin's day). In 1449 a new fire destroyed Le Quesnoy: Duke donated 356 oak trees from the nearby forest or Mormal and also established a hospice in the town called \\"Les Chartri√®res\\".Abb√© P.

In 1468, he came in the town of Le Quesnoy who greeted him with great fanfare. He had lived there from the age of seven, after the death of his mother, with his aunt Beatrice of Portugal. In 1454, he even gave a grand banquet at Le Quesnoy after his wedding with Isabella of Bourbon his second wife. In 1463, he also intervened in the town concerning a case of witchcraft difficult to resolve: he arrested a man named Charles de Noyers in the service of the Comte d'Estampes. The beguiling King of France, Louis XI, was apparently not entirely innocent in this matter: the powerful Duke of Burgundy took umbrage upon him. During his reign, Charles the Bold did nothing but make war: his desire was to recreate a single realm, as the former Lotharingia (from which Lorraine is named), between Burgundy and the Netherlands (he envisaged a Burgundian domination from the North Sea to Sicily).Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy. pp. 45‚Äì46 ; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1944, pp. 199‚Äì212 = Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian Archduke of Austria, later Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor = In 1477, Charles the Bold died at the Battle of Nancy. Immediately Louis XI of France entered Hainaut with 7000 men at arms and a powerful artillery. He stood before Le Quesnoy on 23 May 1477 but was repelled. He returned some time later and succeeded after intense bombardment (nearly 900 balls thrown) to take the town, leaving his fair archers to rush through the open breach, but torrential rain halted the fighting. However, the town surrendered the next day and preferred to pay 900 gold crowns to prevent looting: the King of France had lost 500 men at arms in the venture! The same year the young duchess Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian of Austria, head of the house of Habsburg, and in 1478 his troops drove the French out of the county of Hainaut. Antoine de Chabannes, who had been given custody of the town in 1477 by Louis XI, found himself in a hurry to get away.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy pp. 45‚Äì46. ; H. B√©court, Histoire de la for√™t de Mormal, Lille, 1887, pp. 35‚Äì36. The town and province of Quesnoy were also given in dowry to Margaret of York, the third wife of Charles the Bold of Burgundy upon marriage in Damme, Flanders, 1468. She was also the sister of Kings Edward IV and Richard III of England. A conscientious noblewoman and aware of her duchess status as a political contract (cementing the politico-economic links of Burgundy-Netherlands-England), she was an informed advisor to her husband, and after his death, to Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of Austria, the new sovereigns of the Netherlands and Hainaut. At that time, several men of fiefs and legal representatives of the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy officiated at Le Quesnoy in the administration of Hainaut, such as Jehan de Longchamp, Jacquemart du Parc, Jacquemart de Surie, Enguerrand le Jeune. This feudal organization was superimposed on the manorial organization that was the foundation, which called these men of fiefs to preside over the complexity and tangle of fiefs and under-fiefs and their rights and changes over time: the seals of those \\"notaires\\" appended to the deeds they passed conferred full authority and exempted the use of the seal of the Bailiwick (of the municipal administration, today).A.D.N.

As to Le Quesnoy, it no longer served as favorite home to the new princes: the remoteness of the court was detrimental to the town. In 1492, the population which had previously more than 800 heads of families was reduced to a quarter of its former size. The Court had moved to Mons with many middle-class families and many trades following. Le Quesnoy from this time was seen as a stronghold under the authority of lords and captains-governors: in 1478, The Lord de Maingoval, Count of Chimay took this role. In 1493, we find Robert de Melun, in 1499, John of Luxembourg, in 1511, Philippe de Bellefori√®re, Lord of Romeries and of Caudry. Maximilian of Austria kept a considerable bastion in Le Quesnoy to withstand the incessant incursions of the French settled in Cambrai. At that time, the religious communities in the town, already very numerous, developed in peace yet appointments of the heads of these establishments had to be made with the consent of the central government. Philip the Handsome (), the ruler upon attaining the age of majority, married Joanna of Castile and Aragon. In 1500 Philip gave the castle of Le Quesnoy to his sister Margaret of Austria (later regent of the Netherlands under her godson Charles V). Philip, the local prince born, raised and loved by people in the Netherlands died in 1506, leaving two infant sons: Charles of Luxembourg, later Charles V of Spain and Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, the succession of the nations.Abb√© P.

Upon the death of his maternal grandfather in 1516, he became undisputed King of Spain and its rich colonies. He became, in 1520 elected the new Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Amassing so much power in the hands of one man whose states surrounded France led to the inevitable: Francis I of France and Charles V of Spain were in perpetual strife and wars during their respective reigns. At that time, the garrison of Quesnoy composed of a Walloon company 200 soldiers, commanded by a governor named by Antoine de Cro√ø, Lord of Thour and Sempy. The company had to increase the bourgeois ranks of artillery (created in 1517), archers (existing since 1379) and officers, enjoying special privileges. In 1521, the King of France made his raids in Hainaut and ravaged Ostrevant. In 1523, Charles V came to Le Quesnoy to fight the French raids and strengthened the fortifications of the town which had not been changed since 1314. It was then that the walls of the ramparts, still currently existing, were built on the foundations of the original enclosure. A new design of fortifications had been born at the end of 15th Century developed by the Italians. It was to divide the angles of the fortifications, the towers, which, projecting from the enclosure while remaining attached to them, allowed defenders to fire at all angles against the attackers (also allowing the use of artillery). The invention of these bastions offered shooting in all directions and the stronghold of Quesnoy did not escape this rule hence in 1534, Charles V's engineer, Frate da Modena (Jacopo Seghizzi) drew plans for the refortification and to replace the medieval walls. To defend Le Quesnoy now were new towers (bastion Imp√©rial, bastion C√©sar, bastion Soyez, bastion Saint-Martin et bastion Vert) and four gates (Porte de la Flamengerie, porte de Valenciennes, porte Saint-Martin, porte Fauroeulx) and the work took nearly 20 years! The last tower of the few preserved earlier towers was demolished in 1885. In 1540, Charles returned to Le Quesnoy accompanied by the Dauphin of France and the Duke Orleans (both sons of Francis) as a 10-year truce was signed in 1538 between the belligerents. He returned in 1543 also to check the progress of the work to the town and its fortifications. At this time he ordered the closure of the Gate of Flamengerie to allow flooding around the ramparts. These great works monopolized the activity of town residents who took full advantage of this period of relative calm for entertainment with major feasts and festivals of jubilation: we saw for a time here various companies promoted and sponsored by local lords and monasteries with rich costumes and playing drums and trumpets. Also in 1543, Francis reappeared with an army of 40,000 men and captured Landrecies, Maubeuge and D‚ÄôAymeries and Berlaimont castles: establishing his headquarters at the Abbey of Maroilles: these gains were ceded to Charles V under the Treaty of Cr√©py in 1544. In 1554 Henri II of France fought against Charles V and took Le Quesnoy, but could not hold it: famine prevailed in the town, as the province had been devastated by the rekindled war.Mechelen 2005, Femmes d‚Äôexception, Marguerite d‚ÄôYork, et Marguerite d‚ÄôAutriche, Editeur P.

The reign of the new sovereign was characterized by the struggle against reformed religion harshly repressed by the Inquisition. The rebels, the Huguenots called \\"beggars\\" or \\"image breakers\\" began their campaign in 1566, attacking churches and desecrating any object of worship: on 24 August that year, all the churches in the town of Valenciennes were occupied and ransacked by a thousand of these rebels. Faced with this threat, the garrison of Quesnoy attacked on 24 November with 80 guns and the Huguenots entrenched themselves in Valenciennes. On 23 March 1567 the Huguenots surrendered their arms and the repression by Spanish was too severe, which displeased the people. In the Battle of Le Quesnoy, 12 November 1568, the Prince of Orange, the spiritual leader of the Reformed Church, attacked a body of Spanish soldiers under the walls of Le Quesnoy and then captured the town. The Duke of Alba, Governor of the Netherlands, acting on behalf of Spain the same year retook the town as the Prince of Orange withdrew into France. In 1569, it was decided to top the watchtower of the castle with an octagonal belvedere (the tower existed until 1768: it was destroyed on that date by a hurricane). From 1572, the Protestants supported by the French pillaged the area for several years, because of these facts Sieur Guillaume de Hornes Heze (who realigned with the nobility and the people of Hainaut in dissatisfaction with the Spanish military presence) was executed in 1580 in Le Quesnoy for having attended the Bishop of Cambrai. The result was a growing hatred of the population vis-√†-vis Spain and its king. At that time, the abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Maroilles, Frederick d‚ÄôYve (born in Bavai) became councilor of state and played a key role as intermediary in negotiations between the warring parties in the Netherlands : the representatives of the Protestants led by the Prince of Orange; and the representatives of the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. In 1581 seven northern provinces of the Spanish Netherlands, however, joined a Protestant secession and declared their independence under the name \\"United Provinces\\". In 1583, the Magistrate (a Mayeur, four aldermen, a treasurer and a prosecutor) decided to build a town hall and a belfry. Meanwhile, and until 1593, the rebels were fought: only after this date did calm recover in the Le Quesnoy province.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy, pp. 52‚Äì53 ; O.

He made peace with all the old enemies: the Spanish Netherlands were administered by the Archduke Albert and his wife the Infanta Isabella under the tutelage of Spain. The region bathed in a period of peace in the first third of the 17th Century. The garrison of Le Quesnoy was increased at that time to station 3000 armed men. As there was not enough room in the barracks of the town, use was made to lodge some of the men with the citizens but protests ensued from the population. In 1616 the convent of R√©collets was founded at a place called \\"L‚ÄôHermitage,\\" near the town walls east of the Rue du Gard: its mission was to assist the clergy.Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy, p. 53-54 ; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1944, pp. 320‚Äì321. = Philip IV of Spain = Another Philip succeeded as head of the Spanish Empire in 1621. In his time the castle's restoration was completed in 1625 and the town in 1631 gave 50,000 florins to borrow to pay off its debts. In 1635, France under the influence of Richelieu allied to the United Provinces (Dutch Protestant) and sent its heralds to the Grand Sablon Square in Brussels for a declaration of war against Spain dragging the southern Spanish Netherlands (including Hainaut) into the turmoil of the fourth phase so-called \\" French phase\\" of the Thirty Years War, between the French and Dutch versus a Hispano-Austrian- German alliance. Hainaut at that time was criss-crossed by all troops and vehicles of war and requisitions impoverished rural areas. This misfortune led to another ... in 1639, an epidemic became widespread throughout the region and many people perished in Le Quesnoy. In 1648, the Prince of Ligne came to Le Quesnoy with 4,000 men equipped with artillery and prepared to defense operations, which were needed to counter the advance of French troops. The following year, the property belonging to the French in the town was confiscated. On 31 August 1651 the Hispanic-Hainaut garrison at Le Quesnoy won one last success in the walls of the town. But on 4 September 1654 the Vicomte de Turenne, at the head of the French army, stood before Le Quesnoy with a powerful artillery: he seized the town whilst the Spanish before leaving tried to render useless the fortifications by damaging the most out of walls. Turenne became master, cleverly foiled the plans of Cond√© (the Great Cond√©, Duc d'Enghien, then in the service of Spain).Abb√© P. Giloteaux, Histoire de la ville du Quesnoy, p. 54 ; F. van Kalken, Histoire de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1944, pp. 323, 330, 332 ; H. B√©court, Histoire de la for√™t de Mormal, Lille, 1887, p. 45.  Le Quesnoy becomes French  At the end of the Fronde in 1654, the town was taken by the French royal army of Turenne. The town that was never French becomes it to the great pleasure of the court. The young King Louis XIV received the town as a sacred gift.Anne Blanchard, \\" Louis Nicolas de Clerville\\", in Actes du colloque \\" Vauban et ses successeurs dans les ports du Ponant et du Levant \\", Brest, 16‚Äì19 mai 1993, publi√© dans Vauban et ses successeurs dans les ports du Ponant et du Levant, Paris : Association Vauban, 2000, p 123 (√©galement publi√© dans Les cahiers de Montpellier no 38, tome II/1998, Histoire et D√©fense, universit√© Paul-Val√©ry) The town was then put in the hands of a man from Mazarin,JB Colbert, lettres et instructions Talon nicknamed 'of Le Quesnoy' administered the town that officially became French in 1659 under the Treaty of the Pyrenees. During this transitional period, many properties of the bourgeois came under the control of war profiteers who were local and French.P. Gillotaux, Histoire de Le Quesnoy  Le Quesnoy transformed  An advanced bastion of France until 1678 when Valenciennes became French, the fortifications of Quesnoy were modified and reinforced by the very young Vauban who made in some way his classes. The existing five bastions were amended or supplemented to create a body eight strong. The northern areas (Royal bastion) and south (Gard stronghold) are most representative of the action of Vauban. However, in the old regime of France where clientele took precedence over skills or even economy, the work was not awarded to local contractors. Despite the good reputation of the fortification work begun under the direction of Louvois and Vauban, the fortification was quickly outdated and the town was taken in 1712 by the imperialists in 6 days. The governor of the town of Mr. de la Badie, was made to explain his alleged \\"mediocre\\" resistance. He was quickly released because the French besieged the town under Claude Louis Hector de Villars, in the hands of the Austrians, could only resist one day or seven days more under the orders of the old French military.Archives de la Bastille, Volume 13, page 21-22-23; 1881 The experience of easy capture of the town led the authorities to strengthen the sector of the fortifications by which had the Imperials had attacked in 1712. A huge hornwork, unique in the world, was then built to protect the vicinity called Fauroeulx and the gate of the same name. The work in question divided the supply ponds into two, known today under the names of The Red Bridge Pond and The Blessed Pond. These two ponds supplying water to flood the ditches in case of siege, were supplemented by two other ponds no longer exist (the pond d‚ÄôAulnoye and that of L‚ÄôEcaillon in the forest of Mormal). In the 18th Century that is to say, the reign of Louis XV and the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI, was relatively peaceful for the northern border. In fact, travelers passing by the town were astonished at the friendliness of Quercitains who gained a reputation, as flattering as it was, as \\"pretty people,\\" that is to say, polite people.  Le Quesnoy during the Revolution  It was the chief town of the District of Quesnoy from 1790 to 1795. The city on the border of the young republic was taken by the Austrians and then again in July 1794 by the troops of Scherer after a severe siege in a downpour. 3000 Austrians were taken prisoner on this occasion. The news of the capture of the city was sent within hours by telegraph Chappe, a world first, at the delegation of the Parisian public that greeted it.R√©impression de l'ancien Moniteur, H. Plon, 1861, p. 515. In late imperial times, the city was taken without much resistance by the Dutch during a mock siege. At the end of Congress of Vienna in 1815, it was decided that the city was to be occupied by Russian troops for three years. Relations between Quercitains and Russians are friendly to the point that many marriages are between Russian officers and the local ladies.E. Lesur, Seigneurs et ch√¢telains de Jolimetz, 2007 This relationship, although one officer left his wife to return Russia, between the town and empire of the Tsars, is also recalled when the Franco-Russian accord became the cornerstone of the alliance system of Third Republic on the eve of the Great War. However, the city exhausted by that time, would never regain the prestige that made it the second largest city in French Hainaut.  Le Quesnoy in World War I  The New Zealand monument commemorating the liberation of Le Quesnoy. The town was taken on 23 August 1914 by German troops and suffered a harsh occupation for four years. The mayor of the town, Achille Carlier, was condemned for hiding wounded French and British on the arrival of German troops. Carlier was put on trial in Brussels. He was defended by a German lawyer and convicted.Justice political disease of our time, Professor. Dr. Friedrich Grimm After a difficult approach through the valley of the Ecaillon, the city was relieved on 4 November 1918 by New Zealand troops. In a major movement of British troops who had distinguished themselves in Ghissignies, Louvignies, Jolimetz and Orsinval, taking the old fortress was given to the New Zealand troops encircling the city, who followed from the west a railway track (now dismantled) and bypassed the Red Bridge Pond near Potelle. A garrison of 1,000 German soldiers, including many defenders beaten in Tournai, was ordered to withstand whatever happened. Civilians in the city were ordered to evacuate on 27 October but some remained in cellars. On the third refusal to surrender, including one sent by an aircraft, the New Zealand troops launched an assault on the town while preserving it.Philip Gibbs, copyright 1918 by the New York Times Company. Telegraph special for The New York Times In the late afternoon, the New Zealand artillery and British artillery aimed at the top of the walls and confused the defenders through the use of \\"oil bombs\\".W. E. Murphy, 2nd New Zealand Divisional Artillery, Historical Publications Branch, 1966, Wellington Some men led by 2Lt Leslie Cecil Lloyd Averill reached the ramparts of the southern sector where the remains of the sluicegate of the mill in the town and used a ladder to scale the walls. The New Zealanders took the town after street fighting in the early evening of 4 November 1918. Taking Le Quesnoy and neighbouring communities opened the door to the Sambre Gap.,L'Humanit√© du 6 novembre 1918 that is: the way to Belgium and Germany which precipitated the defeat of Germany. The New Zealanders' action in November 1918 was recorded by New Zealand in four memorials, which vouche for the excellence of preparation which remains in the memories of the New Zealand Artillery, for the courage of the soldiers recognized by numerous military citations (over 50 recorded in the London Gazette) and the preservation of the city. On 10 November 1918 the President Raymond Poincar√© visited the town that re-entered history by its sacrifice. A military parade was then held in a well attended. On 15 July 1923 the New Zealanders' monument was inaugurated. Mayor Daniel Vincent welcomed Marshal Joffre, Lord Milner (a signatory of the Treaty of Versailles) and Sir James Allen, the representative of New Zealand. Many New Zealanders traveled to Le Quesnoy to join the French on 4 November 2018 to celebrate the centenary of the liberation of Le Quesnoy. Many events were held that day including the unveiling of the New Zealand War Memorial Museum. Le Quesnoy in World War II During the Battle of France, Generalleutnant Max von Hartlieb-Walsporn ordered his 5th Panzer Division to invade Le Quesnoy on 18 May 1940. The town was defended by a small force which included a battalion of Moroccan Tirailleurs. The result was a four-day siege which kept von Hartlieb-Walsporn's force in place at a time when other German armoured formations were making rapid progress. Von Hartlieb-Walsporn eventually took Le Quesnoy, but was relieved of his command soon after.  Sites and monuments  100px 100px * The ramparts, built in the Spanish period and modified by Vauban and his successors until 1914. * The bastion Verde Hospital siege. The bastion Green is the smallest but the most interesting of bastions of Quesnoy. Its doors, the oldest, attributed to Charles V, date from about 1540. The work was then modified, enhanced and refined several times. In 1759, the top sides were removed thereby increasing the capacity of the structure and the surface of the bastion. The interior space thus created allowed the addition of four underground rooms accessible only by a courtyard. The superstructure was modified in 1882. * The belfry of the Town Hall, solid and chunky, which was destroyed many times, in 1794, 1918 and 1940. The first tower was built in 1583. It now houses a belfry of 48 bells. Directly adjacent to the belfry, the town hall built in 1700, offers a fine example of classical building. The grand staircase in the lobby is a classified architectural work. right * The memorial of the town, near the town hall, is a work created by Valenciennes sculptor F√©lix Desruelles. 100px * On the ramparts, another work by Desruelles commemorates the liberation of the city (World War I) by ANZAC troops from New Zealand. This monument of the New Zealand fixed on a curtain wall between the two bastions of the Gard and Saint-Martin, is dated 1922. Like many memorials of the Great War, it was opened on Sunday 15 July 1923 in the presence of Marshal Joffre, Lord Milner and Sir James Allen (NZ). The New Zealand government decided in 1920 to include his youth lost in stone. Thus, the \\"jack of all trades\\" British architect, Samuel Hurst Seager was appointed official architect of the Great War memorials of New Zealand. His work was noticed by a traveling exhibition for \\"improving the aesthetic standards of memorials\\" had seduced the local authorities. Hurst Seager thus received the task of designing the memorials of Longueval and Le Quesnoy in France, Mesen in Belgium and Chunuk Bair in Gallipoli ‚Äì the four foremost places of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force during the Great War. In addition to designing, S. Hurst Seager had to find the ideal location of the memorial. So it was he who oversaw the erection of the monument whose implementation was provided by the artist Felix Desruelles the creator of the monument to the dead of the town. The plan of the New Zealanders monument in itself was the work of a designer of the British Flying Corps from Scotland, Robert Henry Fraser, a specialist in plastering and founder of the Art War Memorial Tablet in 1918. 100px * In the Cemetery, a marble sculpture given by the state: Les deux douleurs or the two pains, by Th√©odore Rivi√®re. * The castle, built in the twelfth century by Baldwin IV of Hainaut, it was the home of the Counts of Hainaut, who at some point were also Counts of Holland and Zeeland. Jacqueline of Hinault was born at the Castle in 1401. Charles the Bold and his daughter were the last sovereigns to live there. It was later neglected and almost abandoned in the sixteenth century. Of the prestigious Medieval castle there are few vestiges: a gateway and a set of remarkable Romanesque cellars. The current large building at the site is called Cernay and was mostly built in 1681. 100px * The Tower of Baldwin the Builder. This tower is one of the oldest parts of the fortification.

New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2009; pg. ??? The conflict designation usually includes only the hostilities that took place during 1855‚Äì1856, but there had been numerous previous skirmishes, as early as the 1830s, between European-American settlers and the Native Americans, over territory and resources. Following conclusion of the war, the United States removed the Tolowa people and other tribes to reservations in Oregon and California. In central coastal Oregon, the Tillamook, Siletz and about 20 other tribes were placed with Tolowa people at the Coast Indian Reservation. It is now known as the Siletz Reservation, located on land along the Siletz River in the Central Coastal Range, about 15 miles northeast of Newport, Oregon. While the tribes originally spoke 10 distinct languages here, the surviving native language in the 21st century is Siletz Deen-ni, an Athabaskan language related to Tolowa. History=Background Hoxie Simmons, a Rogue River Indian, c. 1870. The interaction of the Rogue River Indians and the first European-American settlers traveling through the area was relatively peaceful. However, the situation changed drastically with the opening of the Oregon Trail and the gold rushes in northern California and later in eastern Oregon. Larger groups of settlers and miners entered the area, consuming without restrictions the natural resources on which the Indians relied for survival, competing for game and fish, and chopping down entire forests of oak trees. The first recorded hostilities were caused by the American Ewing Young's travel to Oregon in 1834. His party murdered several natives and buried their bodies on the island where the party was camped.\\"Ewing Young Route,\\" Oregon's Historic Trails. End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center. These bodies were later discovered by the local tribe. They retaliated the next year, attacking an American fur trapping party that passed through. Four of the eight European-Americans were killed; William J. Bailey and George Gay were two survivors. In 1837, as part of the Willamette Cattle Company, Bailey, Gay and others were herding cattle north to the Willamette Valley when Gay shot and killed a native boy. He was shot in revenge for earlier attacks against whites. The local Indians raided the cattle drive, but killed or drove off only a few cattle. Cultural conflict Peter Skene Ogden encountered inland Rogue River natives in 1827. The first known contact between these groups of Indians and Europeans occurred when British explorer George Vancouver anchored off Cape Blanco, about north of the mouth of the Rogue River, and Indians visited the ship in canoes.E. A. Schwartz, The Rogue River Indian War and Its Aftermath, 1850‚Äì1980. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997; pp. 20‚Äì25. In 1826, Alexander Roderick McLeod of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) led an overland expedition from HBC's regional headquarters in Fort Vancouver to as far south as the Rogue. In 1827, an HBC expedition led by Peter Skene Ogden made the first direct contact between whites and the inland Rogue River natives when he crossed the Siskiyou Mountains to look for beaver for the fur trade.Nathan Douthit, Uncertain Encounters: Indians and Whites at Peace and War in Southern Oregon. Corvallis, OR: Oregon State University Press, 2002; pp. 11‚Äì19. Friction between Indians and whites was relatively minor during these early encounters. In 1834, however, an HBC expedition led by Michel Laframboise was reported to have killed 11 Rogue River natives, and shortly thereafter a party led by an American trapper, Ewing Young, shot and killed at least two more. The name Rogue River was apparently derived from French fur trappers, who called the river La Riviere aux Coquins, because they regarded the natives as rogues (coquins).Lewis A. McArthur and Lewis L. McArthur, Oregon Geographic Names. [1928] Seventh edition. Portland: Oregon Historical Society Press, 2003; pg. 822.The Oregon Territorial Legislature changed the name to Gold River in 1854, but in response to opposition from Rogue River settlers, changed it back to Rogue River a year later. See: Roger Dorband, The Rogue: Portrait of a River. Portland, OR: Raven Studios, 2008; pg. 58. The number of whites entering the Rogue River watershed greatly increased after 1846, when a party of 15 men led by Jesse Applegate developed a southern alternative to the Oregon Trail; the new trail was used by emigrants headed for the Willamette Valley.Douthit,Uncertain Encounters, pg. 58. Later called the Applegate Trail, it passed through the Rogue and Bear Creek valleys and crossed the Cascade Range between present-day Ashland and south of Upper Klamath Lake.Loy, et al., pp. 14‚Äì15 From 90 to 100 wagons and 450 to 500 emigrants used the new trail later in 1846, passing through Rogue Indian homelands between the headwaters of Bear Creek and the future site of Grants Pass and crossing the Rogue about downstream of it.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pg. 60. Despite fears on both sides, violence in the watershed in the 1830s and 1840s was limited; \\"Indians seemed interested in speeding whites on their way, and whites were happy to get through the region without being attacked.\\"Douthit,Uncertain Encounters, pg. 63. In 1847, the Whitman massacre and the Cayuse War in what became southeastern Washington raised fears among white settlers throughout the region. They formed large volunteer militias to fight Indians.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 66‚Äì68. Tensions intensified among whites passing through the Rogue River Valley in 1848 at the start of the California Gold Rush, when hundreds of men from the Oregon Territory passed through the Rogue Valley on their way to the Sacramento River basin.Schwartz, The Rogue River Indian War and Its Aftermath, pp. 26‚Äì27 After Indians attacked a group of miners returning along the Rogue in 1850, former territorial governor Joseph Lane negotiated a peace treaty with Apserkahar, a leader of the Takelma. It promised protection of Indian rights and safe passage through the Rogue Valley for white miners and settlers.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pg. 68‚Äì69. (see also: Battle of Evans Creek) Mining in the Rogue River valley Joel Palmer, Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs Miners began prospecting for gold in the watershed, including a Bear Creek tributary called Jackson Creek, where they established a mining camp in 1851 at the site of what later became Jacksonville.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 78‚Äì80. Indian attacks on miners that year led to U.S. Army intervention and fighting near Table Rock between Indians and the combined forces of professional soldiers and volunteer miner militias.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 76‚Äì77. John P. Gaines, the new territorial governor, negotiated a new treaty with some but not all of the Indian bands, removing them from Bear Creek and other tributaries on the south side of the main stem. At about the same time, more white emigrants, including families with women and children, were settling in the region. By 1852, about 28 donation land claims had been filed in the Rogue Valley.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pg. 80. Further clashes in 1853 led to the Treaty with the Rogue River that established the Table Rock Indian Reservation across the river from the federal Fort Lane.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pg. 106. As the white population increased and Indian losses of land, food sources, and personal safety mounted, bouts of violence upstream and down continued through 1854‚Äì1855.  War  In 1855, this friction culminated in open conflict, which lasted into 1856, and is now called the Rogue River War.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 124‚Äì32. The Guide to the Cayuse, Yakima, and Rogue River Wars Papers 1847‚Äì1858 at the University of Oregon summarizes the war as follows: > Throughout the 1850s, Governor Stevens of the Washington Territory clashed > with the U.S. Army over Indian policy: Stevens wanted to displace Indians > and take their land, but the army opposed land grabs. White settlers in the > Rogue River area began to attack Indian villages, and Captain Smith, > commandant of Fort Lane, often interposed his men between the Indians and > the settlers.

The Indians killed 27 settlers expecting to settle the > score, but the settlers continued to attack Indian camps through the winter. > On May 27, 1856, Captain Smith arranged the surrender of the Indians to the > US Army, but the Indians attacked the soldiers instead.

Smith and Barrett Codieck \\"Guide to the Cayuse, Yakima, > and Rogue River Wars Papers, 1847‚Äì1858\\", Eugene, OR: University of Oregon, > 2010. Suffering from cold, hunger, and disease on the Table Rock Reservation, a group of Takelma returned to their old village at the mouth of Little Butte Creek in October 1855. After a volunteer militia attacked them, killing 23 men, women, and children, they fled downriver, attacking whites from Gold Hill to Galice Creek. Confronted by volunteers and regular army troops, the Indians at first repulsed them; however, after nearly 200 volunteers launched an all- day assault on the remaining natives, the war ended at Big Bend (at RM 35 or RK 56) on the lower river. By then, fighting had also ended near the coast, where, before retreating upstream, a separate group of natives had killed about 30 whites and burned their cabins near what later became Gold Beach.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 150‚Äì153. Most of the Rogue River Indians were removed in 1856 to reservations further north. About 1,400 were sent to the Coast Reservation in central Oregon, later renamed the Siletz Reservation.Schwartz, The Rogue River Indian War and Its Aftermath, pp. 146‚Äì149.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 157‚Äì158. They were placed with other Indians who were from Coastal Salish tribes, such as the Tillamook, the Siletz, and the Clatsop. To protect 400 natives still in danger of attack at Table Rock, Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, ordered their removal to the newly established Grande Ronde Reservation in Yamhill County, Oregon.Douthit, Uncertain Encounters, pp. 147, 163.  Battle of Hungry Hill  See Battle of Hungry Hill for full article The Battle of Hungry Hill, also known as the Battle of Grave Creek Hills or Battle of Bloody Springs, was the largest battle of the Rogue River Wars.ICTMN Staff, \\"Lost Oregon Indian Battlefield Discovery Attributable to ‚ÄòDetective Work'\\", Indian Country Today Media Network, 7 Nov. 2012. It occurred on October 31, 1855. The Native Americans were camped with their women and children on the top of a hill, with the soldiers located across a narrow ravine about 1,500 feet deep. Two hundred of the Native Americans were in the mountains southwest of present-day Roseburg armed with muzzleloaders, bows, and arrows and managed to hold off a group of \\"more than 300 ... dragoons, militiamen and volunteers\\".Kimberly A.C.

The organization's stated aim is to \\"achieve protection of wild birds, natural habitat and biodiversity\\". BirdLife Malta is also Malta's first environment NGO. It was founded in January 1962, and was then known as MOS (Malta Ornithological Society). It started off more as a study group, but quickly came to realize that wild birds were in dire need of protection. Today Birdlife Malta works to protect bird populations. Malta is a very densely populated small Mediterranean island state, with no truly wild areas left. The biggest threats to birds in Malta are habitat destruction (e.g. new roads, building development, hotels, golf courses), disturbance and direct persecution (hunting, trapping). Malta has been called \\"the most savagely bird-hostile place in Europe\\".Jonathan Franzen, ‚ÄúEmptying the Skies,‚Äù The New Yorker, July 26, 2010, p. 48 BirdLife Malta uses various methods to protect birds. Foremost among its methods are education, especially through schools campaigns, publications, the media and an active junior member section; the management of two wetland nature reserves, namely Gƒßadira and Is-Simar; lobbying the authorities for better bird-protection legislation; assisting the police for better law enforcement; reclaiming and improving degraded habitat; and doing research about birds and their habitat to identify more areas for protection. BirdLife Malta issues various newsletters and magazines for its membership, and publishes books about natural history. Its latest book is Nature in Gozo (2007). BirdLife Malta is an entirely voluntary organisation and dependent on subscription and donations. Membership currently stands at about 3000. BirdLife Malta is a Partner of BirdLife International, a global network of environmental organizations in 100 countries and territories. Causes of Population Decline: Hunting and illegal poaching of birds, especially larger predatory birds can have a significant impact on their population size and has resulted in some population decline.[3] Recently the Maltese government agreed to allow the shooting of 5,000 Turtle Doves. This created controversy due to the endangered status of these birds. BirdLife Malta works to prevent the illegal hunting of birds and works to maintain Malta as a safe stop for the many migratory bird species that pass through on an annual bases.

Many of these have been suspected of being hybrids. In several cases, shorebird hybrids have been described as new species before their hybrid origin was discovered. Compared to other groups of birds (such as gulls), only a few species of shorebirds are known or suspected to hybridize, but nonetheless, these hybrids occur quite frequently in some cases. Hybrids in the Scolopaci (typical waders)=\\"Cooper's\\" and \\"Cox's\\" sandpipers An apparently new sandpiper species (\\"Cooper's sandpiper Tringa/Calidris cooperi\\") was described in 1858 based on a specimen collected in 1833 on Long Island, New York. A similar bird was collected in 1981 at Stockton, New South Wales, Australia. These are probably hybrids between the curlew sandpiper (\\"Calidris\\" ferruginea) and the sharp-tailed sandpiper (Philomachus acuminatus/Calidris acuminata). Cox's sandpiper (\\"Calidris\\" √ó paramelanotos), described as a new species in 1982, is now known to be a stereotyped hybrid between males of the pectoral sandpiper (\\"Calidris\\" melanotos) and female curlew sandpipers. It is known from nearly two dozen sightings since the 1950s, almost all of which are from Australia, with one record from Massachusetts. and another from Japan. Other hybrid scolopacids A stint at Groote Keeten in the Netherlands which was initially thought to be that country's first record of the least sandpiper but which showed anomalous features, was postulated to be a hybrid between little stint (\\"Calidris\\" minuta) and Temminck's stint (\\"Calidris\\" temminckii). Putative hybrids between the dunlin (\\"Calidris\\" alpina) and the white-rumped sandpiper (\\"Calidris\\" fuscicollis) have been occasionally seen in northeastern North America. In Europe, on the other hand, an apparent hybrid between the dunlin and the purple sandpiper (\\"Calidris\\" maritima) has turned up. Courtship and copulation have also been observed between common (Actitis hypoleucos) and spotted sandpipers (Actitis macularia), but there are no records of hybrid offspring. Occurrence of intrageneric hybridization has been reported between the buff-breasted sandpiper (\\"Tryngites\\" subruficollis) and the white-rumped (or possibly Baird's, \\"Calidris\\" bairdii) sandpiper ‚Äì the parent species apparently do belong into the same genus, however (see calidrid) -, as well as between the common and the green sandpiper (Tringa ochropus). Hybridisation in the Charadrii (oystercatchers, stilts, avocets and plovers) Hybridisation between American (Haematopus palliatus frazari) and black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) is relatively common in southern California and adjacent Mexico. The \\"avistilt\\" or \\"stavocet\\" is a hybrid between black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) and American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), occasionally found in California. One such bird was accidentally bred in the San Francisco Zoo in 1971 and lived at least until 1974. The avocet was the father and the stilt the mother of this individual, which apparently was a male. The nearly extinct New Zealand black stilt (Himantopus novaezelandiae) hybridizes with the pied stilt (Himantopus leucocephalus), which jeopardizes the survival of the former species. A Pluvialis plover wintering with a flock of golden plover near Marksbury, England in 1987 was believed to be possibly a hybrid between golden plover and Pacific golden plover.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it became the successor of the DDR- Oberliga, and functions today as a 5th division in the former territory of East Germany and the city of Berlin. This league is named after the Nordostdeutscher Fu√üballverband (NOFV: North-East German Football Association), the regional association of the DFB in the former East German territories. The league is currently split in two groups, north and south, the NOFV-Oberliga Nord and NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd. A third league, the NOFV-Oberliga Mitte existed from 1991 to 1994.  1990‚Äì91 Season  The NOFV-Oberliga developed after the entry of the Deutscher Fu√üball-Verband (the East German Football Association) to the Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund. It was the successor of the DDR-Oberliga and functioned as the elite division in the former East Germany for this season only. FC Hansa Rostock became champions of that league, with Dynamo Dresden being the runners-up. Thereby both acquired the starting rights for the 1991‚Äì92 Bundesliga season. The following teams qualified directly for the 2. Bundesliga: * FC Rot-Wei√ü Erfurt (3rd Place) * Hallesche FC Chemie (4th Place) * Chemnitzer FC (5th Place) * FC Carl Zeiss Jena (6th Place) These two teams qualified indirectly through a playoff round: * 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig (7th Place) * BSV Stahl Brandenburg (8th Place) All remaining clubs continued to play in the NOFV-Oberliga. This became the third- highest division starting with the 1991‚Äì92 season.  1991‚Äì1994  During these three seasons the NOFV-Oberliga was the third-highest league in German football. At this time it consisted of three divisions: North, Central and South. Overall there were 10 Oberligen in Germany at the time. At the end of the season, the Oberliga champions had a play-off for promotion to the 2. Bundesliga. The bottom two teams of each division were relegated to the Landesligen.

The number of divisions was reduced by one so that only North and South remained. Today it is the highest amateur division. The champions of both divisions were promoted directly to Regionalliga until Regionalliga was reduced from 4 to 2 divisions from the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Due to that change, there was no promotion from Oberliga in the 1998‚Äì99, but more teams were relegated to Oberliga than usual. Starting with the 1999‚Äì2000 season promotion was decided by a two-leg playoff between the division champions. This rule was scrapped for the 2005‚Äì06 season, so that both division champions will be promoted to Regionalliga at the end of this season. The bottom three teams of each division are relegated to the 5th level of the pyramid, but this number can increase depending on which teams are relegated from Regionalliga. The NOFV-Oberliga is played in two divisions: * NOFV-Oberliga Nord (North division): ** Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ** northern Brandenburg ** Berlin ** northern Saxony-Anhalt * NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd (South division): ** central and southern Saxony-Anhalt ** southern Brandenburg ** Thuringia ** Saxony Promotions to the Regionalliga since 1994‚Äì95: * 1994‚Äì95: FSV Velten (North division) and Wacker Nordhausen (South division) * 1995‚Äì96: SC Charlottenburg (North division) and VFC Plauen (South division) * 1996‚Äì97: SV Babelsberg 03 (North division) and 1.

Life Harwood was born at Darwen, Lancashire, in 1729. After attending a school at Darwen, he went in 1745 to the Blackburn grammar school under Thomas Hunter, afterwards vicar of Weaverham, Cheshire. Hunter wished him to enter Queen's College, Oxford, with a view to the church. But his parents were Dissenters, and he was trained for the ministry in the academy of David Jennings, at Wellclose Square, London. Leaving the academy in 1750, Harwood engaged in teaching, and was tutor in a boarding-school at Peckham. He preached occasionally for George Benson, and became intimate with Nathaniel Lardner. In 1754 Harwood moved to Congleton, Cheshire, where he superintended a grammar school, and preached alternately at Wheelock in Cheshire and Leek, Staffordshire. At Congleton he saw much of Joseph Priestley, then at Nantwich, who thought of him as a good classical scholar and entertaining companion. From 1757 he associated also with John Taylor, who in that year became divinity tutor at Warrington Academy; and in 1761 he preached Taylor's funeral sermon at Chowbent, Lancashire. An appendix to the printed sermon takes Taylor's side in disputes about the Academy, against John Seddon, and shows, according to Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, that Harwood was by this time at one with Taylor's semi- Arian theology; although he says that he never adopted the tenets of Arius. His letter of 30 December 1784 to William Christie shows, for Gordon, that in later life he inclined to Socinianism. On 16 October 1765 Harwood was ordained to the Tucker Street Presbyterian congregation, Bristol. He had married, and had a numerous family, and he describes his congregation as small. His proposals (1765) for a free translation of the New Testament, a tract against predestination, 1768, and the republication of a treatise by one William Williams on \\"the supremacy of the Father\\", made him locally unpopular. He was shunned and a charge was brought against his character, and he left Bristol in 1772. Coming to London, he settled in Great Russell Street, and employed himself in literary work. He failed to obtain a vacant place at the British Museum, but says he got a better post. Later he complained of the coldness of his dissenting friends, contrasting them unfavourably with Anglicans. In 1776, soon after publishing a bibliography of editions of the classics, Harwood sold his classical books and took lodgings in Hyde Street, Bloomsbury. He was poor, and on 15 May 1782 he was attacked by paralysis. He had therapy by application of electricity by John Birch but could neither walk nor sit, but was still able to write and to teach. He died at 6 Hyde Street on 14 January 1794. He claimed to have ‚Äòwritten more books than any one person now living except Dr. Priestley‚Äô. Without being a follower of Priestley, he defended him (1785) against Samuel Badcock. His wife, a younger daughter of Samuel Chandler, died on 21 May 1791, aged 58. Their eldest son, Edward Harwood (numismatist), wrote a Latin epitaph to their memory. Works He indulged his bent for classical reading, employing it in New Testament exegesis. A first volume (1767) of Introduction to New Testament Studies attracted the notice of Principal William Robertson of the University of Edinburgh, on whose recommendation he was made D.D. by Edinburgh on 29 June 1768. He published his translation of the New Testament in 1768, and another volume by way of introduction in 1771. Harwood's biblical studies received little encouragement from dissenters. Lardner just lived long enough to commend his first volume, and give some hints for a second, and other early friends were dead. Thomas Newton, bishop of Bristol, and Edmund Law, while master of Peterhouse, gave him encouragement; Robert Lowth lent him books; and the value of his work was recognised by continental scholars, his first volume being translated into German (Halle, 1770) by J. F. Schulz of G√∂ttingen. His biblical works are: *‚ÄòA New Introduction to the Study ‚Ä¶ of the New Testament,‚Äô &c.;, vol. i. 1767, vol. ii. 1771; 2nd edit. 1773, 2 vols.

(has appended bibliography of editions); his interleaved copy in the British Museum is corrected to 1 Nov. 1778. His contributions to classical studies are: * ‚ÄòCatulli, Tibulli, Propertii Opera,‚Äô &c.;, 1774, (with revised texts). * ‚ÄòA View of ‚Ä¶ editions of the Greek and Roman Classics,‚Äô &c.;, 1775; 2nd edit., 1778; 3rd edit., 1782; 4th edit., 1790, reprinted in Adam Clarke's ‚ÄòBibliographical Dictionary,‚Äô Liverpool, 1801, 6 vols.; translated into German by Alter, Vienna, 1778; Italian, by Pincelli, Venice, 1780; and by Boni and Gamba, with large additions and improvements, Venice, 1793, 2 vols.; the ‚ÄòIntroduction to ‚Ä¶ Editions,‚Äô &c.;, 1802, by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, is a tabulated arrangement from Harwood's ‚ÄòView.‚Äô * ‚ÄòBiographia Classica,‚Äô &c.;, 2nd edit., 1778, 2 vols. Harwood also translated from the French Abauzit's ‚ÄòMiscellanies,‚Äô 1774, and from the German (a language which he learned after 1773) Christoph Martin Wieland's ‚ÄòMemoirs of Miss Sophy Sternheim,‚Äô 1776, 2 vols. He edited the eleventh edition of John Holmes's Latin Grammar, 1777; the twenty-fourth edition of Nathaniel Bailey's English Dictionary, 1782; and an edition of the Common Prayer Book in Latin, ‚ÄòLiturgia ‚Ä¶ Precum Communium,‚Äô &c.;, 1791, reprinted 1840. An edition of Horace bearing his name was printed in 1805. Among his publications on general religious subjects are: * ‚ÄòA Sermon at the Funeral of John Taylor, D.D.,‚Äô &c.;, 1761. * ‚ÄòAn Account of the Conversion of a Deist,‚Äô &c.;, 1762. * ‚ÄòReflections on ‚Ä¶ Deathbed Repentance,‚Äô &c.;, 1762 (reached a third edition). * ‚ÄòChearful Thoughts on ‚Ä¶ a Religious Life,‚Äô &c.;, 1764, (reached a second edition, and was translated into Dutch). * ‚ÄòConfession of Faith,‚Äô printed with Thomas Amory's sermon and Samuel Chandler's charge at his ordination, 1765. * ‚ÄòA Letter to the Rev.

S. Badcock,‚Äô &c.;, 1785 * ‚ÄòDiscourses,‚Äô &c.;, 1790. His ‚Äòliberal‚Äô 1768 rendering of the New Testament was suggested by the Latin version of Castalio. But Harwood's style was turgid prose. Here is the Lord's Prayer: :O thou great governor and parent of universal nature (God) who manifestest thy glory to the blessed inhabitants of heaven--may all thy rational creatures in all the parts of thy boundless dominion be happy in the knowledge of thy existence and providence, and celebrate thy perfections in a manner most worthy of thy nature and perfective of their own! May the glory of thy moral development be advanced and the great laws of it be more generally obeyed. May the inhabitants of this world pay as cheerful a submission and as constant an obedience to Thy will, as the happy spirits do in the regions of immortality. His reconstructed text of the Greek Testament, 1776, was likewise neglected by his contemporaries. He based his text on the Cantabrigian and Claromontane codices, supplying their deficiencies from the Alexandrine. In a number of instances his readings anticipated the judgment of later editors.

Saint Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, founder of Opus Dei, inspired and encouraged them to start the college. It is a Catholic university. Strathmore has a particularly successful accounting program: 60% of the CPA finalists in Kenya come from it in the past ten years, dating back from 2007. The current Vice-Chancellor of the University is Professor John Odhiambo. History In March 1966, the first intake of Accountancy students, twenty-five in number, joined the Sixth-form students and began preparing for the examinations of the UK-based Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). These first Accountancy students were sponsored by Shell East Africa, British American Tobacco Kenya and the East African Breweries. At this time Strathmore College was unique as a fully integrated post-Form 4 institution offering both academic and professional courses. In October 1982, the college began evening courses in Accountancy after normal working hours, with 60 students sponsored by various companies. In 1986, in response to a request by the Trustees, the government of Kenya donated of land on Ole Sangale Road, MadarakaOle Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate. The European Union (EU) and the Italian government agreed to back the Madaraka Campus project. The donors wanted to support a co-educational college that would offer courses in Management and Accountancy, Kianda College,Kianda College an undertaking of Kianda Foundation,Kianda Foundation which was planning new developments at the time. Derrick Mureithi agreed to run their professional courses in the new Madaraka campus. Construction of the new campus commenced in September 1989. In January 1991, the Information Technology Centre was started in the Lavington, NairobiLavington, Nairobi Campus to run computer courses leading to the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (formerly Institute of Data Processing Management) Diploma and Higher Diploma. In January 1992 a Distance Learning Centre was opened to offer correspondence courses in Accountancy to students who are unable to attend lectures. In January 1993, Strathmore College merged with Kianda College and moved to Ole Sangale Road, Madaraka Estate. In August 2002, the Commission of Higher Education awarded Strathmore a Letter of Interim Authority to operate as a University with a Faculty of Commerce and a Faculty of Information Technology. In 2008, Strathmore was awarded a charter to become a fully-fledged university. It also has since established Strathmore Business School, with academic linkage to various top business schools, including IESE and Harvard Business School.http://www.universityparadise.com/strathmore- university/ Strathmore University Foundation Strathmore University Foundation is incorporated under Kenyan laws as a not for profit company limited by guarantee and having no share capital.

The metrical rhyming psalms were, probably, arranged by a Utrecht nobleman: Willem van Zuylen van Nijevelt (d. 1543). For the melodies he used folksongs from the Low Countries (though some have German or French origin). This publication has great value, because the publisher (Symon Cock) not only added the phrase 'sung to the tune of...' but also provided the actual music (melody) with the texts. Nowadays many of the folksongs can only be reconstructed because of the survival of the \\"Souterliedekens\\". Composers like Jacobus Clemens non Papa, Gerardus Mes, and Cornelis Boscoop made polyphonic settings based on the melody of the monophonic \\"Souterliedekens\\". The melody often functions as a cantus firmus. The Antwerp printer Tielman Susato dedicated four volumes of his music-books (\\"Musyck Boexkens\\") to Clemens' \\"Souterliedekens\\" (vol. IV to VII).

James concentrated on the \\"friends\\" of the title, who included Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, James Russell Lowell, and other figures more prominent than Story himself. Summary and themes James had met William Wetmore Story in Rome in the 1870s and often enjoyed his hospitality. James didn't take Story very seriously as an artist, though, but regarded him as more of a wealthy dilettante. After Story's death in 1895 his family approached James about writing a biography. James found the project a difficult one because he didn't think there was much to say about Story's own artistic efforts. So he made the book into more of a reminiscence on Italy and the many notable people Story had known. James did discuss Story's most significant works, the statues Cleopatra and the Libyan Sybil. James quoted from fine letters written to Story by the Brownings and other noteworthy friends. He also worked the Italian background for all it was worth. As James put it in a letter to William Dean Howells: \\"There is nothing for me but to do a tour de force, or try‚Äîleave poor W.W.S. out, practically, and make a little volume on the old Roman, Americo-Roman, Hawthornesque and other bygone days.\\" Critical evaluation Critics have generally been kind to this book, perhaps because they realize how difficult it is to write a biography on an insignificant subject. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, for instance, calls the book \\"an entertaining account of Story's life in Rome.\\" James' evocation of old Rome and the Italian countryside has been praised as charming and lovely, much like his essays in Italian Hours.

Approximately 300 of the 2,700 homes on the reserve are in Ohsweken, and it is the site of the reserve governmental and administrative offices. History From approximately 1840 to 1865, the Six Nations Confederacy council met in a log building near Middleport, Ontario. In 1856, against protests from the Onondaga chiefs, a strong-willed superintendent from the Indian Department, Jasper Tough Gilkison, established a council building in what is present-day Ohsweken, about 6 km south-west of Middleport. Gilkison later retired in 1891 under pressure from Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald for incompetence. Though the Onondaga chiefs argued that they should establish their own center of government, the village of Ohsweken quickly developed in the surrounding area. Places=Veterans‚Äô Park This park is at the corner of Fourth Line Road and Chiefswood Road. It features The Six Nations-Mississauga War Memorial, which commemorates the 200 First Nations soldiers who were killed during World War II.

Events=Six Nations Fall Fair Six Nations Annual Fall Fair takes place often the first week of September and is one of the oldest Agricultural Fairs in Ontario. Celebrations include the Miss Six Nations pageant, a powwow, horse races, and a derby. Bread and Cheese (Independence Day) In appreciation of the Six Nations' support for Great Britain during the American Revolution and the War of 1812, Queen Victoria began an annual tradition of giving blankets to their community. The custom ended with Victoria's death in 1901. In 1924, however, the council of the Six Nations decided to revive the practice, this time with gifts of bread and cheese, as a commemoration of the close ties between Six Nations and the British Crown.Maracle, Brian. Back on the Rez: Finding the Way Home. Penguin, 1997, p. 212. Every year, thousands of people stand in line to enter the Gaylord Powless Arena where they receive large squares of bread and cheese.

Running from SR 36 in Susanville north to Oregon Route 39 at the Oregon state line, it forms part of the shortest route between Reno, Nevada, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. SR 139 cuts through much Modoc National Forest and passes near Antelope Mountain and Tule Lake. North of SR 299 near Canby, the SR 139 was built by the federal government and turned over to the state in about 1940; the remainder was built by a joint highway district of Lassen and Modoc Counties, completed in 1956, and given to the state in 1959. Route description SR 139 through the Modoc National Forest State Route 139 begins at SR 36 in Susanville, and heads northeast up Antelope Mountain along the eastern edge of Susanville Ranch Park before turning north and descending into the Eagle Lake Basin, passing along the eastern edge of Eagle Lake and later the Said Valley Reservoir. The highway continues north and northwest through valleys and over hills and through a part of the Modoc National Forest, through the community of Avila Place, and then enters the east end of the Big Valley, where it begins to overlap SR 299 through Adin. The combined routes continue northerly through another part of the forest and over Adin Pass into the Warm Springs Valley, where SR 139 splits to the northwest near Canby. SR 139 runs northwest and north over mostly flat terrain through the center of the national forest and the communities of Ambrose and Perez before turning northwest. The route continues through Copic, Newell, Stronghold, Homestead, and Tuber before cutting across the intermittent Tule Lake as the Lava Beds Highway through the city of Tulelake. During this segment, SR 139 passes directly through the former Tule Lake Segregation Unit, used to house Japanese-Americans during WWII. After passing through the former internment camp, SR 139 continues to the Oregon state line at Hatfield. At an intersection right on the state line, SR 161 begins to the west, and Oregon Route 39 continues northwest towards Klamath Falls. The entire route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and north of the SR 299 overlap is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. North of SR 299, SR 139 is an eligible State Scenic Highway, but has not been designated as such; the short piece north of Tulelake is however part of the federal Volcanic Legacy Scenic Byway. The portion north of SR 299 is also in the Interregional Road System as a High Emphasis Route. History In 1925, a state-created \\"California Highway Advisory Committee\\" recommended a number of additions to the state highway system; among these was a route from Susanville to the Oregon state line towards Klamath Falls, via Bieber. This would be part of a road connecting Reno, Nevada and Klamath Falls east of the Sierra Nevada, which would attract heavy traffic and improve access to Crater Lake and Lassen Volcanic National Parks.California Highway Advisory Committee and Arthur Hastings Breed, Report of a Study of the State Highway System of California, California State Printing Office, 1925, p. 98 A local county road already followed this path, but it was unpaved, mostly dirt and gravel but with sections of rock and bad sand. This was close to the present SR 139, with notable deviations around the areas of Hayden Hill, Bieber and Lookout, and Malin, Oregon (as Tule Lake covered SR 139's current location). By the mid-1920s, the main road southeast from Klamath Falls, still unimproved in California, headed southeast to State Highway Route 28 (now SR 299) at Canby rather than south to Bieber. There travelers could head east on Route 28 to Alturas and south on the present US 395 (not a state highway north of Susanville until 1933) towards Reno.Clason Map Company, Touring Atlas of the United States, 1925Rand McNally & Company, Auto Road Atlas, 1926 The California state legislature passed a law in 1939, providing for state takeover of the Canby-Oregon road if the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Public Roads were to construct and pave it. The road was in fact mostly paved by mid-1939,Nevada State Journal, June 30, 1939: \\"A one- mile stretch at the Modoc-Siskiyou county line is gravel surfaced and from Tule Lake to the Oregon state line the oiled surface is broken and somewhat rough.\\" and under construction or completed by mid-1940, when Oregon Route 58 opened, continuing the corridor northwest from Klamath Falls.Reno Evening Gazette, August 2, 1940: \\"With the opening of the new Willamette highway in Oregon, connecting U. S. 99 with U. S. 97, a new avenue for direct travel is available to motorists between Reno and points in the Pacific Northwest...Short stretches are being oiled, with flagmen controlling traffic and caution is required. The balance of this route is entirely paved and in excellent condition.\\" In 1943 the legislature gave it the Route 210 designation;: \\"Route 210 is from Route 28 near Canby to the Oregon line near Merrill.\\" Oregon had added the short connecting Hatfield Highway to its state highway system in 1937.Oregon Department of Transportation, History of State Highways in Oregon, January 2007, p. 677 Lassen and Modoc Counties organized Joint Highway District No. 14 on December 21, 1929 to construct and maintain a road from Susanville via Adin to Oregon. However, since the state took over the part north of Adin, the district's scope was narrowed to Susanville- Adin.Division of Highways, Sixth Annual Report to the Governor on the Activities of the Division of Highways for the Year July 1, 1951 to June 30, 1952, p. 124 It finally completed work in 1956, and held a ceremony on August 26, in which it placed a monument at a point near Eagle Lake.Reno Evening Gazette, Lassen Highway Dedication Held, September 4, 1956 The legislature added the road to the state highway system as Route 216 in 1959.: \\"Route 216 is from Route 20 north of Susanville to Route 28 near Adin.\\" The portion south of Horse Lake Road became an extension of Route 20 instead;: \\"Route 20 is from:...(c) Route 29 near Susanville to Route 73 near Ravendale.\\" this route from Susanville to Ravendale (later Termo) was never constructed by the state, and was deleted from SR 36 in 1998. Also in 1959, a spur of Route 210 west to Dorris was added; this became SR 161 in 1964.: \\"Route 210 is from: (a) Route 28 near Canby to the Oregon line near Hatfield. (b) A point on the highway specified in subdivision (a) of this section near Hatfield to Route 72 near Dorris.\\" By 1946, the Canby-Oregon portion had been marked as Sign Route 139, connecting with Oregon Route 39;Rand McNally & Company, Road Atlas, 1946 it was extended south over US 299 to Adin and Routes 216 and 20 to Susanville by 1960.Oakland Tribune, May 31, 1960: \\"Nichols was killed when his car missed a turn yesterday morning and overturned on State Highway 139, two miles north of Susanville.\\" The number was legislatively adopted, replacing Routes 210 and 216, in the 1964 renumbering.: \\"Route 139 is from: (a) Route 36 near Susanville to Route 299 near Adin. (b) Route 299 near Canby to the Oregon state line near Hatfield.\\" It has remained a two-lane road, despite being added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 (Canby to Oregon) and 1965 (Susanville to Adin).

The reviews, also called inquiries or references, are referred to the ALRC by the Attorney-General for Australia. Based on its research and consultations throughout an inquiry, the ALRC makes recommendations to government so that government can make informed decisions about law reform. The ALRC is part of the Attorney-General's portfolio; however it is an independent statutory authority constituted under the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996 (Cth), and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). As an independent agency, it is able to undertake research, consultations and legal policy development, and to make recommendations to the Parliament, without fear or favour. The ALRC's objective is to make recommendations for law reform that: * bring the law into line with current conditions and needs * remove defects in the law * simplify the law * adopt new or more effective methods for administering the law and dispensing justice, and * provide improved access to justice. When conducting an inquiry, the ALRC also monitors foreign legal systems to ensure Australia compares favourably with international best practice. The ALRC aims to ensure that the proposals and recommendations it makes do not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties of citizens, or make those rights and liberties unduly dependent on administrative, rather than judicial, decisions and, as far as practicable, are consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The ALRC must also have regard to any effect that its recommendations may have on the costs of access to, and dispensing of, justice. Background The ALRC is the primary law reform agency for the Australian government. It has its origins in the Law Reform Commission, which was established in 1975 under the Law Reform Commission Act 1973. This legislation was superseded by the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996 (Cth) (the ALRC Act) which came into effect on 11 November 1996. The new act was intended to improve the structure and functions of the ALRC, consistent with the recommendations of the 1994 Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs titled, Law Reform‚Äîthe Challenge Continues. Constitution Under the amendments to the ALRC Act in 2012, the Commission consists of a President and up to 6 other members. The performance of the Commission‚Äôs functions, and the exercise of its powers, are not affected merely because of 1 or more vacancies in its membership. The Attorney‚ÄëGeneral may, from time to time, appoint such other part‚Äëtime members of the Commission as the Attorney‚ÄëGeneral considers necessary to enable the Commission to perform its functions. Full-time members are to be appointed by the Governor‚ÄëGeneral and part-time members are to be appointed by the Attorney-General. A member holds office for the term (of at least 6 months but not longer than 5 years) specified in his or her appointment, but is eligible for re‚Äëappointment. Presidents * Michael Kirby, Chair, 1975-1984 * Murray Wilcox, Chair, 1984-1985 * Xavier Connor, Chair, 1985-1987 * Elizabeth Evatt, Chair, 1988-1993 * Alan Rose, President, 1994-1999 * David Weisbrot, President, 1999-2009 * Rosalind Croucher, President, 2009-2017 ** Robert Cornall, Acting President, 2017‚Äì2018 * Sarah Derrington, President, 10 January 2018 ‚Äì present Law reform process The process for each law reform project may differ according to the scope of inquiry, and the ALRC usually works within a particular framework when it develops recommendations for reform. An Inquiry begins with Terms of Reference delivered by the Australian Attorney- General identifying an area of law that needs to be reviewed for various reasons including: * there is community concern about a particular issue that needs to be addressed through the process of law reform * recent events or legal cases have highlighted a deficiency with the law * scientific or technological developments have made it necessary to update the law or create new laws. An Issues Paper is usually the first official publication of an inquiry. It provides a preliminary look at issues surrounding the inquiry. It serves to educate the community about the range of the problems under consideration. Discussion Papers provide a detailed account of ALRC research, including a summary of the various consultations and submissions undertaken and received, and set out draft proposals for reform. The ALRC makes a formal call for submissions whenever it releases an Issues Paper or Discussion Paper. Through the submissions it receives, the ALRC can gauge what people think about current laws, how they should be changed and can test its proposals for reform with stakeholders before finalising them. ALRC Final Reports make specific recommendations for changes to the law or legal processes. In formulating recommendations, the ALRC draws not only on submissions, but also face to face consultations, academic and industry research, international research and models, and its considerable experience in law reform. The ALRC seeks to consult with people who have expertise and experience in the laws under review, as well as people likely to be affected by the laws in question. During the process of formulating recommendations, the ALRC has regard to any policy aims expressed in terms of Reference and the principles for reform identified for each particular inquiry, against which possible proposals are assessed. The Attorney-General is required to table the Final Report in Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it, after which it can be made available to the public. The Australian Government decides whether to implement the recommendations, in whole or in part.

He was appointed by 1154, during Byzantine-Hungarian conflicts, and was last mentioned in 1163. Rule Boriƒá is mentioned by Byzantine Greek historian John Kinnamos in his history book covering years 1118‚Äì1176. The first certain mention regards 1154, when the Byzantine-Hungarian war was underway, with engagements in the Danube area. Hungarian king G√©za II surrounded Byzantine-held (in Serbia) and devastated the surrounding area. Part of this Hungarian force was Hungarian vassal Boriƒá, the ban of Bosnia, and a Bohemian detachment. Kinnamos described Boriƒá as \\"exarch (governor) of the land/country of Bosnia\\". When the Hungarian force raised the siege of Braniƒçevo and headed west for Belgrade, Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos sent a detachment to attack the Bosnian troops. However, that Byzantine detachment clashed with the main Hungarian force and was decisively defeated. It is uncertain how and when Boriƒá came to rule Bosnia. According to Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá, he was not a native Bosnian; his homeland is taken to have been central Slavonia. As Hungary became the overlord of Bosnia in the 1130s, it is most likely that Boriƒá was appointed governor in Bosnia as a Hungarian vassal, and was obliged to participate in the march on Braniƒçevo. Later years There are no mentions of Boriƒá until 1163, by which time G√©za II was deceased (31 May 1162) and there was a civil war in Hungary regarding the inheritance of the throne ‚Äì G√©za's brothers Ladislaus and Stephen IV rose up against crowned heir Stephen III. Ladislaus managed to gain the throne, but he died shortly afterwards (14 January 1163), upon which Stephen IV took it with Byzantine help. Boriƒá supported Stephen IV, presumably due to assurance that Stephen IV would, as a Byzantine protege, stand. In 1163 at Esztergom, Stephen IV issued a charter in which he confirmed ban Belo≈°'s decision that the Dubrava forest belongs to the Bishopric of Zagreb; among witnesses were Boriƒá, listed after Belo≈°, a Hungarian court member and palatine, and before other counts. Also, with the permit of Stephen IV, Boriƒá in 1162‚Äì63 gifted the village of Zdelje (Esdel) to the Templars in Slavonia, later confirmed by kings B√©la III and Andrew II (in 1209), as part of further gifts of his descendants. In 1163, the intended heir Stephen III defeated Stephen IV and eventually plead to Byzantium. The new king then chased after Stephen IV's supporters‚Äìand his enemies‚Äìincluding ban Boriƒá. Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum (ca. 1282‚Äì85) says that a \\"miles (soldier) Gotfridus\\" went after the lord of Bosnia, whom he defeated, on the order of the Hungarian king. After this, mentions of Boriƒá in Bosnia disappear. From ca. 1166, Bosnia was a Byzantine province. Legacy Boriƒá's descendants are sometimes referred to as the Boriƒçeviƒá. He had sons named Boriƒá and Pavao, and his grandsons were called Odola, ƒåelk and Boriƒá. The extended family also included Detmar and Benedikt (also called Boriƒá). In the 13th century his descendants had possessions on both sides of the river Sava, in the eastern and western parts of what is now the Po≈æega County. An undated charter of Boriƒá to the Benedictine monastery on Lokrum was proven to be a forgery from the 13th century.

The friends he made in Italy included the dramatist, Vittorio Alfieri, whose widow, Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, Countess of Albany, he is said to have married. On Louise's death in 1824, he inherited her fortune, which he used to found an art school in his home town.

Fabre painted a portrait of Laurent-Nicolas de Joubert, which is now in the Getty Museum. Fabre gained popularity in Florence. The city's Italian aristocrats and tourists were drawn to his elegance, realism, and precision of his portraits. This popularity earned Fabre a place in the Florentine Academy. He became an art teacher, art collector, and art dealer in Florence. Fabre's works include The Dying Saint Sebastian (1789), The Judgment of Paris (1808), and The Death of Narcissus (1814).

It is often contrasted with fiat currency issued by governments or central banks. In many countries, the issuance of private paper currencies and/or the minting of metal coins intended to be used as currency may even be a criminal act such as in the United States (18 U.S. Code ¬ß 486). Digital cryptocurrency is sometimes treated as an asset instead of a currency. For example, cryptocurrency is legal as an asset in the United States, but is illegal as a currency as it's not legal tender. Cryptocurrency is illegal as a currency in a few countries (mainly in West Asia and North Africa). Today, there are over four thousand privately issued currencies in more than 35 countries. These include commercial trade exchanges that use barter credits as units of exchange, private gold and silver exchanges, local paper money, computerized systems of credits and debits, and digital currencies in circulation, such as digital gold currency.  Private bank notes  A private $1 note, issued by the \\"Delaware Bridge Company\\" of New Jersey 1836‚Äì1841 In the United States, the Free Banking Era lasted between 1837 and 1866, when almost anyone could issue paper money. States, municipalities, private banks, railroad and construction companies, stores, restaurants, churches and individuals printed an estimated 8,000 different types of money by 1860. If an issuer went bankrupt, closed, left town, or otherwise went out of business, the note would be worthless. Such organizations earned the nickname of \\"wildcat banks\\" for a reputation of unreliability; they were often situated in remote, unpopulated locales said to be inhabited more by wildcats than by people. The National Bank Act of 1863 ended the \\"wildcat bank\\" period. See also: History of free banking. Private currency issued in Australia by The City Bank of Sydney circa 1900 In Australia, private currency had first been used since the arrival of European settlers in 1788, and into the early years of Federation before the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 effectively shut down the circulation of private currencies by imposing a 10% tax on the practice, making it economically prohibitive. This Act was subsequently repealed by the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, which imposed a ¬£1000 per day fine for private currencies, and s. 44(1) of the Australian Reserve Bank Act 1959 Other persons not to issue notes. prohibited the practice outright. In 1976, Wickrema Weerasooria published an article which suggested that the issuing of bank cheques violated this section, to which banks responded that since bank cheques were printed with the words \\"not negotiable\\" on them, the cheques were not intended for circulation, and thus did not violate the statute.

One of the bank-issued private currency in Hong Kong, which is seriously damaged and repaired with a tape In Hong Kong, although the government issues currency, bank-issued private currency is the dominant medium of exchange.

In Scotland, the Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, and the Royal Bank of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland, the Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, First Trust Bank, and Ulster Bank, are authorised by Parliament to issue Pound sterling bank notes. They are subject to central bank (the Bank of England) regulations concerning \\"ring-fenced backing assets\\" and are backed in part by deposits at the Bank of England. They are exchangeable with other pound notes on a one-to-one basis, and circulate freely within the United Kingdom, though not legal tender, not even in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In fact, technically, no banknote (including Bank of England notes) qualifies as legal tender in Scotland or Northern Ireland.  Complementary currencies  England has had the Totnes pound since it was launched by Transition Towns Totnes Economics and Livelihoods Group in March 2007; A Totnes Pound is equal to one pound sterling and is backed by sterling held in a bank account. As at September 2008, about 70 businesses in Totnes were accepting the Totnes Pound. Other local currencies launched since then include the Lewes Pound (2008), the Brixton Pound (2009), the Stroud Pound (2009)Town launches its own bank notes BBC News 13 September 2009 and the Bristol Pound, which also allows for electronic payments. Austria had the W√∂rgl Experiment from July 1932 to September 1933. Bavaria, Germany, has had the Chiemgauer since 2003. As of 2011 there were over 550,000 in circulation. Since starting in 2006, the \\"City Initiative Karlsruhe\\" has issued the Karlsruher which has no nominal value. Every coin has the value of 50 Eurocents and is primarily used in parking garages. As of 2009, 120 companies in Karlsruhe accept the Karlsruher and usually grant a discount when paid with it. In Canada, numerous complementary currencies are in use, such as the Calgary Dollar and Toronto dollar. However private currencies in Canada cannot be referred to as being legal tender and many private currencies (as well as loyalty programs) avoid the word \\"dollar\\", using names like \\"coupons\\" or \\"bucks\\", to avoid confusion. Examples include: Canadian Tire money and Pioneer Energy's Bonus Bucks. Customer reward and loyalty programs operated by businesses are sometimes counted as private currencies. However, though \\"points\\" or \\"miles\\" may be exchangeable for merchandise or travel from the program sponsor, most of them lack the key element for currency of being a medium of exchange transferable to other individuals and usable as payment for items from other vendors. A few programs do have \\"partnerships\\" allowing this to some extent, and permit the transfer of points or miles. Some startups, such as the Canadian website Points.com, have sought to make loyalty \\"points\\" more currency-like by creating an exchange where points from one loyalty program can be traded for points in other such programs.  Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies  A cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency where cryptography secures the transactions and controls the creation of additional units of the currency. Technically, cryptocurrency is a not currency, but a digital form of token coins or scrip, as cryptocurrencies do not comply with the four fundamental functions of money according to economic theory. A cryptocurrency wallet can be used to store the public and private keys which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. The cryptographic systems used allow for decentralisation; a decentralised cryptocurrency is fiat money but one without a central banking system. In terms of total market value, Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency, but there are over 700 digital currencies in existence. On 6 August 2013, Federal Judge Amos Mazzant of the Eastern District of Texas of the Fifth Circuit ruled that bitcoins are \\"a currency or a form of money\\" (specifically securities as defined by Federal Securities Laws), and as such were subject to the court's jurisdiction. In August 2013, the German Finance Ministry characterized Bitcoin as a unit of account, usable in multilateral clearing circles and subject to capital gains tax if held less than one year. In Thailand, lack of existing law leads many to believe Bitcoin is banned.  Private currency crimes  As national currencies can be counterfeited, so too can private currencies, and private currencies are subject to other criminal issues, including fraud. The Liberty Dollar was a commodity-backed private currency created by Bernard von NotHaus and issued between 1998 and 2009. In 2011, von NotHaus was arrested and subsequently convicted on charges of money laundering, mail fraud, wire fraud, counterfeiting, and conspiracy. The charges stemmed from the government view that the Liberty silver coins too closely resembled official coinage. In 2007, Angel Cruz, founder of The United Cities Corporation (TUC), announced he was establishing an alternative \\"asset based\\" currency named \\"United States Private Dollars\\".\\"Florida man launches 'United States Private Dollar'\\", Daily Kos, August 25, 2007.

He is best known in Thailand by his stage name, Mum Jokmok (, , ); and is a popular Thai television personality. He is variously credited as Mom Jok Mok, Mum Jokemok or Mom Jokmok. Comedy and television Mum started his career as a comedian in the Bangkok \\"cafe\\" scene (restaurants in Thailand with live music and comedy performances). He started his own comedy troupe with \\"Jaturong Mokjok\\". Mum became widely known to the public from the variety-game show Ching Roi Ching Lan (‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô) hosted by Panya Nirankul. He appeared in comedy section with his group members and performed stunts. He also co-hosted with another popular game show Wethithong (‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏ó‡∏µ‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á) with Kiat Kitcharoen. He also has his own TV show named Mum Show, which airs every Saturday night. Film roles Mum is perhaps best known for his film role as George (in English) or \\"Dirty Balls\\", a translation of the Isan language term \\"Buk Hum Lare\\" (‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏´‡∏•‡πà), the comic-relief character in Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, a popular action film that stars Tony Jaa. Mum reprised the comic-relief role in the follow up to Ong-Bak, Tom-Yum-Goong. Instead of a con artist, as in Ong- Bak, he is a Sydney police inspector. Much of the comedy in Tom-Yum-Goong was over Mum speaking English, which is his third language (after Issan Lao and Thai). A gag reel over the closing credits shows him struggling with many of his lines. His first starring film role was in 2001's Killer Tattoo, the debut film of director Yuthlert Sippapak. A story about a group of bumbling hitmen, his character was called Dog Badbomb. After the success of Ong-Bak, Mum was able to write, direct and star in his own film, The Bodyguard, a wire fu action comedy in which he portrays a bodyguard who is fired after the billionaire he is protecting is killed. Martial-arts action was choreographed by Panna Ritikrai, and Ong-Bak's Tony Jaa has a small part as a fighter in a supermarket. One of the most famous scenes is when Mum's character runs naked across Bangkok's crowded Victory Monument public square, a major junction for public transportation. In the \\"making of\\" documentary on the film's DVD, Mum said the scene was one of the most embarrassing things he has ever done. Mum wrote, directed and starred in 2005's Yam Yasothon (Hello Yasothon), in which returned to his roots as a nightclub comedian for a musical romantic comedy set in rural northeastern Thailand in 1967. It was an homage to the Thai musical comediess of the 1960s and '70s, especially the films of Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat. The dialogue was entirely in the Isan Lao dialect, and for screenings in Bangkok it Thai subtitles so that central Thais could understand it more easily. In the Thailand National Film Awards, Yam Yasothon received a best-actress nomination for Mum's co-star, Janet Kheaw. Mum also has shown a flair for dramatic acting. In 2005, he starred in Midnight My Love (Cherm), as a loner taxi driver who has a relationship with a massage parlor girl. Cherm was screened at the 10th Pusan International Film Festival and other festivals. Mum was nominated for best actor at the 2005 Thailand National Film Awards. His co-star, Woranut Wongsawan, was nominated for best actress. He is often seen in smaller roles as well, including the hit 2005 Thai comedy The Holy Man (Luang Phii Theng), as well as an uncredited role in Dumber Heroes, a part he says he did for \\"a case of beer\\". Mum has written a short autobiography, The Untold Story (). At the end of 2005 Mum starred in Ghost Variety (Pee Chalui), a comedy-horror story in which he plays the director of a reality TV series that searches for spirits in haunted places. The film was released on December 29, 2005. The film was directed by Adirek \\"Uncle\\" Wattaleela, a veteran producer and director, and it featured guest appearances from many Thai film directors and producers, including Somsak Techaratanaprasert, Prachya Pinkaew, Piak Poster, Cherd Songsri, Yuthlert Sippapak.

At the time of his death, he was the richest man in Wales. Life history Thomas Williams was born in Llanidan, Anglesey, the son of Owen Williams of Cefn Coch in Llansadwrn. In the 18th century, there was a significant shortage of food for labouring people. Williams, known to his Welsh speaking workmen as Twm Chwarae Teg (\\"Tom Fairplay\\"), once complained to the magistrate at Llanidan that the villagers on Anglesey raided his fields and stole the turnips intended for his cattle and used them to feed their families. His business rival, Matthew Boulton, called Williams the \\"copper king\\" ‚Äì \\"the despotick sovereign of the copper trade\\". To his friend and agent he said, \\"Let me advise you to be extremely cautious in your dealings with Williams\\". He spoke of Williams as \\"a perfect tyrant and not over tenacious of his word and will screw damned hard when he has got anybody in his vice\\". Of the Cornish producers, Boulton said \\"they would not have submitted to be kicked and piss'd on by me as they have been by them\\" (Williams and his partner Wilkinson). Williams' tenacity as a lawyer was very evident when acting for the Hughes family of Llysdulas who were in an acrimonious dispute with Sir Nicholas Bayly of Plas Newydd concerning the Parys Mountain copper mine. This dispute, which ran for over nine years, involved the interpretation of that very unsatisfactory testamentary device called a moiety. At one stage the dispute involved four years of expensive litigation in the Chancery court with the Attorney General and the Solicitor General acting for opposing sides and was not finally settled until 1778. In that year Sir Nicholas leased his own copper mine to a London banker John Dawes (a secret associate of Williams) for 21 years. Williams emerged from the dispute as the managing partner with the Revd Edward Hughes and John Dawes in the Parys Mine Company. This under Williams control was cheap to run and extremely productive. His great problem was to obtain an attractive price for the copper. He faced a cartel of copper smelters whose aim was to buy cheap and sell dear. He moved decisively to establish his own smelting facilities and quickly entered into an agreement with John Mackay to establish an industrial complex at Ravenhead near St Helens in Lancashire. He also established warehousing and copper manufacturing and finishing facilities, and even a mint ‚Äì thus creating a vertical organisation. In 1788, Williams purchased the Temple Mills at Bisham in Berkshire. He built himself a fine mansion there called Temple House and used the mills for smelting copper brought from his Welsh mines. He became MP for the nearby town of Marlow in Buckinghamshire. He also acted quickly to absorb or control other producers ‚Äì notably the Cornish mines to produce a complete response to the cartel. Although always the driving force, Williams built up and controlled a major commercial organisation and surrounded himself with able staff. The Revd Edward was always a sleeping partner but younger brother Michael Hughes was an able manager. Other partners and staff included The Earl of Uxbridge, Owen Williams, and Thomas Harrison. His business organisation was first rate. He developed the technique of establishing his various businesses in separate companies. Thus the Parys Mine Company controlled its own smelting in South Wales, Lancashire and copper manufacture at Holywell and Wraysbury. Likewise the Mona mine (adjoining Parys) output was smelted by the Stanley Company in both Lancashire and South Wales. Other Companies dealt with manufacture at Greenfield near Flint and in the Thames Valley, Chemical Works (vitriol) at Garston Liverpool and still others with warehousing and banking. Williams had built copper works at Flint and Penclawdd where he made copper and brass products. Many of these materials were for use in the African slave trade. These copper trinkets etc. were largely exported to Africa for use as payment for slaves, who were then transported to the West Indies and sold. The proceeds were then used to purchase commodities for import into Britain. Williams claimed to have invested ¬£70,000 in this trade and petitioned parliament in 1788 when a bill was being discussed to prevent British ships from carrying slaves. Williams actively fought against the abolition of slavery and is said also to have introduced the use of copper bolts to fix the copper sheeting to naval vessels and it would appear that he sold them to all sides in the naval conflicts. When he died in 1802, 1,200 people were employed in his Parys and Mona mines, but five years later the number had dropped to 120. This owing partly to the collapse of copper prices, but also to the exhaustion of the known local copper deposits ‚Äì but no doubt largely resulting from the death of the firm's great driving force. He was High Sheriff of Anglesey for 1790‚Äì91.  References  # J. R. Harris (1964) The Copper King: A biography of Thomas Williams of Llanidan. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press.

It was formerly known as Sijil Rendah Pelajaran (SRP; Malay for Lower Certificate of Education). It was set and examined by the Malaysian Examinations Syndicate (Lembaga Peperiksaan Malaysia), an agency under the Ministry of Education. This standardised examination was held annually during the first or second week of October. The passing grade depended on the average scores obtained by the candidates who sat for the examination. PMR was abolished in 2014 and has since replaced by school-based Form Three Assessment (PT3; Malay for Penilaian Tingkatan 3). Subjects The mandatory or core subjects that were taken in this exam are: * Malay language (Bahasa Malaysia) * English language * Mathematics * Science * Geography * History * Living Skills (Kemahiran Hidup Bersepadu) * Islamic Studies (mandatory for Muslim students, optional for others) Optional subjects are: * Arabic language * Basic Arab communication * Chinese language * Iban language * Kadazandusun language (From 2009) * Punjabi language * Tamil language Malay language The Malay language was a mandatory subject, and continues to be so in the exam's successor, the PT3. Before the PMR examination in October, there were oral examinations and a listening comprehension examination which were counted for the actual PMR examination. These examinations were taken three times throughout Form 3, with the best results being selected as a final grade in the PMR examination. The Malay language examination consisted of two papers, that were Paper One, and Paper Two. In Paper One, 40 multiple choice questions were given to test the student's comprehension of the written language being tested, and lasted for typically one hour. Paper One was usually tougher, with results above 30 considered distinctive. Paper Two comprised four sections and was two hours long. For the first section, the candidates were required to write a summary based on the passage given, which also contained three comprehension questions on the same passage. For the second section, the candidates were expected to write an essay of not more than 120 words based on visual aids (such as graphs, charts, images, multiple images, tables and cartoons) that were provided to candidates. For the third section, candidates had to write an essay on one of five topics given to them. The composition must have contained more than 180 words, and carried the most number of marks. For the fourth and final section of the second paper, the candidates had to write a description for any one of the three novels studied by them in lower secondary school based on the instructions given. The questions asked differed from year to year. English language Similar in format to the Malay language exam, the English language exam usually had an oral component, which assessed the students' proficiency in speaking the language, a listening comprehension examination, testing the students' ability to comprehend speech in daily situations, an examination to test the student's composition skills, and finally an examination testing the student's knowledge in grammar and vocabulary. ;Oral and listening examination The oral and listening comprehension examination was taken before the PMR, which would contribute marks to the actual PMR examination. The oral examination was taken 3 times throughout the year with the best results selected for the PMR examination. The oral and listening comprehension examination were usually taken together. This examination for the English language usually lasts about 10 to 15 minutes per student. The maximum score for this examination is 40. The oral examination is divided into 2 sections. The first section was to interpret an illustration given as thoroughly and detailed as possible, and give comments about their actions in a formal way and predict the outcome of such a situation, this being graded on a score of 10. It was advised that students did not point to the picture. No names were to be given and everything was to be said in present tense. The next section was to give a speech in front of a class. This part of the examination was different for each of the 3 oral examination per year. For the first oral examination, this part of the test required the student to present an impromptu speech based on a topic given for more than 3 minutes. For the second oral examination, this part of the test required the student to memorise a passage and present it in front of the class as interestingly as possible for about 5 minutes. For final oral examination, this part required 2 students to strike a conversation in front of the class for about 5 minutes which is relevant to the topic given. The maximum score for this part of the oral test is 10. The final section of the English oral examination requires the student to answer questions spontaneously asked of the examiners related to the previous 2 sections, which often required their opinion and inference, this being graded on a score of 10. The listening comprehension examination followed once the oral examination had finished for the particular class. This examination would then test the students' ability to comprehend the spoken English language in various daily situations. This examination required the student to answer subjective questions which was based on the information contained in the audio played to the students. This examination provided the final 10 marks. ;Written examination For the first paper of the English exam, students were required to answer 40 multiple choice questions in the course of an hour. Questions based on grammar, vocabulary, phrases and idioms were tested. Students were also required to interpret information based on graphical stimuli such as statistical charts, memos, signs, short texts, notices and pictures. A rational cloze passage with a total of 10 questions was provided to the student; the passage tests grammar and vocabulary specifically. There was also a section which tested the student's knowledge in English literature, such as poems, short stories and novels studied throughout the lower secondary English lessons. For Paper 2, students were required to write a long essay and a summary, as well as to answer a literature component. Section A, guided writing, tested the student's ability in functional or situational writing. If a functional writing question is provided, students were required to write an informal or formal letter. If a situational writing question was provided, students were required to write an essay in the form of a narrative or third person drama. Generally, this part of Paper 2 was tough and difficult to score. Section B of Paper 2 required students to write a summary based on a passage given. The final section of Paper 2 was the literature component, where students were required to write an essay based on their knowledge in the novels studied in Form 3. The novels being tested in the literature component include How I Met Myself, The Railway Children and Around the World in 80 Days .The time limit for this paper is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Effective 1 January 2012, the new format set by the Ministry of Education Malaysia prior to the abolition of the exam in 2014 was as follows: Section A : Guided Writing (Remains the Same) Marks: 25 marks (Reduced from 30 marks) Section B : Literature (Section changed from Section C to Section B). Two (2) questions: Question 1 : Poem, short stories & drama Marks: 3 marks Question 2 : Novel Marks: 12 marks (Increased from 10 marks) Section C : Summary (Section changed from Section B to Section C)Marks: 10 marks (Unchanged) Mathematics The mathematics examination in PMR was divided into two papers, that is, Mathematics Paper 1 and Mathematics Paper 2. Paper 1 consisted of 40 multiple choice questions and is worth 40 marks. The time limit for this paper was 1 hour and 15 minutes. This had prompted complaints from students and parents about the very short timeframe for completion and its difficulty. Students usually score lower than average for Paper 1, with scores above 30 being distinctive. The usage of a scientific or four operation calculator was allowed for this paper from 2003 onwards. Programmable calculators were not allowed. Mathematics Paper 2 required open-ended input, and comprises 20 questions in increasing difficulty. This paper was worth 60 marks. Marks for each answer ranges from 1‚Äì6, depending on the complexity of the question. The time limit for this paper was 1 hour and 45 minutes. The usage of calculators regardless of type were prohibited for this paper. For both papers, the questions were usually in the form of: * Whole numbers * Real numbers * Fractions and decimals * Approximation and estimation * Number patterns and sequences * Basic mensuration * Percentages * Financial mathematics * Lines and angles * Bearing * Squares, square roots, cubes and cube roots * Indices * Surds * Polygons * Statistics * Pythagoras' theorem * Perimeter and area * Volume and surface area * Ratio and proportion * Rates * Coordinates * Linear, simultaneous and quadratic equations * Linear inequalities * Algebraic expression, Algebraic formulae and manipulation * Plane and solid geometry * Circles * Arc length and sector area * Transformations * Geometrical constructions and loci in two dimensions * Scale drawings * Graphs of functions * Trigonometry Science The science examination in PMR was also divided into 2 papers, that was Science Paper 1 and Science Paper 2. Paper 1 consisted of 40 multiple choice questions in escalating difficulty and was worth 40 marks. The time limit for this paper was 1 hour. The Science Paper 1, similar to Mathematics Paper 1, is usually very tough to score above 30. The usage of calculators for this paper was allowed, as this was to assist the students answer physics-based questions. Science Paper 2, similar to Mathematics Paper 2, required open-ended input. This paper consisted of 8 to 10 subjective questions. The marks allocated for the questions in Paper 2 varied from 1 mark to 6 marks, each measured proficiency in several units of the science syllabus, with a total of 60 marks. The time limit for this paper was 1 hour and 30 minutes and the usage of calculators was not allowed. The last 2 questions were usually experimental ones, which required the student to formulate a hypothesis, determine the variables of the experiment and tabulate the data for the experiment. The marks allocated for this section of Paper 2 were usually more because it required the student to explain further based on their knowledge in science. The syllabus covers various aspects of chemistry, biology and physics. These distinctions into different fields are not made in the examination format but can be derived based on the different themes: ;Chemistry * Matter and materials science. Chemical and physical properties. The phases of matter and the changes it undergoes. * The variety of resources on earth. Chemical elements, compounds and mixtures. * Electrochemistry. * Testing for results of biological processes. * The composition of air. Combustion. * Water and solution. Acids and bases. * Silicon compounds and calcium compounds. Reactions of metals with non-metals. * Pollution and steps to combat pollution. * Manufactured substances in industries.

Electrical supply and wiring system at home. Fuses and Earth wire. * Astrophysics. The solar system, stars, galaxies and the universe. * The history and developments of space exploration and the field of astronomy. Geography, History and Living Skills The format of the Geography, History and Living Skills examination in the PMR were the same. It had only 1 paper which consists of 60 multiple choice questions in escalating difficulty. The time limit for Geography and History were 1 hour and 15 minutes while for Living Skills it was 1 hour and 30 minutes. The Geography and History papers are commonly deemed very easy as questions are normally recycled from previous years. ;Geography The Geography paper focuses more on human geography rather than physical geography and is primarily focused on Malaysia. It features environmental geography, geomatics and regional geography. The usage of calculators was allowed for this examination. The Geography examination was widely considered as the easiest subject to score \\"A\\". The topics covered in the examination include: * Basic geography: Map reading, bearing, interpretation of topographical map and other basic techniques in geography. * Physical geography: Weather and climate, natural vegetation, plate tectonics, weathering, rivers, coasts, climatic, manmade and natural disasters. * Human geography: Population, settlements, agriculture and aquaculture, natural resource management, industrialisation, tourism, physical and human resources. ;History The History paper featured both national history and international history. However, it focused more on Malaysia's road to independence during the British colonial times. ;Living Skills For the Living Skills (similar to Design and Technology in many countries) paper, the subject was categorised into 4 elective groups where students could choose any one. Then there was the mandatory section where students must have taken engineering drawing, technology, invention, domestic piping, electronics, electrical engineering, basic economics, home decor and safety, tailoring, horticulture and gardening, telecommunication, cooking, consumerism, and signs. The 4 elective groups are: * Choice 1: Technical Skills (such as engine, electromechanics, motor and technical drawing) * Choice 2: Home Economics (such as sewing, baking, catering and fashion) * Choice 3: Agricultural Science (such as landscape, pets, gardening and plantation) * Choice 4: Business and Entrepreneurship (such as marketing, entrepreneurship, accounting and commerce) This paper was closed and is not allowed to be seen by the public. This was done mainly due to the sheer amount of recycled questions every year. Students were also required to complete three projects, that was folios, for these 3 subjects to receive their PMR slip and certificate. Similar to the Malay and English language examination which requires the students to have their oral and listening comprehension examination, these 3 folios would have contributed marks to the actual PMR examination during October. This project was to help the students to score distinctions as these papers are tough. Results The results were released in late December every year to all candidates through the relevant schools. The grades ranges from A (excellent) to E (failure), or even T for non-attendance (Tidak hadir). The grading scores were slightly readjusted based on general performances. Hospitalized students could take the examination at the hospital they were staying at. Based on the results and individual interests, students would have been streamed into Science, Arts, IT, or vocational streams for the following 2 final upper secondary years of schooling. The government aimed for a ratio of 60 Science to 40 Arts students, but this goal was ultimately not met. The results for the last batch of PMR (2013) was released on 19 December 2013 prior to its abolition in 2014. Abolition In 2011, Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin declared that the PMR examination would be abolished in 2014, and the Form Three students' performance for that year would be tested through a School-Based Assessment (SBA) conducted by the schools themselves. The SBA is to be monitored by the Examination Board to ensure the examination questions are of adequate quality and can truly gauge the students' level of performance. According to the then Deputy Prime Minister, this measure will also enable parents to obtain the latest information on their children's academic performances in school. After numerous debates, it was finally confirmed in early October 2012, that PMR would be officially abolished.http://www.malaysia- chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view;=item&id;=42277:muhyiddin-single- session-school-system-in-5-to-10-years&Itemid;=2 See also * Education in Malaysia * Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) * Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) * Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) References Category:School qualifications Category:Standardized tests Category:Education in Malaysia ","title":"Penilaian Menengah Rendah"},{"id":"3569119","text":"Zarand may refer to: * Zarand, Iran, a city in Kerman Province, Iran * Zarand, Qazvin, a village in Qazvin Province, Iran * Zarand, Zanjan, a village in Zanjan Province, Iran * Zarand County, an administrative subdivision of Kerman Province, Iran * ZƒÉrand (), Arad County, Romania ","title":"Zarand"},{"id":"3569122","title":"Delby Powless"},{"id":"3569128","text":"Drakies is a small housing estate on the outskirts of Inverness, Scotland,https://www.hspc.co.uk/Drakieshttp://statistics.gov.scot/resource?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.gov.scot%2Fid%2Fstatistical- geography%2FS02000734 lying immediately south of the former Inverness-shire village of Culcabock.

In popular usage, the term hidalgo identifies a nobleman without a hereditary title. In practice, hidalgos were exempted from paying taxes, yet owned little real property. Etymology Since the twelfth century, the phrase fijo d'algo (lit. son of something) and its contraction, fidalgo, were used in the Kingdom of Castile and in the Kingdom of Portugal to identify a type of nobility. In Portugal, the cognate remained fidalgo, which identified nobles of a similar status to a hidalgo in Spain. In the Kingdom of Arag√≥n, the infanz√≥n was the noble counterpart of the Castilian hidalgo. The pronunciation changes in Spanish occurred during the late Middle Ages, the letter-F sounding was lost, and replaced with the letter-H spelling and pronunciation of hidalgo.Corominas, Joan and Jos√© A Pascual (1981). \\"Hijo\\" in Diccionario cr√≠tico etimol√≥gico castellano e hisp√°nico, Vol. G-Ma (3). Madrid: Editorial Gredos, 359-360. (see History of the Spanish language) In time, the term included the lower-ranking gentry, the untitled, lower stratum of the nobility who were exempted from taxation. The Siete Partidas (Leyes de Partidas), suggests that the word hidalgo derives from it√°lico (\\"italic\\"), a man with full Roman citizenship. In the previous Visigoth monarchies, the condition of the hidalgo was that of a freeman without land wealth, but with the nobleman's rights to wear arms and to be exempt from taxation, in compensation for military service; the military obligation and the social condition remained in force by the Fuero Juzgo law. Origins The hidalgu√≠a has its origins in fighting men of the Reconquista. By the tenth century the term infanz√≥n appears in Asturian-Leonese documents as a synonym for the Spanish and Medieval Latin terms caballero and miles (both, \\"knight\\"). These infanzones were vassals of the great magnates and prelates and ran their estates for them as petty nobility. In these first centuries it was still possible to become a miles simply by being able to provide, and afford the costs of, mounted military service.S√°nchez-Albornoz, \\"Espa√±a y el feudalismo carolingio\\", 778-787; Su√°rez Fern√°ndez, Historia de Espa√±a, 141-142; MacKay, Spain in the Middle Ages, 47-50, 56-57, 103-104, 155; and Men√©ndez Pidal, La Espa√±a del Cid, 86-88, 544-545. Only by the mid-twelfth century did the ranks of the knights begin to be‚Äîin theory‚Äîclosed by lineage. In the frontier towns that were created as the Christian kingdoms pushed into Muslim land, the caballeros, and not the magnates who often were far away, came to dominate politics, society and cultural patronage. From their ranks were also drawn the representatives of the towns and cities when the cortes were convened by kings. It was in the twelfth century that this class, along with the upper nobility, began to be referred to as hidalgos. Types Hidalgos de sangre (by virtue of lineage) are \\"those for whom there is no memory of its origin and there is no knowledge of any document mentioning a royal grant, which obscurity is universally praised even more than those noblemen who know otherwise their origin\\", or in other words, an immemorial noble. Also quoted in When challenged, an hidalgo de sangre may obtain a judicial sentence validating his nobility from the Royal Chanciller√≠a of Valladolid or Granada, if he can prove that it has been accepted local society and custom. In this case, the resulting legal document that verifies his nobility is called a carta ejecutoria de hidalguia (letters patent of nobility). To qualify as an hidalgo solariego (\\"ancestral hidalgo\\"), one had to prove that all four of one's grandparents were hidalgos. Hidalgos solariegos were regarded as the most noble and treated with the most respect. Hidalgos de privilegio (by virtue of royal privilege) and hidalgos de Real Provision (by virtue of meritorious acts) entail a grant of nobility from His Majesty the King of Spain in his position as monarch, or from his position as protector of a military confraternity or hermandad such as the Noble Company of Knights Crossbowmen of Saint Philip and Saint James. Hidalgo de braguetahidalgo at the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola. (\\"fly-of-the-trousers hidalgo\\") obtained tax exemption for having seven sons in legal matrimony. In Asturias, Cantabria and other regions of Spain every seven years the King ordered the creation of padrones (\\"registers\\") where the population was classified either as hidalgos nobles, and therefore, exempt from taxation due to their military status or pecheros (from an archaic verb, pechar, \\"to pay\\")Su√°rez Fern√°ndez, 144 who comprised the estado llano (\\"lower ranks\\") and were excluded from military service and had to pay taxes. These padrones constitute nowadays a source of information about population genealogy and distribution as well as proof of nobility in certain cases. Over the years the title lost its significance, especially in Spain. Kings routinely awarded the title in exchange for personal favors. By the time of the reign of the House of Bourbon, over half a million people enjoyed tax exemptions, putting tremendous strain on the royal state which wasn't calling their services to arms but relied more on professional armies and costly mercenaries. Attempts were made to reform the title and by the early nineteenth century with the forced levies to military service of all citizens by Universal Conscription without any minimum requirements of nobility or pay or loyalty by honour but by coercion on desertion, it had entirely disappeared, along with the social class it had originally signified and most of its centuries-old developed code of honour in the nation's social culture. Influenced by policies in France, hidalgos all became 'pecheros' (taxpayers), without the privileges of the former title, and along with all citizens were also subject to conscription. Both estates of the realm (social classes) became combined, compulsorily contributing to the nation in service and taxes without exemption, while the titled nobility and royalty kept their former privileges and exemptions. Unlike southern Spain, in the north the number of nobles was high and their differences with the common people were few, society having reformed itself from the beginning for historical and demographic reasons, with militias being organized for the support of the Royals. In Asturias, the hidalgos came to be almost 80% of the population, and in the case of Cantabria this figure was even higher, reaching 83% in the sixteenth century and exceeding 90% around 1740. In the Se√±or√≠o de Vizcaya and in Guipuzcoa there was also the so-called universal right of hidalgu√≠a, by virtue of which all Vizcaya and all Gipuzkoans were born hidalgos. In the 16th century, the local charters provided the natives of the Basque Country with automatic status as hidalgos, giving them access to military and administrative careers. The reasons for this was that, unlike other regions of Spain, they were considered to have no Moorish or Jewish origins.Manuel de Larramendi, Corograf√≠a de la muy noble y muy leal provincia de Guip√∫zcoa, Bilbao, 1986, facsimile edition of that from Editorial Ekin, Buenos Aires, 1950. (Also published by Tellechea Id√≠goras, San Sebasti√°n, 1969.) Quoted in La idea de Espa√±a entre los vascos de la Edad Moderna, by Jon Arrieta Alberdi, Anales 1997-1998, Real Sociedad Econ√≥mica Valenciana de Amigos del Pa√≠s. Unlike other hidalgos who refused manual work. Literature In literature the hidalgo is usually portrayed as a noble who has lost nearly all of his family's wealth but still held on to the privileges and honours of the nobility. The prototypical fictional hidalgo is Don Quixote, who was given the sobriquet 'the Ingenious Hidalgo' by his creator, Miguel de Cervantes. In the novel Cervantes has Don Quixote satirically present himself as an hidalgo de sangre and aspire to live the life of a knight-errant despite the fact that his economic position does not allow him to truly do so. Don Quixote's possessions allowed to him a meager life devoted to his reading obsession, yet his concept of honour led him to emulate the knights-errant. The picaresque novel Lazarillo features an hidalgo so poor that he spreads breadcrumbs on his clothes, to simulate having eaten a meal. His hidalgo honour forbids him from manual work but does not provide him with subsistence. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Tales of a Wayside Inn includes \\"The Theologian's Tale\\" which recounts the tragedy of Hidalgo who betrays his two daughters to the Grand Inquisitor. Hidalgo himself lights the fires, then from a tower casts himself into the depths of despair.

It is often considered a nodosaurid closely related to Polacanthus. Gastonia has a sacral shield and large shoulder spikes. Discovery and species Mounted cast skull from the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis The type specimen of Gastonia burgei (CEUM 1307) was discovered in a bonebed of the lower Cedar Mountain Formation in Grand County, Utah. The bonebed contained the fossil remains of other Gastonia, as well as an iguanodontid and the type specimen of a large carnivorous theropod, Utahraptor. Gastonia is among the most common dinosaur fossils in the Cedar Mountain Formation.Kirkland, J.I. (1998). A polacanthine ankylosaur (Ornithischia: Dinosauria) from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) of eastern Utah. In: S.G. Lucas, J.I. Kirkland, & J.W. Estep, (eds) Lower and Middle Cretaceous Terrestrial Ecosystems, New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 14: 271-281. Gastonia was formally named and described by James Kirkland in 1998, from the holotype specimen and other fossil material recovered beginning in 1989. The name Gastonia honors US palaeontologist and CEO of Gaston Design Inc. Rob Gaston. The species G. burgei was named for the director of the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum, Donald L. Burge. The notch in the upper beak is one of the distinguishing features of Gastonia Gastonia burgei, was found in rocks of the Cedar Mountain Formation's Yellow Cat Member, which has been dated to the Valanginian, 136 million years ago.Kirkland, J.I. and Madsen, S.K. 2007. The Lower Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation, eastern Utah: the view up an always interesting learning curve. Fieldtrip Guidebook, Geological Society of America, Rocky Mountain Section. 1-108 p. The holotype is CEUM 1307, a skull of an adult individual. Many hundreds of additional disarticulated bones have been uncovered, from the Gaston Quarry and the . In 1998, these included remains of at least five individuals. In 2004, the number of skulls was reported as four,Vickaryous M.K., Marya≈Ñska T., Weishampel D.B., 2004, \\"Ankylosauria\\".

Kirkland, 2014, \\"The Nature of the Jurassic/Cretaceous (J/K) Unconformity and the Early Cretaceous of Eastern Utah\\" In: Jim Kirkland, John Foster, ReBecca Hunt-Foster, Gregory A. Liggett, and Kelli Trujillo (eds), Mid-Mesozoic: the Age of Dinosaurs in Transition, April 30 ‚Äì May 5, 2014 Fruita, Colorado & Green River, Utah p. 62-63 A second species, G. lorriemcwhinneyae, was described from the Ruby Ranch Member in 2016 based on a large bonebed, probably formed when a group died of drought or drowning. All together, more complete material exists for Gastonia than for any other basal ankylosaur. A wealth of disarticulated material from a bonebed presents problems as it can be hard to tell how many spikes a particular Gastonia actually had. In the late twentieth century a skeleton was mounted made of polyurethane casts of skeletal elements of various individuals. Distortions in the fossils were corrected and missing elements completed. This made Gastonia the first basal ankylosaurian dinosaur to have been mounted for display at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, together with the related Gargoyleosaurus. Description Size comparison Gastonia was a medium-sized ankylosaur. In 1998, Kirkland estimated its length at six metres. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul indicated a body length of five metres and a weight of 1.9 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 228 The skeleton mount is 459 centimetres long with a hip height of 112 centimetres. It is difficult to determine distinguishing traits of Gastonia because its affinities are uncertain. However, in 1998 Kirkland established three characters which were unique for the Ankylosauria as a whole and thus likely autapomorphies, unique derived traits. On the midline of the front snout, the bony core of the upper horny beak, a broad, gradually curved, notch is present between the snout bones, the praemaxillae. The bony nostrils are placed far to the rear. At the underside of the braincase, the basisphenoid, the basipterygoid processes are longitudinally stretched. Restoration of G. burgei Gastonia had a flat and, even for an anylosaurian, very broad rump, the belly strongly protruding between the short powerful limbs. The tail was moderately long and lacked a tail club. The neck was relatively long and the skull probably rather small. The skull is somewhat elongated and pointy, measuring 295 by 283 millimetres in the holotype. The top profile of the skull is convex, the rear skull roof curving below the level of the upper rim of the eye sockets. The quadrate is very strongly inclined to the rear. The occipital condyle, the contact with the neck, is obliquely pointing to below, an ankylosaurid trait causing the head to be pointing downwards. The beak is toothless. The tooth rows of the maxillae are rather straight and each consist of fifteen to sixteen small teeth, lacking a true cingulum, swollen basis. There is no armour on the snout. More to behind, the bony tiles of the skull roof, the caputegulae, are rather indistinctively patterned though a small central plate on the parietal bones is visible. The squamosal horns, at the rear skull corners, and jugal horns, at the cheeks, are small. The sacrum consists of three sacral vertebrae, with a caudo-sacral vertebra behind them. Stiffened rear tail vertebrae or a tail club are absent. The shoulder blade resembles that of nodosaurids in possessing an acromion that is blade-like, but differs in the acromion originating from the front edge, not the outer side of the scapula, not being wrapped to behind and not ending in a knob. It is thus not a typical nodosaurid \\"pseudoacromion\\". The coracoid is square in form, a typical ankylosaurid trait. The humerus has a large deltopectoral crest extending downwards to the middle of the shaft, a derived trait. The ulna is very robust with an enormous olecranon. The shinbone is very expanded at both the upper and lower end. Osteoderms Gastonia was protected by osteoderms, skin ossifications. The neck was covered by at least two bone rings. Usually in ankylosaurs these have the form of \\"halfrings\\" leaving the underside unprotected, but with Gastonia only two segments seem present, one at each side of the midline, causing Kirkland to refer to them as \\"quarter rings\\". Each segment had a pointed keel and a hollow underside. Kirkland stressed that the rump armour was hard to reconstruct because it had not been found in articulation. The sides of the thorax seem to have been covered by about five pairs of large flat triangular spikes. They are recurved and have a deep groove in the rear side. They gradually decline in length to behind, the groove becoming relatively shorter and the base length increasing. According to Kirkland the function of the groove was to receive the front edge of the next spike. Other large flat spikes found, lacked the groove. They were often very curved, the point at a right angle with the base. Kirkland assumed these formed two vertical rows, one at each side of the rump midline. Lower triangular spikes he placed at the sides of the tail, again gradually decreasing to the rear. In between the horizontal and vertical spikes of the rump probably rows of osteoderms were present having the profile of a droplet, with a vertical point at the broader end. The top of the tail had oval plates. The hip region was covered by a large pelvic shield consisting of fused osteoderms. These were patterned as rosettes with a larger plate in the middle, surrounded by at least two rings of smaller plates. Kirkland assumed that four pairs of triangular spikes covered the sides of the pelvic shield also, but this was denied by Paul. The area between all these larger elements was covered by small ossicles, round bony scutes with a diameter of up to two centimetres, hundreds of which have been discovered. G. lorriemcwhinneyae differs from G. burgei in having a flat skull roof, shorter and narrower paroccipital processes, a postacetabular process that is only 36% the length of the preacetabular process, and an ischium that has an unkinked, smooth bottom edge. Phylogeny Skeleton at Wyoming Dinosaur Center Kirkland in 1998 placed Gastonia in the Ankylosauridae, more precisely the Polacanthinae. Later, polacanthines were often seen as Nodosauridae. However, in 2014 an analysis by Victoria Megan Arbour recovered Gastonia as a non-polacanthine basal member of the Ankylosauridae.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014. Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs. Ph.D thesis, University of Alberta Paleobiology Skeletons at the North American Museum of Ancient Life with alternate spike arrangement Gastonia lived in a partly wooded habitat, with riverine forests being separated by open areas. The climate was rather dry with a short wet season. Other dinosaurs of the Yellow Cat include the Euornithopoda Hippodraco, Cedrorestes and Iguanacolossus; the sauropod Cedarosaurus and the Theropoda Falcarius, Geminiraptor, Martharaptor, Nedcolbertia, Utahraptor and Yurgovuchia. Gastonia was the only ankylosaurian present and one of the most common species of its fauna. Gastonia compared to the fauna of the Yellow Cat Member from the Cedar Mountain Formation (Gastonia in pale yellow) Kirkland suggested that Gastonia could have been so abundant because its armour effectively protected it against the apex predator of its habitat, the giant dromaeosaurid Utahraptor, remains of which have been found in the original Gastonia quarry. Gastonia would have shown a typical polacanthine defence, which Kirkland understood to have consisted of a combination of passive protection offered by the vertical spikes and active protection by hitting a predator with the horizontal spikes of the flexible tail. The armour would also have served intraspecific antagonistic behaviour, i.e. fighting between males. The vertical spikes could have intimidated rivals and animals could have determined who was the strongest by ramming their heads together. Kirkland proposed that the typical ankylosaurid down-turned head, made possible by a more ventrally directed occipital condyle compared to nodosaurids, and an increased loosening of the rear skull elements to absorb shocks, were adaptations to this kind of behaviour. Ankylosaurs are often assumed to have been solitary living animals because their short legs seem poorly adapted to the trekking behaviour of herds, but the concentration of Gastonia fossils seems to contradict this.

Robert John Duffy (born August 21, 1954) is an American politician who served as Lieutenant Governor of New York from 2011 to 2014. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 65th Mayor of Rochester, New York from 2006 to 2010. Earlier in his career, Duffy worked as a police officer in Rochester, rising to the positions of Deputy Chief (1992‚Äì1998) and Chief (1998‚Äì2005). He was elected mayor of the city in November 2005, took office on January 1, 2006 and was reelected in 2009 (unopposed) for a term scheduled to end in 2013. In May 2010, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo selected Duffy as his running mate in the race for Governor.Gershman, Jacob. Cuomo Picks Rochester Mayor as Running Mate The Wall Street Journal. 26 May 2010. Cuomo and Duffy were elected in November 2010 for a four-year term beginning January 1, 2011. Duffy chose not to run for reelection in 2014, and instead became the President and CEO of the Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce. Early life and education Duffy was born to Catherine Cuddihy and Cornelius Duffy and raised in Rochester. He attended Holy Rosary Catholic grammar school, and graduated from the Aquinas Institute in 1972. He went on to earn an associate degree in Recreational Leadership from Monroe Community College in 1975, and another associate degree in Criminal Justice from the same school in 1988. He also earned a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1993 and a Master of Public Administration from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1998. Law enforcement career Duffy joined the Rochester Police Department in 1976 and rose to sergeant in 1985 and lieutenant in 1989, serving in several patrol units, the Tactical Unit, the Field Inspection Section, and the Criminal Investigation Section. He was promoted to captain in January 1992 and deputy chief of operations five months later. He was sworn in as the chief of police in 1998 after his predecessor, Robert Warshaw, was appointed Associate Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mayor of Rochester=Campaign After William A. Johnson, Jr. announced his retirement, Duffy debated whether to become a candidate for the mayor's office which would have (and did) pit him against the Democratic favorite and city councilman, Wade S. Norwood. Johnson threatened to fire Duffy if he ran for office. Assemblyman Joseph Morelle called on Duffy to definitively announce or forgo his candidacy or risk running afoul of the state election law prohibiting police officers from soliciting funds for political purposes. Duffy retired as Chief to run in the Democratic Primary for Mayor in 2005. Administration During the opening months of his administration, Mayor Duffy closed down the fast ferry service across Lake Ontario between Toronto and Rochester. In December 2009 Duffy proposed to abolish the Rochester Board of Education and placing governance of the city's public school system directly under the mayor and city council, a system similar to the school governance structure in New York City, Chicago, and Cleveland. Opinion polls taken during 2010 indicated that a majority was in favor of the idea. The plan is still on the table and awaiting approval by the State Legislature a year after it was originally proposed.McLendon, Gary. Mayor Robert Duffy welcomes ideas on schools. Democrat and Chronicle. 5 May 2010. Lieutenant Governor of New York In May 2010, Duffy was picked by Cuomo to be the lieutenant gubernatorial nominee. They won on November 2, 2010 with 62% of the vote. Cuomo subsequently named Duffy director of his transition team. On May 8, 2014, Duffy announced he would not seek re-election as Lieutenant Governor, citing health and family reasons. At the end of his term, he was hired as the President and CEO of the Rochester Business Alliance (now the Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce). Personal life He married his wife, Barbara, in 1986, and raised two daughters, Erin and Shannon. One of Duffy's hobbies is running ‚Äì he has run in the New York City Marathon.

The taxon is further characterized by a narrow rostrum (in dorsal view), the presence of seven conical teeth in each premaxilla, an incomplete osseous nasal septum, a linearly arranged nasal cavity, the absence of an osseus secondary palate, and, as regards osteoderms, two sets of co-ossified cervical plates and a number of elongate conical spines. A very unusual feature is the sagittal (midline) osteoderm on the first set of cervical plates; in most other ankylosaurs, these osteoderms are bilateral, i.e. paired with one on each side of the midline.

Life Alvarus was born at Saln√©s, Galicia. He studied Canon law at Bologna, but in 1304 resigned his benefices, and entered the Franciscan Order. He is said to have been a pupil of Duns Scotus and to have been tutor to the children of Don Pedro, Regent of Portugal. Certain it is that he became penitentiary to Pope John XXII at Avignon, that he enjoyed much favour with this pontiff, and was employed by him to refute the claims of the antipope Pietro Rainalducci of Corbario. In 1333 Alvarus became titular Bishop of Coron in Achaia, and two years later was appointed to the See of Sylves in Portugal. He also served as Apostolic nuncio in Portugal, but was not created cardinal, as some writers have asserted. He died in Seville, where he was buried in the Monastery of St. Clare. Works Alvarus is chiefly remarkable for his work De planctu ecclesiae libri duo. This work, begun at Avignon in 1330, completed in 1332, corrected in 1335 and again in 1340 at Compostela, is notable not only for its extreme defence of ecclesiastical rights but still more, perhaps, for the freedom and force with which the author assails and rebukes the ecclesiastical abuses of his time. Alvarus has been reproached by St. Antoninus and others with having too far favoured the error of the Fraticelli about poverty, but, as Sbaralea shows, it is not difficult to justify him against this charge. On the then agitated question of poverty in the Franciscan Order he wrote with less passion and with more weight than Ubertino da Casale, although he addressed almost the same reproaches as the latter to the relaxed friars within the order. The De planctu was first published at Ulm in 1474. This edition is very rare, and is not free from error. Later editions appeared at Venice (1500) and at Lyons (1517). Besides the \\"De planctu\\", Wadding attributed to Alvarus the following: \\"Collyrium adversus haereses\\"; \\"Speculum regum\\" (one book); \\"Super sentent. libros 4\\"; \\"Apologia contra Marsilum Patav. et Guliel. Ocham\\"; and other unedited works.

He was a faithful Catholic and thus a supporter of the Hungarian Crown, but not very popular in Bosnia ‚Äì as he turned away from his father's policies and persecuted the Bogumils. He was the last member of the House of Kuliniƒá.  Reign  The Bosnian Church spread greatly across Bosnia and even further, throughout Croatia, southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary and the Seaside and even went as far as Northern Italy and southern France during his reign. It became very illfamed in Rome and Buda ‚Äì in the first because of its heretical teachings and opposings of the Roman Catholic Church, and in the latter because of its political influence amongst the Bosnians in Bosnia ‚Äì which was a Hungarian vassalage. Stjepan's Bosnia was thus characterized as being half-Barbaric. Furious because of this, Pope Honorius III dispatched in 1221 his legate, Aconcius, to Bosnia, to determinate the status of the Bosnian heresy. Aconcius said that the Bogumils spread Bogumilism over there just as younglings are being breast-fed. The Pope complained to the Hungarian King Andrews and the Hungarian Bishoprics to destroy the Bosnian Bogomils, calling for a crusade against Bosnia. King Andrews was fighting inner conflicts, so he could not heed the Papacy's callings. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kaloƒçki, wanted to lead the Crusade against Bosnia if the Pope promised that Bosnia would be ecclesiastically subjected to him; and so the Pope asked him to keep his promise in 1225. That year by Pope's edict Bosnia, Soli and Usora was transferred to Bishop Ugrin of Kalocs' suzeiranity from the coastal Dalmatian bishoprics. The Archbishop negotiated with the ruler of Srem to launch a joint operation in Bosnia. The Archbishop dispatched John Angelo of Srem, the nephew of the Hungarian King and a Byzantine emigrant to lead a military attempt into Bosnia. It is because of these anti-Bogumil activities Stjepan was deposed by the Bogumils in 1232, when a disorder caught Hungary. His throne was seized by Matej Ninoslav. He retired to his son, Sibislav, who ruled as Prince of Usora. There he died in 1236.

He was probably the founder of the House of Kotromaniƒá.  Biography = From Christianity to Heresy and backwards  Prijezda was originally a Roman Catholic Christian, but he converted to Bogomilism later on. According to the Pope's letter to Ban Matej Ninoslav, he converted back to Catholicism during Matej's reign. As he could not be trusted because of his previous conversion, he was forced to send his son as a guarantee to the Dominican Order. Ban Matej Ninoslav had to beg even to Rome itself for the release of Prijezda's son, Prijezda II, guaranteeing that they are none other than faithful Catholics - but the pleas reached deaf ears.  Reign during the Crusade  During the Crusades in Bosnia (1234‚Äì1239) against Matej Ninoslav Herzeg Coloman commanding the Christian Armies conquered most of Bosnia and temporarily pushed Matej and his forces. He gave the title of Bosnian Ban to Prijezda, who was Ninoslav's closest living relative. Prijezda ruled for only two years, because Matej managed to restore control over most of Bosnia after the Hungarian defeat in the face of the Tartars. As Prijezda was in mortal danger, he fled to Hungary.  Ban  After the death of Matej Ninoslav in 1250, the question of power over Bosnia was initiated. Ninoslav's sons fought valiantly to keep Bosnia independent, but eventually King B√©la IV of Hungary martially subjected Bosnia and made Prijezda its Ban, who vouched to rule in Hungary's name. After he became Ban, Prijezda started a campaign to exterminate the Bosnian Church's heresy in Bosnia. Due to his ruthless fight against the Bogumils, the Pope ordered the Dominicans to return him his son as it appeared that Prijezda became a pious Catholic. On 11 November 1253 Hungarian King Bela wrote how he fiercely fought against the Bosnian heretics with his armies. After that, King Bela partitioned the Bosnian banate in a way that Prijezda was given Bosnia proper, the area between the valleys of the rivers of Vrbas and Bosna, as his hereditary demesne. Usora and Soli on the other hand were made separate banates ruled by Bans named by the King - Rostislav, B√©la, Michael - later subjected to the Banate of Macs√≥, which had been raised to a Dukedom. Eventually, Bosnia itself was subjected to the Duchy of Macs√≥. Because of his heroic fights, Prijezda received the title \\"Fidelis Noster\\" (\\"Our Faithful\\") from the Hungarian King, as well as several lands outside Bosnia, around Gornji Miholjac. King Bela IV of Hungary attacked the Serb Kingdom of Rascia of King Stefan Uro≈° I and conquered Zahumlje in 1254 which it gave to Prijezda's Bosnia, but the eventual peace between Hungary and the Serbs returned it to Rascia. In 1255 the Hungarian King granted new lands to the Bosnian Ban in Slavonia. Prijezda had to dispatch Bosnian forces in 1260 to fight in the Hungarian Army against the Bohemian King. In 1270, King Bela IV died. He was succeeded by his son Stephen V. The powerful Duke of Macs√≥ was killed a war in 1272. The same year King Stephen V died. The Hungarian throne was succeeded by his son Ladislaus IV. He was too young to rule, so his Cuman mother Elizabeth acted as regent. During these changing times for the power in Hungary Prijezda's power dropped severely. Not only did several Hungarian nobles, including Ugrin of Severin, Hungary's treasure-holder included Bosnia in their titles, but a certain Bosnian nobleman Stephen appeared in Bosnia with high influence and prestige; greatly surpassing that of Prijezda. In 1284, Prijezda arranged a marriage between the Serbian Princess Jelisaveta, daughter of the King of Syrmia, Stefan Dragutin, and his son Stephen I Kotromaniƒá in an attempt to forge an ever-lasting alliance with Dragutin. Prijezda was forced to withdraw from the throne in 1287 due to his old age. He spent his last hours on his estate in Zemljenik.

The company was founded in January 1997 by amateur drivers and engineers Mick Hyde and Phil Abbott, who built open cockpit sportscars which could be registered for road use and run on a track without modification. Radical produce a mix of purpose built race cars as well as road legal sports cars in varying specifications. The most popular racecar produced to date is the Radical SR3 with the V6 RXC being their most numerous road legal sportcar. History Rollcentre Racing's Radical SR9 at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans. The company's first car, the Radical 1100 Clubsport, was based on a Kawasaki motorcycle engine placed inside a small open-cockpit chassis. The cars were intended to run in the 750 Motor Club's races under the Sports 2000 category, with founders Abbott and Hyde driving. In 1999, Radical had built enough 1100 Clubsports that they decided to create a one-make series based around the car. Backed by the British Racing and Sports Car Club, the series featured identical cars that were open to anyone who owned an 1100 Clubsport. The same year, Radical debuted their second model, the Prosport. Available with Kawasaki or Suzuki engine up to 1500 cc in displacement, the Prosports were even more powerful and faster than the Clubsports, and included F3-size slick tyres and an adjustable rear wing. The cars were also brought to the United States for the first time, for use in the SCCA D-Sport class in 2000. Launced in 2001, RADICAL SR3 XX Information Pack (pdf) Radical's next creation was the two-seater SR3, a car which could compete in international racing, such as the FIA's C3 class. The car uses a Suzuki-based engine tuned by Powertec (now RPE) which offered 1300 cc or 1500 cc versions and a maximum of in the latter. A six-speed sequential gearbox was developed specifically for the car to improve performance. The SR3 could also be made road legal in the United Kingdom with the addition of indicators, a hand brake, a catalytic converter, and road legal tyres. In 2006, Radical would make its largest leap into international motorsport with the development of the SR9, a complete Le Mans prototype in the LMP2 class. Official partner Rollcentre Racing would debut the car with success in the Le Mans Series and 24 Hours of Le Mans, and SR9s in the hands of independent teams would contest the 24 Hours of Le Mans a further four times. Current models The Radical model range has seven different models, all of which can be converted to street use in certain countries. Various options, most notably in the powerplants, are available on all of the cars. SR1 Unlike its previous incarnations, the Radical SR1 Cup forms its own racing series. The SR1 Cup is a club, owner-driven racing series that combines competition with training. Combining exceptional performance and handling with LMP styling and low cost of ownership, the SR1 is priced at ¬£44,500 + VAT. It is powered by an advanced 182 horsepower RPE-Suzuki four-cylinder engine capable of propelling the car 0‚Äì60 in 3.5 seconds and eventually to a speed of 138 miles per hour. It is capable of 2.3 gs of lateral acceleration. SR3 An SR3 at Spa in 2009. The most popular Radical model, over 1,000 SR3 have been built. The car is built on a carbon-steel spaceframe chassis, and uses an RPE-tuned Suzuki Generation 3 4-cylinder, 1500cc DOHC motorcycle engine for power. It produces 225 horsepower (168 kW) at the wheels and can get the SR3 RSX to in just 3.1 seconds and on to .  SR8  The Radical SR8 Based on the SR3, the SR8 is a more extreme version intended for track use but can be registered for the road. The SR8 also features one of the largest engines Radical has ever put in their cars, with the 2700 cc RPE RPX V8 constructed by combining elements of Suzuki inline-4s, and producing 430 horsepower (321 kW). A further variant, known as the SR8LM, increased the engine to 2800 cc and brought power output to . In August 2009 Michael Vergers, driving an SR8LM, set the new lap record (6 minutes, 48 seconds) for a road legal production car at the N√ºrburgring Nordschleife circuit. This record was beaten by the 991 generation Porsche 911 GT2 in September 2017 with a time of 6:47.25. The SR8 has the most impressive specifications of any Radical model, bar the RXC Turbo, Turbo 500 and the race cars. It is capable of 0‚Äì60 in 2.7 seconds, 178 miles per hour, and a 2.5 g's of lateral acceleration. One SR8 was converted into an electric car by a team of students Racing Green Endurance from Imperial College London to drive the full length of the Pan-American Highway in May 2010. The project aims to challenge commonly held perceptions surrounding electric vehicles performance and range. The TMG EV P001 is a road-legal electric sports car by Toyota Motorsport GmbH, based on a modified Radical SR8 chassis. RXC V6 The RXC is a midrange track car between the SR3 and SR8. It is street legal in most countries. It is currently the only closed-top Radical track car level. It is propelled by a Ford Cyclone 3.7 Ti- VCT V6 producing 380 hp and 320 lb-ft torque. The base version is capable of 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds and reaches 175 miles per hour. At its top speed, the RXC produces 900 kg of downforce, equaling its curb weight. A turbocharged version is also available, called the RXC Turbo 500. It produces 530 hp and 481 lb-ft torque. Top speed is estimated to be 185 mph, with zero to sixty acceleration estimated at 2.4 seconds. Production of the RXC began in late 2013 at ¬£111,689. RXC Spyder The RXC Spyder is the open top variant of the RXC V8. The standard engine is an RPE 3000cc V8 producing 440 horsepower and the engines maximum power is achieved at 10,500 rpm. The car is built with a seven-speed sequential transmission with paddle shifters fitted as standard, and the car features advanced aerodynamics and styling cues taken from the SR9 LMP2 project. It has a carbon-steel spaceframe based on those of the RXC V8 and the SR9 LMP2. It is capable of 0‚Äì60 in 3 seconds and 178 miles per hour.  RXC V8  The RXC V8 is a track day car that is also used in top tier motorsport. It is powered by the same 3-liter V8 as the RXC Spyder. Motorsport=One-make series Although Radical began by competing in existing events, it was Radical's creation of their own series that have been the choice of competition for most owners. Radical currently backs four international series, while a further six series have been created on the national level. The Radical European Masters series has featured an FIA accredited format since 2012 with three 60-minute races per weekend. The winner of this championship has a chance to race in the Rolex 24 in a DPI car, as part of the Sunoco Daytona Challenge. The series is open to SR3 RS in the supersport class and the SR8 RX and RXC Spyder models. The seven round Radical Challenge championship also runs within the MSVR package, with each meeting featuring two 15-minute qualifying sessions and a pair of 20-minute sprint races, and a 40-minute endurance race with the opportunity for one or two drivers per car. Teams are limited to one set of tyres per weekend, limiting costs and levelling competition. The Radical SR1 Cup is Open to drivers who have either never held a race licence before, or are still eligible to wear a novice cross on the rear of the car (meaning they have competed in less than six races), the SR1 Cup will lead the drivers through the process of getting on the grid, with a detailed programme of driver training and technical tuition. In the UK there are also two other main championships open to radical cars. The Open Sportscar Series can accept almost any radical car whilst the Radical Owners Club Bikesports Championship can accommodate cars fitted with bike engines such as the SR1,SR3 and PR6. Around the world there are numerous Radical single-marque racing championships, running to regulations that broadly mirror those of Radical UK and European racing series. In North America, there are the following primary series: *Radical North American Masters Championship that visits 7 circuits all around the USA & 1 circuit in Canada. * Radical Canada Cup that visits several tracks in eastern Canada as well as a single trip to a US track. Australia also have a very popular series that supports the Bathurst 12 hours among others that caters to Radical SR3 cars. The 2018 Radical Australia Cup was won by Kim Burke.Daniel Herrero, SHANNONS NATIONALS: Denyer/D‚ÄôAlberto win Sydney Four Hour, www.speedcafe.com Retrieved 12 March 2019 Le Mans In the second quarter of 2005, the company announced its plans to race in the LMP2 class of the Le Mans Series with their new SR9. The British Rollcentre Racing team would run the first chassis using Judd power before being joined later in the season by a factory team, known as Team Bruichladdich Radical, who used the AER powerplant. Both teams would score their only points of the season at N√ºrburgring, with Rollcentre taking third in LMP2 and Radical finishing in fifth. Team Bruichladdich, now Greaves Motorsport, came third in Valencia. Rollcentre would also run the company's first entry in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Although the car finished in a distant 20th place, the car was able to prove its reliability by being able to finish the race only months after being completed. The Team Bruichladdich Radical squad also flew to the United States for the final round to of the American Le Mans Series, where Radical Chairman, Tim Greaves raced with his own Team Bruichladdich whilst supporting Van de Steur Racing in the third SR9 completed. Tim Greaves owns all the rights to the Radical SR9 and the spares moulds and designs. For 2007, Rollcentre sold their SR9 as they moved onto a new LMP1 Pescarolo. Embassy Racing purchased the car and continued running it in the Le Mans Series alongside the factory Radical, while Van der Steur would run a partial schedule in the American Le Mans Series. For 2008, Italian team World Racing Cars purchased the Judd- powered SR9 from Embassy with Swiss team Race Performance contesting the 2010 event. British Formula Ford Radical Sportscars made its debut as a race team in the 2013 British Formula Ford season. Radical signed longtime Radical sportscar racer James Abbott to represent the brand in Formula Ford. In the new for 2013 Ford EcoBoost powered Radical chose for the new Sinter LA12 chassis produced by Fluid Motorsports. Former Formula Ford racer Robbie Kerr joined the team as a driver coach for James Abbott. After three rounds, with little success, Radical decided to replace the Sinter with a Mygale M13-SJ. While JTR's Dan Cammish dominated the season, Radical had a reasonable season. After switching to Mygale the results improved, finishing with two third-place finishes in the last three races at Brands Hatch.

He is best known for his 1977 song \\"The King Is Gone\\", a tribute to Elvis Presley, who had recently died. From that single onward, McDowell charted more than thirty Top 40 hits on the Billboard country music charts, though he never experienced further pop success after \\"The King is Gone.\\" Two of his singles ‚Äì \\"Older Women\\" and \\"You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation\\" ‚Äî reached Number One on the country charts, while eleven more reached Top Ten. He has also released more than twenty studio albums, and has been signed to Curb Records since 1986. U.S. Navy McDowell served in the US Navy from 1968-72. He served on board the USS Hancock and USS Kitty Hawk. Career Following the death of Elvis Presley in 1977, McDowell, a devoted fan of Presley‚Äôs, recorded a song that became his first country and only pop hit with his self-penned tribute song \\"The King Is Gone,\\" which he recorded on the independent Scorpion record label. The record took off immediately, gaining airplay on country and pop radio stations across the United States and around the world. It peaked at number thirteen on Billboard's Hot 100 singles, and became a gold record. In January 1978, McDowell performed the song on the NBC special Nashville Remembers Elvis on His Birthday, in which he appeared alongside a number of Presley's contemporaries. To date, \\"The King Is Gone\\" has sold more than 5 million copies. McDowell was commissioned to cover a number of Elvis' songs for the soundtrack to 1979 made-for-TV Presley biography film Elvis, during which Kurt Russell, portraying Presley, lip- synched to McDowell's vocals. He actually recorded 36 songs, but not all of them were used in the film. McDowell also sang the Elvis vocals for the 1981 TV movie Elvis and the Beauty Queen and for the 1988 TV miniseries Elvis and Me. All of the Elvis vocals for the 1990 TV series Elvis were performed by McDowell. McDowell also contributed to the 1997 Showtime special, Elvis Meets Nixon. He scored a second hit for the Scorpion label entitled \\"I Love You, I Love You, I Love You\\" before being signed by CBS Records Epic in 1979. McDowell charted a string of hit singles and albums for Epic between 1979 and 1986. Every single release, except one, became a Top 10 hit, including \\"Older Women\\" and \\"You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation\\". Other hits during his Epic years included \\"Watching Girls Go By\\", \\"Personally\\", \\"You Made A Wanted Man Of Me\\", \\"Wandering Eyes\\", \\"All Tied Up\\", and \\"In a New York Minute\\". Moving to Curb Records in 1986, McDowell scored a Top 10 hit with \\"It's Only Make Believe\\", a duet with Conway Twitty on what had been Twitty's breakthrough rock and roll hit in 1958. Initially a member of McDowell's back-up band would substitute for Twitty during live performances. Recently, however, McDowell has performed the song live with Twitty's prerecorded voice, followed by a solo from a member of the back-up band. In 1988, he teamed with Jerry Lee Lewis for a duet that McDowell wrote, entitled \\"You're Never Too Old To Rock N' Roll\\". He recorded yet another Top 10 hit with his cover version of the pop standard \\"Unchained Melody,\\" which also became a No. 1 country music video. He started appearing in larger venues and touring before headlining his own shows. In 2002, McDowell recorded two albums for Curb Records, one consisting of beach music with Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters, Ronnie McDowell with Bill Pinkney's Original Drifters. The second project, a country album, entitled Ronnie McDowell Country, a collection of six new McDowell penned songs and a few country standards. In January 2017 McDowell collaborated with Richard Lynch on a military tribute duet \\"Love Tattoo\\". On January 17, 2018 he unveiled \\"The Magic Moment\\" , his original painting of Elvis Presley getting his first guitar at the Tupelo Hardware Store in Tupelo MS, thus kicking off the pilot for his forthcoming TV show, entitled \\"Ronnie McDowell Painting America,\\" Personal life Ronnie McDowell resides in Hendersonville, Tennessee. He has five children. His son, Tyler Dean, is also signed to Curb Records. Another son, Ronnie Jr. and a nephew, Chris, recorded in a band called Six Shooter on Curb in 1991.

The film barely broke even at the box office, grossing $31,387,164 in the US. The film was directed by Steve Rash.  Plot The New York Knicks are also-rans in the NBA, their roster filled with players who either lack talent or are too distracted by off-the-court issues. Nonetheless, limousine driver and rabid fan Edwina \\"Eddie\\" Franklin (Whoopi Goldberg) attends every Knicks game in the nosebleed section of Madison Square Garden. During halftime of a game, Eddie is one of three fans picked to win a chance to be the honorary assistant coach of the Knicks for the second half by sinking a free throw, which she does. She quickly gets on the nerves of head coach John Bailey (Dennis Farina), whom she had heckled earlier. Eddie is eventually charged with a technical foul for stepping onto the court during an argument between Bailey and a referee, and she is ejected from the Garden, to the fans' dismay. Eddie's popularity piques the interest of the new Knicks owner, \\"Wild Bill\\" Burgess (Frank Langella). After he forces Bailey to quit, Burgess names Eddie the new head coach. The decision is received with skepticism and derision. However, she eventually is able to connect with the players both off and on the court to earn their respect. Eddie is able to lead the Knicks into championship contention; the winner of their game against the Charlotte Hornets, now coached by Bailey, will receive the final spot in the NBA playoffs. The night before the game, Burgess tells Eddie that if the Knicks win this game, he plans to sell the team to someone who intends to move the team to St. Louis. A conflicted Eddie must decide what to do when the Knicks take a one-point lead with just a few seconds to play. Realizing the consequences, she stops the game to announce Burgess's plan to the crowd at the Garden. Faced with the possible enormous backlash from the Knicks' fans, Burgess promises the crowd he won't sell the team or move them out of New York City. When play resumes, the Hornets have one last chance to win, but Larry Johnson commits a charge on the game-winning layup, nullifying the basket and giving the Knicks the victory and the playoff berth.

The line then passed] on nationalisation in 1948. It was renamed Aber Halt on 6 May 1968, then Aber on 5 May 1969. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. Another station also called Beddau Halt existed on the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway and should not be confused with this station. The 'Junction' suffix refers to the fact that until the early 1980s, there were two junctions near here - one to the south between the current line via Caerphilly (which opened in 1871) and the original route down the Big Hill via Penrhos Junction to Walnut Tree Junction near on the Taff Vale Railway route from Cardiff to and another to the north for the branch line to Senghenydd. The former opened in 1858 and provided the Rhymney company with its original access to Cardiff General and the docks. It was freight-only for most of its life, but was heavily used in post-grouping and BR days by coal trains originating from the various collieries on the Rhymney line heading to the marshalling yard at . This avoided the need for such trains to use the busy section through , even though the 3¬Ω mile line was steeply graded (hence the nickname - the 1 in 48 ruling gradient was however favourable for loaded trains). The latter opened in 1894 and was used for both freight (to Windsor Colliery near the terminus) and passenger services. The Senghenydd branch passenger service ended in June 1964 as a result of the Beeching Axe, but it remained in use for colliery traffic until 1977Senghennyd - The Town, The Colliery, The Disasters And More www.MW0GKX.co.uk; Retrieved 2013-09-12 whilst the Taffs Well route closed in June 1982 \\\\- both have since been dismantled.

Arriva Trains Wales History The first Caerphilly station was on the now-disappeared Taffs Well to Ystrad line. It opened in 1858 and closed in 1871 when the current railway alignment and station opened. The first station was around 250 meters from the current Aber station but on a completely different alignment. The current station was built in 1871 as part of the Rhymney Railway. It ended up as a four way junction: *To the west at Penrhos junction (on the line from Junction to Walnut Tree Junction) with the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway *To the east through a tunnel to a junction with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway at Machen, and onwards to Newport Docks As a result of traffic volume, the station was rebuilt in 1913 to four platforms and a west facing bay platform. Present form The station in 1990 With the closure of both junctions, and the simplification of the railway to a pure through service as part of the Rhymney Line, the station was rebuilt to a two platform with bus interchange in 1970. The signalling system is currently set up to allow northbound services to terminate in the southbound platform (using a facing crossover) & return directly to Cardiff if required, although this facility is only used during the evenings in the current (May 2013) timetable.

Its practitioners are a modern form of rag and bone men that visit residences door-to-door.Brown A. Singapore English in a Nutshell: An Alphabetical Description of Its Features. Federal Publications, 1999. page 121. They can either walk along corridors (if that particular HDB estate has a covered carpark) or for certain HDB estates where the carpark is right under the HDB blocks, walk through the carpark downstairs honking a horn. However, around landed properties, they may drive around in a lorry with a horn attached to it, instead of going door-to-door. They make visits in carts, collecting old newspapers and other unwanted items. These will be resold at specialized markets and eventually recycled or reused. \\"Karang guni\\" is a Malay phrase for gunny sack, which was used in the past to hold the newspapers. The Karang guni men would haul the heavy sacks on their backs as they walked their rounds to do the collection. Today, most of them use a hand truck instead. These people can be distinguished by their use of horns or (rarely) hand bell and shouts of \\"karang guni, poh zhua gu sa kor, pai leh-lio, dian si ki...\\" (\\"Rag and bone, newspapers and old clothes, spoilt radios, televisions\\" in Singlish and Hokkien) when making their rounds. Depending on the person, a nominal fee is paid for the quantity of newspapers or unwanted items sold. The karang guni industry is made highly profitable due to the dense urban nature of Singapore, where hundreds of public housing Housing Development Board apartment units are located in one block, with often a dozen blocks in each housing estate. This gives the karang guni men large access to sources of scrap. There are reported stories of rag-to-riches, karang guni men who have become millionaires just from the karang guni business. Today, however, competition is usually too great. Second-hand items in good condition bought by the karang guni men are usually resold in flea markets such as Sungei Road, though in recent times some have begun listing items additionally on online auctions. Because karang guni men are motivated by the resale value of these materials on the market, there are also reported cases where some collectors have been selective in what to receive from households, even though they may be still recyclable or reusable. At the beginning of the 21st century, karung guni men are facing competition from government recycling initiatives and charities that directly collect from residents material to be recycled. A few karang guni men have been prosecuted for attempting to steal scrap material from the green recycling bags placed outside housing units for collection.

He became a running star as the sport enjoyed a huge resurgence at the start of the Great Depression, fueled in large part by newsreel coverage. His career was abruptly cut short when he was banned for life from track for payments he received for several races. Early running career Ladoum√®gue was born at La Bastide, Bordeaux. He made his first impression in the track world by finishing third in the 1926 French 5000 m championship while still a teenager. Later that year, he improved his 5000 m time with a 15:11 3/5 run against Great Britain, finishing the year ranked 20th in the event. Despite his success, Ladoum√®gue was discouraged by a French track expert who said his long strides were not suited for long distances, so he moved down to the 1500 m in 1927. However, he did not find much success that year, running a best of only 4:03.6 and finishing sixth in the French championships. In 1928, he started to run for Stade Fran√ßais under famed coach Charles Poulenard, and his improvement was dramatic. On 3 June, Ladoum√®gue ran 3:58.0, then 3:55.2 a week later. Two weeks after that, he ran 15:03.2 over 5000 m. Then, on 1 July, won the Paris championships in 3:54.6, followed by a victory in the French championships in 3:52.2. The latter time ranked Ladoum√®gue as third-fastest all-time over the distance and a favourite at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. 1928 Olympics The Olympic 1500 m final was held on 2 August. In the end, the battle came down to a race between Ladoum√®gue and two Finnish runners: Eino Purje and Harri Larva. Larva and Purje exchanged leads early on, with Ladoum√®gue in the pack behind. After 800 m, Ladoum√®gue chased down the leading Finns and on the backstretch of the final lap, took the lead from Purje. As Purje faded, Larva pursued Ladoum√®gue. Into the homestretch, Larva pulled even, but Ladoum√®gue held his ground. Then, with 20 meters remaining, Larva pulled ahead. Ladoum√®gue, seeing it was hopeless, eased up and finished second. World records Jules Ladoum√®gue in 1930 Stung by criticism that he lacked the kick to win close races after his Olympic disappointment, Ladoum√®gue sought to prove the experts wrong. Accordingly, he ran in several races in 1929 where he allowed the pace to slow, waiting for the homestretch to drive for the finish. But when he tried that strategy against Cyril Ellis on 28 July at Colombes, France, Ellis defeated him 4:04 to 4:04.2. Ladoum√®gue suffered the same result a week later in Berlin against his Olympic rival Larva. By 1930, however, it was clear that Ladoum√®gue could win a race in any manner he chose. On 13 July he ran 3:53.8, then he avenged the humiliation he received the year before from Ellis by defeating him over the mile 4:15.2 to 4:20.2 in London on 2 August. Reg Thomas was second at 4:17.2. A series of races followed, including a convincing defeat of 1500 m record-holder Otto Peltzer 3:53.7 to 3:59.0. Ladoum√®gue now felt ready to attempt to break Peltzer's 3:51.0 world record. The attempt was made 3 October on the 450-metre track at Stade Jean Bouin, near Ladoum√®gue's home in Paris. He aimed for 500-metre split times of 1:16, 1:17 and 1:17, which would total 3:50, a new world record. S√©ra Martin and Jean Keller were pace-setters, and included in the field was an Italian then considered to be a mediocre runner - Luigi Beccali. Keller led the field through 400 m in 58.6 and 500 m in 1:13.4. Sensing he was running too fast, Keller slowed but Ladoum√®gue, feeling fresh, yelled \\"Plus vite, plus vite!\\" Keller hit 800 m in 2:00.4 and dropped out. Martin took over the pace-setting chore, and hit 1000 m in 2:33.0, exactly on schedule. Martin continued for only a few more metres before dropping out. At the bell, Ladoum√®gue and Beccali were alone. Ladoum√®gue increased the pace, hitting 1200 m in 3:05.0 - 1.0 seconds faster than Peltzer's record pace, but Ladoum√®gue feared he lacked Peltzer's kick so he ran hard all the way. He struggled through the final homestretch, later saying \\"My legs were like lead in that final lap.\\" He crossed the line and three watches recorded his time as 3:49 1/5, two at 3:49.0. The slower time was taken as the official time, and Ladoum√®gue not only had the record, he became the first sub-3:50 1500 m runner. He repeated his record-setting ways by running the 1000 m in 2:23.6 on the same Paris track 19 October. In 1931, his early season was relatively pedestrian as the fastest 1500 m race he ran was 3:58.0 by July. But on 2 July, he set his third world record, this time in the 2000 m with a time of 5:21.8. After defeating Thomas 3:53.6 to 3:55.0 over the 1500 m on 2 August, he raced Purje, whose 2000 m record he had broken, over 3/4 mile on 13 September. In an exciting race which saw Ladoum√®gue catching Purje at the finish, both runners broke the existing world record with a 3:00.6 performance, Ladoum√®gue winning by a foot. For his next feat, he decided to attempt the mile record on the same weekend he broke the 1,500 m record the year before - on the first Sunday in October. Running in Stade Jean Bouin in Paris with six other Frenchmen, Ladoum√®gue followed 800 m runner Ren√© Morel as he clocked 60.8 for 440 yards and 2:04.2 for 880 yards. Morel passed 1000 m in 2:34.6, slowed, and Ladoum√®gue was alone at the bell lap. Ladoum√®gue hit the 3/4 mile mark at 3:08.0, 1.3 seconds behind the pace Paavo Nurmi ran when he set his record in the mile in 1923. But Ladoum√®gue had conserved his strength for the final quarter, a strategy which delivered him the 1,500 m record the year before. At the 1500 m point in the race, Ladoum√®gue was at 3:52.4, now 0.6 seconds faster than Nurmi. He finished at 4:09.2, a new world record, the first time 4:10 had been broken. Ladoum√®gue was now a national hero and a clear favourite to win gold in the 1500 m at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. But the French Federation, to the disgust of the French public, banned him for life because he had allegedly received payoffs for several of his races. His career thus ended. In 1955 Ladoum√®gue published an autobiography, entitled Dans ma foul√©e. He died in Paris, √éle-de-France in 1973.

A sequel to the game was later released in Japan for the PlayStation known as Septentrion: Out of the Blue. Story Mostly inspired by the 1969 book and 1972 film, The Poseidon Adventure, the game is set in 1921, and the players must escape the sinking ship Lady Crithania, which gets hit by a gigantic wave and is capsized. The game features four playable characters, each with a different story: * Capris Wisher - An architect. This young man takes his younger sister Amy to the Lady Crithania. However, Amy's sickness becomes a severe hindrance to him. * Redwin Gardner - A counselor, traveling with a family consisting of an unnamed mother, her children Stella and Harry Adams. Plus, Jack Hamilton, a nephew. * Jeffrey Howell - A senior doctor, he travels along with his wife Adela. * Luke Haines - A crewman of the Lady Crithania. He suspects that the sea conditions are too much for the Lady Crithania to handle, much to the opposition of his superiors.  Gameplay  An example of the main game screen. Luke Haines stands in a stairway before the tidal wave. The player must escape from the ship within a one-hour time limit. The timer is hidden except when the player injures themselves, in which case they fall unconscious and lose five minutes of time. After a period of time, the ship begins to periodically tilt in the water and gradually fill with water. The player can take up to seven other survivors, some of which have different value to each playable character, and all of them have different requirements in how to get to them and how to make them follow the player. Depending on how many survivors the player finds, who they are and how valuable they are to the character player selected, the ending will vary. The best ending for each character is obtained by escaping the boiler room, the final area of the game, with their sentimental person (Amy for Capris; Harry, Stella and Jack for Redwin; Ismay for Luke; and Adela for Jeffrey) and over 25 \\"points\\" worth of survivors.  Release  The game was released in Japan as Septentrion on May 28, 1993 for the Super Famicom. The game was released in North America April 1994, on under the title S.O.S. and was published by Vic Tokai. It was followed up by the Japan-only release of Septentrion: Out of the Blue in 1999 for the Sony PlayStation. Reception GamePro gave the game a negative review, saying that the premise is compelling but marred by too many poorly- designed segments.

It is similar to tic-tac-toe and dots and boxes, but has greater complexity. SOS is a combinatorial game when played with two players. In terms of game theory, it is a zero-sum, sequential game with perfect information. Gameplay Before play begins, a square grid of at least 3x3 squares in size is drawn. Players take turns to add either an \\"S\\" or an \\"O\\" to any square, with no requirement to use the same letter each turn. The object of the game is for each player to attempt to create the straight sequence S-O-S among connected squares (either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically), and to create as many such sequences as they can. If a player succeeds in creating an SOS, that player immediately takes another turn, and continues to do so until no SOS can be created on their turn. Otherwise turns alternate between players after each move.. Keeping track of who made which SOSs can be done by, e.g., one player circling their SOSs and the other player drawing a line through theirs. Once the grid has been filled up, the winner is the player who made the most SOSs. If the grid is filled up and the number of SOSs for each player is the same, then the game is a draw. The game can also be played where the player who creates an SOS is the winner and if no SOSs are created the game is a draw.

Registro di consultazione manoscritto V.E. 307. The document can be found in the library under the title Fondo Vittorio Emanuele 307. Alleged Nostradamian connections A postscript by Carthusian librarians states that the book had been presented by one Brother Beroaldus to cardinal Maffeo Barberini, who would later become Pope Urban VIII (1623‚Äì1644). A further covering note suggests that the images were by the French seer Nostradamus (1503‚Äì1566), and had been sent to Rome by his son C√©sar de Nostredame as a gift. There is, however, absolutely no contemporary evidence that Nostradamus himself was either a painter or the author of the work, whose contents in fact date from several centuries before his time‚Äînor, indeed, that he had ever heard of it, given that it did not finally appear in print until after his death. The postscript is in fact dated '1629', and the covering note (not in Nostradamus's hand) from which the Nostradamian title derives cannot, on the basis of its contents, date from earlier than 1689 ‚Äì though an internal note does refer to a source dated 1343.Ottavio Cesare Ramotti, The Nostradamus Code, tr. Tami Calliope, Destiny Books, 1998 Nevertheless, the highly speculative Italian writer Ottavio Cesare Ramotti,The Nostradamus Code, tr. Tami Calliope, Destiny Books, 1998 together with the History Channel's The Lost Book of Nostradamus (October 2007), have still made much of the book's supposedly 'Nostradamian' origin. There is a letter by C√®sar de Nostredame (Michel's first son), written to the French scientist Fabri de Peiresc, in which mention is made of several miniatures painted by C√®sar, and of a booklet that was destined as a gift to King Louis XIII in 1629,Daniel Ruzo, page 332, \\"El Testamento Aut√©ntico de Nostradamus\\", by Ed. Grijalbo, Mexico City 1997 but there is no evidence whatsoever of any connection between these and the Vaticinia. Style Image 18 The images contain symbolic objects, letters, animals, crossings of banners, bugles, crosses, candles, three writing styles, etc., some of which seem to some to form figures similar to Roman numerals, or veiled references to personal names. As suggested by the various added inscriptions, they are supposed to have been inspired by the celebrated papal prophecies of Abbot Joachim of Fiore, a 12th-century Cistercian monk from Calabria. Sources Image 23 Image 38 Image 44 The origin of the work is clearly the fourteenth century Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus, in which most of the images (including Image 23 opposite) are to be found. By way of example, its Image 12 corresponds to the latter's Image 9, Image 18 to 15, Image 23 to 20, Image 24 to 21 and Image 29 to 26 (note, too, the similarity of sequence). A work similar to this is Marston MS 225, which can be found in the manuscript and rare-book library of Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, United States.Reeves, Marjorie, Some Popular Prophecies from the Fourteenth to the Seventeenth Centuries This manuscript comes from the German areas of Bavaria and Bohemia, probably from within the courts of emperor Frederick III and Maximilian I.

Leaving the Royal Academy School of Painting in 1931, before the completion of his five-year scholarship, his first commission was from a brewing firm to decorate a chain of saloon bars with landscape murals. A papier-m√¢ch√© tray by Hurry, showing a circus artiste hanging off the back of a black horse In the second half of the 1930s he wandered Britain and Ireland painting landscapes. Depressed with his work and seeking inspiration to develop a personal style, he moved to Brittany then Paris, but was forced to return to Britain due to health problems. In 1939, found unfit for military service and disturbed by the war, he isolated himself in his secluded cottage at Thaxted, Essex. At this time he was befriended by Grace Sholto Douglas, an elderly patron of arts who died in 1942. In 1940‚Äì41 he produced two books of intricate automatic drawings that were exhibited at the Redfern Gallery, leading to his acclaim as an \\"ultra-surrealist\\". His first stage work was for a production of Hamlet for the Sadler's Wells Ballet in 1942, work commissioned by Robert Helpmann, who had seen his paintings in a London gallery. He subsequently worked for Sadler's Wells, the Old Vic, Aldwych Theatre, Glyndebourne, the Royal Opera House, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the theatre in Canada, particularly in Stratford, Ontario. He left a large corpus of paintings, including abstract, portraiture and landscape works.

The city's geography, with its scarce availability of land, is a contributing factor in making New York the most densely populated major city in the United States. Environmental issues are chiefly concerned with managing this density, which also explains why New York is among the most energy-efficient and least automobile-dependent cities in the United States. The city's climate is temperate.  Geography  boroughs of New York City Population density and elevation above sea level in Greater NYC, U.S. (2010) New York City is especially vulnerable to sea level rise. New York City is located on the coast of the Northeastern United States at the mouth of the Hudson River in southeastern New York state. It is located in the New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Harbor Estuary, the centerpiece of which is the New York Harbor, whose deep waters and sheltered bays helped the city grow in significance as a trading city. Much of New York is built on the three islands of Manhattan, Staten Island, and western Long Island, making land scarce and encouraging a high population density. The Hudson River flows from the Hudson Valley into New York Bay, becoming a tidal estuary that separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Northern New Jersey. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson Rivers, separates Manhattan from the Bronx. The boroughs of New York City straddle the border between two geologic provinces of eastern North America. Brooklyn and Queens, located on Long Island, are part of the eastern coastal plain. Long Island is a massive moraine which formed at the southern fringe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last Ice Age. The Bronx and Manhattan lie on the eastern edge of the Newark Basin, a block of the Earth's crust which sank downward during the disintegration of the supercontinent Pangaea during the Triassic period. The Palisades Sill on the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River exposes ancient, once-molten rock that filled the basin. Tough metamorphic rocks underlie much of Manhattan, providing solid support for its many skyscrapers. The city's land has been altered considerably by human intervention, with substantial land reclamation along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times. Reclamation is most notable in Lower Manhattan with modern developments like Battery Park City. Much of the natural variations in topography have been evened out, particularly in Manhattan. The West Side of Manhattan retains some hilliness, especially in Upper Manhattan, while the East Side has been considerably flattened. Duffy's Hill in East Harlem is one notable exception to the East Side's relatively level grade. The city's land area is estimated to be . However, a more recent estimate calculates a total land area of 304.8 square miles (789.4 square kilometres). The highest natural point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which at 409.8 ft (124.9 m) above sea level is the highest hill on the Eastern Seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is largely covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt. Adjacent counties New York *Westchester County *Nassau County New Jersey *Monmouth County *Middlesex County *Union County *Hudson County *Bergen County  Boroughs  New York City comprises five boroughs, an unusual form of government used to administer the five constituent counties that make up the city. Throughout the boroughs there are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods, many with a definable history and character all their own. If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States. *The Bronx (Bronx County, pop. 1,364,566) is New York City's northernmost borough. It is the birthplace of rap and hip hop culture, the site of Yankee Stadium, and home to the largest cooperatively owned housing complex in the United States, Co-op City. Except for a small piece of Manhattan known as Marble Hill, the Bronx is the only section of the city that is part of the North American mainland. * Brooklyn (Kings County, pop. 2,511,408) is the city's most populous borough and was an independent city until 1898. Brooklyn is known for its cultural diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods and a unique architectural heritage. The borough also features a long beachfront and Coney Island, famous as one of the earliest amusement grounds in the country. * Manhattan (New York County, pop. 1,606,275) is the most densely populated borough and home to most of the city's skyscrapers. The borough contains the major business centers of the city and many cultural attractions. Manhattan is loosely divided into downtown, midtown, and uptown regions. * Queens (Queens County, pop. 2,256,576) is geographically the largest borough and the most ethnically diverse county in the United States. Historically a collection of small towns and villages founded by the Dutch, the borough today is mainly residential and middle class, with enclaves of above average income and wealth. It is the only large county in the United States where the median income among African-American households, about $52,000 a year, has surpassed that of Caucasian households. Queens is the site of Citi Field and its predecessor Shea Stadium, the home of the New York Mets, and annually hosts the US Tennis Open. * Staten Island (Richmond County, pop. 475,014) is the most suburban in character of the five boroughs. It is connected to Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and to Manhattan by the free Staten Island Ferry. Until 2001 the borough was home to the Fresh Kills Landfill, formerly the largest landfill in the world, which is now being reconstructed as Freshkills Park, one of the largest urban parks in the United States. Environmental issues Central Park is nearly twice as big as the world's second-smallest country, Monaco. Historically its reservoirs were important components of the city's water supply. New York City plays an important role in the green policy agenda because of its size. Environmental groups make large efforts to help shape legislation in New York because they see the strategy as an efficient way to influence national programs. New York City's economy is larger than Switzerland's, a size that means the city has potential to set new de facto standards. Manufacturers are also attuned to the latest trends and needs in the city because the market is simply too big to ignore. Although cities like San Francisco or Portland, Oregon are most commonly associated with urban environmentalism in the United States, New York City's unique urban footprint and extensive transportation systems make it more sustainable than most American cities.

Along with Kapaun Mt. Carmel Catholic High School, it is one of two Catholic high schools in the city, part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita. History Bishop Mark K. Carroll was installed as the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita on May 6, 1947. From there he began to have a vision. He wanted to establish the first Catholic boys' high school in the Wichita Diocese. He immediately began to follow this dream. By September 1962, Bishop Mark Carroll had installed two Catholic boys' high schools, Bishop Carroll being the second. At first, he named the new school Notre Dame High School, but by May 1964, Notre Dame had closed in order for it to be moved to its current location and reopened.

Formerly known as the Bear Stearns Building, it is owned and occupied by JPMorgan Chase. Following several failed plans for development of the site, 383 Madison Avenue was constructed between 1999 and 2002 over the underground rail yards for the nearby Grand Central Terminal. 383 Madison Avenue housed the world headquarters of the now-defunct Bear Stearns from the building's completion until Bear's collapse and sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2008. The building now houses the New York offices for JPMorgan's investment banking division, which formerly occupied 277 Park Avenue. Both 383 Madison and 277 Park are adjacent to JPMorgan Chase's world headquarters address, 270 Park Avenue, and the 383 Madison building is serving as temporary headquarters while 270 Park is being redeveloped. History The original building at 383 Madison was a 14-story, limestone office building designed by Cross & Cross and named the Knapp Building. The building occupied the entire block and had served as the headquarters of the Manhattan Savings Bank, BBDO, and William Zeckendorf's Webb & Knapp. Planning In October 1982, G Ware Travelstead and First Boston acquired the building for $77.75 million and hired Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) to design a new replacement for the site. Initial studies for the project reached up to and 140 stories, taller than Sears Tower, the tallest building in the world at the time. A 72-story, tall tower was later proposed in the mid-1980s. The building (also referred to as the Travelstead Tower), which would have been the fourth- tallest in New York City, was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) and would have spanned . KPF incorporated several setbacks into the design, and planned to construct the Travelstead Tower out of steel and reinforced concrete. The office floors were to be arranged in a cross, with columns in the building's core because of the presence of underground tracks for Grand Central Terminal under the site. There would have been three sections in the tower: trading floors made of concrete; a series of office stories capped by a shoulder truss, and the top 20 stories above the truss. However, the site was only zoned for and needed to purchase additional air rights from Grand Central Terminal to hit the targeted square footage. The building ran into opposition trying to transfer the air rights, with New York's Manhattan Community Board 5 voting unanimously to deny the transfer in June 1989. Following the Community Board's opposition, the New York City Planning Commission also unanimously disapproved of the transfer. The developers sued the city in the New York Supreme Court, but the court upheld the city's decision to deny the rights transfer, effectively cancelling the project. In 1994, Howard Ronson's HRO International signed a deal giving the firm the option to buy the property for $55 million from First Boston. The developer planned a 24-story, $200 million building named Park Avenue Place on the site. The tower was planned for completion in the third quarter of 1996. HRO planned to reuse the old building's foundations and also solicited tax breaks from the city government. Ronson was reportedly in discussions with Morgan Guaranty Trust and Swiss Re about anchoring the building. However, in January 1996 First Boston reneged on their deal with HRO and instead signed a contract to sell the land to Bear Stearns. Another conflict unfolded when First Boston's partner in the site, the al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia, announced in February 1996 that they would be buying out First Boston's stake to take control of the entire site. The family's ownership stake included a right of first refusal if First Boston attempted to sell the property. Construction and use JP Morgan Chase entered negotiations with the al-Babtain family in October 1996, hoping to build a new headquarters for themselves on the site, near their existing headquarters at 270 Park Avenue. Bear Stearns signed a 99-year lease for the land beneath the building in 1999 with plans to move its headquarters and most of its 4,500 employees to the new building. Hines Interests managed the development process for Bear Stearns. In mid-2001, before the September 11 attacks, the bank installed a mosaic in its lobby, showing Manhattan's skyline before the World Trade Center was built. It was completed in 2001 and opened in 2002. The building changed hands in 2008 during JPMorgan's takeover of Bear Stearns. On their second-quarter 2008 conference call, JP Morgan estimated the building's value at $1.1 to $1.4 billion. Deconstruction of the adjacent 270 Park Avenue, JPMorgan's old headquarters adjacent to 383 Madison Avenue, started in 2019. A new building would be erected on the 270 Park Avenue site to serve as an expanded headquarters. During the time that 270 Park Avenue is being redeveloped, 383 Madison Avenue is serving as temporary headquarters. Design The glass \\"crown\\" at top Designed by David Childs of SOM, it is tall with 47 floors and approximately available for rent. The building has an octagonal tower that rises out of a rectangular eight-story base. The facade is made of granite with glass panels. The tower terminates at a crown made of glass which is illuminated at night. Two-thirds of the building‚Äôs foundation sit on slabs atop the Metro-North Railroad's Grand Central Terminal yards rather than being attached to the bedrock itself. The tunnels also required Bear Stearns to move HVAC and mechanical equipment that would usually sit in the basement up higher in the building. The building utilizes of air rights from the terminal's yards. Features The building was designed to be able to run for four days without exterior power through four emergency electrical generators, its own steam turbines, and tanks that could store of emergency water. When it opened, the building contained 23 high-speed elevators capable of traveling per minute. , the building has 30 elevators. Floors 3 through 11 served as Bear Stearns' trading floors. Each floor was and each housed 285 traders. Impact The building's visually decorative design differs from the conventional functionalist style of neighboring office buildings, and hence has proven unpopular with some critics. New York said, \\"This is a building you wouldn't want to get anywhere near at a cocktail party. Dressed nearly head to toe in dour granite, and geometrically proper, it's stiff to the point of pass-out boredom. Out of character with SOM' current work, the design recalls the firm's unfortunate postmodern interlude a decade ago.\\" A night time photograph of the building taken at a steep angle from its base appears on the cover of William D. Cohan's book, House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wretched Excess on Wall Street (2009).

Unlike the other social actions, an affectional action is an action that occurs as a result of a person's state of feeling, sometimes regardless of the consequences that follow it. Because the action is a result of our state of feeling, an affectional action may sometimes be described as irrational and reactive. An example of an affectional action can be the act of a father striking their daughter because of an action that she carried out that the father saw as frustrating.  Max Weber's writings  Max Weber describes the actions that we take as rarely occurring with the influence of only one of the four types of social actions. He describes the action as: \\"an uncontrolled reaction to some exceptional stimulus.\\" The action taken by the individual is also described as a reaction that consists of a release as a result of emotional tension. An affectional action may not alway be uncontrolled and strictly reactive, as a person may act strictly on their emotions, but the emotions of the person may take some form of rationalization, resulting in an action that is not purely affectional anymore.  In The Managed Heart  The Managed Heart is a book that was written by Arlie Russell Hochschild. First published in 1979, the book speaks about the role of emotions and feelings in our society, \\"feeling rules\\", as well as the use of emotions and affectional action in the workplace. Hochschild presents the idea that actions that result from our emotions is rational, not irrational. She goes on to say that the relationship that we accept between irrationality and affectional action stems from our \\"cultural policy toward emotional life...\\"  Emotions as described by sociologists  Hochschild speaks about emotions and our actions resulting from our feelings using the input from many other famous sociologists in The Managed Heart: * Charles Darwin: Darwin believed that emotional gestures were biologically innate. He went on to say that the gestures that resulted from emotions and feelings were mainly universal and applied to all individuals, where some gestures like kissing and weeping were culturally specific. * Sigmund Freud: Freud went through three major stages of his idea of emotions. First, he believed our emotions were a result of our blocked libido, presenting itself as tension and anxiety. Then, he believed emotions and emotional actions to accompany Id. And finally he came to see emotion and affectional action as \\"signals of impending danger (from inside or outside) and as an impetus to action.\\" * William James: James believed that different emotions would accompany different body states, meaning, the manipulation of our body and mind also alters our emotions and how we would react to certain situations in which we react based upon our emotional state.  Across individuals  People will react differently in certain situations, so an affectional action will always depend on the person performing the action. With this in mind, an affectional action will have a variety of factors like the personality of the person, or the cultural normalities, or even the setting in which the person is in. There will never be a universal action occurring out of emotional and state of feeling. A few examples of the variables that go into how the subject reacts can be: * Whether the person tends to be more emotional than usual * The cultural teachings from which the person comes from * The environment in which the person is in An affectional action has to take into account the individual, but the affectional action must also take into account the social norms in which the situation is occurring. This can affect the action an individual will take to an extreme level, as most individuals would react differently when in extremely different situations. Take for example, a waiter in a restaurant. He may become frustrated with clients and want to shout, however, because of his job and the norms that accompany it, he is barred from his typical action. This is an example of emotional labor, an idea developed by Arlie Russell Hochschild. The idea speaks about emotional regulation carried out in order to fit the \\"emotional requirements of a job\\". Emotional labor is one of the major modifiers of the action and individual will take, regardless of their feeling state. This will often occur when an individual is dealing with clients or customers and needs to give off a professional or \\"good\\" image, often suppressing the initial affectional action they may want to take.

Tyrone Power stars as the scrappy Irish immigrant whose 50-year career at West Point took him from a dishwasher to a non-commissioned officer and athletic instructor. Maher was buried there in January 1961. Maureen O'Hara, one of Ford's favorite leading ladies, plays Maher's wife and fellow immigrant, Mary O'Donnell. The film co-stars Ward Bond as Herman Koehler, the Master of the Sword (athletic director) and Army's head football coach (1897‚Äì1900), who first befriends Maher. Milburn Stone appears as John J. Pershing, who in 1898 swears Maher into the Army. Harry Carey, Jr., makes a brief appearance as the young cadet Dwight D. Eisenhower. Philip Carey plays (fictional) Army football player and future general Chuck Dotson. In addition, actress Betsy Palmer makes her screen debut as Kitty Carter. The phrase \\"The Long Gray Line\\" is used to describe, as a continuum, all graduates and cadets of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Many of the scenes in the film were shot on location at West Point, including the \\"million dollar view\\" of the Hudson River near the parade grounds. The film was the last one in which actor Robert Francis appeared before his death at age 25 in an air crash. His rising stardom had reached third billing behind Power and O'Hara at the time of his death. Plot The movie is framed as the reminiscences of Master Sergeant Martin Maher (Tyrone Power), who first came to West Point in 1898 as a civilian employee. Arriving from County Tipperary, Ireland, Marty begins as a waiter. When he realizes that enlisted men receive better treatment than do hired laborers, he immediately signs up and joins the U.S. Army. Capt. Koehler (Ward Bond), impressed with his boxing skills, wants him as an assistant in athletics instruction. Marty meets Mrs. Koehler's cook, Mary O'Donnell (Maureen O'Hara), also recently arrived from Ireland. They marry and settle into a house on campus. Marty becomes a corporal, and Mary saves enough money to bring his father (Donald Crisp) and brother (Sean McClory) to America. Mary becomes pregnant, but the baby dies only hours after birth, and Mary learns that she may never have another child. The cadets become the children they will never have. Over time, Marty continues to earn the love and respect of cadets such as Omar Bradley, James Van Fleet, George Patton and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Mahers grow close to the family of \\"Red\\" Sundstrom, a West Point cadet killed in World War I. Years later, Marty is still at West Point, and James \\"Red\\" Sundstrom, Jr. (Robert Francis), along with the sons of others whom Marty had trained, has become a cadet. At the outbreak of World War II Sundstrom confesses to Marty that he has illegally married his girlfriend which could disqualify him from graduating. Although his marriage is annulled, Sundstrom resigns from West Point to join the regular U.S. Army. Later, Mary attempts to view one of the parades she so loves but her poor health forces her to watch from her porch. She quietly dies while Marty is fetching her shawl. On Christmas Eve, Marty prepares for a quiet evening but is joined by a group of cadets. Kitty (Betsy Palmer) arrives with Red, Jr., who has earned his captain's bars in Europe and wants Marty to pin them on. After Marty is faced with retirement, he heads to Washington to see the President (a West Point graduate) about the matter. He is met by the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy along with several high- ranking officers on his return to West Point. Slightly bemused by the attention, he is taken to the parade field. The film concludes with a full dress parade in Marty's honor. As the band plays a series of Irish tunes, all the people Marty loves, both living and dead, join the parade to honor him.

The only historically real West Point graduate to be awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I was Emory Jenison Pike from the Class of 1901.

Etymology and history Both Victoria Street and Victoria Bridge were named after Queen Victoria (1819-1901). Victoria Bridge over Rochor River was built in 1914 and took its name from Victoria Street. The name of Victoria Street may have changed several times in the nineteenth century. On Lieutenant Philip Jackson's plan of the town of Singapore, drawn in 1822, the street appears as \\"Rochor Street\\".

Cover art by Dave Dorman Death Hawk is a fictional American comic book character, a self-styled salvage expert in the 25th century. The character starred in a namesake, three-issue series published by Adventure Publications from 1987-1988, created and written by Mark Ellis. He first appeared in a five-page back-up feature in Star Rangers #2-3, by the same writer. Publication history Death Hawk ran three issues cover-dated May to November 1988. The first issue was pencilled by artist Adam Hughes, succeeded with issue #2 by Rik Levins. The first two issues featured painted covers by Dave Dorman, the third by Steve Hickman. Death Hawk was canceled after the third issue when the publisher went out of business. A fourth issue was completed but went unpublished at the time. In September 2008, Ellis' Millennial Concepts (with Transfuzion Publishingg) published a 128-page trade paperback, Death Hawk: The Soulworm Saga Volume One, that collected the published Death Hawk stories and the previously unpublished fourth issue. It included an introduction by Douglas Clegg and incidental art by Darryl Banks, Jim Mooney and Robert Lewis. Fictional character biography The 25th century as presented in Death Hawk and its companion series Star Rangers was a dystopia of solar system-spanning corporations that held the true power behind the centralized government of the Sol 9 Commonwealth. His true name unrevealed, the protagonist was the surviving member of a group of corporate outcasts who called themselves the Death Hawks. When the group was betrayed by one of their own, Death Hawk escaped in his 50-year-old spaceship the Peregrine. With the aid of his bio-engineered sidekick, Cyke, Death Hawk traveled the spaceways eluding arrest warrants and creditors, his eye always out for ways to keep his salvage business going ‚Äî often when legality was questionable. Cyke, described as an \\"intelligent blob of goo\\" was a telepathic protosymbiote produced by the Biotek Corporation. Although Death Hawk referred to Cyke as \\"he\\", the creature was sexless. However, it possessed the ability to morph into a variety of sizes and shapes. Not only was Cyke extremely intelligent, it was far more knowledgeable than his human partner and wasn't above reminding Death Hawk of the fact. The story arc \\"The Soulworm Saga\\" revolved around the quest for a mythical alien object of immense power. Other characters included: *Brigid O'Shaunessy/Vanessa Bouvier, a beautiful con artist who claimed to be an exo-archeologist. *R'yex, an Arcturan mercenary who first opposed Death Hawk then out of necessity joined forces with him. *Anton Chane, a director of the mysterious Biotek Corporation, whose agenda has far-reaching implications for the evolution of humanity. *Takaun, one of the \\"high daimyos\\" of the Sol 9 Shogunate, who was just as crafty as Chane and as greedy as R'yex, but in his own way.

Biography  Lombardi was born to a concert pianist and an Italian actress living in New York City. His family soon moved back to Rome, Italy, where he lived until the age of six. He went on to attend Buckley Country Day School and public schools in Great Neck, New York and elsewhere on Long Island. In 1974 Lombardi began his undergraduate studies at Dowling College and graduated cum laude in the biology major and physics minor in 1977. He attended graduate school at Clemson University, where he received his MA in 1980 and was granted a PhD in zoology in 1983. Upon graduation, Lombardi accepted a postdoctoral appointment and lectureship in the biological sciences at the University of North Carolina which he held until 1986. In 1986, Lombardi was appointed an assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. In 1990, he received tenure and was named director of graduate studies in biology. He served on the faculty at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro until 1999. Lombardi also served as director of the university's Analytical Visualization Center from 1993 to 1999. From 2002 to 2005, Lombardi managed a research and development group at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison that specialized in the design and development of open source virtual learning environments and digital media technologies for learning and instruction. Currently Lombardi is an assistant vice president with Duke University's Office of Information Technology. He is also a senior research scholar with Duke University's program in information science and information studies, and an adjunct professor with Duke University's Department of Computer Science.  Work  Lombardi's early research program centered on the evolution of complex organismal function in vertebrates and the evolution of maternal-embryonic physiological relationships. An advocate of the use of imaging technologies and early adopter of information technology in university teaching and learning, in 1987 Lombardi began writing HyperTalk- based software applications in support of learning and instruction in anatomy and physiology. In the mid-1990s, Lombardi combined his interests in information technology, complex systems, and the phenomenon of emergence in biological systems to begin designing and developing computer-supported collaboration systems involving self-optimizing massively multiuser online 3D environments.  The Bone Box  In 1989 he developed and marketed The Bone Box, a commercial 3D auto-tutorial program for use in learning human skeletal anatomy with the early Macintosh computer.  ViOS  Lombardi eventually founded ViOS, Inc. where, during the period from 1999 to 2001, he served as the venture capital-backed company's first CEO and then chief creative officer/software architect. There, he and his team designed and implemented ViOS, a client‚Äìserver technology that enabled the first 3D user interface to network deliverable resources (including the Internet) in the form of a highly customizable and massively multi-user online virtual environment ‚Äì essentially a very large scale social software system/3D wiki.  Croquet Project  Lombardi is one of the six principal architects of the Croquet software developer's toolkit and from 2006 to 2008 he served as executive director of the Croquet Consortium,Croquet Consortium a not-for-profit organization to promote the adoption of Croquet open source software technologies.  Open Cobalt  Lombardi led a National Science Foundation funded effort to develop Open Cobalt, an open source and multi-platform metaverse browser and toolkit application and toolset to support the large scale visualization and simulation needs of educators and researchers.

From 1991 to 2001, she served as a traditional midwife in Illinois and Wisconsin. Cryns has a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) designation. As a childbirth activist, she worked to restore childbirth rights to Illinois women and their families, speaking and providing public education on the topic and testifying at Legislative committee hearings. Cryns introduced several bills to the Illinois legislature for many years in an effort to gain licensure for midwives. She assisted at over 300 births. Cryns has seven children, six of whom were born at home.  Legal issues = Department of Professional Regulation  On April 7, 2000, Cryns was ordered to cease and desist the practice of medicine, nursing and midwifery by the Department of Professional Regulation, (\\"DPR\\") since she was not a registered nurse in Illinois although she did have a license in Wisconsin. She sued DPR, claiming the agency had no jurisdiction to regulate her practice. A judge ruled Cryns had not violated any state regulations and vacated the agency's cease and desist order. However, it was only a hollow victory, temporarily, because a condition of her bond in the criminal case prevented her from practicing as a midwife. On May 7, 2001, the Illinois Appellate Court for the second district reversed the trial court, \\"finding that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on plaintiff‚Äôs request for a preliminary injunction without viewing a videotape of the birth, which had been entered into evidence.\\" Upon remand, the trial court granted Cryns' motion and the Department appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois In May 2002, the Supreme Court of Illinois agreed to hear the civil case of Illinois Department of Professional Regulation vs. Yvonne Cryns, over whether the DPR has the right to regulate unlicensed professions. Oral arguments were heard on November 30, 2002. In July 2003, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that direct-entry midwifery fell under the jurisdiction of the Advanced Practice Nursing Act, which identifies nursing as including ‚Äúthe assessment of healthcare needs ... the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health ... counseling, patient education, health education, and patient advocacy.‚Äù The court also found that Cryns was practicing nursing or midwifery without a license, based upon the testimony of Louis Verzi, the baby‚Äôs father, as well as the videotape admitted into evidence. This created a precedent where women who attended at-home births now risked being prosecuted. A midwife could not effectively practice his or her profession in Illinois without being licensed as a nurse. After the ruling, Cryns agreed to stop helping women give birth.  August 2000 birth and death  On August 19, 2000, Cryns assisted a home birth in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, where, after the boy was born via breech birth, Cryns attempted Cardiopulmonary resuscitation before calling 9-1-1.  Trial  Cryns was charged with involuntary manslaughter of both a born child and of an unborn child. The main piece of evidence in the trial was a videotape of the birth, showing the complete 46 minutes from the time the child's foot first became visible until the birth was complete. Prosecutors claimed Cryns was reckless and contributed to the boy's death by not calling for emergency help sooner, trying for 12 minutes to revive the baby before telling his father to call 911 because she did not want the authorities to know that she was violating her cease-and-desist order. Cryns told the Verzis, \\"I don't want you to tell [the emergency crew] I was here,\\" adding \\"Do me a favor, get all my stuff out of here.\\" She was charged with reckless disregard for the safety of the baby boy, who in a feet-first position in his mother's uterus, presented a risky delivery that doctors and many midwives generally believe warrants a hospital birth and often a Caesarean section. Cryns claimed her actions were in keeping with accepted midwife practice and the boy's death was beyond her control. Throughout the trial, the baby's parents (Louis and Heather Verzi) supported Cryns. The Verzis testified that they had known they were taking a risk by having a breech baby delivered at home, and they had signed an informed-consent agreement taking responsibility. = Not guilty for unborn child = In June 2001, a jury found her not guilty for the unborn child and was deadlocked (10-2 in favor of conviction) for the born child charge. Cryns' attorney, Andrea Lyon, tried to argue that a second trial constituted double jeopardy. Her motion to dismiss was denied in November 2001, so Lyon appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court. In September, Cryns agreed to the plea bargain on the misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct, and sentenced to 18 months probation. = Legal expenses = The judge also ruled that part of her bail bond cash be used to pay for a transcript copy of her original. Lyon also appealed that, arguing that Cryns is \\"legally indigent\\", and that the bond was paid for by \\"friends and church members\\" for whom it should remain for. An affidavit filed with a motion to get a free transcript of the testimony in her earlier trial showed that the Cryns owed an estimated $255,000 in legal expenses, for both her defense on the criminal charges and in her civil court battle against the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation.

He was the younger brother of Professor Walter Garstang, FRS, a marine biologist and zoologist. Garstang is considered a pioneer in the development of scientific practices in archaeology as he kept detailed records of his excavations with extensive photographic records, which was a comparatively rare practice in early 20th- century archaeology Biography John Garstang was born in Blackburn on 5 May 1876, the sixth child of Walter and Matilda Garstang. He was educated at Blackburn Grammar School and in 1895 he obtained a scholarship for Jesus College, Oxford to study mathematics. While at Oxford, Garstang became interested in archaeology and conducted excavations at Ribchester. Encouraged to take up archaeology, Garstang excavated other Romano-British sites during his vacations from Oxford. After gaining a 3rd from Oxford in 1899, Garstang joined the team of Flinders Petrie at Abydos. He excavated various sites in the vicinity, including the discovery of the great tombs at Beit Khallaf in 1901. In 1902 he carried out his first independent excavation in Egypt at Reqaqnah. The excavation was funded by an excavation committee, a group of wealthy donors who in turn would receive a selection of objects from Garstang's excavations in exchange for their patronage. Like Petrie before him, Garstang would continue to use Excavation Committees to fund his excavations for most of his career. In 1902, Garstang was also appointed the honorary reader in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Liverpool. In 1904, Garstang founded the Institute of Archaeology, which was affiliated with the University. From 1907-41, Garstang was the first professorship in the methods and practice of archaeology at the University. On behalf of the Institute, Garstang excavated sites in Egypt, Sudan and the Near East up to the out break of World War I. Some of his assistant excavators include E. Harold Jones, English artist and illustrator. He served as the Director of the Department of Antiquities in the British Mandate of Palestine between 1920-26, and excavated at Ashkelon, 1920-21\\\\. He was also the Head of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, 1919-26\\\\. He also carried out a major excavation of Jericho from 1930-36, funded by Sir Charles Marston. He taught at the Egyptology section of the Faculty of Arts when this was established in the 1920s. One of his students was Pahor Labib, late Director of the Coptic Museum, Cairo.Martin Krause, Essays on the Nag Hammad Texts - In Honour of Pahor Labib, Brill, Leiden, 1975, p. 1 From 1936 to the outbreak of World War II, Garstang excavated Y√ºm√ºk Tepe near Mersin. Garstang returned to Turkey after the War, and finished the excavation in 1948. In 1948, Garstang founded the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, assisted by other Anatolian archaeologists including Winifred Lamb, and acted as its first director (he was succeeded by Seton Lloyd).

Scholars call using means that \\"work\\" as tools, instrumental action, and pursuing ends that are \\"right\\" as legitimate ends, value-rational action. These terms were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who observed people attaching subjective meanings to their actions. Acts people treated as conditional means he labeled \\"instrumentally rational.\\" Acts people treated as unconditional ends he labeled \\"value-rational.\\" He found everyone acting for both kinds of reasons, but justifying individual acts by one reason or the other. Here are Weber's original definitions, followed by a comment showing his doubt that ends considered unconditionally right can be achieved by means considered to be conditionally efficient. An action may be: Max Weber Although Weber coined these terms for rational action, he did not use them consistently. Sometimes he called instrumental means \\"calculation of material interests\\" or \\"everyday purposive conduct.\\" He called value-rational ends \\"ideal motives enjoined by religion or magic. His inconsistency‚Äîfollowed by later scholars‚Äîmakes it hard to decide which kind of action is under consideration. But his original distinction survives as the core of modern explanations of rational social action: instrumental means are thought to be value-free conditionally- efficient tools, and value-rational ends are thought to be fact-free unconditionally-legitimate rules. As Weber studied human action in religious, governmental, and economic settings, he found peoples' reasoning evolving and often contaminating itself by converting conditional means into unconditional ends. Pre-modern peoples impute to animate and inanimate objects alike the free-will and purpose they find in human action‚Äîa belief called animism. They use instrumentally efficient means to control non-human wills. But applying means-end reasoning to control spirits and inanimate objects contaminates human knowledge. A rain-dance mistakenly thought to work instrumentally becomes a prescribed ritual action proclaimed to be permanently legitimate regardless of actual consequences. Instrumentally-ineffective means became prescribed value-rational ends-in-themselves. Similar contamination occurs in modern societies when instrumental actions that actually \\"work\\" temporarily become accepted as intrinsically efficient, converting context-dependent action-as-means into permanently legitimate action-as-end. Weber knew (and personally regretted) that European societies had been rejecting supernatural rules of behavior since the Age of Enlightenment. He called this discrediting of value-rational ends \\"disenchantment\\", and feared that placing faith in practical conditional ends destroys human freedom to believe in ultimate moral ends. J√ºrgen Habermas quoted Weber expressing dismay at this destruction of an intrinsic moral compass for human societies: As a scientist, Weber did not judge disenchantment. But he continued to believe that instrumental means are neither legitimate nor workable without value-rational ends. Even apparently impersonal scientific inquiry, he argued, depends on intrinsic value-rational beliefs as much as does religion. A recent study argues that his analysis provides legitimate means for restoring value-rational action as a permanent constraint on instrumental action.  Talcott Parsons Talcott Parsons used Weber's classic terms for society-wide patterns of rational action. In his 1938 work, The Structure of Social Action, he quoted Weber's definitions and integrated them into the theory he called \\"social harmonized action systems. He called his theoretical framework a \\"means-end schema\\" in which individuals coordinate their instrumental actions by an \\"efficiency-norm and their value- rational actions by a \\"legitimacy-norm\\". His prime example of instrumental action was the same as Weber's: widespread use of utilitarian means to satisfy individual ends. His prime example of value-rational action was institutionalised rituals found in all societies: culturally prescribed but eternally legitimate ends. Rational humans pursue socially legitimate value- rational ends by using operationally efficient instrumental means. Parsons thus placed Weber' rational actions in a \\"patterned normative order\\" of \\"cultural value patterns\\". Rational social action seeks to maintain a culture- bound value-rational order, legitimate in itself. The system maintains itself by means of four instrumental functions: pattern maintenance, goal attainment, adaptation, and integration. Weber's instrumental and value-rational action survives in Parson's system of culturally correlated means and ends. J√ºrgen Habermas Despite coining new names, J√ºrgen Habermas followed Parsons in using Weber's classic kinds of rational action to explain human behavior. In his 1981 work, The Theory of Communicative Action, he sometimes called instrumental action \\"teleological\\" action or simply \\"work\\". Value-rational action appeared as \\"normatively regulated\\". In later works he distinguished the two kinds of action by motives. Instrumental action has \\"nonpublic and actor-relative reasons,\\" and value-rational action \\"publicly defensible and actor-independent reasons\\". In addition, he proposed a new kind of social action‚Äîcommunicative‚Äînecessary to explain how individual instrumental action becomes prescribed in legitimate patterns of social interaction, thus eliminating their separation. James Gouinlock expressed Habermas's proposal as follows: Habermas argued that language communities share a background of value-rational symbols that constitutes \\"a normative context recognized as legitimate\\". It establishes an \\"intersubjectively shared lifeworld of knowledge that plays the role of correlating moral actions that Weber assigned to value rationality and Parsons assigned to institutions‚Äîa trans-empirical realm of shared beliefs. Shared understanding produced by direct communication creates a collective consciousness of instrumental knowledge‚Äîtechnological reality‚Äîand of moral rules‚Äîvalue reality‚Äîcapable of generating prescribed patterns of correlated behavior. Habermas reasoned that mutual understanding produced by communicative action provides socially legitimate value-rational norms. But power structures, such as Weber's religions, bureaucracies, and markets, prescribe contaminated patterns of behavior resulting in \\"cultural impoverishment\\" similar to Weber's disenchantment. He shared Weber's fear of the domination of instrumental over value-rational action: \\"... instrumental rationality (as functionalist reason) has expanded from its appropriate realm of system organization into the lifeworld, and has thereby begun to erode the communicative competences of the members of that lifeworld\\". Instrumental motives for conformity to amoral institutional norms replace voluntarily shared norms of communicative action. Habermas replaced Weber's unconditional value-rational ends and Parsons' unconditional maintenance of patterned normative ends by communicative action to explain observed action correlating instrumental means and value-rational ends.  John Dewey  John Dewey could agree with Weber's observation that people act as if they judge and act separately on instrumental means and value-rational ends. But he denied that the practice creates two separate kinds of rational behavior. When judged independently, means cannot work and ends are not legitimate. Dewey argued that singular human actions cannot be explained by isolated motives, as Weber sought to do. For humans in society, the bulk of individual actions are habitual \\"ways of acting,\\" like driving a car. Every action is embedded in biological and cultural environments, which humans continuously reshape instrumentally to promote developmental patterns of behavior: efficient driving adapts constantly to road conditions. Dewey had argued before Habermas that correlated action depends on communication. But communication is not a separate form of action preceding and enabling instrumental action. Rather, according to James Gouinlock, Dewey held that communication inheres in all correlated behavior. Once correlated patterns of behavior become institutionalised habits, they require little thought, as Weber recognized. \\"... life is impossible without ways of action sufficiently general to be properly named habits\\". But habits arise only after instrumental actions successfully achieve each valued end. They are neither non-rational, as Weber classified them, nor immediately-known value-rational actions, as other philosophers classify them, undertaken without regard to existing means. Where Parsons and Habermas concluded that culturally accredited institutions legitimize value-rational ends, Dewey concluded that they are often contaminated instrumental valuations‚Äîflawed inductive generalizations‚Äîthat should be reconstructed rather than treated as moral affirmations of rational action. Dewey's challenge to Weber's separation between instrumental and value-rational action remains unanswered. The distinction persists in both common sense and scholarly explanations of human behavior.

The Conference sessions began on 15 April 1661, and continued for around four months. By June, a deadlock became apparent. The conference was attended by commissioners: 12 Anglican bishops, and 12 representative ministers of the Puritan and Presbyterian factions. Each side also had nine deputies (called assistants or coadjutors). The nominal chairman was Accepted Frewen, the Archbishop of York. The object was to revise the Book of Common Prayer. Richard Baxter for the Presbyterian side presented a new liturgy, but this was not accepted. Shortly afterwards the Anglican church split, with the dissenting Nonconformists largely leaving. In 1662 the Act of Uniformity followed.

The sixteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, Paul developed as a tropical depression just offshore Central America on September 18. The depression briefly moved inland two days later just before heading westward out to sea. The storm changed little in strength for several days until September 25, when it slowly intensified into a tropical storm. Two days later, Paul attained hurricane status, and further strengthened to Category 2 intensity after turning northward. The hurricane then accelerated toward the northeast, reaching peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Paul made landfall over Baja California Sur on September 29, and subsequently moved ashore in Sinaloa the next day. Prior to making landfall near the El Salvador-Guatemala border as a tropical depression, the precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall over the region, which later continued after landfall. Many rivers in the region burst their banks after five days of rainfall, causing severe flooding and multiple mudslides. Throughout Central America, at least 1,363 people were killed, with most of the fatalities occurring in El Salvador, although some occurred in Guatemala. Another 225 deaths were attributed to floods from the depression in southern Mexico. In addition, Paul was responsible for 24 fatalities and moderate damage in northwestern Mexico, where it made landfall at hurricane strength. Meteorological history The precursor disturbance to Paul originated from an area of low barometric pressure and disorganized thunderstorms, which was first noted near the Pacific coast of Nicaragua on September 15\\\\. Several days later, satellite imagery indicated it had developed a center of cyclonic circulation; on 1800 UTC September 20, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Two. At that time, it was located west of Managua, Nicaragua and supported winds of 35 mph (50 km/h). The depression turned northward in response to a weak steering flow between two high pressure systems--one near Cabo San Lucas and the other west of Central America. It then moved inland near the El Salvador-Guatemala border, and dissipated overland. Under the influence of a persistent stationary trough near California, the remains of the depression retraced westward back over the open waters of the Pacific. Advisories on the system were resumed late on September 20\\\\. Though it was reconsidered a tropical cyclone, its wind circulation was poorly defined; the depression again degenerated into an open trough at 0000 UTC September 22. Its forward motion remained relatively unchanged for several days, and by September 24 the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone. After briefly drifting northward, the system began tracking toward the west-northwest. It gradually organized into a tropical storm at 0000 UTC September 25. Since it was then situated over favorable sea surface temperatures between and , Paul underwent a phase of rapid intensification. This allowed it to reach Category 1 hurricane strength on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) just two days after its naming. Upon becoming a hurricane, Paul turned to the north and continued to develop. As the storm neared Baja California Sur, it reached Category 2 intensity. An upper-level trough forced the hurricane to accelerate towards the northeast, at which point it had reached peak wind speeds of 110 mph (180 km/h). From 1800 to 2100 UTC on September 29, the eye of the hurricane made landfall along Baja California Sur, moving ashore less than south of La Paz near San Jos√© del Cabo. After weakening slightly inland, Paul briefly reemerged over water and subsequently made its final landfall near Los Mochis, Sinaloa with winds of 100 mph (165 km/h). Tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued shortly thereafter, though exact information on the storm after it moved inland is unavailable due to a lack of data completion in the hurricane database. Preparations Hurricane Paul after landfall. An alert was issued for the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa and Baja California Sur; army and navy units were on standby in case of an emergency. Roughly 50,000 people evacuated to storm shelters and thousands of others sought refuge in public buildings, such as schools and churches. Across La Paz, officials evacuated 3,000 families from hurricane-prone areas. In the towns of Altata and Guam√∫chil alone, army officials evacuated 5,000 coastal residents. Impact=El Salvador The tropical depression that later became Paul produced the worst natural disaster in El Salvador history since 1965. Although the death toll was initially believed to be lower it rose to a final toll of 761 after new victims were confirmed on September 28. Of these deaths, 312 occurred in the capital city of San Salvador, which had also sustained the worst damage. Another 40 people perished in Actoo, a very small village located west of San Salvador. Rescue workers searched through rocks and mud to find missing victims. About 25,000-30,000 people were left homeless. Much of San Salvador was submerged by flood waters of up to high, and even after their recession hundreds of homes remained buried under trees, debris, and of mud. In all, property damage from the storm amounted to $100 million in the country; while crop damage amounted to $250 million. Guatemala, and southern Mexico In Guatemala, widespread catastrophic floods claimed 615 lives and left 668 others missing. More than 10,000 people were left homeless in the wake of the disaster. According to the highway department, the storm destroyed 16 bridges which left 200 communities isolated from surrounding areas. Overall, economic losses of $100 million (1982 USD) were reported in the country. Throughout southern Mexico, floods from the precursor depression to Paul killed another 225 people. Baja California Sur Hurricane Paul produced heavy rainfall along its path through Baja California Sur. At least 85 homes in La Paz sustained damage, and many telephone lines in the region were down at the height of the storm. Wind gusts estimated at 120 mph (195 km/h) swept through San Jos√© del Cabo, causing property damage and subsequently leaving 9,000 homeless. Despite the damage, no deaths were reported in the wake of Paul. Northwest Mexico and southwest United States Upon making its final landfall in Sinaloa, Paul produced hurricane- force winds recorded at 100 mph (160 km/h) in Los Mochis. The winds demolished numerous homes in the region, leaving 140,000 residents homeless and another 400,000 people isolated. The greatest damage occurred 70 miles (110 km) south of Los Mochis in the city of Guamuchil; some houses suffered total destruction, while many other had their roof blown off. A total of 24 people were killed by the storm, although it produced beneficial rains over the region. The worst flooding occurred near the Rio Sinaloa; to of rain fell in some locations. Over 25,000 homes were damaged. Agricultural damage was severe in the state of Sinaloa, with up to 40 percent of the soybean crop destroyed. Sugar cane, tomato, and rice crops also sustained damage from the hurricane, and in its wake the state's corn production was down by 26 percent from the previous year. Total storm damage in Mexico amounted to $4.5 billion (1982 MXN; $70 million USD). The remnants of Paul moved into the United States, producing heavy rainfall in southern New Mexico and extreme West Texas. Inclement weather was observed as far inland as the Great Plains. A combination of rain and snow moved into Colorado; of snow was expected in Wyoming, thus winter storm warnings were required for parts of the state.  Aftermath  In the aftermath of the storm, the Government of El Salvador was criticized for failing to keep the public well informed. It provided over $300,000 in aid and declared a state of emergency; additionally, a state of mourning was declared. The United Nations World Food program began distributing food set aside for victims of the El Salvador Civil War. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala provided $25,000 in aid for the country. Mexican authorities rushed to supply food and water to the homeless.

In February 1952, the Squadron was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 26. During July 1954, the Squadron was relocated to Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina where it remained until 1966. On February 1, 1962, the Squadron's designation was changed to Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 262 and, in April through June 1965, HMM-262 participated in Operation Powerpack in the Dominican Republic. Vietnam HMM-262 was deployed to the Republic of Vietnam in December 1966 and subsequently reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 36, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. The squadron supported operation during the Vietnam War and operated from K·ª≥ H√†, Marble Mountain, Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Phu Bai and while participating in numerous operations throughout the country. Post Vietnam With the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam, HMM-262 relocated to MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii during 1971 and was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 24. While stationed at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, HMM-262 provided helicopter support to the 1st Marine Amphibious Brigade, FMF. In December 1976, HMM-262 was designated as the first Hawaii-based helicopter squadron to deploy to the western Pacific as a composite squadron. The squadron deployed aboard USS Tripoli on November 17 and remained the \\"Cutting Edge\\" of the 31st MAU for the next eight months. The Flying Tigers boarded in March 1990 to become the first Hawaii-based helicopter squadron to deploy aboard ship since 1985. In August 1990, HMM-262 deployed to Okinawa, Japan on UDP (Unit Deployment Plan) and re-positioned its flag in September 1990 to NAS Cubi Point, Republic of the Philippines, to become the ACE (air combat element) in support of Marine Air-Ground Task Force 4-90 (MAGTF 4-90). The squadron participated in emergency flood/earthquake relief efforts and was extended overseas due to Operation Desert Shield/Storm and returned to Hawaii on June 4, 1991. In September 1992, the Flying Tigers once again embarked aboard USS Belleau Wood and participated in Hurricane Iniki relief efforts on the island of Kauai. On September 27, 1992, the Squadron transferred its home base to MCAS Futenma, MAG-36, 1st MAW, Okinawa. This effectively transitioned the Flying Tigers to become the first permanently assigned HMM squadron in the region since 1978. Since 2000 In October 2001, HMM-262 (REIN) sent a detachment of personnel and aircraft aboard to the new nation of East Timor for humanitarian assistance operations. As all Unit Deployment Program personnel were frozen in December 2001, the squadron concluded the year with a \\"Be Prepared To\\" order to remain the ACE for the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) and to prepare for potential contingency operations. After 18 months as the ACE of the 31st MEU, the Squadron was again reassigned to MAG-36 and was named a Chief of Naval Operations Aviation Safety Award winner for calendar year 2002. In December 2004, HMM-262 deployed to the Philippines as part of Joint Task Force-535 in support of its Humanitarian Aid/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) mission. In only nine days of flying, the Squadron delivered over of food, water, and supplies to an isolated area that had been devastated by flooding and mudslides resulting from a succession of typhoons. A CH-46 from HMM-262 takes off from a field in Leyte as part of the humanitarian operations following the 2006 mudslides From January through March 2005, HMM-262 deployed aboard and as part of Joint Task Force-536 in support of Operation Unified Assistance, the HA/DR effort following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake/tsunami. Operating off the northwestern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, HMM-262 supported the effort by delivering aid and supplies to the victims of the massive tsunamis. During the period from January 14 to February 9, the Squadron delivered over of food, water, and other supplies to an area that spanned over of coastline. At the conclusion of this effort the squadron was selected to provide helicopter lift on 19 & 20 February 2005 for former Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush during their tour of the tsunami- devastated areas of Thailand and Indonesia. In February 2006, the squadron was again on board USS Essex as part of the 31st MEU when called to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by the 2006 Southern Leyte mudslide. In January 2007, HMM-262 deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. This marked the first combat deployment of the squadron since the Vietnam War. The squadron was based at Al Taqaddum Air Base and their mission was to provide assault support for II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) units in Al Anbar Province. From February to May 2007 the squadron flew 1,574 sorties totaling 2,532 flight hours. They also had one Marine killed in action On September 30, 2013, the CH-46E Sea Knights from HMM-262 made their final flight from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, and were retired to make way for the MV-22B Ospreys. HMM-262's CH-46Es were the last of their type in Okinawa, and the Pacific. The unit was re-designated as Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 262 (VMM-262). In November of 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest recorded typhoon in history, struck the Philippines. VMM-262 deployed a detachment of four Ospreys in support of Operation Damayan, carrying supplies and personnel throughout the damaged areas. The vast size of the affected area plus the lack of runways for traditional fixed wing aircraft made the Osprey the perfect platform for disaster relief. https://sldinfo.com/2013/11/flying- tigers-engage-in-support-of-the-philippine-rescue-effort/ When a 7.8 magnitude earthquake rocked the inland country Nepal in May 2015, VMM-262 self-deployed a detachment of MV-22B Ospreys from Okinawa to Kathmandu in order to support aid operations during Operation SAHAYOGI HAAT. Along with Joint Task Force 505, the Tigers delivered shelter material and food to disaster-stricken areas throughout the Himalayan mountains. https://www.marines.mil/News/News- Display/Article/588290/joint-personnel-us-marines-fly-critical-supplies-to- nepal-earthquake-survivors/ While attached to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit in the fall of 2018, VMM-262 Reinforced responded to Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands following Super Typhoon Yutu. V-22s and CH-53s from the Flying Tigers carried FEMA personnel, supplies, and Marines ashore to help provide relief to the stricken islands. https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/31st-meu-takes-lead-on-tinian/ In February 2020, VMM-262 was tasked with supporting the Singapore Air Show.

Her provocative poetry was published posthumously in 2011 in Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.Freytag-Loringhoven, Elsa von. Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag Loringhoven. Ed. Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011. The New York Times praised the book as one of the notable art books of 2011. Early life Elsa Pl√∂tz was born in Swinem√ºnde in Pomerania, Germany, to Adolf Pl√∂tz, a mason, and Ida Marie Kleist. Her relationship with her father was temperamental‚Äîshe emphasized how controlling he was in the family, as well as how cruel, yet big-hearted he was.Reilly, Eliza Jane. \\"Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven.\\" Woman's Art Journal 18, no. 1 (1997): 26-33. doi:10.2307/1358677 In her art, she related the ways that political structures promote masculine authority in family settings, maintaining the state's patriarchal societal order. Her discontent with her father's masculine control may have fostered her anti- patriarchal activist approach to life. On the other hand, the relationship that she had with her mother was full of admiration‚Äîher mother's craft involving the repurposing of found objects could have spawned Freytag- Loringhoven's utilization of street debris/found objects in her own artworks. She trained and worked as an actress and vaudeville performer and had numerous affairs with artists in Berlin, Munich and Italy. She studied art in Dachau, near Munich. She married Berlin-based architect August Endell in a civil service on August 22, 1901 in Berlin,Gammel, Irene. Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 109. becoming Elsa Endell. They had an \\"open relationship\\", and in 1902 she became romantically involved with a friend of Endell, the minor poet and translator Felix Paul Greve (who later went by the name Frederick Philip Grove). After the trio travelled together to Palermo, Sicily in late January 1903, the Endells' marriage disintegrated.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 129. They divorced in 1906.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 144.

In July 1910, Elsa joined him in the United States, where they operated a small farm in Sparta, Kentucky, not far from Cincinnati. Greve suddenly deserted her in 1911 and went west to a bonanza farm near Fargo, North Dakota, and to Manitoba in 1912. There are no records of a divorce from Greve.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 153. She started modeling for artists in Cincinnati, and made her way east via West Virginia and Philadelphia, and then she married her third husband, the German Baron Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven (son of Hugo von Freytag-Loringhoven), in November 1913 in New York. She later became known as \\"the dadaist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\\".  Work  Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven In New York City, Freytag-Loringhoven supported herself by working in a cigarette factory and by posing as a model for artists such as Louis Bouch√©, George Biddle, and Man Ray. She also appeared in works by George Grantham Bain and others; lithography by George Biddle; and paintings by Theresa Bernstein. Poetry Claude McRay (i.e. McKay) and Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven, before 1928 The Baroness was given a platform for her poetry in The Little Review, where, starting in 1918, her work was featured alongside chapters of James Joyce's Ulysses. Jane Heap considered the Baroness \\"the first American dada.\\" She was an early female pioneer of sound poetry,Gammel, Irene and Suzanne Zelazo. \\"'Harpsichords Metallic Howl‚Äî': The Baroness Elsa von Freytag- Loringhoven's Sound Poetry.\\" Modernism/modernity 18.2 (2011): 255-271. but also made creative use of the dash, while many of her portmanteau compositions, such as \\"Kissambushed\\" and \\"Phalluspistol,\\"Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo, \\"The First American Dada: Introduction,\\" in Freytag- Loringhoven, p. 17. present miniature poems. Most of her poems remained unpublished until the publications of Body Sweats. Her personal papers were preserved after her death by her editor, literary agent, artistic collaborator, and lover Djuna Barnes. University of Maryland Libraries acquired a collection of her work with the papers of Barnes in 1973 and subsequently separated von Freytag-Lorninghoven's papers and treated them as an individual collection. The collection contains correspondences, visual poems, and other artistic/literary works by the artist. The University of Maryland's special collections has an extensive digital archive of her manuscripts. Collage, performance and assemblage God (1917), by Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven and Morton Livingston Schamberg, gelatin silver print, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston In New York, the Baroness also worked on assemblage, sculptures and paintings, creating art out of the rubbish and refuse she collected from the streets. The Baroness was known to construct elaborate costumes from found objects, creating a \\"kind of living collage\\" that erased the boundaries between life and art. The Baroness' elaborate costumes both critiqued and challenged the bourgeoisie notions of feminine beauty and economic worth. She adorned herself with utilitarian objects like spoons, tin cans, and curtain rings, as well as street debris that she came across. The Baroness' use of her own body as medium was deliberate, to transform herself into a specific type of spectacle‚Äîone that women who complied to the constraints of femininity of the time would be humiliated to embody. By doing so, she controlled and established agency over the visual access to her own nudity, unhinged the presentational expectations of femininity by appearing androgynous, drew upon ideas of women's selfhood and sexual politics, and provided emphasis on her anti-consumerism and anti- aestheticism outlooks. She included her body's smells, perceived imperfections, and leakages in her body art, encompassing Irrational Modernism.Gammel, Irene. \\"Taking off Her Chemise in Public: New York Dada, Irrational Modernism, and the Baroness Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven.\\" Oxford Art Journal 28, no. 1 (2005): 135-38. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4500007.) Irrational Modernism \\"...maintains a finely calibrated balance between rationality and irrationality, reason and affect, public and personal. Boundaries are crossed, but not collapsed.\\" That being said, the placement of her raw, true personal body/self in a public space by her own means and her own fashion, could not be better explained than as Irrational Modernism. The Baroness' body art was not only a sculpture and living collage, but also a form of dadaist performance art and activism. Few artworks by the Baroness exist today. Several known found object works include Enduring Ornament (1913), Earring-Object (ca. 1917-1919), Cathedral (ca. 1918) and Limbswish (ca. 1920). Rediscovered by the Whitney Museum in New York City in 1996, her Portrait of Marcel Duchamp (1920‚Äì1922)Irene Gammel, Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity‚ÄîA Cultural Biography, MIT Press, 2003, pp. 466, 490, is another example of her assemblages. There has been new research indicating that some artworks attributed to other artists of the period can now either be partially attributed to the Baroness, or raise the possibility that she may have created the works. One work, called God (1917) had for a number of years been solely attributed to the artist Morton Livingston Schamberg. The Philadelphia Museum of Art, which collection includes God, now credits the Baroness as a co-author of this piece. Amelia Jones suggested that this artwork's concept and title was created by the Baroness, however, it was likely constructed by both Schamberg and the Baroness. This sculpture, God, involved a cast iron plumbing trap and a wooden mitre box, assembled in a phallic-like manner.Lappin, Lunda. \\"Dada Queen in the Bad Boys' Club: Baroness Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven.\\" Southwest Review 89, no. 2/3 (2004): 307-19. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43472537. Her concept behind the shape and choice of materials is indicative of her commentary on the worship and love that Americans have for plumbing that trumps all else; additionally, it is revealing of the Baroness's rejection of technology. Fountain (1917) Perhaps the most notable of plumbing sculptures in Modern Art history is Fountain (1917), by Marcel Duchamp. The ready-made has recently been connected to the Baroness speculatively.The iconic Fountain (1917) is not created by Marcel Duchamp, Theo Paijmans, June 2018A woman in the men's room: when will the art world recognise the real artist behind Duchamp's Fountain? The Guardian, 2019-03-29. This is, however, only supported by a \\"great deal of circumstantial evidence.\\" The speculation is largely based on a letter written by Marcel Duchamp to his sister Suzanne (dated April 11, 1917) where he refers to the famous ready-made: \\"One of my female friends under a masculine pseudonym, Richard Mutt, sent in a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.\\"Marcel Duchamp to Suzanne, 1917 Apr. 11. Part of the Jean Crotti papers, 1913-1973, bulk 1913-1961. Smithsonian Institution Archives of American Art. Literary historian Irene Gammel suggested in 2002 that the \\"female friend\\" in question was the Baroness. Duchamp never identified his female friend, but three candidates have been proposed: an early appearance of Duchamp's female alter ego Rrose S√©lavy, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven,Robert Reiss, \\"My Baroness: Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\\" in New York Dada, edited by Rudolf E. Kuenzli (New York: Willis Locker & Owens, 1986), pages 81-101. or Louise Norton (a close friend of Duchamp, later married to the avant-garde French composer Edgard Var√®se,David M. Lubin, Grand Illusions: American Art and the First World War, Oxford University Press, 2016, who contributed an essay to The Blind Man defending Fountain,The Blind Man, Vol. 2, 1917, p. 5 and whose address is discernible on the paper entry ticket in the Stieglitz photograph).Francis M. Naumann, New York Dada, 1915-23 (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1994), p. 239, note 17 \\"It is important to note, however, that Duchamp wrote ‚Äòsent‚Äô not ‚Äòmade‚Äô, and his words do not indicate that he was implying that someone else was the work‚Äôs creator.\\" Death In 1923, Freytag- Loringhoven went back to Berlin, expecting better opportunities to make money, but instead found an economically devastated post-World War I Germany. Despite her difficulties in the Weimar Republic, she remained in Germany, penniless and on the verge of insanity. Several friends in the expatriate community, in particular Bryher, Djuna Barnes, Berenice Abbott, and Peggy Guggenheim, provided emotional and financial support. Freytag-Loringhoven's mental stability steadily improved when she moved to Paris. She died on 14 December 1927 of gas suffocation after it was left on in her flat. She may have forgotten to turn the gas off, or someone else may have turned it on; the circumstances were not clear. She is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, Paris. In 1943, Freytag-Loringhoven's work was included in Guggenheim's show Exhibition by 31 Women at the Art of This Century gallery in New York. Biographies The Baroness was one of the \\"characters, one of the terrors of the district,\\" wrote her first biographer Djuna Barnes, whose book remained unfinished.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, p. 17. In Irrational Modernism: A Neurasthenic History of New York Dada, Amelia Jones provides a revisionist history of New York Dada, expressed through the life and works of The Baroness. The 2002 biography, Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity, by Irene Gammel, makes a case for the Baroness's artistic brilliance and avant-garde spirit. The book explores the Baroness's personal and artistic relationships with Djuna Barnes, Berenice Abbott, and Jane Heap, as well as with Duchamp, Man Ray, and William Carlos Williams. It shows the Baroness breaking every erotic boundary, reveling in anarchic performance, but the biography also presents her as Elsa's friend Emily Coleman saw her, \\"not as a saint or a madwoman, but as a woman of genius, alone in the world, frantic.\\"Gammel, Baroness Elsa, p. 16-17. In 2013, the artists Lily Benson and Cassandra Guan released The Filmballad of Mamadada, an experimental biopic on the Baroness. The story of The Baroness' life was told through contributions from over 50 artists and filmmakers. The film premiered at Copenhagen International Documentary Festival and was described as a, \\"playful and chaotic experiment that posits a return to a grand collective narrative via the postqueer populism of YouTube and crowdsourcing,\\" by Art Forum. Cultural references The novel Holy Skirts, by Rene Steinke, a finalist for the 2005 National Book Award, is based on the life of Freytag-Loringhoven. Holy Skirts comes from the title of a poem by Elsa. Freytag-Loringhoven also appears in Siri Hustvedt's 2019 novel Memories of the Future as \\"an insurrectionist inspiration for [Hustvedt's] narrator.\\" In August 2002, actress Brittany Murphy impersonated Elza in a photoshoot session to New York Times pictured by Jeff Riedel.

It was a more \\"edgy\\" song than their previous singles, made so by the inclusion of implied themes of adultery and erotic temptation in the lyrics., and was arranged to a brisk bossa nova-esque beat which was in stark contrast to the style of the group's first single Life In A Northern Town . There were two additional singles released in the UK by Blanco y Negro, a 7\\" shaped picture disc and a second limited edition release. Background The Love Parade is the only song on The Dream Academy's eponymous album not to be produced by David Gilmour. Instead, the band recruited Alan Tarney to work with them on the track. Tarney was brought in at the suggestion of Rough Trade Records founder Geoff Travis to work on \\"The Love Parade\\". \\"What happened was, we had a pretty good demo for ‚ÄúLove Parade,‚Äù and we loved it, and when we made the record with David, somehow we ever got 'round to it\\". Lead vocalist Nick Laird-Clowes noted that Tarney brought some \\"real special techniques\\" to the table: he tracked the vocals \\"12 or 15 times\\" during certain portions of the song. There were high hopes for the single, especially from Warners, and there was some degree of promotion of the song (such as a live performance on American Bandstand). However, the single failed to live up to the expectations of their debut single, \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", just making the top 40 (#36) in the US and reaching #68 in the UK.

They also host the Eid prayers in situations when there is no musalla or eidgah available or nearby to host the prayers. Etymology Jama masjid or jame masjid comes from the Persian term masjed-e jame (), from the Arabic language term masjid jƒÅmi‚Äò (), meaning \\"congregational mosque\\" . In Arabic, the term is simplified to jƒÅmi‚Äò (). In non-Arab Muslim nations, the word jƒÅmi‚Äò (\\"that which gathers, congregates or assembles\\") is often conflated with another word from the same root, jumu‚Äòah (), a term which refers to the Friday noon prayers () or the Friday itself ()., This is due to the fact that the jumu'ah prayers require congregations and are only held in congregational mosques, usually the main mosque or central mosque of a town or city, and hence they are also sometimes known as Friday mosques. The term is rendered similarly in transliterations from other languages, such as jame mosque, jami masjid, jameh mosque, jamia masjid, or jomeh mosque.

A motif may be repeated in a pattern or design, often many times, or may just occur once in a work. Types of motif A motif may be an element in the iconography of a particular subject or type of subject that is seen in other works, or may form the main subject, as the Master of Animals motif in ancient art typically does. The related motif of confronted animals is often seen alone, but may also be repeated, for example in Byzantine silk and other ancient textiles. Where the main subject of an artistic work such as a painting is a specific person, group, or moment in a narrative, that should be referred to as the \\"subject\\" of the work, not a motif, though the same thing may be a \\"motif\\" when part of another subject, or part of a work of decorative art such as a painting on a vase. Ornamental or decorative art can usually be analysed into a number of different elements, which can be called motifs. These may often, as in textile art, be repeated many times in a pattern. Important examples in Western art include acanthus, egg and dart,Lucy T. Shoe, Profiles of Greek Mouldings 1936, supplemented by Shoe, \\"Greek Mouldings of Kos and Rhodes\\", Hesperia 19.4 (October - December 1950:338-369 and illustrations) and various types of scrollwork. Elibelinde kilim motifs, symbolising fertility Many designs in Islamic culture are motifs, including those of the sun, moon, animals such as horses and lions, flowers, and landscapes. Motifs can have emotional effects and be used for propaganda. In kilim flatwoven carpets, motifs such as the hands-on-hips elibelinde are woven in to the design to express the hopes and concerns of the weavers: the elibelinde symbolises the female principle and fertility, including the desire for children. Pennsylvania Dutch motif known as a hex sign Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs are a familiar type of motif in the eastern portions of the United States. Their circular and symmetric design, and their use of brightly colored patterns from nature, such as stars, compass roses, doves, hearts, tulips, leaves, and feathers have made them quite popular. In some parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country, it is common to see these designs decorating barns and covered bridges. The idea of a motif has become used more broadly in discussing literature and other narrative arts for an element in the story that represents a theme.James H. Grayson.

Along with Mount Kinka and the Nagara River, it is one of the main symbols of the city.  History  Gifu Castle was first built by the Nikaid≈ç clan between 1201 and 1204 during the Kamakura Period.Gifu Castle Official Page . Gifu City Hall. Accessed January 11, 2008.Gifu Castle. Japan National Tourist Organization. Accessed May 7, 2008. Originally called Inabayama Castle (Á®≤ËëâÂ±±Âüé Inabayama-j≈ç), Gifu Castle has gone through a great number of repairs over the course of several generations. Even though it was famous as a physically powerful castle, it was once taken over by a mere sixteen men. During the Sengoku period a samurai by the name of Takenaka Hanbei went to the castle, ostensibly to visit his sick brother. In reality, he went to the castle not to visit his brother but to kill Sait≈ç Tatsuoki, the lord of castle. When Hanbei struck at him, Tatsuoki was very confused--believing an enemy army had come to attack him--and fled. Thus, Hanbei obtained Inabayama Castle with relative ease. Later, Hanbei returned the castle to his lord, but Tatsuoki had lost an immeasurable amount of reputation and honor due to his perceived cowardly flight from the castle. In 1567, Oda Nobunaga launched an attack on Mino Province from Sunomata Castle, led his forces across the Kiso River, and marched straight to the castle town of Inoguchi (now Gifu city) attracting the support of many Saito retainers along the way. Nobunaga laid siege to Inabayama Castle on 13 September. Even though the defenders were demoralized to see the banners of Saito retainers among the attacking army, the mountaintop castle was still in a nearly impregnable position. The siege took about two weeks. Near the end of the siege, Nobunaga's retainer Kinoshita T≈çkichir≈ç led a small party up the steep cliffs of Mount Kinka, entered the castle from the unguarded rear, and opened the front gates, allowing the attacking forces to enter. After Tatsuoki was defeated, Nobunaga claimed the castle and made it his primary base-of-operations. Nobunaga renamed the stronghold \\"Gifu Castle,\\" following an example set by an ancient Chinese practice. Nobunaga then proceeded to renovate the castle into a far more impressive and grandiose structure than its previous incarnation. Luis Frois, a renowned Jesuit Missionary from Portugal, was personally invited by Nobunaga to visit the castle. After a short stay in Gifu, Frois praised the castle's extraordinary beauty. The Battle of Gifu Castle in 1600 served as a prelude to both the Battle of Sekigahara and the destruction of Gifu Castle in the same year. After the demolition of the castle, part of the structure was brought to Kan≈ç Castle to the south to fortify its position. Present day Mount KinkaThe current version of Gifu Castle is a cement structure that was built in the 1950s, as the previous castle had been destroyed by the firebombings of the surrounding city during World War II. Inside the castle, there are three floors with exhibits representing the castle's past. With maps, weapons, pictures and other artifacts on display, visitors can recreate the story of Gifu Castle. On the top floor of the castle, an observation deck, visitors can enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of the surrounding area, including the Nagara River and Nagoya. At various points throughout the year, the castle is also open to night viewing, providing an awe-inspiring view of the city.Gifu City Walking Map. Gifu Lively City Public Corporation, 2007. The newly opened Gifu City Tower 43 also provides panoramic views of the city and is open late year-round; however, its views are limited to only a few compass directions. A short walk from the castle is a small archives museum, containing more artifacts from Gifu Castle. Also in this museum are pictures from major castles throughout Japan. Entry into this museum is included in the price to visit Gifu Castle, making it a worthwhile stop for visitors to Gifu Castle. Lights, walkways and signs that were added during 2005's beautification campaign make visiting the castle even more convenient and informative.Outline of Gifu City 2005. Gifu City Hall, April 2005.

His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879. During his reign, Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent.Hrvatski leksikon (1996‚Äì1997) Stjepan Antoljak, Pregled hrvatske povijesti, Split 1993., str. 43. Reign=Rise to power inscription of duke Branimir, c. 880 In 879, Branimir had Duke Zdeslav, a supporter of the Byzantine Empire, killed near Knin in a rebellion that he led.Iohannes Diaconus: Istoria Veneticorum, p. 142 Approval from the Holy See was brought about by Branimir's own actions to bring the Croats further away from the influence of Byzantium and closer to Rome. Duke Branimir wrote to Pope John VIII affirming this split from Byzantine and commitment to the Roman Papacy. During the solemn divine service in St. Peter's church in Rome in 879, Pope John VIII gave his blessing to the duke and the whole Croatian people, about which he informed Branimir in his letters. The Pope brought the very decision on 21 May 879, and confirmed it in his letter from 7 June 879. This day is marked today as the Croatian Diplomacy Day. In Branimir's time Venetians had to pay taxes to Croatia and to the Narentines for their ships traveling along the eastern Adriatic coast, while the Dalmatian cities under Byzantium paid 710 ducats of tribute to the Croatian ruler. In 880, the Pope asked Duke Branimir for help for an armed escort of his delegates across southern Dalmatia and Zahumlje. Religious policy Remains from Branimir's time on display in Zadar During Branimir's reign, the bishop of Nin recognized the supreme ecclesiastical authority of the bishop of Rome, unlike the archbishop of Split, who recognized the supremacy of the patriarch of Constantinople. Duke Branimir promoted the bishop of Nin to the Archbishopric of Split after the archbishop's death in the Patriarchate of Aquileia without knowledge of the Holy See, which worsened his relations with the pope. Under the influence of Methodus' baptising missions in 882 who made a stop in Croatia on his way from Moravia to Constantinople, Branimir endorsed parallel usage of Latin and Slavic in liturgy, which was not liked by the new pope, Stephen V. Throughout his reign, Duke Branimir worked on increasing his independence. He also undertook a pilgrimage to Cividale.

It is based on a Dave Robicheaux homonymous novel by James Lee Burke. Harley Peyton and Scott Frank wrote the screenplay. The film was followed by In the Electric Mist (2009), starring Tommy Lee Jones as Dave Robicheaux. In the sequel, Robicheaux still lives in Louisiana and has come out of retirement as an Iberia Parish sheriff's detective. Plot A former police detective and Vietnam veteran in New Orleans and a recovering alcoholic, Dave Robicheaux, is living a quiet life in the swamplands of Louisiana with his wife Annie. The couple's tranquility is shattered one day when a drug smuggler's plane crashes in a lake, right before their eyes. Robicheaux succeeds in rescuing a lone survivor, a Salvadoran girl, whom he and Annie quickly adopt and name Alafair. With the arrival of a DEA officer named Dautrieve and an inherent connection to Bubba Rocque, the leading drug kingpin in the area and Robicheaux's longtime friend from New Iberia, Dave becomes involved in solving the case and consequently finds himself and his family in danger. Robicheaux is assaulted by two thugs as a warning. With help from his former girlfriend Robin, an exotic dancer who still has feelings for him, he continues to investigate. His longtime acquaintance Bubba denies any involvement, but Dave warns him and Bubba's sultry wife Claudette that he is going to find out who is behind all this and do something about it. He tracks down one of the men who attacked him, Eddie Keats, and splits his head open with a pool cue in Keat's own bar. Killers come to the Robicheaux home late one night. Robicheaux is unable to prevent his wife Annie from being killed. He falls off the wagon and neglects the young girl they adopted. Robin comes to stay with them. Clearing his head, Robicheaux seeks vengeance against the three killers. He first goes after a large man called Toot, chasing him onto a streetcar and causing his death. Bubba and Claudette reassure a local mob boss named Giancano that they will not let this vendetta get out of hand, and Bubba gets into a fistfight with Robicheaux, falsely suspecting him of an affair with Claudette. Eddie Keats is found dead before Robicheaux can get to him. Going after the last and most dangerous of the killers, Victor Romero, he knows that someone else must be giving them orders. He finds Romero and kills him. Then, going to Bubba's home, Robicheaux discovers that it is Claudette who planned the hit. After overhearing Claudette confessing her plan to take over the drug business, Bubba appears and shoots Claudette, and Robicheaux calls in the crime. When he returns home, Robin has left forever, and all Robicheaux has left in his life is his daughter Alafair.

The condition is associated with the fear of contracting the disease in question. Some authors suggested that the condition must be referred to as nosophobiaHunter R.C.A, Lohrenz J.G., Schwartzman A.E. \\"Nosophobia and hypochondriasis in medical students\\". J Nerv Ment Dis 1964;130:147-52. Nikhil Thakur, Bogdan Preunca \\"Nosophobia presented as acute hypochondria\\". TMJ 56(2), 120 rather than \\"hypochondriasis\\", because the quoted studies show a very low percentage of hypochondriacal character of the condition, and hence the term \\"hypochondriasis\\" would have ominous therapeutic and prognostic indications. The reference suggests that the condition is associated with immediate preoccupation with the symptoms in question, leading the student to become unduly aware of various casual psychological and physiological dysfunctions; cases show little correlation with the severity of psychopathology, but rather with accidental factors related to learning and experience. Overview Baars (2001) writes that medical students who study \\"frightening diseases\\" for the first time routinely experience vivid delusions of having contracted such diseases, and describes it as a \\"temporary kind of hypochondria\\". Baars says that the experience is so common that it has become known as \\"medical student syndrome\\". Hodges (2004), reviewing the literature, said that \\"the first descriptions of medical students' disease appeared in the 1960s.\\" He may have been referring to the phrase, for the phenomenon itself was noted much earlier. George Lincoln Walton (1908) reported that :Medical instructors are continually consulted by students who fear that they have the diseases they are studying. The knowledge that pneumonia produces pain in a certain spot leads to a concentration of attention upon that region which causes any sensation there to give alarm. The mere knowledge of the location of the appendix transforms the most harmless sensations in that region into symptoms of serious menace. Hodges also said that it was suggested in the 1960s that: :This phenomenon caused a significant amount of stress for students and was present in approximately 70 to 80 percent of students... papers written in the 1980s and 1990s conceptualised the condition as an illness in the psychiatric spectrum of hypochondriasis.... Marcus found that the dream content of year two medical students frequently involved a preoccupation with personal illness. Marcus's subjects reported many dreams in which they suffered illnesses of the heart, the eyes and the bowels, among others. Hodges went on to describe work by Moss-Morris and P√©trie who saw medical students' disease as \\"a normal perceptual process, rather than a form of hypochondriasis.\\" Learning about a disease \\"creates a mental schema or representation of the illness which includes the label of the illness and the symptoms associated with the condition. Once this representation is formed, symptoms or bodily sensations that the individual is currently experiencing which are consistent with the schema may be noticed, while inconsistent symptoms are ignored.\\" Howes and Salkovskis (1998) noted that \\"medical students frequently develop fears and symptoms of illness. This has been termed medical students' disease, nosophobia, hypochondriasis of medical students, and medicalstudentitis.\\" They mentioned two studies, one concluding that about 70% of medical students have groundless medical fears during their studies, and one which found that 78.8% of a randomly chosen sample of medical students showed a history of \\"medical student disease.\\" However, they cite a number of studies showing a similar incidence of hypochondria in law students and other non-medical students, which they said call into question \\"the widely held view that medical students are more likely than others to have excessive anxiety about their health.\\" In popular culture An episode of the TV show Scrubs called \\"Our Driving Issues\\" features a class of medical students who, despite having been warned about medical students' disease, nevertheless suffer from it. In the Indian movie Dharmadhurai (Tamil) starring Vijay Sethupathy, one of the lead heroine Dr.Stella suffer from second year syndrome.

The Creighton Model was developed by Dr Thomas Hilgers, the founder and director of the Pope Paul VI Institute. This model, like the Billings ovulation method, is based on observations of cervical mucus to track fertility. Creighton can be used for both avoiding pregnancy and achieving pregnancy.  Conceptual basis  Hilgers describes the Creighton Model as being based on \\"a standardized modification of the Billings ovulation method\\", which was developed by John and Evelyn Billings in the 1960s.Creighton Model The Billingses issued a paper refuting the claim that the CrMS represents a standardization of the BOM. According to the Billingses said that those concepts are two different methods and should not be seen as interchangeable.Some Clarifications Concerning NaProTECHNOLOGY and the Billings Ovulation Method  Effectiveness  For avoiding pregnancy, the perfect-use failure rate of Creighton was 0.5%, which means that for each year that 1,000 couples using this method perfectly, that there are 5 unintended pregnancies. The typical-use failure rate, representing the fraction of couples using this method that actually had an unintended pregnancy, is reported as 3.2%.http://www.jabfm.org/content/22/2/147.long For achieving pregnancy, no large clinical trials have been performed comparing ART and NaProTechnology. Only observational one-arm studies have been published so far. In the larger of these two studies, 75% of couples trying to conceive received additional hormonal stimulation such as clomiphene. However, most of those researches are self-reported. For Dr. David Adamson, a clinical professor at Stanford University and the former president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, there isn't any evidence that this system is better than simply having sex regularly for achieving pregnancy.https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/inside-the-strange- heartbreaking-relentless-quest-for-a-natural-fertility-treatment/  References  Further reading  * Hilgers, Thomas W., M.D., The NaPro Technology Revolution: unleashing the Power in a Woman's Cycle.

In: Architectura recreationis, by J. Furttenbach A periaktos (plural form periaktoi, from a Greek word meaning revolving) is a device used for displaying and rapidly changing theatre scenes. It was first mentioned in Vitruvius's book on architecture, De architectura (c. 14 BC), but its most intense use began in Renaissance theatre, as a result of the work of important theatrical designers, such as Nicola Sabbatini (1574‚Äì1654). It consists of a revolving solid equilateral triangular prism made of wood. On each of its three faces, a different scene is painted, so that, by quickly revolving the periaktos, another face can appear to the audience. Other solid polygons can be used, such as cubes, but triangular prisms offer the best combination of simplicity, speed and number of scenes per device. A tabletop model of a set with two periaktoi A series of periaktoi positioned one after the other along the stage's depth can produce the illusion of a longer scene, composed by its faces as seen in perspective. These periaktoi must therefore be rotated simultaneously to a new position, thus achieving interesting illusions. This is made by coupling them by using sprocket gears at their bases and a flat chain or conveyor belt mechanical transmission system. A similar concept is used in some modern Trivision multi- message billboards, which are made up of a series of triangular prisms arranged so that they can be rotated to present three separate flat display surfaces in succession. Early motion picture mechanical devices, such as the praxinoscope, were also based on rapidly rotating solid polygons, which had the successive animation or photographic plates affixed or projected to each face, thus providing the optical illusion of movement.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at 266 mm (10.67 inches). About 7,500 people were affected, and damage was estimated at 100 million pesos (2005 MXN, US$9.3 million). Two people died related to the storm.  Meteorological history  A tropical wave accompanied by a weak surface low pressure area crossed Central America and eastern Mexico from June 24 through June 27. An area of disturbed weather associated with the system moved into the Bay of Campeche early on June 28, though initially unfavorable upper-level wind shear and land interaction limited initial development. It tracked west-northwestward at 8‚Äì16 km/h (5‚Äì10 mph), and after moving into open waters the organization of deep convection increased with curved banding features developing. Based on data from a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, it is estimated it developed into Tropical Depression Two at 18:00 UTC on June 28, while located about northeast of the city of Veracruz. At the time of its first advisory, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Veracruz to Tampico. About four hours after formation, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bret, upon which it attained a minimum central pressure of 1002 mbar. Shortly thereafter, its appearance on radar deteriorated, and convection warmed around the center. With a mid-level anticyclone over Texas, Bret tracked steadily to the west-northwest, and began to re-organize just before moving ashore; at 12:00 UTC on June 29, the storm made landfall just southeast of Tuxpan with winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). After crossing the coast, the storm quickly degenerated to tropical depression status, though Bret retained a well- organized cloud pattern with deep convection. The center turned to the north- northwest, and early on June 30 Bret dissipated inland over Mexico.  Impact  Tropical Storm Bret produced heavy rainfall along its path, with a peak 24‚Äëhour rainfall total of 266 mm (10.47 inches) recorded in El Raudal, Veracruz; several other locations reported over 4 inches (100 mm) of precipitation. The rainfall caused widespread flooding in Veracruz, especially in the city of Naranjos where an overflown river flooded portions of the city with 2 m (7 ft) of water. Bret killed two people in Mexico - one in Naranjos and the other in Cerro Azul. The damage total from Bret was estimated at 100 million pesos (2005 MXN, US$9.3 million). Shortly after the passage of the storm, the government of Veracruz opened 6,000 emergency storm shelters for impacted citizens. Floodwaters from the rainfall inundated scores of houses and cars, forcing 2,800 people to evacuate, and affecting 7,500 families in Veracruz. The Mexican Army, combined with the efforts of police officers and state officials, worked with amphibious vehicles to rescue families in flooded houses, of whom many waited on rooftops. Landslides from the flooding cut communications and left 66 villages temporarily isolated. Across Veracruz, the most affected localities were Naranjos, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Tamal√≠n, Tantima, Benito Ju√°rez, Tamiahua, and Tempoal de S√°nchez. The government of Veracruz declared a state of emergency for 14 municipalities. Damage in the state totaled over 100 million pesos (2005 MXN, US$9.3 million); the state government requested 100 million pesos (2005 MXN, US$9.3 million) in reconstruction aid.

Romero and starring Jason Beghe, Kate McNeil, John Pankow, and Joyce Van Patten. Its plot follows a young athlete who becomes a paralyzed quadriplegic, and develops a bond with an intelligent service monkey named \\"Ella\\" who becomes homicidal after she is injected with an experiment serum of human brain tissue. It is based on the 1983 British novel of the same title by Michael Stewart. Producers Peter Grunwald and Charles Evans of Orion Pictures acquired the rights to Stewart's novel in 1985, and began production two years later, with Romero assigned to direct. The film marked Romero's first major studio feature, and was his second-most expensive film at that time, with a budget of $7 million. The setting was changed from Oxford, England, where the novel was set, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a city in which Romero had long resided and often set his films. Principal photography of Monkey Shines took place in Pittsburgh in the late summer and early fall of 1987. It had a protracted post-production and editing process, as Romero shot more film than he had on any of his previous projects, particularly due to the use of live monkeys. Monkey Shines was released theatrically by Orion Pictures in July 1988, receiving mixed reviews and a lackluster box-office reception, grossing $5.3 million against its $7 million budget. In the intervening years, the film has been noted by critics as an offbeat entry in Romero's filmography, and has earned status as a minor cult film. Plot Law student and athlete Allan Mann is struck by a truck and the surgery to save him renders him quadriplegic. Allan fails to adjust to his condition, becoming suicidal and despondent. When Geoffrey Fisher, a scientist friend of his who has been experimenting with the injection of human brain tissue into Capuchin monkeys learns this, he is prompted to supply one of the experimental monkeys, named \\"Ella\\", to Allan as a helper. Ella is able to assist Allan with activities in the house that cannot be accomplished via his SNP-equipped wheelchair. Their relationship is amicable at first, with Allan's life being made much easier, and the two bond deeply, even sharing poignant moments with romantic music, but soon their interaction takes a decidedly sinister turn. Ella seems to become a telepathic receptacle for Allan's anger at his state and his desire for revenge against people who have wronged him for slights both real and imagined. Simultaneously, Allan develops a romantic relationship with Melanie Parker, a specialist in quadriplegia and helper monkeys who has assisted in training Ella. Ella's protectiveness progressively turns into an extreme envy, which Allan begins to notice after a series of violent incidents occur. First, Ella kills the pet bird of Allan's uncaring nurse, Maryanne, who lets the bird fly through the house on a whim; much to Allan's dismay. Maryanne accuses Allan of killing her pet bird despite having no proof and knowing Allan's condition would have prevented him from even touching it, and then quits in frustation. A short time later, Allan discovers his paralysis may be reversible, and that the incompetence of his egotistical surgeon, Dr. Wiseman‚Äîwith whom Allan's ex-girlfriend, Linda, is having an affair‚Äîwas the cause of it. Ella subsequently escapes from the house one night, tracking Linda and Dr. Wiseman to a cabin where they are having a romantic getaway. Using stolen matches, Ella lights their bed on fire, burning them to death. Suspecting that Ella is carrying out murder on his behalf, Allan grows frightened of her, but Melanie and Geoffrey assure him it is not possible. Despite this, Geoffrey takes Ella back to the lab at Allan's insistence, but Ella manages to overtake Geoffrey and escape. She returns to Allan's house, where she kills Allan's controlling, narcissistic mother Dorothy by electrocuting her in the bathtub with a hairdryer. Ella then strikes down Geoffrey, who arrives in search of her, by stabbing him with the very syringe of sodium pentobarbitone he had intended to use on her; before he dies, Geoffrey confesses to Allan the experimental procedures Ella has undergone. Allan attempts to exit the house, but Ella disables the power, preventing him from opening the electric-powered door. His multiple attempts to leave are thwarted by Ella, who eventually urinates in his lap as an act of defiance. Melanie, worried when Allan does not answer the phone, arrives, but Ella attacks her, causing her to hit her head and lose consciousness. Ella attempts to light Melanie on fire, but is unable to as she is soaked from the rainstorm outside. As a last resort, Ella attempts to inject Melanie with one of Geoffrey's pentobarbitone syringes, but Allan diverts her attention when he summons the strength to move his hand and engage his tape deck. The romantic music summons Ella to cuddle close to him. When Ella is under Allan's head, Allan bites her in the neck and kills her by thrashing his head back and forth in a violent manner, snapping her neck before finally relinquishing his bite and throwing her corpse into his tape deck. Later, Allan undergoes spinal surgery. While resting after the operation, he has a nightmare that he flatlines and Ella leaps out of his back while the doctor is making an incision. When he wakes up, Melanie reveals that the surgery was successful. Having regained his ability to move, Allan and Melanie leave the hospital together. CastAnalysis Film scholar Tony Williams interprets Monkey Shines as a \\"complex film dealing with the ambiguous nature of human motivations,\\" and humans' inability to deal with the consequences of their own desires. Journalist Michael Wilmington notes that the film's thematic weight rests in the presentation of the antagonistic monkey, Ella: \\"The audience that rejects her as a little toy-terror--or the movie as a piece of icy misanthropy which perversely trashes women, animals and quadraplegics--misses the point. Watching this movie, one loves Ella, bleeds for her, wishes desperately to preserve her from harm. But hell and humanity carry their own demands.\\" Production=Development United Artists had originally optioned Michael Stewart's novel, Monkey Shines (1983), for a film adaptation in 1984, having purchased the rights for $20,000. The option included film rights to another novel by Stewart, Far Cry (1984). However, seven months later, in 1985, the option expired, after which producer Charles Evans purchased the rights to the novel. Executive producer Gerald Paonessa commented that he had wanted George A. Romero to direct, as he felt he \\"had a wonderful, dark sense of humor.\\" Romero was convinced to direct after being shown script treatments of the project. Filming The film features Boo, a Capuchin monkey, similar to the one pictured Monkey Shines marked Romero's second feature film produced with a major studio, after 1982's Creepshow, as well as the second most-expensive. The production budget was approximately $7 million. The film was shot in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with principal photography beginning on July 31, 1987. Romero, a longtime resident of Pittsburgh who set most of his prior films there, chose the location. Additional filming occurred at the Mellon Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as a private barn in Murrysville, which was converted into the monkey training center which Melanie operates. Interiors of Allan's house were constructed by set designer Cletus Anderson, a longtime collaborator of Romero's. The film's shooting schedule was extensive, consisting of twelve-hour days. Romero's wife and assistant, Christine (who also appears in the film) commented that it was the \\"toughest shoot we've ever had.\\" For filming Boo, the capuchin monkey portraying Ella, Romero required multiple monkey doubles. Additionally, four puppets of the monkey were designed by Tom Savini, one of which was remote-controlled, each adorned with yak fur. Helping Hands, a service animal program from Boston, assisted with the monkeys featured in the film. Filming concluded in October 1987. Post-production At the time of filming, Romero commented that \\"Post-production on this will be very heavy. I hope to be finished by the end of March. It's a huge edit. I'm shooting more film than I ever have because of the monkeys... As our budgets grow, everything takes longer.\\" The film's distributor, Orion Pictures, was desperate for a hit, as it was in financial difficulty. First, the studio forced Romero to add a happy ending to the picture, a plot device which the director had long avoided in favor of more ambiguous endings; originally, Romero had intended to conclude the film in the same manner as its source novel, in which Allan does not recover from his accident. Second, after poor previews, the studio recut the film without Romero's knowledge to add a \\"shock\\" ending. Another issue was the film's overall length, as Romero had completed a very long and involved shooting script that numbered over 240 pages. This resulted in a first cut of which 40 to 50% of the shot footage met the cutting room floor in the need to get the film reduced to a practical length. Upset with the way his project had been handled, Romero returned to independent films. ;Alternate ending The original intended ending of the film was unreleased until 2014, when it was included as a bonus feature on its debut Blu-ray release. In the original ending, prior to Dorothy and Geoffrey's deaths, Geoffrey's boss Dean Harold Burbage (Stephen Root) steals the remaining brain tissue serum and injects it into all of Geoffrey's remaining test monkeys. After Allan regains his ability to move on his own, Burbage is assaulted by animal rights protesters who had earlier attacked Geoffrey for experimenting on monkeys. Burbage insults them then returns to the lab where it's discovered that all of the remaining monkeys have completely taken control of his mind. Release=Box office Monkey Shines was released theatrically in the United States on July 29, 1988, opening in 1,181 theaters. It grossed $1.9 million during its opening weekend. It eventually went on to gross a total of $5.3 million in the United States over its 22-week theatrical run. Critical response Several critics compared the portrayal of Ella to that of King Kong Several critics praised Monkey Shines for its portrayal of its philosophical themes: David Kehr of the Chicago Tribune heralded it as Romero's \\"most complex and challenging creations... [Romero's] is a style of philosophical fiction that seems hardly to belong to the 20th Century at all, but rather to the 18th Century school of Swift, Diderot and Voltaire. Like those authors, he uses satire as one of his principal tools and principal weapons,\\" concluding that, \\"Monkey Shines is an extremely thoughtful, provocative film; it's also a damn good horror movie.\\" Other critics, such as the Los Angeles Timess Michael Wilmington, commented on the film's characterization of Ella, and the relationship between her and Allan; comparing Ella to King Kong, Wilmington noted: \\"The story‚Äôs dark pivot is the symbiosis between Allan and Ella: a match made in hell. Ella, preternaturally sensitive to all her master‚Äôs desires, becomes infected with his hatreds--just as, in the lab, she‚Äôs been made addicted to a serum containing human brain tissue. It‚Äôs not a matter of the beast emerging against the human--but of humans perverting the beast.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post made similar observations about the character dynamic: \\"Alternating between comfort and revenge, [Ella] seems the ultimate victim, an unwitting pawn. Her scenes with Beghe are at once tender and terrifying as they battle it out to see who's the boss. Some closeups make Ella seem as ferocious as King Kong, but at other times she looks as if she's just been kicked out of the Garden of Eden.\\" Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic about the film, awarding it two and a half out of a possible four stars; the film's main flaw, wrote Ebert, was its being overlong with too many subplots: \\"Romero loses momentum in the closing passages because he has too many loose ends to keep track of. Somewhere within this movie's two hours or so is hidden an absolutely spellbinding 90-minute thriller.\\" Caryn James of The New York Times panned the film, writing that the screenplay \\"wraps up more loose ends than anyone cares about, yet leaves some nagging bits of illogic,\\" also criticizing the film for its \\"calm, and tedious, exposition.\\" The film was met with criticism from some disability rights organizations such as ADAPT and Adapting Society, due to an depiction of a toy monkey in a wheelchair in initial promotional materials. Members of ADAPT formed a picket line in wheelchairs at the Hollywood Pacific Theater the Saturday of the film's opening weekend. Bill Bolte, a member of Adapt California, commented: \\"The idea of a monkey attendant turning into a monster is appalling.\\" On August 10, Orion Pictures issued a public apology, removing the content from media advertisements for the film, promising to consult disability experts for promotional materials of upcoming projects. Monkey Shines holds a 53% approval rating on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 critic reviews, with its consensus reading: \\"While not one of horror legend George Romero's more evolved efforts, Monkey Shines delivers enough primal fear to satisfy more forgiving genre enthusiasts.\\" The film possesses a score of 71 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews. Contemporary film scholar John Kenneth Muir deemed Monkey Shines a \\"harrowing and fascinating film,\\" and praised its realistic depiction of the monkey, Ella. Home media Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on September 28, 1999. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray for the first time in November 2014. In November 2019, Scream Factory announced this Blu-ray would be going out of print in 2020. Trailer poem One of the trailer's showed a toy monkey banging its cymbals while sitting in a wheel chair. This trailer is known for its poem. :Once there was a man whose prison was a chair. The man had a monkey; they made the strangest pair. :The man was the prisoner; the monkey held the key. No matter how he tried, the man couldn't flee. :Locked in his prison, terrified and frail; The monkey wielding power, keeping him in jail. :The man tried to keep the monkey from his brain, but every move he made, became the monkeys game. :The monkey ruled the man, it climbed inside his head. And now as fate will have it...One of them was dead! In popular culture The Malcolm in the Middle episode \\"Monkey\\" parodies the film, as Craig Feldspar (David Anthony Higgins) was in an accident earlier in the series (\\"Dewey's Dog\\") and is confined to an electric wheel chair for six weeks. Rather than use his insurance money on a Nurse, He gets a helper monkey, \\"Oliver\\", who's later revealed to be deranged and homicidal.

It was one of the author's own favourite works. Plot summary The story is set in the city of Corrientes, part of the Argentine Littoral, on the shore of the Paran√° River. Eduardo Plarr is an unmarried medical doctor of English descent who when a boy left Paraguay with his mother to escape the political turmoil for Buenos Aires. His English father remained in Paraguay as a political rebel and, aside from a single hand-delivered letter, they never hear from him again. When Plarr moves to Corrientes, a quiet, subtropical backwater, he strikes up an acquaintance with the two other English inhabitants: a bitter elderly English teacher, Humphries, and the British Honorary Consul, Charles Fortnum. Fortnum is a divorced, self-pitying alcoholic who abuses his position for gain. Plarr's other acquaintance is Julio Saavedra, a forgotten but self-important Argentine writer of novels full of silent machismo. Visiting the town brothel with Saavedra, Plarr is attracted to a girl, Clara, but she is taken by another man. Later, when he is called to treat Fortnum's new wife, Plarr recognizes Clara. Although he has never been to England, Plarr regards himself as a cool, self-controlled Englishman. Nonetheless he finds himself obsessed by Clara and seduces her with a pair of highly decorative sunglasses. They then begin an affair in which he remains emotionally distant from her. \\"Caring is the only dangerous thing,\\" Plarr says in the novel. \\"Love was a claim which he wouldn't meet, a responsibility he would refuse to accept, a demand. So many times his mother had used the word when he was a child; it was like the threat of an armed robber. 'Put up your hands or else ...' Something was always asked in return: obedience, an apology, a kiss which one had no desire to give.\\" When Clara becomes pregnant Fortnum, believing the child is his, drinks less. Two of Plarr's friends from his Paraguayan Jesuit schooldays turn up at his surgery. One is Rivas, a married priest, now defrocked. They tell Plarr his father is alive and in a jail in Paraguay, and that they have a plot for which a doctor's assistance is needed to kidnap the US Ambassador on his trip to Corrientes to see ruins. They intend to ransom the ambassador for the release of political prisoners in Paraguay, including Plarr's father. However, they are incompetent and mistakenly kidnap Fortnum instead. They take him to a squalid hut in a shanty town while bargaining with the authorities. Plarr goes to the hut, where Fortnum, who has been shot in the leg while attempting to escape, lies drinking whisky. Fortnum spends much of his time, as he faces up to his impending death, sentimentalizing about Clara and remembering the fearsome figure of his father. He overhears Plarr confessing his adultery with Clara and that the child is Plarr's. The police surround the hut while the failed priest, Rivas, conducts a makeshift mass inside with the rain coming down. When the police deadline is about to expire, Plarr goes out to talk with them. The police shoot him dead, and his death is blamed on the kidnappers. The kidnappers are captured, and Fortnum restored to Clara. Plarr's mother, once a beauty and now bloated, along with some of his previous mistresses, attends his funeral. Saavedra reads a homily. The UK embassy then relieves Fortnum of his consulship and tell him he will be awarded an OBE in the next UK honours. In the last scene, Fortnum and Clara reconcile and name the child Eduardo, after Plarr. Adaptation The book was made into the 1983 film The Honorary Consul (also released as Beyond the Limit), directed by John Mackenzie, with Richard Gere as Plarr and Michael Caine as Fortnum. The soundtrack theme was composed by Paul McCartney and performed by John Williams.

Markelius played an important role in the post-war urban planning of Stockholm, for example in the creation of the model suburbs of V√§llingby (1950s) and Farsta (1960s). Biography Born in Stockholm, he attended the Royal Institute of Technology and the Academy of Arts in Stockholm from 1910 to 1915, later working at the offices of Ragnar √ñstberg and Erik Lallerstedt. He developed an early interest in housing and planning, was one of the founder members of CIAM in 1928, and participated in the modernist housing section of the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930), the birth of Swedish Functionalism. In 1931, he co-authored the book-length manifesto \\"acceptera\\", promoting modernism as a set of cultural values. His association with Swedish reformer Alva Myrdal (1902‚Äì1986) resulted in a design for a 57-unit communal-living Collective House in the center of Stockholm, in 1935. The building offered communal amenities like childcare facilities and shared kitchen and meeting spaces, all at least partly inspired by the Narkomfin Building in Moscow. Markelius lived in the Collective House himself for thirty years, serving as an unofficial handyman, to make sure the building still worked, and to demonstrate his commitment to the values of social housing. Meanwhile, among his major civic projects, Markelius began work on the Concert Hall in Helsingborg in 1932. In 1952, Markelius was nominated to the board of design consultants for the United Nations Secretariat Building by Sweden. Towards the end of his career the architect turned his attention to city planning. In 1949 Markelius took the Howland Memorial Prize, and in 1961 the Prince Eugen Medal. In 1962 Markelius was awarded a Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects.

In the background, Interstate 84 crosses between NY and PA just north of the monument. The New York‚ÄìPennsylvania border is the state line between the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania. It has three sections: * Along the center line of the Delaware River from the Tri-States Monument tripoint with New Jersey at the confluence of the Delaware with the Neversink River in Port Jervis, New York to the 42nd parallel north between Hancock, New York and Deposit, New York about 2.8 km downstream from Hale Eddy; above Hancock this is the West branch of the Delaware; * Across the 42nd parallel north to the corner of the Erie Triangle; * North along the east boundary of the Erie Triangle to Lake Erie. The survey of the 42nd parallel north was carried out in 1785‚Äì86 and accepted by the two states in 1787. The surveying technique that was used at the time was not especially accurate, and as such, this boundary wanders a bit on both sides of the true parallel.

The striped states are sometimes considered Southern. The culture of the Southern United States, or Southern culture, is a subculture of the United States. The combination of its unique history and the fact that many Southerners maintain‚Äîand even nurture‚Äîan identity separate from the rest of the country has led to it being the most studied and written-about region of the U.S. Southern culture has been and remains generally more socially conservative than that of the rest of the country. Because of the central role of agriculture and slavery in the antebellum economy, society remained stratified according to land ownership, and communities often developed strong attachment to their churches as the primary community institution. From its many cultural influences, the South developed its own unique customs, literature, cuisine, and music.Richard A. Peterson (1999-12-15). Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity. University of Chicago Press. p. 9. . History Slavery in the United States had a major role in shaping the South, its agricultural practices, the American Civil War, and segregation in the United States. The presence and practices of Native Americans and the landscape also played a role in Southern culture. The climate is conducive to growing tobacco, cotton, and other crops, and the red clay in many areas were used for the distinctive red-brick architecture of many commercial buildings. People=Anglo Americans In the time of their arrival, the predominant cultural influence on the Southern states was that of the English colonists who established the original English colonies in the region. In the 17th century, most were of Southern English origins, mostly from regions such as Kent, East Anglia and West Country who settled mostly on the coastal regions of the South but pushed as far inland as the Appalachian mountains by the 18th century. In the 18th century, large groups of Scots lowlanders, Northern English and Ulster-Scots (later called the Scots-Irish) settled in Appalachia and the Piedmont. Following them were larger numbers of English indentured servants from across the English Midlands and Southern England, they would be the largest group to settle in the Southern Colonies during the colonial period. They were often called \\"crackers\\", a derogatory epithet applied to rural, non-elite whites of south Georgia and north Florida.New Georgia Encyclopedia. Georgiaencyclopedia.org (2002-07-24). Retrieved on 2011-06-18. Before the American Revolution, the term was applied by the English, as a derogatory epithet for the non-elite settlers of the southern backcountry. This usage can be found in a passage from a letter to the Earl of Dartmouth, \\"I should explain ... what is meant by Crackers; a name they have got from being great boasters; they are a lawless set of rascals on the frontiers of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia, who often change their places of abode.\\" Most European Southerners today are of partial or majority English and Scots-Irish ancestry.David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.633‚Äì639 In previous censuses, over a third of Southern responders identified as being of English or partly English ancestry with 19,618,370 self-identifying as \\"English\\" on the 1980 census, followed by 12,709,872 identifying as Irish, 11,054,127 as Afro-American, and 10,742,903 as German. It should also be noted that those who did identify themselves of German ancestry were almost exclusively found in the northern border areas of the region which are adjacent to the American Mid-West. Those from the Tidewater area of Virginia and the Tidewater region of North Carolina identified themselves almost exclusively as of English origins, while those from the Piedmont areas were a mixture of English, Scotch-Irish, Scottish and Irish origins. South Georgia has a large Irish presence, the ancestors of whom were largely at one time Roman Catholic; however, many were converted to various Protestant sects due to the lack of a missionary presence of the Catholic Church in the 18th and 19th centuries. The predominance of Irish surnames in South Georgia has been noted by American historians for some time. Meanwhile, a community of Scottish highlanders settled around what is now Fayetteville in North Carolina. Gaelic was spoken in this region into the nineteenth century. People of many nationalities established communities in the American South. Some examples are the German American population of the Edwards Plateau of Texas, whose ancestors arrived in the region in the 1840s. German cultural influence continues to be felt in cities like New Braunfels, Texas near Austin and San Antonio Much of the population of East Texas, Louisiana, coastal Mississippi and Alabama, and Florida traces its primary ancestry to French and/or Spanish colonists of the 18th century. Also important is the French community of New Orleans dating back to the 1880s. African Americans The other primary population group in the South is made up of the African American descendants of the slaves brought into the South.Steven Hahn, A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration (2005)Jacqueline Jones, Labor of love, labor of sorrow: Black women, work, and the family, from slavery to the present (2009). African Americans comprise the United States' second largest racial minority, accounting for 13.6 percent of the total population according to the 2010 census, but accounted for nearly 45% of the Southern population during the Antebellum period and through the early 20th century. Despite Jim Crow era outflow to the North (see Great Migration (African American)), the majority of the black population has remained concentrated in the southern states, and blacks have been returning to the South in large numbers since the end of formal segregation (see New Great Migration).Sarah- Jane Saje Mathieu, \\"The African American great migration reconsidered.\\" OAH Magazine of History 23.4 (2009): 19-23 online. Religion The area roughly considered to constitute the \\"Bible Belt\\" Part of the South is known as the \\"Bible Belt\\", because of the prevalence there of evangelical Protestantism. South Florida has a large Jewish element that migrated from New York. Immigrants from Southeast Asia and South Asia have brought Buddhism and Hinduism to the region as well.\\"Overview: Religion and the U.S. South\\". Southernspaces.org (2004-03-16). Retrieved on 2011-06-18. In the colonial period and early 19th century the First Great Awakening and the Second Great Awakening transformed Southern religion. The evangelical religion was spread by religious revivals led by local lay Baptist ministers or itinerant Methodist ministers. They fashioned the nation's \\"Bible Belt.\\"Christine Leigh Heyrman, Southern Cross: The Beginnings of the Bible Belt (1998) After the Revolution, the Anglican Church of England was disestablished (meaning it no longer received local tax money) and was reorganized as the nationalised Protestant Episcopal Church of the USA. The Revolution turned more people toward Methodist and Baptist preachers in the South. The Cane Ridge Revival and subsequent \\"camp-meetings\\" on the Kentucky and Tennessee frontiers were the impetus behind the Restoration Movement. Traveling preachers used music and song to convert new members. Shape-note singing became a fundamental part of camp meetings in frontier regions. In the early decades of the 18th century, the Baptists in the South reduced their challenge to class and race. Rather than pressing for freedom for slaves, they encouraged planters to improve treatment of them, and ultimately used the Bible to justify slavery.Christine Leigh Heyrman, Southern Cross: The Beginnings of the Bible Belt, Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1998 First Baptist Church in Charleston, South Carolina In 1845, the Southern Baptist Convention separated from other regions. Baptist and Methodist churches proliferated across the Tidewater region, usually attracting common planters, artisans and workers. The wealthiest planters continued to be affiliated with the Episcopal Church. By the beginning of the Civil War, the Baptist and Methodist churches had attracted the most members in the South, and their churches were most numerous in the region. Historically Catholic colonists were primarily those from Spain and France who settled in coastal areas of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Today, there are significant Roman Catholic populations along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (especially the port cities of New Orleans, Biloxi, Pensacola and Mobile), which preserve the continuing (and broadly popularized) Catholic traditions of Carnival at the beginning of Lent in Mardi Gras parades and related customs. Elsewhere in the region, Catholics are typically a minority and of mainly Irish, German and French or modern Hispanic ancestry.As of 2013, Catholics comprised 42% of the population in the New Orleans Metropolitan area based on numbers presented by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans. Atlanta, in comparison to some other Southern cities, had a relatively small Roman Catholic population prior to the 1990s. Catholics comprised 1.7% of the population in 1960, and 3.1% of the population in 1980. The population has been growing rapidly since then. The number of Catholics grew from 292,300 members in 1998 to 900,000 members in 2010, an increase of 207 percent. The population was expected to top 1 million by 2011. The increase is fueled by Catholics moving to Atlanta from other parts of the U.S. and the world, and from newcomers to the church. About 16 percent of all metropolitan Atlanta residents are Catholic, comparable to many of Midwestern metropolitan areas. Raleigh, North Carolina also has a rapidly growing number of Catholics, with Catholicism having the largest number of affiliates out of any other religious group (11.3%) and the second largest number in Wake County (22%). Maryland, which was settled by the British, is historically Catholic as well and many historians believe it was named after the Queen Henrietta Maria by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron of Baltimore. Maryland was the only Roman Catholic British colony in the Americas, and was considered a refuge for England's Roman Catholic minority which was being persecuted by the Church of England.Maryland#cite note-washingtonpost.com-9 When William of Orange rose to power in England, Catholicism was outlawed in Maryland, causing a decrease in the number of practicing Catholics. In the 1840s, the Catholic population rebounded with the mass immigration of Irish due to the Great Famine of Ireland. Maryland also became home to many Polish and Italian immigrants. In general, the inland regions of the Deep South and Upper South, such as Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama were less attractive to immigrants and have stronger concentrations of Baptists, Methodists, Churches of Christ and other Protestant or non-Catholic fellowships. Eastern and northern Texas are heavily Protestant, while the southern and western parts of the state are predominantly Catholic. The city of Charleston, South Carolina, has had a significant Jewish population since the colonial period. The first were Sephardic Jews who had been living in London or on the island of Barbados. They were connected to Jewish communities in New England as well. The community figured prominently in the history of South Carolina. Richmond also had a large Sephardic Jewish community before the Revolution and still has a notable Jewish community today. They built the first synagogue in Virginia about 1791. New Orleans also historically (and in the present day) has a significant Jewish community. The South Florida area is home to the nation's second largest concentration of Jewish Americans outside New York, most of them early 20th century migrants and descendants from the Northeast. They were descendants of Ashkenazi Jews from Germany, Russia, Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe. Twentieth-century migration and business development have brought significant Jewish and Muslim communities to most major business and university cities, such as Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and more recently, Charlotte. Southern dialect Approximate extent of Southern American English, based upon multiple dialect studies.ASA 147th Meeting Lay Language Papers ‚Äì The Nationwide Speech Project .

Based on Labov, Ash, and Boberg 2006: 68. Southern American English is a group of dialects of the English language spoken throughout the Southern states of the United States, from West Virginia and Kentucky to the Gulf Coast, and from the mid-Atlantic coast to throughout most of Texas and Oklahoma. Southern dialects make up the largest accent group in the United States. Southern American English can be divided into different sub-dialects, with speech differing between regions. African American Vernacular English (AAVE) shares similarities with Southern dialect due to African Americans' strong historical ties to the region. It has been said that Southerners are most easily distinguished from other Americans by their speech, both in terms of accent and idiom. However, there is no single \\"Southern Accent.\\" Rather, Southern American English is a collection of dialects of the English spoken throughout the South. Southern American English can be divided into different sub-dialects, with speech differing between, for example, that of Appalachian region and the coastal \\"low country\\" around Charleston, South Carolina. Folklorists in the 1920s and later argued that because of the region's isolation, Appalachian language patterns more closely mirrored Elizabethan English than other accents in the United States.Wilson, Charles Morrow. \\"Elizabethan America.\\" Atlantic Monthly, August 1929, 238‚Äì44. Reprinted in Appalachian Images in Folk and Popular Culture, ed. W. K. McNeil, 205‚Äì14. 1989. While traces of African linguistic features remain in AAVE, there are a few distinctively African dialect groups in the South, the Gullah the most famous among them. Gullah is still spoken by some African Americans in the Low Country of South Carolina, Georgia and Northeast Florida, particularly the older generation. Also called Geechee in Georgia, the language and a strongly African culture developed because of the people's relative isolation in large communities, and continued importation of slaves from the same parts of Africa. As the enslaved people on large plantations were relatively undisturbed by whites, Gullah developed as a creole language, based on African forms. Similarly the people kept many African forms in religious rituals, foodways and similar transportable culture, all influenced by the new environment in the colonies. Other, less known African American dialect groups are the rural blacks of the Mississippi Basin, and Africatown near Mobile, Alabama, where the last known ship to arrive in the Americas with slaves was abandoned in 1860. There are several other unique linguistic enclaves in the American South. Among them is that of Tangier Island, Virginia, as well as the Outer Banks North Carolina, which some scholars claim preserves a unique English dialect from the colonial period. The New Orleans or \\"Yat\\" dialect is similar to Northeastern port city accents because of an influx of German and Irish immigrants similar to those of the Northeast. Many are familiar with the French-based Cajun French that is spoken in the southern half of Louisiana. Other distinct languages include Cajun French (Louisiana), and Isle√±o Spanish (Louisiana, see also Canarian Spanish). The US South also contains many indigenous languages from the Native American Muskogean, Caddoan, Siouan‚ÄìCatawban, Iroquoian, Algonquian, Yuchi, Chitimacha, Natchez, Tunica, Adai, Timucua and Atakapa families. The historical record seems to suggest a picture of great linguistic diversity (similar to California) although most languages mentioned were not documented. Several southeastern languages have become extinct and all are endangered. The influence of native languages has led to distinct Indian varieties of English. Regional variations There continues to be debate about what constitutes the basic elements of Southern culture. This debate is influenced partly because the South is such a large region. As a result, there are a number of cultural variations among states in the region. Among the variations found in Southern culture are: *The lowland South was first settled by the English in the Chesapeake colonies of Virginia and Maryland, and later in South Carolina. This was the first area developed as plantations for cash crops of tobacco, rice and indigo. Later, cotton, and hemp became important cash crops, as well. Planters imported large numbers of Africans as slave labor. The coastal areas were dominated by wealthy planters, who controlled local government. *Historical, political, and cultural divisions continue to divide the \\"upcountry\\" or \\"hill\\" culture of the Appalachian and Ozark mountain regions from that of low-lying areas such as the Virginia Tidewater, Gulf Coast, the Low Country of South Carolina and the Mississippi Delta. By contrast, farmers in the hill country cultivated land for subsistence, and few held slaves. The hill country's population has chiefly Scots-Irish and English ancestry. Because they were chiefly yeoman farmers, many upland areas did not support the Confederate cause during the American Civil War (see Andrew Johnson). Those in the hill country continued to support the Republican Party when the remainder of the white South supported Democrats. *Areas having experienced a large influx of newcomers typically have been less likely to hold onto a distinctly Southern identity and cultural influences. For this reason, urban areas during the Civil War were less likely to favor secession than agricultural areas. Today, partly because of continuing population migration patterns between urban areas in the North and South, historically \\"Southern\\" larger urban areas, such as Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville, Orlando, and San Antonio have assimilated modern metropolitan identities distinct from their historic \\"Southern\\" heritage. However, while these metropolitan areas have had their original southern culture somewhat diluted, they nonetheless have largely preserved their distinct \\"Southern\\" identity.The Georgia World Congress Center. About Atlanta, 17 November 2009. *Over the past half- century, numerous Latinos have migrated to the American South from Latin America, most notably in the cases of Texas and Florida. Urban areas such as Atlanta, New Orleans, Charlotte and Nashville have seen a major increase in Latino immigrants over the past ten to fifteen years. Factory and agribusiness jobs have also attracted Mexican and Latin American workers to more rural regions of the South. Alabama Southern Alabama north of Mobile was settled predominately by large plantation owners and slaves moved west from their original settlements on the coast South Carolina and Georgia. These settlers originally had slave plantations in Barbados and sought to expand their plantation based economy. This region is mainly known for its large African American population and historic cultivation of wheat, cotton, and rice. It is the epitome of what is considered the Deep South. Today, this region is the poorest in the state and one of the poorest regions in the country. It still remains mostly rural has seen minimal development. Unlike the rest of Southern Alabama which was settled by British plantation owners, Mobile and the Gulf Coast was settled by Spanish and French settlers much earlier than the rest of the state. Mobile likely has more in common with New Orleans than it does with the rest of the State. Today, Mobile still retains some of its French traditions such as having a large Catholic presence and annual celebrations of Mardi Gras.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1794 Northern Alabama was settled by Northern English and Scots Irish settlers who came to the United States to escape the nearly consistent war in the region. These Appalachian settlers were mostly small farmers who did not own any slaves and had little voting power due to the rich planters in the south who controlled the government. Today, this region is still mostly rural but is developing as cities like Birmingham and Huntsville attract outsiders for work.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1830 400pxthumbrightPlurality ancestry per US county, 2000: German English Norwegian Finnish Dutch Mexican Spanish Native \\"American\\" African American Irish French Italian Kentucky With its northern border at the boundary of the Upper South and the Midwest, Kentucky demonstrates multiple cultural influences. A study in the 1990s revealed that 79% of Kentuckians agreed they were living within the south. The study also showed that 84 percent of Texans, and 82 percent of Virginians believe they live in the south. Between 80‚Äì90% of residents in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Georgia and the Carolinas described themselves as southerners.UNC-CH surveys reveal where the 'real' South lies. Unc.edu (1999-06-02). Retrieved on 2011-06-18. This is likely because regional identification often varies dramatically within Kentucky. For example, many consider northern Kentucky to be the most Midwestern region as it shares culture with Cincinnati. Studies show that a significant minority of people in Northern Kentucky still identify with the South. Conversely, southern Ohio and southern Indiana are highly Southern in comparison to most of the Midwest, as is the \\"little Egypt\\" region of southern Illinois. Some sources treat Southern Indiana as essentially the upper tip of Upland South culture while others maintain that Southern culture, while significant, is not dominant in the region.\\"Traditional Arts Indiana Cultural Map ‚Äì South.\\" Traditional Arts Indiana, 2 May 2008. Louisville is viewed as culturally and economically Midwestern in some analyses, because it rapidly industrialized during the late 19th century (although not to the same extent as most northern cities), as opposed to the slow industrialization that occurred in the South.Meyer, David R. \\"Midwestern Industrialization and the American Manufacturing Belt in the Nineteenth Century.\\" The Journal of Economic History, Volume 49, Issue 4, December 1989 (Pages 921‚Äì937). Other observers consider Louisville to be southern culturally, due to dialect and various other aspects of culture. It is often described as both \\"the Gateway to the South\\" and \\"the northernmost Southern city and southernmost Northern city.\\" Unlike the remainder of the state, Louisville, Covington, and Newport received large numbers of German immigrants due to manufacturing interests on the Ohio river, thus making the culture there somewhat distinct from the rest of the state. Had Kentucky been a free-state, prior to the Civil War, it would have likely drawn more German immigration, as there was usually a relatively small number of slaves in the areas where Germans did settle. As of the 1980s the only counties in the United States where over half of the population cited \\"English\\" as their only ancestry group were all in the hills of eastern Kentucky (and made up virtually every county in this region).James Paul Allen and Eugene James Turner, We the People: An Atlas of America's Ethnic Diversity (Macmillan, 1988), 41. In the 1980 census 1,267,079 Kentuckians out of a total population of 2,554,359 cited that they were of English ancestry making them 49 percent of the state at that time. While varying degrees of southern cultural influence can be found in Kentucky inside the Cincinnati area and Louisville, smaller cities such as Owensboro, Bowling Green, Hopkinsville and Paducah, together with most of the state's rural areas, have continued to be more distinctly Southern in character. Outside of those two specific areas, southern culture, dialect, mannerisms, etc. are prominent. Southern cuisine is quite common across the state. Western Kentucky is famous for a regional style of southern barbecue, and other forms of southern food such as catfish, country ham, greens beans etc. can also be found. Today most of the state, outside of Northern Kentucky, shares a cultural identity with Tennessee and the rest of the Upland South in ancestry, dialect, and various other aspects of culture.Best of the Best from Mid-South Cookbook (Best of the Best Cookbook) (Best of the Best Regional Cookbook Series) (9781934193341): Gwen McKee, Barbara Moseley: Books.

North Carolina The Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham areas have attracted many new residents because of economic growth: banking/finance in Charlotte; universities and high-tech in Raleigh-Durham. Wilmington has also become a center of Midwestern & Northern migration for its temperate coastal climate and growing business community. Meanwhile Asheville and its surrounding area has tended to attract more progressively minded transplants due to its longstanding reputation as a center of liberal thought and open-minded attitudes, and retirees due to its scenic mountain setting. In addition to Northerners, the job markets in North Carolina's three largest metropolitan regions‚ÄîCharlotte, Raleigh-Durham and the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point Piedmont Triad‚Äîhave also attracted large and growing Latino and Asian American immigration and migration. A report released by the Brookings Institution in May 2006 entitled Diversity Spreads Out, noted that the Charlotte metro area ranked second nationally with a 49.8% growth rate in its Hispanic population between 2000 and 2004. The Raleigh-Durham metro area followed in third place with a 46.7% rate of growth. Oklahoma Settlement of the Oklahoma territory began as a direct result of the Civil War, with southerners escaping Reconstruction populating the southeastern region of the state, now commonly referred to as \\"Little Dixie\\". Italian laborers began arriving in eastern Oklahoma in the 1870s. Texas In the 1980 United States Census the largest ancestry group reported in Texas was English, with 3,083,323 Texans who identify as being of English ancestry forming roughly 27% of the population at the time. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original thirteen colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim \\"American\\" ancestry. Because of its size and unique history, particularly having once been Mexican territory, and later a nation in its own right (i.e. the Republic of Texas), Texas' modern-day relationship to the rest of the South is often a subject of debate and discussion. It has been described as \\"a Southern state, certainly, yet not completely in or of the South.\\" The size and cultural distinctiveness of Texas prohibit easy categorization of the entire state into any recognized region. Geographic, economic and cultural diversity among regions of the state preclude treating Texas as a region in its own right. Notable extremes range from East Texas, which is often considered an extension of the Deep South, to Far West Texas, which is generally acknowledged to be part of the interior Southwest. The upper Texas Panhandle and the South Plains areas of West Texas do not easily fit into either category. The former has much in common both culturally and geographically with Midwestern states like Kansas and Nebraska. The South Plains, though originally settled primarily by Anglo Southerners, has become a blend of both Southern and Southwestern culture due to rapidly increasing Hispanic population. The larger cities of Texas, such as Austin, Dallas and Houston‚Äîwith their burgeoning knowledge-based economies‚Äîhave attracted migrants from other regions of the United States, particularly the Midwest and West Coast. Combined with the influence of increasing numbers from an African American New Great Migration,William H. Frey (May 2004). \\"The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965-to the present\\". Brookings Institution. brookings.edu. Retrieved July 10, 2017. and also from Latin America and Asia, the historic \\"Southern culture\\" has been transformed. However‚Äîpartly due to its membership in the Confederacy and history as part of the Solid South‚Äîand the fact much of the state is in the Bible Belt‚Äîit is usually considered more of a Southern than a Western state. Also, linguistic maps of Texas place most of it within the spheres of upper, mid- and Gulf- Southern dialects, helping to further identify the state as being essentially Southern (use of Southern colloquialisms such as y'all and ain't are still very much widespread in Texas). Virginia Based on a study from the late 1990s, 82% of Virginians believe they live in the South and most identify more with the South than with any other region. They uphold many traditions and beliefs of the South and take pride in their heritage. However, Northern Virginia, Richmond, and the Hampton Roads region have attracted many internal migrants coming for job opportunities with the federal government, military, and related businesses during and after World War II, due to the emergence and expansion of the Northeast Megalopolis. More expansion resulted from the dot- com bubble around the start of the 21st century. Economically linked to Washington, D.C. and having a large migrant presence, residents of urban areas in Virginia tend to consider its culture more Mid-Atlantic than Southern.http://statchatva.org/2015/11/23/northern-virginia/ Virginian culture was spread across the Chesapeake region during colonial times by settlers and strongly influenced the culture of the Lowland South through the transport of slaves. Virginia's coastal areas were heavily plantation based, relying on tobacco. Prior to the Civil War, Virginia was the largest slave state and profited greatly from breeding and selling slaves to the Deep South. These slaves were thoroughly integrated into colonial Virginian culture and brought their traditions from Virginia to the Deep South where they blended with Gullah and Creole traditions. Following the Civil War and Reconstruction, Virginia went through the dark period of Jim Crow and faced the era of Massive Resistance to school desegregation. However, cities like Richmond and Norfolk have always been much more progressive and urban in culture than the more rural areas. They were known early on for having large Free Black, Quaker, and Jewish populations, much industry, and significant immigration from Eastern Europe up until the Civil War, in which Richmond was made the Confederate capital despite voting against secession.https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/the-north-of-the- south/ Today, Richmond and Norfolk are often considered the border between the Mid-Atlantic and Upper South having distinct Southern characteristics and ties to the Northeast Megalopolis.http://www.america2050.org/northeast.html These remain the only two large cities in the country in which old fashioned Chesapeake Bay style culture is found with the distinctive Tidewater accent and many historic plantations still prevalent throughout the region. Modern Virginia has seen an ongoing tendency for Northeasterners who move to the state to identify separately from the rest of the South politically and culturally. However, they choose to remain in Virginia for better economic opportunities than are available further North, as well as the low tax rates. West Virginia West Virginia was formed during the American Civil War in 1863 from 50 western counties of Virginia and is currently composed of 55 counties. Many of the counties in the new state had supported Virginia and the Confederacy during the war but were included for territorial reasons, which resulted in a \\"Redeemer\\" government in 1876.Foner, Eric, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863‚Äì1877, Harper Collins, 1988, pg. 39. Sullivan, Ken (ed.), The West Virginia Encyclopedia, West Virginia Humanities Council, 2006, pg. 607. Many legacies of its Virginia heritage remain, such as county and local place names. The state constitution is based on the antebellum constitution of Virginia. As recently as 2007 an 1849 Virginia statute was used in a county prosecution. Historic plantation houses are found throughout the state, legacies of its antebellum origins. West Virginia was the last slave state admitted to the Union. The state legislature consists of a senate and a house of delegates. The state government belongs to the Southern Governors Association and the Southern Legislative Conference.Southern Governors Association It is the 7th most Protestant state and the 7th most religious state in the United States. Out migration has been a steady phenomenon, beginning after the Civil War when ex-Confederates moved into southern Ohio to escape the political sanctions in their new home state. In the 20th century out migration increased as West Virginians moved north for jobs in industry.Where Are the West Virginians? West Virginia has a high rate of family owned farms and the state produces large numbers of poultry, corn, apples and peaches. Tobacco production peaked in 1909 at 14,400,000 pounds, and was the second most valuable crop as recently as 1983 but is no longer a popular commodity.Sullivan, Ken (ed.), The West Virginia Encyclopedia, West Virginia Humanities Council, 2006, pg. 708. Many southern dishes are common in the state; biscuits and sausage gravy, chicken and dumplings, sweet tea, cornbread and beans and condiments such as cole slaw and chow chow accompany barbecued meats. The southern diet has been blamed for health problems such as obesity and diabetes and smoking is among the highest rates in the United States. Southern Appalachian dialect can be heard in much of the state though mostly south of Clarksburg. Country music is one of the most popular genres in the state, WWVA Jamboree out of Wheeling was the second oldest venue for country music after the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. Charleston is one of the highest per capita markets for country music. Some of West Virginia's notable musicians include Little Jimmy Dickens, Brad Paisley, Hazel Dickens, Red Sovine, Hawkshaw Hawkins, Molly O'Day and the rockabilly musician Hasil Adkins. Maryland Similar to other Border States, Maryland has regions that are culturally Southern. Prior to the second half of the 20th Century, Maryland was largely Southern with strong connections to northern industry as Baltimore served as a center for grain trading. However, economic growth and demographic shifts of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s overshadowed Maryland's Southern culture. The growing service economy and ensuing southward migration of New Englanders and more solidly Northeastern workers transformed the I-95 corridor and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area into robustly Mid- Atlantic areas. After the election of Barack Obama the Washington region has refused to be identified as Southern leading Southern Maryland to consider secession but ultimately siding with the state. Portions of Maryland, specifically Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore of Maryland remain largely culturally Southern, driven by agriculture and commercial fishing. Most of the land is rural and there are but a few large population centers. Many local restaurants in those two areas still serve sweet tea and dishes including or composed entirely of greens in addition to menus heavy with fried food. Many dialectic studies show that St. Mary's County in Southern Maryland and Dorchester County, Somerset County, Wicomico County, and Worcester County in the Eastern Shore have southern accents. Western Maryland is considered Appalachian, and remains largely rural. That region is very similar to the neighboring West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Beyond the Census- classified SouthMissouri= Missouri is classified as a Midwestern state by the Census Bureau and some of its residents. St. Louis was known as the \\"Gateway to the West\\" when settlement was expanding. The northern edge of the Ozark Plateau was settled chiefly by mid-to-late 19th century German immigrants, however, who founded numerous vineyards and wineries. Due to this, Missouri was the second-largest wine-producing state before Prohibition, which destroyed the industry. Wineries have been rebuilt since the later decades of the 20th century, and Missouri wineries are competing well in national festivals. Part of the Missouri River valley, from beyond St. Louis suburbs in St. Charles County to east of Jefferson City, is known as the Missouri Rhineland because of the extensive vineyards and wineries based on German immigrant tradition and descendants. In the antebellum years, many settlers from Upper South states such as Virginia and Kentucky migrated to the counties of central and western Missouri along the Missouri River, where they could cultivate tobacco and hemp. Because these southerners brought their culture and slaveholding with them, Missouri was admitted to the Union as a slaveholding state. In modern times, this area became known as Little Dixie. Before the Civil War, six of the counties included in this area had populations in which more than 25% were enslaved African Americans, the highest concentrations in the state outside the cotton plantations in the Mississippi Delta.T. J. Stiles, Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War, New York: Vintage Books pbk, 2003, pp.10‚Äì11 map Antebellum houses typical of the South still stand in some of Little Dixie. All the crops grown there today are corn, soybeans and wheat, for which the area was better suited than for Southern crops like cotton or tobacco. Rural southern Missouri in the Ozark Plateau and the bootheel are definitively southern in culture. =Midwest, Southwest, and West= Many areas of New Mexico, Arizona and California were predominantly settled by European American southerners as they moved west in the 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, pro-Confederate governments were established in what is now Arizona and New Mexico during the Civil War and, at one point, southern California was on the cusp of breaking away from northern California and joining the Confederacy. In the aftermath of the Civil War, several freedmen's towns were founded by emancipated African Americans from the south. Southerners migrated to industrial cities in the Midwest for work before and after World War II. They went to Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, as well as Missouri and Illinois. During the Great Depression and Dust Bowl crisis, a large influx of migrants from areas such as Oklahoma, Arkansas and the Texas Panhandle settled in California. These \\"Okie\\" and \\"Arkie\\" migrants and their descendants remain a strong influence on the culture of the Central Valley of California, especially around the cities of Bakersfield and Fresno. More than 6.5 million African Americans left the segregated South for the industrial cities of the Midwest and West Coast during the Great Migration, beginning in World War I and extending to 1970. Many migrants from Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas moved to California during and after World War II because of jobs in the defense industry. As a result, many African Americans as well as European Americans have \\"Northern\\" and \\"Southern\\" branches of their families. Significant parts of African-American culture, such as music, literary forms and cuisine, have been rooted in the South but have changed with urban northern and western influences, too. Cuisine A wood-fired barbecue pit at Wilbur's Barbecue ‚Äì Goldsboro, North Carolina As an important feature of Southern culture, the cuisine of the South is often described as one of its most distinctive traits. Popular sayings include \\"Food is Love\\" and \\"If it ain't fried it ain't cooked\\". Southern culinary culture has readily adopted Native American influences. Corn meal cereal known as \\"grits\\", cornfritters, cornbread and brunswick stew are a few of the more common examples of foods adopted directly from southeastern Indians. Nevertheless, a great many regional varieties have also developed. The variety of cuisines range from Tex-Mex cuisine, Cajun and Creole, traditional antebellum fare, all types of seafood, and Carolina, Virginia (which shares strong similarities with North Carolina) and Memphis styles of Barbecue. Traditional African American Southern food is often called soul food. While not typically as spicy as cajun food, it incorporates a variety of herbs, flour, and can also be called stick-to-your-ribs food. Of course, most Southern cities and even some smaller towns now offer a wide variety of cuisines of other origins such as Chinese, Italian, French, Middle Eastern, as well as restaurants still serving primarily Southern specialties, so-called \\"home cooking\\" establishments. Some notable \\"home cooking\\" meals include: fried chicken, corn on the cob, greens with pot liquor, vegetable stew, chicken and dumplings, and chicken fried steak. Drink Iced tea is commonly associated with the South. Specifically, sweet tea, or brewed iced tea sweetened with granulated sugar, has traditionally been served in the South. In fact, most southern restaurants serve sweet tea in addition to \\"unsweet tea\\", whereas most restaurants in other regions serve only (unsweetened) iced tea. Iced tea with lemon Many of the most popular American soft drinks originated in the South (Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Big Red, Dr Pepper, RC Cola, and RC Cola's Nehi brand products). In much of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Texas, and other parts of the South, the term \\"soft drink\\" or \\"soda\\" is discarded in favor of \\"Coke\\" (see Genericized trademark). Some people use the term \\"co-cola\\", shortened from Coca-Cola, when ordering a soft drink. Official support for Prohibition existed in the Southern states before and after the 18th Amendment was in force in the USA. Due to widespread restrictions on alcohol production, illegally distilled liquor or moonshine has long been associated (often rather stereotypically) with working class and poor people in much of the region, especially in southern Appalachia. Many southern states are control states that monopolize and highly regulate the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages. Many counties in the South, particularly outside of the large metropolitan areas, are dry counties that do not allow for alcohol sales in retail outlets. However, many dry counties still allow for \\"private clubs\\" often with low daily fees to serve alcohol on the premises. New Orleans is known as \\"the City that Care Forgot\\", epitomized by the saying laissez les bons temps rouler (let the good times roll). The Crescent City's culture revolves around food, drink, and community celebrations. Hurricanes are a famous French Quarter drink, as are sazerac cocktails and absinthe. The upper South, specifically Kentucky, is known for its production of bourbon whiskey, which is a popular base for cocktails. As of 2005, Kentucky was credited with producing 95% of the world's bourbon, which has been referred to as America's only native spirit. The mint julep is traditionally depicted as a popular beverage among more affluent Southerners. Many other bourbons are produced in Kentucky including Evan Williams, Wild Turkey and Bulleit. Southern Comfort is a flavored distilled spirit modeled after bourbon and made in Louisiana. Another form of spirit produced in the South is Tennessee Whiskey, with Jack Daniel's, made in Lynchburg, Tennessee being the number one selling whiskey in the world. George Dickel, is produced in nearby Tullahoma, Tennessee. Literature Born in the Little Dixie region of Missouri to parents who had recently emigrated from Tennessee, Mark Twain is often placed within the pantheon of great Southern writers. Many of his works demonstrate his extensive knowledge of the Mississippi River and the South; also included in his works as a frequent theme were the injustice of slavery and the culture of Protestant public morality. One of the best known southern writers of the 20th century is William Faulkner, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949. Faulkner brought new techniques such as stream of consciousness and complex techniques to American writing (such as in his novel As I Lay Dying). Faulkner was part of the Southern Renaissance movement. The Southern Renaissance (also known as Southern Renascence)Tate, Allen, The New Provincialism, 1945 was the reinvigoration of American Southern literature that began in the 1920s and 1930s with the appearance of writers such as Faulkner, Caroline Gordon, Elizabeth Madox Roberts, Katherine Anne Porter, Allen Tate, Tennessee Williams, and Robert Penn Warren, among others. The Southern Renaissance was the first mainstream movement within Southern literature to address the criticisms of Southern cultural and intellectual life that had emerged both from within the Southern literary tradition and from outsiders, most notably the satirist H. L. Mencken. In the 1920s Mencken led the attack on the genteel tradition in American literature, ridiculing the provincialism of American intellectual life. In his 1920 essay \\"The Sahara of the Bozart\\" (a pun on a Southern pronunciation of 'beaux-arts') he singled out the South as the most provincial and intellectually barren region of the US, claiming that since the Civil War, intellectual and cultural life there had gone into terminal decline.Mencken, H. L. \\"The Sahara of the Bozart\\", Prejudices, 2nd series, 1920 This created a storm of protest from within conservative circles in the South. However, many emerging Southern writers who were already highly critical of contemporary life in the South were emboldened by Mencken's essay. On the other hand, Mencken's subsequent bitter attacks on aspects of Southern culture that they valued amazed and horrified them. In response to the attacks of Mencken and his imitators, Southern writers were provoked to a reassertion of Southern uniqueness and a deeper exploration of the theme of Southern identity.Shapiro, Edward S. \\"The Southern Agrarians, H. L. Mencken, and the Quest for Southern Identity\\", American Studies 12 (1972): 75‚Äì92. Other well-known Southern writers include Erskine Caldwell, Edgar Allan Poe, Joel Chandler Harris, Sidney Lanier, Cleanth Brooks, Pat Conroy, Harper Lee, Zora Neale Hurston, Eudora Welty, Ralph Ellison, Thomas Wolfe, William Styron, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers, James Dickey, Willie Morris, Tom Wolfe, Truman Capote, Walker Percy, Charles Portis, Barry Hannah, Alice Walker, Cormac McCarthy, Anne Rice, Shelby Foote, John Grisham, Charlaine Harris, James Agee, Hunter S. Thompson, Wendell Berry, Bobbie Ann Mason, Harry Crews and the authors known as the Southern Agrarians. Possibly the most famous southern novel of the 20th-century is Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, published in 1937. Another famous southern novel, To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, won the Pulitzer Prize after it was published in 1960. Music Country music originated in the Southern United States, and the country music industry is based in Nashville, Tennessee The musical heritage of the South was developed by both whites and blacks, both influencing each other directly and indirectly. The South's musical history actually starts before the Civil War, with the songs of the African slaves and the traditional folk music brought from Britain and Ireland. Blues was developed in the rural South by African Americans at the beginning of the 20th century. In addition, old-time music, gospel music, spirituals, country music, rhythm and blues, soul music, funk, rock and roll, beach music, bluegrass, jazz (including ragtime, popularized by Southerner Scott Joplin), zydeco, and Appalachian folk music were either born in the South or developed in the region. In general, country music is based on the folk music of white Southerners, and blues and rhythm and blues is based on African American southern forms. However, whites and blacks alike have contributed to each of these genres, and there is a considerable overlap between the traditional music of blacks and whites in the South, particularly in gospel music forms. A stylish variant of country music (predominantly produced in Nashville) has been a consistent, widespread fixture of American pop since the 1950s, while insurgent forms (i.e. bluegrass) have traditionally appealed to more discerning sub-cultural and rural audiences. Blues dominated the African American music charts from the advent of modern recording until the mid-1950s, when it was supplanted by the less guttural and forlorn sounds of rock and R&B.; Nevertheless, unadulterated blues (along with early rock and roll) is still the subject of reverential adoration throughout much of Europe and cult popularity in isolated pockets of the United States. Zydeco, Cajun and swamp pop, despite having never enjoyed greater regional or mainstream popularity, still thrive throughout French Louisiana and its peripheries, such as Southeastern Texas. These unique Louisianan styles of folk music are celebrated as part of the traditional heritage of the people of Louisiana. Conversely, bluegrass music has acquired a sophisticated cachet and distinct identity from mainstream country music through the fusion recordings of artists like Bela Fleck, David Grisman, and the New Grass Revival; traditional bluegrass and Appalachian mountain music experienced a strong resurgence after the release of 2001's O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Elvis Presley is an iconic rock and roll musician from the South Rock n' roll largely began in the South in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Early rock n' roll musicians from the South include Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Bo Diddley, Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, James Brown, Otis Redding, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, among many others. Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash, while generally regarded as \\"country\\" singers, also had a significant role in the development of rock music, giving rise to the original \\"crossover\\" genre of rockabilly. In the 1960s, Stax Records emerged as a leading competitor of Motown Records, laying thegroundwork for later stylistic innovations in the process. The South has continued to produce rock music in later decades. In the 1970s, a wave of Southern rock and blues rock groups, led by The Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, and 38 Special, became popular. Macon, Georgia-based Capricorn Records helped to spearhead the Southern rock movement, and was the original home to many of the genre's most famous groups. At the other end of the spectrum, along with the aforementioned Brown and Stax, New Orleans' Allen Toussaint and The Meters helped to define the funk subgenre of rhythm and blues in the 1970s. Many who got their start in the regional show business in the South eventually banked on mainstream national and international success as well: Elvis Presley and Dolly Parton are two such examples of artists that have transcended genres. Many of the roots of alternative rock are often considered to come from the South as well, with bands such as R.E.M., Pylon, the B-52s, and Indigo Girls forever associated with the musically fertile college town of Athens, Georgia. Cities such as Austin, Knoxville, Chapel Hill, Nashville and Atlanta also have thriving indie rock and live music scenes. Austin is home to the long-running South by Southwest music and arts festival, while several influential independent music labels (Sugar Hill, Merge, Yep Rock and the now-defunct Mammoth Records) were founded in the Chapel Hill area. Several influential death metal bands have recorded albums at Morrisound Recording in Temple Terrace, Florida and the studio is considered an important touchstone in the genre's development. There is a large underground heavy metal scene in the Southern United States. Death metal can trace some of its origins to Tampa, Florida. Bands such as Deicide, Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under, Cannibal Corpse, Volt negative among others, have come out of this scene. The Southern United States are also the place where sludge metal was born and it's where its pioneering acts, Eyehategod and Crowbar, come from; as well as other notable bands of the style such as Down and Corrosion of Conformity. Other well known metal bands from the South include Pantera, Hellyeah, Lamb of God, and Mastodon. This has helped coin the term southern metal which is well received by the vast majority in metal circles around the world. Other heavy metal and hardcore punk subgenres, including metalcore and post-hardcore, have also become increasingly popular in this region. Recently, the spread of rap music has led to the rise of the musical subgenre of the Dirty South. Atlanta, Houston, Memphis, Miami, and New Orleans have long been major centers of hip-hop culture.

Basketball is also popular, particularly college basketball.

Taking advantage of warmer late-winter weather, many professional baseball teams began training in Florida in the spring, starting in the 1920s and 15 teams continue to train there each year. Regular season Major League Baseball (MLB) began in 1966, when the Milwaukee Braves transferred its franchise to Atlanta. Expansion teams were added to Texas with the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers in the 1960s and 70s, while Florida became home to the Miami Marlins in 1993 and Tampa Bay Rays in 1998. At one time a number of minor league baseball leagues flourished in the South. The region is still home to more minor league teams than any other region of the United States. Normally associated with cold climates, five National Hockey League (NHL) franchises are based in the south: the Dallas Stars, Tampa Bay Lightning, Florida Panthers, Nashville Predators, and Carolina Hurricanes (six if the Washington Capitals are counted as Southern). The South is also the birthplace of NASCAR auto racing; Shackleford says it flourishes there because \\"the violence and danger of the sport resonated with growing idealization of the traditional Southern culture.\\"Shackleford, Ben \\"NASCAR Stock Car Racing: Establishment and Southern Retrenchment\\", International Journal of the History of Sport (2011) 28#2 pp 300‚Äì318 Race tracks that host NASCAR sanctioned events are found in several different locations in the South, including Martinsville, Virginia, Talladega, Alabama, Bristol, Tennessee, Darlington, South Carolina, Dover, Delaware, Sparta, Kentucky, Daytona, Florida, Charlotte, Atlanta, Miami, Richmond, Virginia, and Fort Worth, Texas. Other popular sports in the South include golf (which can be played almost year-round because of the South's mild climate), fishing, soccer (which is the fastest growing sport in the South), and hunting wild game. Augusta, Georgia, which is the host city of The Masters (one of golf's premier tournaments held each spring) and home to 15 golf courses, is considered to be the golf capital of the world. Atlanta was the host of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Film Many critically acclaimed movies have been set in the cultural background of the South.

However, in 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected as the first President of the United States from the Deep South (or arguably only the first since the Civil War). The election resulted in reporters swarming into Carter's small southern town of Plains, Georgia, speculation about his lifestyle and Southern Baptist faith, and renewed interest in Southern culture.Plains, Georgia .

Many anime characters with Kansai accents speak with Southern accents in English-language adaptations. Popular images of Southerners Since the early 19th century Southerners have been the subject of stereotypes, epithets and ridicule. Traces remain in the media, usually in humorous form, as in the 1960s TV series, \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\", a situation comedy, which depicts the cultural dissonance of a poor backwoods family that moves to upscale California after striking oil on their land.Anthony A. Harkins, \\"The Hillbilly in the Living Room: Television Representations of Southern Mountaineers in Situation Comedies, 1952‚Äì1971\\", Appalachian Journal (2001) 29#1 pp 98‚Äì126. Many poor Southern whites make fun of the stereotypes.As in Michelle Lamar, and Molly Wendland, The White Trash Mom Handbook: Embrace Your Inner Trailerpark, Forget Perfection, Resist Assimilation into the PTA, Stay Sane, and Keep Your Sense of Humor (2008), and Kendra Morris, White Trash Gatherings: From-Scratch Cooking for down-Home Entertaining (2006). Images typically depict Southerners as laid-back, hospitable, jolly and carefree‚Äîand lazy.David Bertelson, The Lazy South (1980) The hostile epithet \\"white trash\\" originated among house slaves in the 1830s to ridicule whites of low income or low morality.Matt Wray, Not Quite White: White Trash and the Boundaries of Whiteness (2006) p. 2 From the colonial eras travelers often emphasized the backward, uneducated, uncouth, dirty or unhygienic, impoverished, and violent aspects of Southern life. A favorite theme especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks portrayed \\"hicks\\" isolated from modern culture as shiftless male hunters, violently feuding clans like the Hatfields and McCoys, degraded women smoking corncob pipes, religious snake handlers, and compulsive banjo players.Henry D. Shapiro, Appalachia on Our Mind: The Southern Mountains and Mountaineers in the American Consciousness, 1870‚Äì1920 (1979) The national stereotype of the South in 1917 can be glimpsed in a study of tobacco usage in the late 19th century written by a Northern historian who paid close attention to class and gender: > The chewing of tobacco was well-nigh universal.

The Progressive Era brought attention to the problems the South faced. An influential scholarly study was Horace Kephart's Our Southern Highlanders (1913), which portrayed an isolated and culturally inert people.Katie Algeo, \\"Locals on Local Color: Imagining Identity in Appalachia\\", Southern Cultures (2003) 9#4 pp 27‚Äì54. The bleak image inspired northern philanthropy, such as the Rockefeller foundations, to intervene using modern public health techniques and to promote better schooling.John Ettling, The Germ of Laziness: Rockefeller Philanthropy and Public Health in the New South (1981) ch. 1 Since the 1930s, however, Hollywood has used stereotypes of the South to contrast virtues of simple rural life with the corruption that can be found in the city.Austin Wade, \\"The Real Beverly Hillbillies\\", Southern Quarterly (1981) 19#4 pp 83‚Äì94. Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until 1934, when Al Capp introduced L'il Abner, the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching 60 million readers in over 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. Inge says Capp, \\"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South.\\" Other popular strips on Southern life included Pogo, Snuffy Smith and 'Kudzu.M.

Throughout its history, the story has been given a political application.  The fable  According to the earliest source, Phaedrus, the story concerns a group of frogs who called on the great god Zeus to send them a king. He threw down a log, which fell in their pond with a loud splash and terrified them. Eventually one of the frogs peeped above the water and, seeing that it was no longer moving, soon all hopped upon it and made fun of their king. Then the frogs made a second request for a real king and were sent a water snake that started eating them. Once more the frogs appealed to Zeus, but this time he replied that they must face the consequences of their request. In later variations of the story, the water snake is often replaced with a stork or heron. Commentary, analysis and depiction The Frogs Who Desired a King, illustrated by Milo Winter in a 1919 Aesop anthology The original context of the story, as related by Phaedrus, makes it clear that people feel the need of laws but are impatient of personal restraint. His closing advice is to be content for fear of worse. By the time of William Caxton, who published the first version in English, the lesson drawn is that . In his version, it is a heron rather than a snake that is sent as king. A later commentator, the English Royalist Roger L'Estrange, sums up the situation thus: Yet another view was expressed by German theologian Martin Luther in his \\"On Governmental Authority\\" (1523). There he speaks of the fewness of good rulers, taking this lack as a punishment for human wickedness. He then alludes to this fable to illustrate how humanity deserves the rulers it gets: 'frogs must have their storks.' The author Christoff M√ºrer has a similar sentiment in his emblem book XL emblemata miscella nova (1620). Under the title Freheit there is a verse that warns that those who do not appreciate freedom are sent a tyrant by divine will.Emblem 11 The story was one of the 39 Aesop's fables chosen by Louis XIV of France for the labyrinth of Versailles, a hedge maze of hydraulic statues created for him in 1669 in the Gardens of Versailles, at the suggestion of Charles Perrault. It is likely he was aware of its interpretation in favour of contentment with the status quo. Jean de la Fontaine's fable of (III.4) follows the Phaedrus version fairly closely and repeats the conclusion there. In setting the scene, however, he pictures the frogs as 'tiring of their democratic state', taking in 1668 much the same sardonic stance as Roger L'Estrange would do in 1692. La Fontaine was writing shortly after the restoration of the monarchy in England following a period of republican government; L'Estrange made his comment three years after a revolution had overthrown the restored regime and installed another. As soon as the French had their own experience of regime-change, illustrators began to express their feelings through this fable too. A cartoon dating from 1791 and titled Le roi soliveau, ou les grenouilles qui demandent un roi (King Log, or the frogs demand a king)Print available at Cornell University wryly portrays those responsible for the Champ de Mars massacre.Augustin Challamel, Histoire- mus√©e de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise, Challamel, 1842, vol.1, p.158 In the following century, the caricaturist Grandville turned to illustrating La Fontaine's fables after a censorship law made life difficult for him. There it is a recognisably imperial stork who struts through the water wearing a laurel crown, cheered on one side by sycophantic supporters and causing havoc on the other. Ernest Griset, the son of French political refugees from yet another change of regime, followed the same example. His horrific picture of a gruesome skeletal stork seated on a bank and swallowing his prey appeared in an 1869 edition of Aesop's fables. It is his comment on the Second French Empire that had driven his parents into exile. The gloom of 19th-century illustrators was mitigated by a more light-hearted touch in the following century. In the 1912 edition of Aesop's Fables, Arthur Rackham chose to picture the carefree frogs at play on their King Log, a much rarer subject among illustrators. But the French artist Benjamin Rabier, having already illustrated a collection of La Fontaine's fables, subverted the whole subject in a later picture, Le Toboggan (‚ÄòThe sleigh-run‚Äô, 1925). In this, the stork too has become a willing plaything of the frogs as they gleefully hop onto his back and use his bill as a water-slide.  Literary allusions  William de Morgan, 1872 (Victoria & Albert Museum) The majority of literary allusions to the fable have contrasted the passivity of King Log with the energetic policy of King Stork, but it was pressed into the service of political commentary in the title \\"King Stork and King Log: at the dawn of a new reign\\", a study of Russia written in 1895 by the political assassin Sergey Stepnyak- Kravchinsky, using the pen-name S. Stepniak. The book contrasts the policy of the reactionary Tsar Alexander III with the likely policy under Nicholas II, who had only just succeeded to the throne. As well as a later passing reference in the title of Alyse Gregory's feminist novel King Log and Lady Lea (1929), the fable was also reinterpreted in one of Margaret Atwood's four short fictions in a 2005 issue of the magazine Daedalus.Daedalus, Vol. 134, No. 2, pp. 119‚Äì123. Entitled \\"King Log in Exile\\", it features the deposed king musing on his ineffective reign, gradually illustrating that his inertia hid not harmlessness but a corrupt selfishness. Two modern poetical references are dismissive. Thom Gunn alludes to the fable in the opening stanzas of his poem \\"The Court Revolt\\". The situation described is a conspiracy in which many courtiers connive out of sheer boredom: 'King stork was welcome to replace a log'. New Zealand poet James K. Baxter, on the other hand, expresses a preference in his epigram Election 1960: > A democratic people have elected King Log, King Stork, King Log, King Stork > again. Because I like a wide and silent pond I voted Log. That party was > defeated. W. H. Auden recreated the fable at some length in verse as part of the three \\"Moralities\\" he wrote for the German composer Hans Werner Henze to set for orchestra and children's chorus in 1967. The theme of all three is the wrong choices made by people who do not sufficiently appreciate their good fortune when they have it. The first poem of the set follows the creatures' fall, from a state of innocence when In the first age the frogs dwelt at peace, into dissatisfaction, foolishness and disaster. Two centuries earlier, the German poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing had given the theme an even darker reinterpretation in his \\"The Water Snake\\" (Die Wasserschlange). Taking its beginning from the Phaedrus version, the poem relates how a frog asks the snake why it is devouring his kind. 'Because you have invited me to,' is the reply; but when the frog denies this, the snake declares that it will therefore eat the frog because he has not. Part of a set of variations on Aesopic themes, this appears as the last in Gary Bachlund's recent setting of five fables by Lessing (F√ºnf Fabelen, 2008). Earlier musical settings included one by Louis-Nicolas Cl√©rambault of words based on La Fontaine's fable (1730s) and Louis Lacombe's setting of La Fontaine's own words (Op. 72) for four men's voices as part of his 15 fables de La Fontaine (1875). It also figures as the third of Maurice Thiriet's Trois fables de La Fontaine for four children singing a cappella.  Films  In 1922, Polish animator W≈Çadys≈Çaw Starewicz produced a stop-motion animated film based on the tale in Paris entitled Les Grenouilles qui demandent un roi (aka Frogland). The final episode of the BBC series I, Claudius (1976), following the frequent allusions in Robert Graves source novel Claudius the God, was titled \\"Old King Log\\". In it the aging emperor refers to himself as such, to the confusion of his advisors.

He first came to prominence as a comedian in the 1970s and has had his own shows on television and radio. Early life and career Cricket was born in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland and left school at 16. He spent the next two years working in a betting shop, before spending the summer of 1966 working as a Red Coat in Butlins Holiday camp at Mosney, County Meath, Ireland. He spent the following two summers at the Butlins Holiday Camp in Clacton, Essex. By the early 1970s he was living in Manchester. From 1972 he worked at the Pontins holiday camps in Southport and Morecambe. He returned to Clacton-on-Sea in 2006 to star in the eight-week summer show, Summer Special at the West Cliff Theatre. Most recently Jimmy has been touring the UK in The Good Old Days of Music Hall and Variety with Neil Hurst and Shep's Banjo Boys. Television and radio He was given his own television series on a show called And There's More (named after his best- known catchphrase), produced by Central Television (also notable for including the first TV appearance by Rory Bremner). He also had his own radio series for BBC Radio 2 called Jimmy's Cricket Team, written by Eddie Braben and starring Peter Goodwright, Bill Pertwee and Noreen Kershaw. He featured in The Krankies Klub alongside the Krankies and Bobby Davro. He also appeared in numerous Royal Variety Shows. He made many appearances on BBC TVs long running TV show The Good Old Days. Jimmy was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1987 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in central London - the last edition that Andrews presented. Cricket was one of a number of veteran performers to appear in the video for the 2007 Comic Relief single, a cover of The Proclaimers' song \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\" by Matt Lucas as Andy Pipkin and Peter Kay as Brian Potter. Style Cricket's humour is entirely clean. A popular theme of his comedy is Irish logic, and the ubiquitous letter from his \\"Mammy\\". He almost always appears in his trademark outfit of cut-off evening trousers, evening tailcoat, hat (given to him by the BBC to wear on The Good Old Days) and wellington boots marked \\"L\\" and \\"R\\" for left and right, but worn on the wrong feet. He frequently prefaces an anecdote with the catchphrase: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, [beat], come here [or c'mere]\\". Personal life Cricket lives in Lancashire with his wife, May. He has four children and two grandchildren. Two of his children, Frankie and Katie Mulgrew, followed him into comedy; Katie using her own name, Frankie as 'Frankie Doodle'. Frankie has since become ordained as a Catholic priest and published his first book, Does God LOL?, in June 2013. Another of Cricket's daughters, Jamie, became a teacher and lives in London. His oldest son Dale is a Lib Dem councillor for Rochdale.

It was edited by Philip Babcock Gove and a team of lexicographers who spent 757 editor-years and $3.5 million. The most recent printing has 2,816 pages, and as of 2005, it contained more than 476,000 vocabulary entries (including more than 100,000 new entries and as many new senses for entries carried over from previous editions), 500,000 definitions, 140,000 etymologies, 200,000 verbal illustrations, 350,000 example sentences, 3,000 pictorial illustrations and an 18,000-word Addenda section. The final definition, Zyzzogeton, was written on October 17, 1960; the final etymology was recorded on October 26; and the final pronunciation was transcribed on November 9. The final copy went to the typesetters, RR Donnelley, on December 2. The book was printed by the Riverside Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first edition had 2,726 pages (measuring wide by tall by thick), weighed , and originally sold for $47.50 ($ in dollars). The changes were the most radical in the history of the Unabridged. Although it was an unprecedented masterwork of scholarship, it was met with considerable criticism for its descriptive (rather than prescriptive) approach. It told how the language was used, not how it ought to be used.Herbert Charles Morton, The Story of Webster's Third: Philip Gove's Controversial Dictionary and its Critics (1995) p. 123  Deletions  Prior to Webster's Third the Unabridged had been expanded with each new edition, with minimal deletion. To make room for 100,000 new words, Gove now made sweeping deletions, dropping 250,000 entries. He eliminated the \\"nonlexical matter\\" that more properly belongs to an encyclopedia, including all names of people and places (which had filled two appendices). There were no more mythological, biblical, and fictional names, nor the names of buildings, historical events, or art works. Thirty picture plates were dropped. The rationale was that, while useful, these are not strictly about language. Gove justified the change by the company's publication of Webster's Biographical Dictionary in 1943 and Webster's Geographical Dictionary in 1949, and the fact that the topics removed could be found in encyclopedias.Morton (1995) Also removed were words which had been virtually out of use for more than two hundred years (except those found in major literature such as Shakespeare), rare variants, reformed spellings, self-explanatory combination words, and other items considered of little value to the general reader. The number of small text illustrations was reduced, page size increased, and print size reduced by one-twelfth, from six point to agate (5.5 point) type. All this was considered necessary because of the large amount of new material, and Webster's Second had almost reached the limits of mechanical bookbinding. The fact that the new book had about 700 fewer pages was justified by the need to allow room for future additions. In style and method, the dictionary bore little resemblance to earlier editions. Headwords (except for \\"God\\", acronyms pronounced as a string of letters, and, in the reprints, trademarks) were not capitalized. Instead of capitalizing \\"American\\", for example, the dictionary had labels next to the entries reading cap (for the noun) and usu cap (for the adjective). This allowed informative distinctions to be drawn: \\"gallic\\" is usu cap while \\"gallicism\\" is often cap and \\"gallicize\\" is sometimes cap.  Reception and criticisms  The reviews of the Third edition were highly favorable in Britain.Ronald A. Wells, Dictionaries and the Authoritarian Traditions: A Study in English Usage and Lexicongraphy (1973) p. 84 Robert Chapman, a lexicographer, canvassed fellow lexicographers at Funk & Wagnalls, who had used the new edition daily for three years. The consensus held that the Third was a \\"marvelous achievement, a monument of scholarship and accuracy\\". They did come up with some specific criticisms, including typographic unattractiveness (the type is too small and hard to read); non-use of capital letters (only \\"God\\" was capitalized; the goal was to save space); excessive use of citations, giving misspellings as legitimate variants, dropping too many obsolete words, the lack of usage labels, and deliberate omission of biographical and geographical entries. Chapman concluded that the \\"cranks and intransigents who advise us to hang on to the NID 2 are plain fools who deny themselves the riches of a great book\\".Robert L. Chapman, \\"A Working Lexicographer Appraises Webster's Third New International Dictionary\\", American Speech, October 1967, Vol. 42 Issue 3, pp 202‚Äì210, quotes on p 210 This dictionary became preferred as a backup source by two influential style guides in the United States, although each one directs writers to go first to other, shorter dictionaries. The Chicago Manual of Style, followed by many book publishers and magazines in the United States, recommends Webster's Third, along with Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary for \\"general matters of spelling\\", and the style book \\"normally opts for\\" the first spelling listed (with the Collegiate taking precedence over Webster's Third because it \\"represents the latest research\\").The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th edition, New York and London: University of Chicago Press, 2003, Chapter 7: \\"Spelling, Distinctive Treatment of Words, and Compounds\\", Section 7.1 \\"Introduction\\", p 278 The Associated Press Stylebook, used by most newspapers in the United States, refers readers to W3 \\"if there is no listing in either this book or Webster's New World\\".Goldstein, Norm, editor, Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual, New York: Perseus Books, 1998, \\"dictionaries\\" entry, p 61  Permissiveness  In the early 1960s, Webster's Third came under attack for its \\"permissiveness\\" and its failure to tell people what proper English was. It was the opening shot in the culture wars, as conservatives detected yet another symbol of the permissiveness of society as a whole and the decline of authority, as represented by the Second Edition.John P. Davies, DOA: education in the electronic culture (2003) p. 16 As historian Herbert Morton explained, \\"Webster's Second was more than respected. It was accepted as the ultimate authority on meaning and usage and its preeminence was virtually unchallenged in the United States. It did not provoke controversies, it settled them.\\" Critics charged that the [Webster's Third] dictionary was reluctant to defend standard English, for example entirely eliminating the labels \\"colloquial\\", \\"correct\\", \\"incorrect\\", \\"proper\\", \\"improper\\", \\"erroneous\\", \\"humorous\\", \\"jocular\\", \\"poetic\\", and \\"contemptuous\\", among others.Jack Lynch, The Lexicographer's Dilemma: The Evolution of \\"Proper\\" English from Shakespeare to South Park (2009) Gove's stance was an exemplar of descriptivist linguistics: describing language as it is or has been used. As David M. Glixon put it in the Saturday Review: \\"Having descended from God's throne of supreme authority, the Merriam folks are now seated around the city desk, recording like mad.\\"Herbert C. Morton, The Story of Webster's Third: Philip Gove's Controversial Dictionary and its Critics (1995) p. 172 Jacques Barzun said this stance made Webster's Third \\"the longest political pamphlet ever put together by a party\\", done with \\"a dogma that far transcends the limits of lexicography\\".Barzun in The American Scholar (1962) Volume 32 p. 176 In 1962 two English professors, James Sledd (Northwestern) and Wilma R. Ebbitt (University of Chicago), published a \\"casebook\\" that compiles more than sixty lay and expert contributions to this controversy.James Sledd and Wilma R. Ebbitt, Dictionaries and That Dictionary: A Casebook on the Aims of Lexicographers and the Targets of Reviewers (Chicago: Scott, Foresman, 1962). In it, Sledd was drawn into debate with Dwight Macdonald (1906-1982), one of the most prominent critics of the dictionary, who in the pages of The New Yorker (March 10, 1962) had accused its makers of having \\"untuned the string, made a sop of the solid structure of English\\"; Macdonald held that the dictionary was an important indicator of \\"the changes in our cultural climate\\".  Ain't  The dictionary's treatment of \\"ain't\\" was subject to particular scorn, since it seemed to overrule the near-unanimous denunciation of that word by English teachers. The New Yorker ran a cartoon showing a receptionist at the dictionary's office telling a visitor that \\"Dr. Gove ain't in.\\" The entry said, \\"though disapproved by many and more common in less educated speech, used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers esp. in the phrase ain't I\\". The Globe and Mail of Toronto editorialized: \\"a dictionary's embrace of the word 'ain't' will comfort the ignorant, confer approval upon the mediocre, and subtly imply that proper English is the tool of only the snob\\".Morton p. 157. The New York Times editorialized that \\"Webster's has, it is apparent, surrendered to the permissive school that has been busily extending its beachhead in English instruction in the schools ... reinforced the notion that good English is whatever is popular\\" and \\"can only accelerate the deterioration\\" of the English language.New York Times October 12, 1961. The Times widely respected Theodore M. Bernstein, its in-house style authority and a professor of journalism at Columbia University, reported that most of the newspaper's editors decided to continue to use the Webster's Second.Wells, Dictionaries and the Authoritarian Traditions: A Study in English Usage and Lexicongraphy (1973) p. 79. Garry Wills in the National Review opined that the new dictionary \\"has all the modern virtues. It is big, expensive, and ugly. It should be a great success.\\"Morton p. 192. In his Nero Wolfe novel Gambit (1962), Rex Stout famously depicted his erudite armchair detective burning pages from this edition in his fireplace because it sanctioned usages he disliked. Criticism of the dictionary spurred the creation of The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, where 500 usage notes were determined by a panel of expert writers. The editor, however, often ignored their advice.John Ottenhoff, \\"The Perils of Prescriptivism: Usage Notes and the American Heritage Dictionary\\". American Speech, Fall 1996, vol. 71, issue 3, pp. 272‚Äì85.  Revisions and updates  Since the 1961 publication of the Third, Merriam-Webster has reprinted the main text of the dictionary with only minor corrections. To add new words, they created an Addenda Section in 1966, included in the front matter, which was expanded in 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1993, and 2002. However, the rate of additions has been much slower than it had been throughout the previous hundred years. Following the purchase of Merriam-Webster by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. in 1964, a three-volume version was issued for many years as a supplement to the encyclopedia. At the end of volume three, this edition included the Britannica World Language Dictionary, 474 pages of translations between English and French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. A CD-ROM version of the complete text, with thousands of additional new words and definitions from the \\"addenda\\", was published by Merriam-Webster in 2000, and is often packaged with the print edition. The Merriam-Webster staff has been working on the fourth edition (W4) of the Unabridged since 2008, but a publication date had not been set. It is now unlikely that Merriam-Webster will ever publish a paper version of W4 due to its unprecedented length.

The Open Age team plays winter rugby in the Pennine League. They also field junior teams from age 6 up to 16. The club has a strong junior setup, with teams at seven different age groups.  History  The club was founded under the name ‚ÄúJunior Eagles‚Äù in 1989 as a first attempt to develop rugby league below professional level after the formation of the Sheffield Eagles in 1984. After three seasons without a base the club found a permanent home in the disused athletics stadium in Hillsborough Park. The Hillsborough Arena Sports Association was set up and began work on grant applications that was to reach fruition with a successful Sports Lottery grant in 1996. After beginning with only junior teams, an Open Age team was created that began life in the Pennine League in 1993. After a difficult start the team got going and by 1998/9 they lost only one game in winning the League title under coaches and Eagles legends Mark Aston and Paul Broadbent. The club then entered the National Conference League (the most prestigious amateur competition in rugby league) but then in 2002 took the bold step of joining the newly created National League 3, switching from winter to summer rugby in the process. The club was a regular participant in the play-offs, but never reached the Grand Final. It also ran a second team in the summer, playing in the Rugby League Conference. Another new development in 1994 saw the Sheffield‚Äôs Women‚Äôs RL team join the club, which by then had changed its name to Sheffield Hillsborough Eagles. In 1997 the Club changed its name to Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks to avoid confusion with the professional club in the media and with the public and in the following year its new facilities were opened at Hillsborough Sports Arena following a ¬£750,000 Lottery grant and a total investment of a million pounds. In May 2006 the club withdrew from National League 3 as many of the players who had formed the team were unavailable and it was felt that the remaining players would not be competitive at that level. The club withdrew completely from summer rugby in 2007 after it announced that it would not be entering a team in the Rugby League Conference, enabling players to take a rest and focus on the winter Pennine League team. On 3 March 2007, Hillsborough Hawks under-16s team broke the world record for ‚ÄúMost Tacklebags Tackled in an Hour,‚Äù with 18 players making over 3600 tackles between them. As a result of this, the team raised enough money to go on a groundbreaking tour to Serbia in early April 2007. The Under 18's fielded a team in the Gillette National Youth League in 2010. In 2007, the Men's open age team won Pennine League Division 5, and also the Pennine Supplementary Cup, with a victory over Thornton at Crown Flatt, Dewsbury. In 2010 they won promotion from Division 4, and in 2011 were promoted from Division 3 at the first attempt. The Hawks also won the South West Yorkshire Cup. However, in the summer of 2011, a number of key players left the club, and the Hawks elected to drop down two Divisions, to Pennine League Division 4, where it was felt the club would be more competitive. After a shaky start, Hawks finished third in Division 4, and lost in the final of the South West Yorkshire Cup, and at the end of the season it was announced that the Hawks were switching back to summer, to play in the new RFL Yorkshire Summer League. In 2018, the Men's open age team entered the Yorkshire Men's League, however, failed to recruit enough players to fulfil the fixtures of the season. A 'dual registration' deal with Hemel Stags was entered into, forcing a number of the local players out of contention.

Biography The son of Percy Rivington Pyne and Albertina Shelton Taylor, Pyne was born in New York City in 1855, and graduated from Princeton in 1877. Pyne inherited an enormous fortune from his maternal grandfather and namesake, Moses Taylor who was first president of the First National City Bank of New York and a stockholder in the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. Pyne decided early on in his life to dedicate himself to advancing the interests of his alma mater, and in 1884 gained a seat on the Board of Trustees of Princeton at age 28. Settling in the town of Princeton, his beautiful estate, Drumthwacket, is now the official residence of the Governor of New Jersey. Pyne's wealth allowed him to focus on his philanthropy and involvement in civic organizations, and the list of organizations in which he was involved speaks to the extent of his generosity and the breadth of his interests. According to historian William Selden: > ‚ÄúMoses Taylor Pyne was a director of four banks, four steel and metal > manufacturing companies, one gas company, one insurance company, eight > railroads and president of one railroad, two hospitals, two secondary > schools, two YMCAs; and a vestryman of four Episcopal churches. He was a > member of twenty-five clubs, twelve of which were Princeton University > undergraduate eating clubs, as well as president of the Princeton township > governing board, a member of the New Jersey Public Library Commission, the > first president of the earlier Princeton Historical Association, and > president of the board of the first Princeton Inn which he helped to finance > and build in 1891 on part of the original Morven property. In fact, for > nearly a quarter of a century no enterprise of importance in Princeton would > be started without the assurance of endorsement from Moses Taylor > Pyne.‚ÄùWilliam Selden, Drumthwacket, (Princeton: Drumthwacket Foundation, > 1993), 37. He died on April 22, 1921 in Princeton, New Jersey and was interred at Princeton Cemetery.  Benefactor of Princeton  The total amount of money that Pyne gave to Princeton, including the University, its students, faculty, and related institutions, is truly incalculable. ‚ÄúThe extent of his financial aid to Princeton has never been disclosed. It was known to be very large but the point was one which he never cared to discuss.‚ÄùRobert Annin, Woodrow Wilson: a Character Study (New York: Dodd, Mead and Coo., 1924), 33. He poured an untold amount of money into the general fund, and while Pyne never disclosed how much, ‚Äúit is known...that for several years he drew his own check to cover the deficit in the university budget.‚Äù \\"M. Taylor Pyne Dies, Princeton Mourns,\\" New York Times, April 23, 1921 According to the Princeton Alumni Weekly: Pyne served also as the chairman of the Committee on Grounds and Buildings, and the physical appearance, style and footprint of the Princeton campus are also due to his vision, in advocating for Collegiate Gothic architecture, and generosity, in the form of the hundreds and hundreds of acres that Pyne bought and gave to the University, free of charge: ‚ÄúThe choice of the uniform and beautiful architectural style which enriches the and Princeton campus was largely his work. The purchase of large tracts of land, far in advance of any apparent need, came of his faith in Princeton‚Äôs future.‚ÄùAnnin, Woodrow Wilson: a Character Study, 33. In the words of University president John Hibben, ‚Äúmore than any one man he is responsible for the development of what is now so widely known as the Princeton spirit.‚Äù The strong connection of alumni to Old Nassau was developed into a lasting force by Pyne, who founded both the Princeton Alumni Association and the Princeton Alumni Weekly. Many of the other unique and endearing features of the Princeton community can be traced to Momo Pyne, including even the black squirrels that populate the campus, which were introduced by Pyne to add to the unique menagerie at Drumthwacket.William Selden, Drumthwacket, (Princeton: Drumthwacket Foundation, 1993), 38. Of all the Princeton institutions that were influenced by Moses Taylor Pyne, none were shaped more consistently or decisively than the upperclass eating clubs of Prospect Avenue, whose origin, growth and survival was ensured by the patronage of \\"Momo\\" Pyne. Pyne believed that permanent eating clubs established in their own clubhouses was the key to stabilizing the social life of campus, and he provided generous loans and architectural advice to help this process along. He had a documented role in the establishment of Ivy Club, Cap and Gown Club, Elm Club, Campus Club, Cloister Inn and Tower Club, and many others, as demonstrated by the fact that he was made an honorary member of twelve out of the fourteen eating clubs in existence at Princeton in 1907.William Selden, Drumthwacket, 37.  Legacy  When he died in 1921, the Wall Street Journal wrote the following in his obituary: Pyne served for thirty-six years on the Board of Trustees and he did not miss a single meeting. He died in 1921 and is buried on \\"President's Row\\" in the Princeton Cemetery. On the day of his funeral, \\"the whole community joined in tribute. University activities were suspended and all business stopped on Nassau Street. After the services at Drumthwacket the funeral cortege drove slowly through the grounds of the Graduate College, past the site of the Pyne Dormitory, by Upper and Lower Pyne, to the FitzRandolph Gateway where it entered the Campus. To the tolling of the Nassau Hall bell the procession passed through a student guard of honor to the steps of Nassau Hall, then westward around the rear of the building, and through the arches of Pyne Library, and then back to Nassau Street. After the procession left the Campus, the students walked down Witherspoon Street in a body to the cemetery where they encircled the grave and awaited the arrival of the cortege.\\" During his last illness, the Trustees voted to name the under-construction dormitory Pyne Hall to honor his services. In addition to the buildings and endowed professorships that bear his name, the University has established in his honor the Moses Taylor Pyne Honor Prize, usually referred to as the \\"Pyne Prize\\", which is the \\"highest general distinction conferred on an undergraduate.\\" Pyne's portrait hangs in Procter Hall of Princeton's Graduate College.

His most famous protege is Rev. Al Sharpton, whom acknowledged his call as a minister at the age of nine. Biographical sketch Named for civil rights leader Frederick Douglass, Washington was born on January 1, 1913 in Arkansas. He later served as a pastor for a church in Montclair, New Jersey. With his wife, Madame Ernestine Beatrice Washington, who was called \\"The Songbird of the East\\" Washington moved to Brooklyn, New York to set up a tent at 966 Fulton Street. This ministry was known as \\"The Sawdust Trail\\". From there Washington's ministry grew until he was able to purchase the old Loew's Theatre that stood at 1372 Bedford Avenue. Eventually, Washington Temple COGIC, with over 5,000 members, became one of the largest congregations of any denomination located in Brooklyn, New York. Washington served as assistant Jurisdictional Prelate to Bishop O. M. Kelly before finally succeeding him in 1983. He also served on the General Board of the Church Of God In Christ as Second Assistant Presiding Bishop to Bishop J.O. Patterson, Sr. In addition to his early work with Sharpton, Washington also served as a mentor and spiritual father to many COGIC pastors. Included among these are Bishop Norman L. Prescott, the prelate of New Jersey's Third Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and pastor of Washington's former church in Montclair; Superintindent Robert L. Madison of Washington Temple; Elder TJ Williams Jr. of First COGIC of Bridgehampton, NY; Reverend Timothy Wright, world-famous gospel singer, Elder Stanley Williams of Grace Temple COGIC in Westbury, NY; Elder Odolph Wright of City Of Faith COGIC (New York and Georgia); and Elder Michael Collymore (North Carolina). Washington also introduced Sharpton to Reverend William Augustus Jones Jr., who converted Sharpton to his current Baptist faith.Interview with Al Sharpton, David Shankbone, Wikinews, December 3, 2007. Washington died in January 1988. He was succeeded as bishop by Ithiel Clemmons and as pastor by Elder Robert L. Madison.

Life Born in Lithuania, c. 1695, he was a Rabbinical casuist. At one time Ginsburg was rabbi in Pinsk, and then later founded a yeshivah in Minsk. Here however he engaged in hostile dispute with the Gaon Yechiel Halpern, whose supporters eventually drove Ginsburg from the city.YIVO: Gintsburg, Aryeh Leib ben Asher Legend has it that the Shaagas Aryeh was run out of the city of Minsk on an oxen cart.\\"Research into the Life and Family of the Shagas Aryeh\\" (Hebrew) Due to the insult, as he left the city he remarked \\"What, Minsk isn't burning yet?\\" For years, fires that broke out were attributed by the Jews of Minsk to the curse of the Shaagas Aryeh. His most famous book Shaagas Aryeh (Hebrew, ◊©◊ê◊í◊™ ◊ê◊®◊ô◊î, for 'Roar of the Lion'), a collection of responsa, was first published in Frankfurt am Main in 1755 and is still frequently quoted in rabbinical debate, as are many of his responsa. After its publication he became known as \\"the Shaagas Aryeh\\" after his book. He became rabbi in Metz in France in 1765, but an early argument with his congregation led to him refusing to enter the synagogue except to give four sermons a year. Despite this he retained his post until he died in Metz on June 23, 1785. Hasidim considered the Shaagas Aryeh \\"the definitive talmid hakham (great leader) of the generation\\", They maintain a legend that the Besht sought out the Shaagas Aryeh and \\"served him by putting his shoes on for him\\". A legend exists of his death. During his studies a book-case fell on him, covering him with books. His students were able to rescue him after an hour or so and he related to them that he had been covered by the books of the authors with whom he had quarreled. He had asked forgiveness from all of them and they all complied save for one, Mordecai Yoffe (known as the Levush) who refused. He knew therefore that he was not long for this world, and pronounced the verse in Hebrew \\"Aryeh shoag mi loi yiroh\\"; i.e. that Aryeh (the lion, meaning himself) ' (roars), but mi (an acronym of Mordecai Yoffeh, but can also mean 'who') ' (is not afraid).Eleff, Zev (2012), The Wages of Criticism in Jewish Review of Books, Winter 2012 no. 8, accessed 6 March 2013. It is speculated that this legend is the source of the urban myth surrounding the death of the French-Jewish composer Charles- Valentin Alkan, whose family originated from Metz.Conway, David (2012), Jewry in Music, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 230.

Becoming a tropical depression on December 30, and intensifying into the season's 28th named storm later that day, Zeta continued into January 2006. It was one of only two Atlantic tropical cyclones to span two calendar years (the other being Hurricane Alice in 1954‚Äì55). Zeta originated from an area of low pressure on December 29, which previously developed within an upper-level trough. After becoming a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center continually predicted it would weaken rapidly. Like the previous tropical cyclone, Hurricane Epsilon, Zeta defied these predictions. The storm reached its peak strength on January 2, 2006, before degenerating into a remnant low on January 6 and dissipating on the next day. Several ships encountered the storm, and several crews in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected by rough seas and high winds. Even so, as no land areas were threatened by Zeta, the NHC did not issue any tropical storm watches or warnings. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Zeta originated from an upper-level trough that interacted with a weakening frontal system in late-December 2005. By December 28, the trough had developed into a low pressure area roughly 750 mi (1,210 km) west- northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The following day, a low-level circulation developed and convective activity began to increase around the low. By December 30, sufficient shower and thunderstorm activity had developed for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as a tropical cyclone. Over the following several hours, convective banding developed around the storm's center and by 0600 UTC, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeta, the record 28th tropical or subtropical cyclone to form during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Operationally, however, the NHC did not begin issuing advisories on Zeta until 1700 UTC. Traveling slowly northwestward in response to a mid-level low to the southwest, the storm gradually intensified in a region of favorable anticyclonic outflow. By the afternoon of December 30, dry air caused the system to become slightly disorganized and led forecasters to anticipate further weakening of the storm and dissipating within three days. The following day, a mid-level ridge to the north caused Zeta turn westward before nearly stalling due to upper-level westerlies. By this time, the storm attained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) but increasing wind shear caused convection to become disorganized, resulting in a brief weakening period. Despite the shear, the shallow structure of Zeta allowed convection to regenerate and the storm gradually re-intensified. Around 1800 UTC on January 1, 2006, Zeta attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a barometric pressure of about to the northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. By January 2, the storm began tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid-level trough located east of the storm. Tropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening. The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on January 4, and Zeta's convection began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on January 6 and degenerated into a remnant low later that day. With this transition, the very active 2005 hurricane season belatedly came to a close. The remnant low retained its identity for another day, before dissipating southeast of Bermuda during January 7. Impact and records Tropical Storm Zeta shortly after being named on December 30 Several of the crews that were taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing Race were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from Tropical Storm Zeta. Several teams encountered winds up to 50 mph (85 km/h) and large swells up to . Although battered by torrential rain and high winds, the direction of the winds assisted some of the ships in the race by speeding them closer to Antigua. One Welsh vessel was blown off-course, ending with an encounter with a shark that battered their boat. The ship Liberty Star made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta, including one of 40 mph (65 km/h) winds early on December 31, when the ship was about 45 miles (75 km) north of the storm. When Zeta formed at 0600 UTC on December 30, it became the second latest-forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic. Only Hurricane Alice of December 1954 formed later in the day than did Zeta, becoming a tropical storm around 1200 UTC. Additionally, Zeta became the second known Atlantic tropical cyclone, along with Alice, to exist in two calendar years. Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to 28, eight more than the previous record held by the 1933 season; NHC forecaster James Franklin noted that the atmosphere \\"seem[ed] to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam\\".

She was built as an Englishman/ Larch Deep Sea-class tugboat for war service by the British government in 1943.Mitchell and Sawyer (1990) p. 304 After the end of World War II she was renamed Ashford and then Chris M before reverting to the original name of Empire Sandy and being converted to a schooner. Tugboat history Empire Sandy was one of 1,464 Empire ships built or acquired for war service by the British government. Built in England in 1943 as a deep sea tugboat, she was tasked with Royal Navy work and salvaging merchant ships damaged in the Battle of the Atlantic and other naval engagements during the Second World War. She served in the North Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Sierra Leone, the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal during the Second World War. Empire Sandys Second World War 'Official Log-Books' documented all her wartime voyages. Of notable interest are the complete particulars of the crew, names, addresses, ages, next of kin etc. The oldest is the Master, E Thomas, 63, and the youngest is the Cabin Boy, Kenneth Lewis 15. These are in 'Log Book 014'. Another interesting entry is in TNA-25-5-05-094 describing the storm while towing, with His Majesty's Rescue Tug Hesperia, AFD24 (Admiralty Floating Drydock 24) off the coast of Libya on 8 February 1945. The tug Hesperia and AFD24 were both blown ashore and lost. In 1948 she was bare-boat chartered by Risdon Beazley who renamed her Ashford. Together with their Bustler-class tug Twyford, Ashford entered the rescue towage market. Ashford is listed, in 'Part of the Acorn Archive ‚Äì Hearts of Oak' as part of the salvage team attending the battleship after Warspite went aground on 23 April 1947. Ashford is incorrectly identified as tug Englishman,The tug Englishman was bombed and sunk on 21 January 1941 however all other particulars are of Ashford (Empire Sandy). Ashford was handed back to the Admiralty in 1952. She was then sold to a Canadian firm, the Great Lakes Paper Company, and renamed Chris M (after Chris Michels, a senior employee of Great Lakes Paper). She then came to the Canadian Great Lakes where she spent fifteen years towing timber rafts for Lake Superior logging companies. In the early 1970s the aged ship was to be sold for scrap, but the steel hull was still in very good condition and she was bought by Nautical Adventures Co. for a possible conversion. They completely rebuilt Chris M as a three-masted schooner in the style of the 1880s and she assumed her original name Empire Sandy .

Education Maddox was born in Inkster, Michigan and grew up in Newnan, Georgia.Letter to President Trump (July 8, 2018) - Facebook Post He began practicing law in 1976, after graduating from Howard University (BA, 1967) and Boston College Law School (JD, 1971).Howard University (Class of 1967) Yearbook Clients Maddox represented several alleged victims including the family of Michael Stewart, a Brooklyn man who died while in custody of the New York City Transit Police. Six officers were indicted for the death; all were found not guilty. Rudy Giuliani, then US Attorney in Manhattan, found insufficient evidence to warrant a federal grand jury investigation. A Metropolitan Transportation Authority report later faulted police for use of excessive force. He was the attorney for Cedric Sandiford and the family of manslaughter victim Michael Griffith in the Howard Beach incident. Maddox and other lawyers demanded a special prosecutor be appointed to the case, and the request was eventually granted. Maddox accused the New York City Police Department and Commissioner Benjamin Ward of a cover-up. He represented Tawana Brawley during the period of her rape allegations. Maddox and two other Brawley advisers accused Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones of abducting and raping Brawley. A grand jury did not charge Pagones. The family of murder victim Yusuf Hawkins in the Bensonhurst incident was also one of Maddox's clients. Maddox has represented many defendants, including Michael Briscoe, arrested during the investigation into the alleged rape of the Central Park jogger. Briscoe was found innocent in that case. In 1984, Maddox was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice after a courtroom melee in which he and his client Willie Bosket were confronted by court officers. Maddox was the defense lawyer for one of the two men hired by Marla Hanson's landlord to mutilate and disfigure her. Maddox challenged Hanson's character during the trial. This led New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind to ask a grievance committee \\"to investigate the professional behavior of Mr. Maddox.\\" Maddox responded, It's my job to question the character of Mr. Bowman. Law professor Stephen Gillers of New York University Law School said, \\"There's nothing unethical about what he is reported to have done.\\" Maddox also represented Al Sharpton when Sharpton faced a 67-count indictment alleging fraud and theft. Sharpton was acquitted of all charges. Disciplinary actions In 1990, Maddox was indefinitely suspended by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn after failing to appear before a disciplinary hearing to answer allegations regarding his conduct in the Brawley case. In 1996, Maddox was ordered to pay New York State $1,000 in legal costs for filing a false complaint of racial bias. He had alleged that he had had to apply to represent an indigent defendant in a murder case, while two lawyers who were white had been appointed to represent the other defendant in the case without having to apply. The state showed evidence that in fact, the two lawyers had applied and Maddox had filed a discrimination suit instead of going through the applications process. Michael Mukasey, at that time a Federal judge, ordered Maddox to pay New York State the legal costs it had incurred defending against the suit. The following year, in 1997, Maddox and his group, the United African Movement, were fined $10,000 by New York City's Commission on Human Rights after they denied a white teacher access to a speech by Cornel West on the basis of her race.Media Advisory Other activities Maddox is a former Director of the National Conference of Black Lawyers Juvenile Defense Project. He is also the founder of the Center for Law & Social Justice at Medgar Evers College and co-sponsored the 1983 Congressional hearings on Police Brutality in New York City. A 2006 resolution passed by the Council of the City of New York supported Maddox's reinstatement, but the New York State Attorney General's office has not acted on this request.Res Maddox often contributes to publications such as Amsterdam News and is a frequent guest on WLIB radio's Sharp Talk program, hosted by Sharpton. He has also given speeches at several colleges and rallies.

Accommodation is usually in the form of chalets (which Pontins calls \\"apartments\\"). Company history Balloon car 707, seen with an all over advert for Pontin's, at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, 5 August 1990 Fred Pontin opened his first holiday camp in 1946 on the site of a former U.S. army base (built during World War II), at Brean Sands near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset at a cost of ¬£23,000. Pontin formed a syndicate, in which he held 50% control, to own the camp. Within a year he had six camps. Over the years he bought more camps and personally ran them for a year, before selling them to the syndicate. He gradually expanded his empire to thirty sites. The camps were smaller and less expensive than Butlin's holiday camps. Pontin's had Bluecoats to entertain their guests, as opposed to Butlins Redcoats. Among the Bluecoats were Shane Richie, Bobby Davro, Bradley Walsh, Nick Wilton, Lee Mack and Carol Lee Scott (who later played \\"Grotbags\\"). In 1978, the company was sold to Coral for ¬£56 million. In 1980, Coral (including Pontins) was taken over by Bass Brewing, who sold Pontins in 1987 to a management buyout team led by Trevor Hemmings.Note: Hemmings construction firm had originally built the holiday centre at Southport. It was sold again in 1989, to Scottish & Newcastle. Over the next ten years the company closed or sold off a number of sites. In a three-year programme in the mid-1990s, the remaining camps were modernised. By 2000, the company was operating only eight camps, and was sold back to Hemmings.

It used to be known as the Sto. Tomas de Villanueva Institute. Colegio de Sto. Tomas - Recoletos is a private college. It also provides Secondary education for young men and women. History The Colegio de Santo Tomas ‚Äì Recoletos facade On April 19, 1940, during the Provincial Chapter in the old Convent in Intramuros (Manila), the idea of establishing a Center of Learning of the Augustinian Recollect was put forward. The school was to be founded in San Carlos. On September 28, 1940, the Father Provincial sent a circular letter to Recollect Fathers working in the Diocese of Bacolod (covering the whole Negros Island), asking them to help in the construction of the school building. Fr. Tirso Ruana, OAR was tasked to spearhead the construction of the school building. He requested Mr. Eusebio Calderon, the parish organist, to look for a lot where the building would be erected. On October 12, 1940, with the execution of an Absolute Deed of Sale, the Augustinian Recollect Fathers acquired a 13,565 square meter lot for Php 4,400 from Don Emilio Broce along Azcona St. Fr. Provincial of the Province of San Nicolas de Tolentino and Fr. Pedro Garcia, OAR, laid the cornerstone on December 19, 1940. The school was intended as a school for boys only offering secondary education with its counterpart, Colegio de Sta. Rita, a school for girls, run by the Augustinian Recollect Sisters. After a year of construction, on June 20, 1941, the Solemn Blessing was officiated by the Most Rev. Casimiro Lladoc, D.D., Bishop of Bacolod, and was attended by civil and ecclesiastical dignitaries. Three days after, the school was opened with the enrolment of 153 boys. Fr. Pedro Zunzarren, OAR was appointed as the first Rector. When World War II broke out on December 8, 1941, the school was closed two days after. The school was converted into a hospital and later on, was used by the United States Armed Forces in the Far East as a training camp for Filipino recruits who were later sent to the battlefront. With the arrival of the Japanese Imperial Army in San Carlos City, it took over the school, and made it their headquarters and jail. In 1945 the school resumed classes with the enrolment of 137 boys. Fr. Gregorio Espiga assumed the Directorship of the school. On March 4, 1947, the Department of Instruction under the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines granted Government Recognition No. 24, Series of 1947 to Sto. Tomas de Villanueva Institute offering a complete general secondary course (day) with the authority to issue its graduates the secondary school diplomas. During 1950 to 1952 Santo Tomas de Villanueva Institute opened up Grade V and Grade VI due to lack of classrooms in the public elementary school. Only 27 graduated from the grade school. It was closed after operating for two school years. In 1966, the college celebrated its Silver Jubilee. In June 1971, under the directorship of Fr. Anesio Villanueva, CST-R broke its tradition as a High School for boys by its acceptance of girls. Among the 86 graduates, two girls received their diplomas, namely, Manuelita Caballero and Perla Detomal.

However, she also details some of her own experiences as a woman in China. The interviews usually focus on the embedded cultural perceptions in China about women's rights, roles, and suffering. Many of these interviews were drawn from the call-in portion of Xinran' widely popular radio program, Words on the Night Breeze. She also interviewed other women, whom she sought out for their experiences as Chinese women or opinions about the status of Chinese women. This book attacked key issues such as infanticide, son-preference, suppression of sexuality, homosexuality, and the sexism embedded in culture and society. For this reason, Xinran had to leave China in order to write the book, which was published in Britain. Though the author herself has some opinions about women, whose inherent differences she describes throughout the book, she acknowledges and confronts the stereotypes about women which she detailed in some of the life experiences of Chinese women she recounted. Many women's stories involved rape, forced marriage, deception, and abuse at the hands of authority figures in society and the government. All of these men gained their power over women from pre-existing cultural practices and furthered their control through the existing power structures. In The Good Women of China, Xinran sheds light both on the persistence of oppression of women in China as well as the new opportunities for women in modern Chinese society. Drawn mainly from anecdotes and interviews, and sparsely substantiated by historical facts and statistics, this book takes on important issues without resorting to a black-and-white view of the situation.

He was born in Highams Park, the son of Frederick William Pontin, an East End cabinet maker, and Elizabeth Marian Tilyard, and attended Sir George Monoux Grammar School in Walthamstow but left without passing any examinations. He had a successful career in the city's Stock Exchange before World War II. During the war, he was involved in helping to establish hostels for construction workers. Based on this experience, he decided to move into the holiday camp business after the war. In 1946, he formed a syndicate to buy an old disused camp at Brean Sands near Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset which was the start of the company known as Pontins. He gradually expanded his empire to thirty sites including the popular Southport and Prestatyn resorts. In 1960, he bought Farringford House on the Isle of Wight, the former home of Alfred, Lord Tennyson which had been turned into a hotel. Pontin kept racehorses in stables near the hotel, one of which, Specify, won the 1971 Grand National. He expanded his holiday business into other parts of Europe, forming Pontinental in 1963 with holiday villages in Spain, Majorca, Sardinia, Ibiza, Greece, Morocco and Yugoslavia.

In 2009, Sadier retired the project name \\"Monade\\" and began performing under her own name. History In the late 1990s, the All-City imprint released a 7\\" split of Monade's \\"Ode to a Keyring\\"/\\"Witch Hazel\\" [the a-side of the split featured materials by post- rock group, M, featuring David Pajo of Slint. These songs were recorded by Sadier with Rosie Cuckston of the band Pram. The two songs featured on Monade's initial 45 were re-recorded for the group's first full-length record, Socialisme Ou Barbarie [Drag City]. They have released two albums to date on the Duophonic label which is partially owned by Sadier herself. The first album, Socialisme ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings was released in 2003 after being produced part-time over a period of six years. Their second album, A Few Steps More (2005), marks a more cohesive stage in the band's development. There is now a regular lineup, and it was recorded using studio equipment. The album has been roundly praised and criticised for its superficial resemblance to the sound of Stereolab, but several reviews have commented more on the harmonic structure of the album, which almost seems to blend symphonically at times. Asked about on the album's themes in an interview for Eye Weekly, Sadier commented: \\"I was trying to write to the individual and the capacity to listen to one's desires. Also, I tackled the idea of becoming. I think that's quite an important notion: that things should be allowed to become. I became a singer and it took me years and I want Monade to have a chance to become a band.\\"Eye - Monade - 05.12.05 The name \\"Monade\\" was taken from Cornelius Castoriadis' concept of the \\"monade psychique\\" (psychical monad), which was the term Castoriadis used to describe the undifferentiated infantile psyche, before its shattering into the ego, super- ego, and id through the process of socialization. L√¶titia Sadier has stated that the name has a double meaning ‚Äì the word \\"monade\\" is from the root word \\"mono-\\" (meaning \\"one\\") and etymologically related to the sound recording term \\"mono\\", which stands in contrast to stereo, and therefore is a reference to Monade as a solo side project to Stereolab.MAGNET Interview: Stereolab The title of Monade's first album pays tribute to a libertarian Marxist political group founded by Castoriadis, Socialisme ou Barbarie. In March 2008, a new Monade album was released, without any promotion, called Monstre Cosmic. On September 19, 2009 at The BirdCage in London, it was announced that it was Laetitia's last performance under the name Monade. Laetitia played a selection of new solo songs.

Ramet, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia at Peace and at War: Selected Writings, 1983-2007, (Transaction Publishers, 2008), 23. Until the 1970s HOP was a Croatian emigrant organization with more than 80 percent of its members made up from people who had been politically active in some way in the 1941‚Äì1945 Independent State of Croatia regime. Originally led by Ante Paveliƒá, the former poglavnik, other signatories of HOP's first foundation charter included former Independent State of Croatia government officials such as D≈æafer Kulenoviƒá and Vjekoslav Vranƒçiƒá, which caused it to be considered a successor of the Ustashe, the Croatian fascist movement which ran the Independent State of Croatia. The stated goal of the organization was the re-establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in its World War II borders, encompassing most of territory of present-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was at the time of HOP's foundation part of SFR Yugoslavia. Although considered by outsiders to be the most radical Croatian nationalist organization, HOP officially described itself as an anti-communist organization committed to democratic political means. After the collapse of communism in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the organization's headquarters were moved from Buenos Aires to Zagreb and it was officially registered as a political party in Croatia in October 1991. Following registration, HOP ran in the August 1992 parliamentary election with little success. It has remained a marginal political force ever since. Their only other election campaign came six years later for the 2007 election, in which they also fared poorly. Today, HOP functions as a minor political party in Croatia without holding any seats in the Croatian Parliament or at any other government level. The organization has active branches in Canada (in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver), and Australia (in Melbourne and Sydney).

The Challenger flag is an American flag that was placed in the flight kit of Space Shuttle Challenger for mission STS-51-L. The flag was sponsored by Boy Scout Troop 514 of Monument, Colorado, whose Scoutmaster was William \\"Bill\\" Tolbert, a major in the United States Air Force assigned to the Space Command. Challenger, which launched with the flag aboard on January 28, 1986, broke apart 73 seconds into its flight. In the course of recovery operations at sea over the next several weeks, this flag was found intact and ultimately returned to the scout troop months later. Background William \\"Bill\\" Tolbert had ordered a \\"Capitol flag\\" through Troop 514's congressional representative as a part of the United States Capitol Flag Program. The flag was manufactured by the Valley Forge Flag Company and had been flown briefly over the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. on January 25, 1985. Tolbert intended that this Capitol flag eventually be flown aboard a space shuttle and returned to the scout troop, to serve as a source of inspiration. Through calling in multiple favors, the flag was eventually submitted to the NASA Johnson Space Center by the 2d Space Wing, for flight on a space shuttle. On January 28, 1986, it was carried in the \\"official flight kit\\" of Space Shuttle Challenger on its last flight. It was sealed in plastic and was next to some souvenir medallions being flown by one of the astronauts. After the destruction of Challenger, when the wreckage was brought up from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, rescuers found the flag, still in its sealed plastic bag, intact and completely unscathed. The souvenir medallions had melted into a single lump. On December 18, 1986, the Challenger flag was returned to Boy Scout Troop 514 in a special ceremony attended by 100 dignitaries, guests, and members of the media, at the Consolidated Space Operations Center, Falcon Air Force Station, Colorado. Astronaut Guy Bluford, who had flown on board the Challenger on two previous missions, and who is also an Eagle Scout, returned the flag to the troop. Later usage Troop 514 is still in possession of the Challenger flag. They continue to display it for certain special public events and Eagle Courts of Honor. Early in 1987, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger designated the Challenger flag as the official flag of the ceremonies commemorating the United States Constitution bicentennial and he invited the troop to participate in the bicentennial gala in Philadelphia. On September 17, 1987, the flag was part of a parade through the streets of Philadelphia, and that evening it was presented on the stage of the Philadelphia Civic Center Hall as part of the opening ceremonies. The celebration was attended by an audience of 13,000 people, and televised as We the People 200: The Constitutional Gala. The next day, Boy Scout Troop 514 went to Washington, D.C. where the Challenger flag was flown once again over the United States Capitol. In 2002, the Challenger flag was loaned to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be displayed in Salt Lake City during the 2002 Winter Olympic games. In 2011, the flag was flown at an Eagle Scout Courts of Honor. On November 3, 2012, the flag was brought onstage for a Mitt Romney rally in Denver by Scoutmaster Bill Tolbert. On the 25th anniversary of the Challenger disaster, the Challenger flag was flown at the reveille formation of the United States Air Force Academy. The flag's flying was arranged by Troop 514's current Scoutmaster and Cadet Group One Air Officer Commanding, Lt. Col. Michael Hastriter. In January 2016, the 30th anniversary of the Challenger disaster, the Challenger flag was displayed at a special memorial dinner organized by Challenger Learning Center of Colorado. Retired Shuttle Astronaut Susan Helms was the keynote speaker. On September 26, 2019, at the dedication of the new Challenger Learning Center of Colorado, the Challenger flag was displayed in front of active and retired US Air Force and NASA dignitaries. Dr. June Scobee Rodgers, widow of Challenger Shuttle commander Dick Scobee, presented the keynote address.

Abandoned for long periods of time, modern infrastructure has made the location easily accessible as re-development is taking place. It was used as the location for the final showdown of the movie City of Ghosts (2002) and the 2004 film R-Point. To the north-east are the Povokvil Waterfalls.  History  The Old Catholic church was built by the French in the early 1920s. The Damrei Mountains have long been considered sacred and venerated by the Cambodians. The hill station was built as a resort by colonial French settlers to offer an escape from the heat, humidity and general insalubrity of Phnom Penh. Nine hundred lives were lost in nine months during the construction of the resort in this remote mountain location.Michael Vickery, Cambodia 1975‚Äì1982, quoted from David P. Chandler, The Assassination of Resident Bardez The centrepiece of the resort was the grand Bokor Palace Hotel, inaugurated in 1925. It has been complemented by the villa of the \\"R√©sident Sup√©rieur\\", a post office (now demolished), and a catholic church. It is also an important cultural site, showing how the colonial settlers spent their free time. Bokor Hill was abandoned first by the French in late 1940s, during the First Indochina War, because of local insurrections guided by the Khmer Issarak. It was only in 1962, for the reopening of the \\"Cit√© du Bokor\\", that a casino was established in the new hotels near the lake, (Hotels Sangkum and Kiri). Some buildings were added at this time: an annex for the palace, the mayor's office and a concrete parasol. The Bokor mountain was abandoned again in 1972, as Khmer Rouge took over the area. During the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, Khmer Rouge entrenched themselves and held on tightly for months. In the early 1990s Bokor Hill was still one of the last strongholds of Khmer Rouge.  Transportation  Thanks to modern infrastructure high Bokor can now conveniently be reached via National Highway 3 near the town of Kampot. The ascent previously required a grind on an old road that took 1.5 hours to complete. However, as at December 2011, construction was essentially completed on the new sealed road from National Highway 3 up to the hill station. The road is special in its use of battered slopes and drainage systems in an attempt to prevent landslides. Construction was also well under way on a number of buildings in the hill station area, with the area being partially signed and popular with Cambodian and foreign tourists.  Modern day  Monivong. Statue of Yeay Mao (Grandmother Mao) Now abandoned, with the exception of the old post office, most of the buildings are still standing. The strategic importance of the location is underlined by the fact that the Cambodian authorities maintain a ranger station on the site. The only other historic building currently in use on the site is a small temple. There is also a waterfall which tends to be dry in high season and in full flow during rainy season. About 10 km before on the way for Bokor Hill Station there is the Black Palace (Damnak Sla Khmao). It was a little summer palace of King Sihanouk, abandoned some decades ago. The site is owned by the government but is now under 99‚Äìyear lease to the Sokimex Group who are undertaking to relay the road and redevelop the site, repairing the old hotel and casino along with new buildings (hotels, hospital, restaurants, golf clubs etc.). The project was announced on Jan 19th 2008, construction of the road and resort was expected to take 30 months at a cost of US$21 million. The Thansur Bokor Highland Resort hotel opened in 2012. The subsequent re-development is budgeted at US$1 billion over the next 15 years after which a further application may be submitted to create a larger Bokor city, the plans for which are unknown.Interview with Sok Kong published on The Cambodia Daily FootnotesReferences * * External links * AsiaObscura on Bokor Hill Station * Timeline of Hill Station * Les stations climatiques : hill stations of French Indochina in the Thirties, with some historical photos * Bokor Palace H√¥tel : A comprehensive collection of historical documents about the creation and the history of Bokor Hill Station.

Hirschbeck announced his retirement following the 2016 season. In 2000, Hirschbeck was elected as the first president of the newly certified World Umpires Association, a position he held until 2009. Umpiring career Hirschbeck umpired in the All-Star Game three times (1989, 2004, 2013), in the Division Series 10 times (AL: 1995, 1998, 1999, 2005; NL: 2001, 2003, 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016), the American League Championship Series 5 times (1990, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2015), and the World Series five times (1995, 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016) acting as crew chief the latter three times. Controversies Though umpires typically prefer to stay out of the public eye, Hirschbeck found himself in the spotlight after an on-field incident in the final weekend of the regular season on Friday, September 27, 1996 in Toronto when Baltimore Orioles second baseman Roberto Alomar became involved in a heated, two-way argument with Hirschbeck over a close called third strike. Hirschbeck ejected Alomar from the game, and Alomar subsequently spat in Hirschbeck's face, claiming that the umpire had used a degrading ethnic slur against him. Lip readers contend that Hirschbeck called Alomar a \\"faggot\\" as Alomar walked away, exacerbating an already tense situation.As They See 'Em: A Fan's Travels in the Land of Umpires - Bruce Weber - Google Books Alomar, along with other MLB players, claimed that Hirschbeck's personality had become extremely bitter since one son had died from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and another son had been diagnosed with it. Having heard Alomar's remarks, Hirschbeck charged into the Orioles' clubhouse the next day and he had to be restrained by fellow umpire, Jim Joyce. Alomar was suspended for five games and required to donate $50,000 to ALD research. By October 5, Hirschbeck said he had forgiven Alomar for the incident. The called third strike which provoked the confrontation was described by some observers as an incorrect call.Hock Tooey http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1996/10/14/hock-tooey Alomar and Hirschbeck made public apologies to each other on April 22, 1997, standing at home plate and shaking hands in front of the crowd before an Orioles game. \\"You know, I just wanted to put it behind us,\\" Hirschbeck said on an interview to the Arizona Republic in 2005. \\"I said something to him once and it just flooded out how sorry he was.\\" Hirschbeck and Alomar joined forces to raise awareness about ALD and to raise funds for research. They came to regard each other as friends. When asked about the incident at his retirement in 2005, Alomar said, \\"That, to me, is over and done. It happened over nine years ago. We are now great friends. We have done some things with charity. God put us maybe in this situation for something.\\" Alomar later made a donation of $252,000 for research on ALD. In 2002, MLB sued the umpires union in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in an attempt to discipline Hirschbeck, the union's head. The complaint alleged that Hirschbeck had ordered a member of his umpiring crew not to warn a pitcher for intentionally throwing at a batter.Baseball Clashes With Its Umpires in Court http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/19/sports/sp-bbnotes19 The case alleged that Hirschbeck's performance as an umpire was \\"well below par\\" and specifically mentioned a May 4, 2002, game in Cleveland which Hirschbeck had umpired at home plate. According to vice president for umpiring Ralph Nelson, thirty of the 127 pitches Hirschbeck had called were incorrect, with twenty- two pitches off the plate called strikes by the umpire. Nelson referred to Hirschbeck's performance in that game as the \\"worst by any umpire in any Questec game this year by a substantial margin.\\"BASEBALL; Baseball's Latest Legal Tangle Is With Umpires Union https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/19/sports/baseball-baseball-s-latest-legal- tangle-is-with-umpires-union.html Baseball had already issued a warning letter to Hirschbeck on May 10, 2002, accusing him of misconduct during a game he had worked on April 28 of that year.The Cultural Encyclopedia of Baseball, 2d ed. https://books.google.com/books?id=hYw- CgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA969&lpg;=PA969&dq;=John+Hirschbeck+court+2002&source;=bl&ots;=Y1GHRweKLH&sig;=hZWCI6R42WshlOXFpj1-vhhUBlM&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0CEAQ6AEwB2oVChMIluPJyrHRyAIVDHI- Ch128wwy#v=onepage&q;=John%20Hirschbeck%20court%202002&f;=false In that letter, it was charged that Hirschbeck's actions violated the Official Playing Rules of Major League Baseball, and that Hirschbeck's threat to his supervisor that he would issue needless warnings to pitchers in future games and instruct other umpires to do the same would have \\"serious repercussions\\" for Hirschbeck if carried out.Office of Com'r of Baseball v.

The threats were alleged to have been made during a discussion between Hirschbeck and Rob Manfred, management's top labor lawyer. Hirschbeck was allegedly upset that a personal acquaintance was one of 26 baseball employees laid off earlier that year.Suspended Bruce Froemming apologizes for comment http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2003-01-30-froemming-slur_x.htm On May 5, 2013, Hirschbeck ejected Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals after the outfielder argued a check-swing call for strike three in the first inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post wrote that Hirschbeck should have simply turned his back and ignored Harper rather than escalating the incident.

Hirschbeck's final game as an umpire came in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series between the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians on November 2, 2016. Hirschbeck retired after 34 years as an MLB umpire. Personal life According to Hirschbeck, he began umpiring as a senior in high school; short of money to attend his prom, he started umpiring Little League for $5 a game. He continued in college and umpired in the minor leagues for seven years. He is a 1976 graduate of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, Connecticut, where he played baseball. John's brother Mark Hirschbeck served as an umpire from 1988 to 2003, with the pair becoming the first brothers to become major league umpires. On April 8, 2014, Hirschbeck's son Michael died, 21 years after son John Drew's death from ALD. The cause of death was not immediately known. In January 2015, Hirschbeck announced his planned return to baseball for the 2015 season, explaining how important baseball was to Michael. Cancer On August 23, 2009, Hirschbeck was diagnosed with a form of testicular cancer described as treatable by Dr. Stephen Jones of the Cleveland Clinic, causing Hirschbeck, who had missed the entire 2008 season following back surgery, to miss the remainder of the 2009 season as well. After the tumor was removed via orchiectomy, the cancer was given a 10 percent chance of recurrence, and Hirschbeck returned for the 2010 season. After working a reduced schedule in 2011 due to back pain, Hirschbeck's cancer returned and he missed the 2012 MLB season. His last contest before returning to umpiring's disabled list was Game 162 of the 2011 regular season between the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles. In August 2012 Hirschbeck advised he was again cancer-free and made plans to return to work in 2013. He worked his first Spring Training game after his return to MLB on February 28, 2013, serving as the first base umpire for a Boston-Pittsburgh game.\\"Healthy John Hirschbeck Works First Spring Training Game.\\" Close Call Sports and the Umpire Ejection Fantasy League.

In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency. By contrast, in a capitalist economy managers are instructed to maximize profits for private owners, while competitive pressures are relied on to indirectly lower the price to equal marginal cost. This model was first proposed by Oskar R. Lange in 1936 during the socialist calculation debate, and was expanded by economists like H. D. Dickinson and Abba P. Lerner. Although Lange and Lerner called it \\"market socialism\\", the Lange model is a form of planned economy where a central planning board allocates investment and capital goods, while markets allocate labor and consumer goods. The planning board simulates a market in capital goods by a trial-and-error process first elaborated by Vilfredo Pareto and L√©on Walras. The Lange model has never been implemented anywhere, not even in Oskar Lange's home country, Poland, where Soviet-type economic planning was imposed after World War II, precluding experimentation with Lange-style economy. Some parallels might be drawn with the New Economic Mechanism or so-called Goulash Communism in Hungary under K√°d√°r, although this was not a pure Lange-model system.Wolf, Thomas. \\"The Lessons of Limited Market-Oriented Reform\\" (1991), The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 5, No. 4 (Autumn, 1991), pp. 45-58  Overview  The model is sometimes called the \\"Lange‚ÄìLerner\\" model. Abba Lerner wrote a series of articles that greatly influenced Lange's thinking. For example, Lerner (1938) caused Lange to re- write his 1936 and 1937 articles on market socialism, before they were re- published as chapters in a 1938 book. Lerner (1938) influenced Lange's thinking on social dividend payments. Lerner (1944) also argued that investment in the Lange model would inevitably be politicized. The Lange model was developed in response to Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek's criticisms of socialism during the socialist calculation debate. The critics argued that any body that owns and consolidates a society's means of production cannot acquire the information needed to calculate general equilibrium prices, and that market-determined prices were essential for the rational allocation of producer goods. The Lange model contains principles proposed by neoclassical economists Vilfredo Pareto and L√©on Walras. Lange's theory emphasizes the idea of Pareto efficiency: a situation is Pareto-efficient if there is no way to rearrange things to make any individual better off without making anyone worse off. To achieve Pareto efficiency, a set of conditions must be formulated in stages. This idea of deriving conditions to ensure that consumer preferences are in balance with the maximum amount of goods and services produced is emphasized by Walras. The theorem indicates that a socialist economy based on public ownership could achieve one of the principal economic benefits of capitalism - a rational price system - and was an important theoretical force behind the development of the concept of market socialism.  Basic principles  A chart to show how the model would hypothetically function. The Lange model suggests three levels of decision-making. The lowest level contains firms and households, the intermediate level contains industrial ministries, and the highest level is the central planning board. The board sets the initial price of consumer goods arbitrarily and informs the producing firms of these prices. The state-owned firms then produce at the level of output where marginal cost equals price, P = MC, so as to minimize the cost of production. At the intermediate level, industrial ministries determine the sectoral expansion of industry. Households decide how to allocate income and how much labor to supply by choosing between work and leisure.  Institutions  The key institutions of the Lange model include the central planning board (CPB), industrial ministries for each economic sector, and state enterprises managed democratically by their employees.  Trial-and-error price adjustments  Because prices are set by the central planning board \\"artificially\\" aiming to achieve planned growth objectives, it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in equilibrium at first. To produce the correct amount of goods and services, the Lange model suggests a trial-and-error method. If there is a surplus of a particular good, the central planning board lowers the price of that good. Conversely, if there is a shortage of a good, the board raises the price. This process of price adjustments takes place until equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved.  Central planning board  The central planning board (CPB) has three major functions in the Lange model: First it instructs firms to set price to equal marginal cost, secondly it adjusts prices to attain market-clearing prices for goods and services, and finally, it reinvests the economic profit derived from state enterprises into the economy based on a target rate of growth. The central planning board also distributes social dividends to the population.  Social dividend  Apart from setting prices, the central planning board allocates social dividends. Because all non-labor factors of production are publicly owned, the rents and profits of these resources belong to the public. The profits would be used to finance a social dividend scheme based on the individuals' share in the income derived from the socially owned capital and natural resources, providing a complementary source of income for workers alongside their salaries and wages.On the Economic Theory of Socialism, by Lange, Oskar. 1936. The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1: \\"It seems, therefore, convenient to regard the income of consumers as being composed of two parts: one part being the receipts for the labour services performed and the other part being a social dividend constituting the individual's share in the income derived from the capital and the natural resources owned by society.\\"  Advantages  The Lange economic model has a number of theoretical advantages. One advantage is public control over investment. The rate of economic growth would be largely state-determined and a major determinant would be investment ratio. Another advantage argued by Lange was that externalities could be better accounted for, thanks to the state's ability to manipulate resource prices. Because the state controls all firms, they could easily factor the cost of an externality into the price of a certain resource. Because decisions are made at higher rather than lower levels, it is argued that these decisions are less likely to have undesirable environmental consequences. Furthermore, because the state uses marginal cost pricing and determines entry, Langean socialism can avoid monopolies and the accompanying lack of allocative efficiency and x-efficiency. The model claims to solve another main criticism of capitalism. Lange believed that his model would reduce cyclical instability because the state would control savings and investment, consequently eliminating a major source of inefficiency, inequality and social instability that arises from violent cyclical shifts under capitalism.  Criticisms  Milton Friedman criticized the Lange model on methodological grounds. According to Friedman, the model rested on \\"models of imaginary worlds\\" rather than \\"generalizations about the real world\\", making the claims of the model immune to falsification. He also criticized the model on logical grounds by pointing out that any system which posits state ownership of enterprise requires the continuous intervention by force from the state as any time an individual started a private enterprise the state must either shut it down or seize it, or use force to deter individuals from starting private enterprises in the first place.Milton Friedman, 'Lange on Price Flexibility and Employment', Essays in Positive Economics.

Life and career Marianne von Werefkin was born in the Russian town of Tula as the daughter of the commander of the Ekaterinaburg Regiment. She had her first private academic drawing lessons at the age of fourteen. In 1880, she became a student of Ilya Repin, the most important painter of Russian Realism. Her progress was dealt a setback by a hunting accident in 1888 in which she accidentally shot her right hand which remained crippled after a lengthy period of recovery. By practicing persistently she finally managed to use drawing and painting instruments with her right hand again. In 1892 she met Alexej von Jawlensky, who desired to be her prot√©g√©, and in 1896 she, Jawlensky, and their servant moved to Munich. Werefkin studied with other Russians in Munich at an art school directed by the Slovenian Anton A≈æb√®.Barnett, Vivian Endicott. ‚ÄúRussian Artists in Munich and the Russian Participation in Der Blaue Reiter.‚Äù In Russian Modernism: Cross Currents of German and Russian Art, 1907-1917, 61‚Äì74. Edited by Konstantin Akinsha. Munich, London, New York: Prestel, 2015. For the sake of Jawlensky's painting, Werefkin interrupted her painting for almost ten years. She began painting again in 1906. In 1907 she created her first expressionist works; in these she followed Paul Gauguin's and Louis Anquetin's style of \\"surface painting\\", while also showing the influence of Edvard Munch. She and Jawlensky spent in 1908 several periods working with Kandinsky and M√ºnter after their discovery of the picturesque rural town of Murnau near Munich, where Gabriele M√ºnter owned a house. The four artists frequently painted together in open air in and around Murnau. At her Munich apartment, Werefkin initiated a Salon which soon became a center of lively artistic exchange between members of the German and Russian avant-garde who would later be founders of the Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen (New Association of Artists in Munich, NKVM) and Blaue Reiter. The NKVM, founded in 1909, became a forum of exhibitions and programming. At the first touring exhibition of NKVM, Werefkin exhibited Washerwomen (1909) and The Storm (1907). The simplified form and psychological content of works relate to the sources Werefkin admired at this time including the artist Paul Gauguin, Japanese woodcuts and the expressive works of the Nabis in France. Werefkin also founded the ‚ÄúLukasbruderschaft‚Äù of which also Kandinsky was a member. The two principals of Blaue Reiter, Kandinsky and Marc, met each other at Werefkin and Jawlensky's home on New Year's Eve in 1911. After a few years Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc distanced themselves from NKVM and formed the Der Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider). The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky and a number of native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Werefkin began exhibiting together with Blaue Reiter in 1913. At the outbreak of the First World War, Werefkin and Jawlensky immigrated to Switzerland, near Geneva. They later moved to Zurich. By 1918, they had separated, and Werefkin moved alone to Ascona, on Lago Maggiore where she painted many colorful, landscapes in an expressionist style. In 1924 she founded the artist group \\"Gro√üer B√§r\\" (i.e., Big Bear, Ursa Major). In her later years, she painted posters. Her friends \\"Carmen\\" and \\"Diego Hagmann\\" protected her from poverty. Marianne von Werefkin died in Ascona on 6 February 1938. She was buried in the Russian graveyard in Ascona.

Much later, the idiom has been applied by zoologists to varying kinds of predatory behaviour. A fable based on it has been falsely credited to Aesop and is now numbered 451 in the Perry Index. The confusion has arisen from the similarity of the theme with fables of Aesop concerning wolves that are mistakenly trusted by shepherds; the moral drawn from these is that one's basic nature eventually shows through the disguise. Origin and variants The phrase originates in a sermon by Jesus recorded in the Christian New Testament: Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves (Gospel of Matthew 7:15, King James Version) ; . The sermon then suggests that their true nature will be revealed by their actions (by their fruits shall ye know them, verse 16). In the centuries following, the phrase was used many times in the Latin writings of the Church FathersQuotations from Ignatius, Justin, Tertullian, Archelaus and Lactantius and later on in European vernacular literature.De Gruyter, Thesaurus proverbiorum medii aevi, Berlin, 2000, p.2 A Latin proverb also emerged, Pelle sub agnina latitat mens saepe lupina (Under a sheep‚Äôs skin often hides a wolfish mind). Although the story of a wolf disguised as a sheep has been counted as one of Aesop's Fables in modern times, there is no record of a fable with this precise theme before the Middle Ages, although there are earlier fables of Aesop in Greek sources to which the Gospel parable might allude. The first fable concerning a wolf that disguises itself in a sheep's skin is told by the 12th-century Greek rhetorician Nikephoros Basilakis in a work called Progymnasmata (rhetorical exercises). It is prefaced with the comment that 'You can get into trouble by wearing a disguise' and is followed by the illustrative story. 'A wolf once decided to change his nature by changing his appearance, and thus get plenty to eat. He put on a sheepskin and accompanied the flock to the pasture. The shepherd was fooled by the disguise. When night fell, the shepherd shut up the wolf in the fold with the rest of the sheep and as the fence was placed across the entrance, the sheepfold was securely closed off. But when the shepherd wanted a sheep for his supper, he took his knife and killed the wolf.'Christian Walz: Rhetores Graeci, London, 1832, Myth 4, p.427 The conclusion drawn is different from the Gospel story. In the former one is warned to beware of hypocritical evil-doers; Nikephoros warns that evil-doing carries its own penalty. Francis Barlow, 1687; the end of \\"The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\\" The next version does not appear until three centuries later in the Hecatomythium of the 15th-century Italian professor Laurentius Abstemius. In his telling, 'A wolf, dressed in a sheep's skin, blended himself in with the flock of sheep and every day killed one of the sheep. When the shepherd noticed this was happening, he hanged the wolf on a very tall tree. On other shepherds asking him why he had hanged a sheep, the shepherd answered: The skin is that of a sheep, but the activities were those of a wolf.' Abstemius' comment on the story follows the Biblical interpretation: 'people should be judged not by their outward demeanor but by their works, for many in sheep's clothing do the work of wolves'.Fable 76: a copy of the original Latin with English versions Certain elements of this story are to be found in Aesop's fable of the shepherd who raised a wolf cub among his dogs. When it was grown, it secretly reverted to type. If a wolf stole a sheep and the dogs could not catch it, the guardian wolf continued the chase and shared the meal with the marauder. On other occasions it would kill a sheep and share the meat with the other dogs. Eventually the shepherd discovered what was happening and hanged the wolf. What may be a reference to this story occurs in an anonymous poem in the Greek Anthology in which a goat laments that it is made to suckle a wolf-cub, The Greek fable is numbered 267 in the Perry Index.Aesopica website As in the case of The Walnut Tree, however, this would not have been the first time that Abstemius adapted one of Aesop's fables to fit a contemporary idiom, in this case that of the wolf in sheep's clothing. Though the commonest retelling of the story in English follows the version by Abstemius, it is often credited to Aesop. Another variant fable by Aesop is number 234 in the Perry Index.Aesopica website This concerns a wolf that regularly comes to view the flock, but never attempts any harm. Eventually, the shepherd comes to trust it and on one occasion leaves the wolf on guard. He returns to find his flock decimated and blames himself for being taken in. In neither case is there the suggestion by Aesop that the wolf disguised itself as a sheep. Yet another variation on the disguise theme was included in the Cento favole morali (\\"100 moral fables\\", 1570) of the Italian poet Giovanni Maria Verdizotti. In this the wolf dresses itself as a shepherd, but when it tries to imitate his call, it wakes the real shepherd and his dogs. Since the wolf is encumbered by its disguise, it cannot get away and is killed. This is the version followed in La Fontaine's Fables (III.3).An English translation online The conclusion both poets draw is the same as that of Nikephoros. The story entered the English canon under the title \\"The wolf turned shepherd\\" in Roger L'Estrange's 1692 fable collectionFable 395 and in verse as \\"The Wolf in Disguise\\" in Robert Dodsley's Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1765).Fable 43, pp.50-1 Artistic interpretations Earlier illustrations of the fable concentrated on the hanging of the wolf. More recently, the emphasis has been on the disguise.The Victoria & Albert Museum site has a selection of these In France, the theme of the wolf disguised in shepherd's clothing is more common.Oxford University Press A number of recent CDs are titled A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, although most are references to the idiom and the fable is not mentioned in the words of any of the songs. The same is true of many songs that have the phrase as their title. One exception is the lyric by Tackhead on their 1991 CD Strange Things, which uses the fable for a satirical attack on Capitalist entrepreneurs.Lyrics on Letras Inc In zoology Zoologists have repeatedly compared predatory animals which make use of aggressive mimicry to a wolf in sheep's clothing, including jumping spiders, lacewings, ant-mimicking aphids, hemipteran bugs mimicking chrysomelid beetles, bird-dropping spiders, orchid mantises, cichlid fish, and the zone-tailed hawk which flies with vultures; these animals have evolved to deceive their prey by appearing as other prey, or like angler fish and snapping turtles lure the prey by appearing as the prey's prey.

The airport serves the town of Churchill and the surrounding region. Although it is a small domestic airport, it handles a relatively high number of passengers throughout the year as Churchill is a major destination for ecotourism and scientific research. Churchill Airport also serves as a transfer airport for passengers and cargo travelling between Winnipeg and remote communities in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut.  History  The airport was originally part of the Fort Churchill military installation built by the United States Army Air Forces, with the permission of the Canadian government, during the Second World War. Facilities at Fort Churchill supported the Canadian and American operations of the nearby Churchill Rocket Research Range beginning in the 1950s. The airport at Fort Churchill later served as a Strategic Air Command base housing the 3949th Air Base Squadron of the 813th Strategic Aerospace Division. The asphalt runway is still maintained and the airport serves as a diversion airport for jet aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 747 or Boeing 777 that are forced to make emergency landings.

Biography Benois was born in Russia, to Anna Katarina (Groppe), who was of German descent, and a French father, Louis Jules Benois (from Brie, Saint- Ouen-sur-Morin). He studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts from 1827 to 1836. Eight years later, he was appointed a court architect to Nicholas I of Russia and oversaw several projects in the town of Peterhof, notably the Principal Imperial Stables (1847‚Äì52). He was quite notable in 19th-century Russia for adhering to the Gothic Revival style of architecture and decoration. Benois designed some of the first railway stations in Russia, notably in Strelna, Tsarskoe Selo and New Peterhof, the last being considered his masterpiece. Later in his career he also worked in the Caucasus, where he designed the Summer Palace of the Viceroy in Likani, Georgia. New Peterhof Railway Station By his marriage to Camilla, daughter of Alberto Cavos who designed Mariinsky Theatre, Nicholas had four sons. Of these, Alexander Benois specialized in stage design, Albert Benois was a painter, and Leon Benois became a distinguished architect. His daughter married the sculptor Eugeny Alexandrovich Lanceray, and that marriage produced the artists Zinaida Serebriakova and Eugene Lanceray. The actor Peter Ustinov was a great- grandson.
