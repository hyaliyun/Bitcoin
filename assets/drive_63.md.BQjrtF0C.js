The population was 1,878 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Mills County, which is named for John T. Mills, a justice of the Supreme Court for the Third, Seventh, and Eighth districts of the former Republic of Texas. Goldthwaite is located in the western portion of the Texas Hill Country. The elevation is 1,580 feet. Goldthwaite is situated at the intersections of U.S. Highways 84 and 183, Texas State Highway 16, and Texas Farm-to-Market Roads 572 and 574. History Goldthwaite was originally a part of the southern portion of Brown County. Like many other Texas communities, Goldthwaite was named for a railroad official, Joe C. Goldthwaite of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, who conducted the auction of town lots. The post office opened in 1886. After Mills County was organized, several landowners donated property with the assurance that Goldthwaite would become the county seat. The first county jail was built in 1888, and the courthouse was completed in 1890. The Santa Fe Railroad constructed shops and a roundhouse switch. Goldthwaite was scheduled to have become a division point until labor problems compelled the railroad to relocate the shops to Brownwood, the seat of Brown County, to the north. Even without the railroad, Goldthwaite progressed. By 1898, it had a population of 1,200, three churches, a bank, a number of hotels and boardinghouses, two cotton gins, two gristmills, both public and private schools businesses, and two competing weekly newspapers, the Goldthwaite Eagle and the Goldthwaite Mountaineer.

Nocona is a city along U.S. Highway 82 and State Highway 175 in Montague County, Texas, United States. The population was 3,033 at the 2010 census. The city, its lake, and its resurgence as a regional travel destination were featured in the June 2012 edition of Texas Highways magazine. History The city is named for Peta Nocona, the Comanche chief. The area was first known to white settlers as the last stop in Texas before crossing the Red River on the Chisolm Trail. It was founded in 1887 along a particular bend in the Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway line, which soon became part of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, connecting Gainesville and Henrietta, and later Wichita Falls. Nocona assumed the role of economic and industrial center of northern Montague County, and many older towns in the area, bypassed by the railroad, and its businesses shuttered. Its citizens moved to Nocona. The city has steadily maintained a population around 3000 since the 1940s, though industries responsible for its growth have come and gone. The \\"North Field\\", an oil field between Nocona and the Red River, contributed to Nocona's economy for much of the 20th century and continues to do so on a small scale. The MKT line, which was responsible for Nocona's founding, was abandoned in 1969 and the tracks removed in 1971. Nocona also has a proud history of leather works and has been home to Justin Industries, Nocona Boot Company, and the Nocona Belt Company. Nocona Boot Company and Justin Industries have since moved; however, the Montague Boot Company has been established in downtown Nocona, making boots for the Larry Mahan line at Cavender's Boot City. Also integral to the Nocona economy is the Nocona Athletic Goods Company (product names are spelled \\"Nokona\\"), which manufactures baseball gloves, bats, catcher's equipment, and other sports accessories. The Athletic Goods' facilities burned in July 2006, and production has been moved to a temporary facility. Significant efforts are currently underway to revitalize the Clay Street downtown area. See an example of refurbishing a downtown landmark from start to finish at the F&M; Bank Face Lift Project. Nocona has a lake, about 10 miles north of the city, appropriately named Lake Nocona, or Farmer's Creek Reservoir. It is a recreational lake popular with people from across north-central Texas. On Lake Nocona sits Nocona Hills, an attractive gated lakeside \\"city\\" with many homes, a hotel, golf course, landing strip, and other amenities.

The population was 1,043 at the 2010 census. History Established by primarily European Americans in 1856, the city was originally known as Head of Elm, named for its location at the headwaters of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River, one of the four distinct headwaters. Numerous settlers came to this area from the Upper South of Tennessee and Kentucky, attracted to new opportunities in Texas. Joe Howell was a surveyor who originally laid out the town and is credited as founder. According to one account, Irby Holt Boggess from Tennessee gave leadership in partnership with Howell in or around 1872. This account was displayed in 1986 in the Stonewall Saloon Museum on the town square of Saint Jo. It is incorporated in a story about Boggess. Howell was said to have opposed alcoholic beverage sales, and was given the pejorative nickname \\"Saint Jo.\\" This was also applied to the town he founded. But in 1880 Zachariah T. Haden, who had come from Paducah, Kentucky with his family, was working as a saloon keeper in Saint Jo, perhaps at the Stonewall Saloon.1880 US Census, St. Jo, Montague County, Texas; Roll: 1320; Page: 379A; Enumeration District: 120; Ancestry.com Saint Jo was located near Red River Station, a trading post on the Red River. In the post-Civil War period, this post became the southern terminus of the Chisholm Trail. As ranchers undertook cattle drives to get their cattle to railheads in Kansas and then shipped East, where they could command high prices, the areas related to the trail began to develop increased populations and businesses. Cowboys were the chief customers for saloons and hotels in these towns. Eventually railroads were constructed into Texas, ending the cattle drives to Kansas, and drawing off business along the trail. After the United States' 20th-century Prohibition era, from 1920‚Äì1933, Saint Jo voted to remain a \\"dry\\" city. It was not until May 2009 that residents voted to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption. St. Jo has been proud of its Western heritage and encourages tourism related to it. For instance, the Stonewall Saloon has been preserved for use as a museum, and the main street has retained its late 19th-century character. On May 6, 2017, the Real Chisholm Trail Symposium met in St. Jo. Program participants included representatives of the West Texas Historical Association, the Trail Drivers Association, and the Fort Sill Museum in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Gary and Margaret Kraisinger, the joint authors of the 2004 book The Western: The Greatest Texas Cattle Trail, 1874 - 1886, also appeared.Tai Kreidler, executive director of West Texas Historical Association, email, April 28, 2017.

Handbook of Texas Online: June 10, 2010. Accessed on July 9, 2017. By 1850, the town's name was shortened to Mink. After the Civil War, Mink's population swelled due to an influx of settlers from Kentucky and Tennessee, resulting in a post office being built in 1885. In 1902, the International-Great Northern Railroad (now operated by Union Pacific), decided to build a railroad to the north of Mink, causing most of the residents of Mink to move closer to the railroad line. The new town was named Melton in honor of a wealthy landowner who lived in the area.Town of Magnolia. County Genweb: October 18, 2016. Accessed on July 9, 2017.

History Advertisement for the sale of lots in the Town of Montgomery, Texas from the July 8, 1837 edition of the Telegraph and Texas Register newspaper published in Houston, Texas. The town of Montgomery was founded in the middle of the Lake Creek Settlement by W. W. Shepperd in July 1837 on 200 acres of land that had originally been part of the John Corner League. Shepperd had established the first store in the Lake Creek Settlement in 1835. W. W. Shepperd and his partner John Wyatt Moody named the town Montgomery.Searle, Kameron K. The Early History of Montgomery, Texas. City of Montgomery, Texas: July 7, 2012. Accessed on November 4, 2017. Montgomery became the first county seat of Montgomery County shortly after the county was created on December 14, 1837. Montgomery County was the third county formed during the Republic of Texas. The county originally extended from the Brazos River to the Trinity. The city was officially incorporated in 1848 with Judge Nathaniel Hart Davis as mayor. Origins of the city's name Local histories and accounts by 20th century historians held that the city and county of Montgomery were named after a family of early settlers to the area: Andrew Montgomery or Owen and Margaret Montgomery Shannon. However, recent evidence provided by Kameron Searle suggests that it is more likely that the town and county were named after Lemuel P. Montgomery, a major in the U.S. Army during the Creek War. John Wyatt Moody, one of the founders of Montgomery, was County Clerk of Montgomery County, Alabama before moving to Texas. Montgomery County, Alabama, is named for Lemuel P. Montgomery.Montgomery County, Alabama. Alabama Department of Archives and History. Accessed on June 21, 2017.

There he built houses for his family and his slaves and established the first trading post/store in the Lake Creek Settlement.

However it soon broke with many of the tenets of Bordigism and Marxism per se, arguing that in the aftermath of May '68 there was no longer any potential for the working class to escape the domination of capital through revolution.

Bruce Nichols of The Dallas Morning News said that \\"Several people familiar with the town said troubles began in Patton Village after founding father H.L.

In 1988 state prosecutors indicted 76-year-old Floyd Duval, the municipal court judge, for official oppression after soliciting sex from a 21-year-old woman from Splendora as compensation for a traffic ticket fine. Three weeks before Thursday May 26, 1988, the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct suspended Duval's license. On Tuesday May 24, 1988, 36-year-old Lynn Coleman, a lawyer from New Caney and a former Montgomery County assistant attorney, replaced Duval as the municipal court judge.

June 25, 1989. Retrieved on March 2, 2012. It became the main source of revenue for the community. The stretch was annexed by the city in 1971. Originally the town was on a two lane road that Steve Weller of the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel said was a \\"road going nowhere\\". Therefore, Patton Village did not have much through traffic. The leaders annexed the stretch of US 59, around west of the highway, so it could have through traffic which it could generate revenues from. The through traffic being ticketed did not threaten the actual residents of Patton Village. At one point Patton Village used unmarked police cars with radar equipment in order to catch cars speeding. Bruce Nichols of The Dallas Morning News said in 1988 that the community \\"is probably best known for its reputation as a speed trap, which Patton Village leaders say they're trying to overcome.\\" When the \\"speed trap\\" was active, there were 1,100 citations issued by Patton Village authorities per month. H. L. Patton had criticized the Patton Village for relying on the speed trap. E. A. Ramsey, the municipal judge, agreed with Patton, saying that the stretch of highway in which the speed trap was located was not in the corporate limits of Patton Village. In December 1981 the Patton Village municipal court refused to prosecute motorists who had been ticketed in that speed trap. This caused severe financial issues in the community; the city did not provide W-2 forms for its municipal employees by the designated deadlines. At one point H. L. Patton had sued the city, accusing then current police chief C. B. \\"Bud\\" Watson, former town police chief Johnny Naquin, and former police officer Collier Wright of maliciously and willfully confiscating six of Patton's vehicles; the municipal government had been using those six. On the week of February 6, 1982, H. L. Patton had won his suit, and the jury awarded him $12,700 in actual damages and $30,000 in exemplary damages. H. L. Patton announced that he would be willing to forfeit the winnings from the lawsuit pay to rescue the Patton Village municipality from the shortfall. In 1987 a newly passed law limited speeding ticket charges from small towns to $20. According to Texas House of Representatives member Keith Valigura, a Republican of Conroe, said that Patton Village police decided to do roadside inspections with every speeding driver so that the police department could bill drivers for other violations. The newly elected mayor, 66-year-old Robert Devaney, announced on Tuesday May 17, 1988 that he was going to shut down the municipal court that had processed speeding tickets. 90% of Patton Village's revenues had originated from the \\"speed traps\\" processed by the court and enforced by the then 20-member Patton Village Police Department. The department had continued to maintain a speed trap along U.S. Route 59. Devaney criticized the community for relying on \\"speed trap\\" revenues and said that his community may give amnesty to drivers with speeding tickets and that it may be able to reduce the police budget since it no longer uses the speed trap.\\"Mayor puts brakes on speed trap.\\" The Milwaukee Sentinel. Wednesday May 18, 1988. Page 2, Part 1. Retrieved from Google News (2 of 34) on February 26, 2012. Devaney also requested for an audit and an investigation.

Retrieved from Google Books (1 of 4) on February 26, 2012. which would force municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents each to only have traffic ticket revenues account for 30% of each municipality budget. Patton Village was in District 16, Valigura's district. In response to the proposed bill, Judy Lennon, the Patton Village mayor, lobbied in an attempt to have the bill blocked. On Wednesday May 10, 1989, the Texas House passed the bill with no opposition. Weller said that \\" jealous citizens of nearby Humble, Conroe and Cut and Shoot\\" had pressured Texas state legislators into passing the bill. In response, the police chief, David Broussard, engaged in a hunger strike, only taking coffee, water, and a few beers, for 12 days beginning on May 24, 1989. Broussard hoped to cajole Governor of Texas Bill Clements into vetoing the bill. Lloyd Oliver, the city attorney of Patton Village, threatened to legally challenge Valigura's bill in court and said that it \\"discriminates against towns under 5,000 population.\\" Ultimately Clements signed the bill into law. The pre-Valigura law 1989 Patton Village budget had a projection of $297,700 in total revenues, with 79%, $236,000, to originate from the municipal court issuing citations. Valigura's law took effect on September 1. Since then, the Patton Village authorities tried to overhaul the community's image.

It won a Special Award for Excellence in 1994 from the Urban Land Institute.ULI Awards for Excellence Winners, 1979‚Äì2006. Urban Land Institute. (Link from Google Cache) History The Woodlands was conceived after the oil industry investor George P. Mitchell attended a symposium by the Rouse Company subsidiary American City Corporation and developer of Columbia, Maryland on how to develop new towns using the HUD Title VII program. It was dedicated by George P. Mitchell in 1974 and managed by The Woodlands Corporation as an extension of Mitchell Energy & Development. Mitchell, an oil businessman, planned to establish a conference center, hotels, office parks, retail malls, schools, large distribution centers, and golf courses. Houses would range from moderately priced to expensive and large. Bill Schadewald of the Houston Business Journal said that Mitchell wanted the development to \\"entice city slickers looking for far-flung suburban quality of life\\".Schadewald, Bill. \\"Looking back 'Then and Now' at 40 years of Houston business\\". Houston Business Journal. Friday December 24, 2010. 3. Retrieved September 13, 2011.

Texas Transportation Archive. http://www.ttarchive.com/Library/Companies/GroganAtBivins-Magnolia.html hence Grogan's Mill and Cochran's Crossing neighborhoods, called \\"villages\\". The original planning utilized many of the planning concepts and design consultants employed in other well-regarded new communities of that era such as Columbia, Maryland, Irvine Ranch, California and Reston, Virginia. The original development plan included environmental design principles espoused by Ian McHarg, a distinguished landscape architect, teacher and author of the seminal work Design With Nature. It continued to grow residentially and commercially as many companies were moving there. In addition to Chevron Phillips, Huntsman Corporation, Hewitt Associates, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Maersk, M&S; Engineering and Woodforest National Bank have set up operations. The Town Center includes shopping and eating facilities as well as a waterway resembling the San Antonio River Walk. On September 13, 2008, it sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Ike. Sustained winds of brought down thousands of trees, powerlines, and billboards in the area and severely damaged the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion. Ike was the first hurricane to directly affect the area since Hurricane Alicia in 1983. The summer of 2011 brought an unprecedented drought throughout Texas, which caused thousands of trees to die and requiring they be taken down, a process that continued into 2012. In 2011, Schadewald said \\"Now: Obviously, The Woodlands had quite a future.

Incorporation Mitchell's original plan was for The Woodlands to be annexed by the city of Houston. In the middle part of the 2000s, some residents feared such an annexation, as had happened to the Kingwood development almost a decade before. To counteract any possible move by the city, a movement began to create an independent city government. However, the formation of an independent government would require authorization by the State of Texas and the City of Houston, as Houston held extraterritorial jurisdiction over the area.https://www.thewoodlandstownship- tx.gov/Faq.aspx?QID=64 In 2007, two state legislators representing The Woodlands, Sen.

About 600 of the estimated 1,000 early Danville residents in the 1850s were slaves. After the Civil War, many recently freed slaves lived in the Willis area, establishing Thomas Chapel United Methodist Church in 1867, the oldest church in Willis. In 1870, The Houston and Great Northern Railroad (now the Union Pacific Railroad) decided to build a railroad through Montgomery County. After residents of Danville refused to allow the railroad to be built through their town, Peter J. and Richard S. Willis donated a parcel of their landholdings in Montgomery County so that the railroad could travel through it, founding the town of Willis in the process.Jackson, Charles Christopher. Willis, Texas. Handbook of Texas Online: June 15, 2010. Accessed on July 5, 2017. Upon the railroad's completion in 1872, many residents of the surrounding communities of Danville, Old Waverly, and Montgomery moved to the new town of Willis. In 1874, a county election was held to determine whether the county seat of Montgomery County should be transferred from the town of Montgomery to Willis. Although Willis received more votes (788 to 646), Willis did not receive the requisite two-thirds majority, so the county seat remained officially in Montgomery. A protracted legal battle ended in 1878 when the Supreme Court of Texas ruled in favor of Montgomery. With several county officials and Willis residents refusing to accept the results, another county seat election was held in 1880, with Montgomery winning the vote over Willis 1308 to 1243. The dispute between the two towns finally ended in 1889, when Conroe was selected as the county seat.Harley Gandy, William.Excerpts from \\"A History of Montgomery County, Texas\\" Chapter V, Cities, Towns, and Communities.

In 1891, local Willis residents start growing Cuban tobacco, turning Willis into a hub for the production of cigars and other tobacco products. During the early years of the Great Depression, Willis suffered from falling demand in lumber products and a sharp decline in the demand for tobacco products. The economy began to recover in 1931 during the Texas oil boom, when oil was discovered in the area. In the 1930s and 40s, the development of U.S. Route 75 along with the recovery of the lumber industry during World War II fully revitalized the local economy.

The population was 1,926 at the 2010 census.  History  Worker at carbon black plant in Sunray (photo by John Vachon, 1942) Sunray, Texas, was founded by Jack Clarence Collins. He was born in Hartley, Texas, in 1893, and in 1902 moved to Channing, Texas, with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. E.S. Collins. Jack graduated from Channing High School and later, in 1916, from Texas A&M;, where he was class valedictorian and class president in his senior year. Later, he served for several years as cashier of the First National Bank of Channing while extending his family's ranch holdings. Mr. Collins was well-known and respected in ranching and financial circles, and was a ranking member of the Republican Party for several years.Moore County News, Jan. 6, 1938 Jack Collins did not call the town \\"Sunray\\" when he laid it out in 1930. The first lots were sold at $10 each under the name \\"Altman\\", but it was discovered that a town in Rusk County had already appropriated that name, hence, the name \\"Sunray\\" was used. A post office was applied for on May 5, 1930, using the name \\"Altman\\", but because of the duplication, \\"Sunray\\" was not approved until 1935. The change to the name \\"Sunray\\" came because Sunray Oil Company (later Sunoco) set up a gas-oil refinery near the town on of land originally donated by Mr. Collins to Dana Oil & Gas Royalty Company. Sunray Oil Company bought the holdings of Dana in the early Jones Field in northeast Moore County, which was near the new town. The townsite location was determined by a new Rock Island Railroad route running from Dalhart to Morse along the northern edge of Mr. Collins's townsite survey. At the time, the town was from the Jones Well and from the Morton oil well‚Äîboth early oil-gas discoveries in Moore County. On Sunday, 29 July 1956, the nearby industrial plant was the site of a major accident. The McKee refinery fire killed 19 firefighters when a storage tank suffered a vapor explosion.

It was primarily settled after annexation by the United States by migrants from the South, many of whom arrived before the American Civil War. In that period, farmers had established cotton plantations. It was also an area of pine forests.

Matador City Hall First State Bank in Matador, Texas Matador is a town in and the county seat of Motley County, Texas, United States. The population was 607 at the 2010 census. In 1891, it was established by and named for the Matador Ranch. It is located 95 miles east of Lubbock, Texas.  History  The Matador Ranch was consolidated in 1882 by a Scottish syndicate, and a post office opened at Matador in 1886. At the end of the 19th century, townspeople freed the community from domination by the Matador Ranch, which was liquidated in 1951, by relocating nonranch families there and electing their own slate of officials. The community was incorporated in 1912 and made the county seat. The state required that a town have at least 20 businesses. Local ranch hands hence established fraudulent, temporary businesses using ranch supplies. The only real business in Matador at the time was a saloon.David Jouris, All Over The Map, Its highest population, 1,302, was reached in 1940. Hotel Matador Originally the Carter Hotel, the Hotel Matador was built in 1914 by Roy Carter and his wife, the former Jessie Simpson. For a rural area, the hotel had luxurious rooms with a bell hop, a full-time gardener, and laundry service. It had 15 rooms, a dining room, and a large 9-foot, oak-rimmed tub as the only bathroom in the facility. An ice cream parlor, which ran the length of the lobby, operated until the 1920s.\\"Hotel Matador\\", West Texas Historical Association, March 31, 2011 The name \\"Hotel Matador\\" was coined in the 1920s. The hotel changed owners several times. Under the direction of Judge C.B. Whitten, it was a community gathering place for meetings, parties, and dances for young people. In 1941, hotelier and barber Warren Clements purchased the property. He turned the ice cream parlor into a barber shop. He also established living quarters for himself and his wife, Faye, with an apartment behind the hotel. Mrs. Clements maintained an English garden known for her prize irises, and under her tutelage, the hotel was known for its entertainment. In 1980, Johnny (Sonny) and Evelyn Jackson purchased the hotel and restyled it into apartments. It later became a single residence, but had been abandoned for five years when the current owners took possession and began reclaiming and restoring the historic facility. Three sisters, Marilyn Hicks, Linda Roy, and Caron Perkins, operate the Matador as an eight-unit bed and breakfast. The barber shop was converted to the Circle Cross Heritage suite, with the original tin ceiling and elaborate bathroom fixtures. Traweek House Albert Carroll Traweek, Sr. (1875‚Äì1959) was a physician in Matador, originally from Fort Worth, known as the \\"pneumonia doctor\\" for his success in treating patients with that sometimes fatal illness. He was the first Motley County public health officer and established the Traweek Hospital, now the Motley County Historical Museum. In 1915, Dr. Traweek began construction on the Traweek Home, designed by Charles Stephen Oates, Traweek's uncle and a noted builder in West Texas. The two-story stuccoed masonry structure was completed in 1916 at a cost of $14,000. It is a hybrid of Classical Renaissance, Prairie, and Classical Revival architecture.\\"Traweek House\\", Historical marker, Texas Historical Commission, Matador, Texas Among the visitors to the Traweek House was Baldwin Parker, a son of Quanah Parker, the last Comanche chief, as well as state and national officials. The house at 927 Lariat Street in Matador remains in the Traweek family. It received an official historical medallion in 1964 and was designated in 1990 as a Texas Historic Landmark. Dr. Traweek and his wife, the former Allie Rainey, had six children. The house was last occupied by their youngest son, Howard Traweek (1912‚Äì1988), the county attorney for five decades, and his wife, the former Eleanor Mitchell (1922‚Äì1998). Bob's Oil Well Luther Bedford \\"Bob\\" Robertson (1894‚Äì1947), a native of Greenville, Texas, came to Matador in the 1920s. Originally a service-station attendant, he opened his own Conoco gasoline business, which he topped with a decorative wooden oil derrick. He patented his design, and in 1939, he replaced the wooden derrick with one of steel. It stood 84 ft in height and was lighted.\\"Bob's Oil Well\\", Historical marker, Texas Historical Commission, Motley County, Texas Robertson advertised his business in unusual ways, having maintained a cage of live rattlesnakes for the amusement of tourists. He later added a small zoo of lions, monkeys, and coyotes, and a white buffalo. He paid long-distance truckers to place advertising signs at strategic points across the United States. The signs noted the mileage to Bob's Oil Well in Matador. Matador is equidistant from Dallas and Carlsbad, New Mexico, and 9 miles (14 km) closer to Denver than to El Paso. Robertson soon expanded his operation to include a grocery store, cafe, and garage. He was also a Matador civic leader and sought to recognize returning veterans from World War II. Robertson died in 1947, two weeks before a high wind toppled the steel derrick that had been his trademark. His widow, the former Olga Cunningham (1904‚Äì1993), restored it in 1949 with even more prominent lights. Ultimately, the business failed, and attempts by other to revive it were short-lived. At the intersection of U.S. Route 70 and State Highway 70, the site serves as a reminder of a time when bold roadside architecture was only beginning, and of a man who promoted his adopted hometown in extraordinary ways.

The population was 21 at the 2010 census, making it the smallest town in Texas. Geography Mustang is located at (32.012629, -96.431178). It is situated at the northeast corner of the junction of Interstate 45 and FM 739 in central Navarro County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land. History Mustang was incorporated in 1973 for the purpose of selling alcohol in what was then a dry Navarro County. The incorporation effort was led by partners William \\"Bill\\" McKie, a former Corsicana city attorney, and Harold \\"Mack\\" McElhenney, a businessman. On October 30, 1973, the town approved beer sales. In a March 25, 1975, election, residents voted 20-0 in favor of selling hard liquor, as well as mixed beverages. Mustang had a population of 12 in the 1980 Census, which grew to 35 in 1990. By the mid-1990s, the town lost its status as the primary alcohol stop in the county, as other nearby communities began to repeal their blue laws. The population of Mustang rose to 47 in 2000. Town founder Bill McKie negotiated a deal to sell Mustang to Tommy Sinclair, who leased a club in the community, on June 5, 2005, for $600,000. The transaction was not completed, however, and Sinclair filed a lawsuit in October 2005 for the right to buy the property. McKie died on November 11, 2005, and his wife Marsha took over legal proceedings on her late husband's behalf. Since McKie's death, legal wrangling over ownership of the town and financial issues have plagued Mustang. In November 2006, the city of Angus threatened to cut off water service to the community over an unpaid bill that totaled $3,400. Mrs. McKie, acting on the town's behalf, personally paid the bill. The case over ownership went back to court in April 2007. Four months later, Sinclair was given possession of Mustang, but not the deed. He promptly evicted many of the town council, as well as the city secretary and fire chief. The evictions went to court in November 2007 and a majority of the council left town, but refused to resign their posts. In February 2008, the two council members living in residence called for an election to be held that coming May. The town's disputed ownership status led to the holding of two separate council elections on May 10, 2008. The first election, endorsed by Tommy Sinclair, elected a mayor and five aldermen. The vote was canvassed on May 17. In the second called election, three aldermen positions were left open. Those results were canvassed on May 14. Eight votes were cast; six votes in one election and two in the other. Both governments claimed legitimacy. Tommy Sinclair and two others were indicted on June 25, 2009, by a Navarro County grand jury in connection with the October 1, 2008, death of a Houston man after an alleged altercation at his cabaret in Mustang.

History Richland, at the junction of Interstate 45 and State Highway 14, on Pisgah Ridge twelve miles south of Corsicana in south central Navarro County, was first settled in the late 1840s. Asa Chambers had established a store on the trail from Corsicana to Franklin by 1848, when a post office, named Richland Crossing after nearby Richland Creek, opened in his store. The store, which moved and changed ownership several times, continued to form the nucleus of the community until the early 1870s. When the Houston and Texas Central Railway was built through the area in 1871, the station on the Pisgah Ridge near the store was designated Richland, and a new community began to develop around the depot. A post office named Richland began operating in 1878, and by the mid-1890s the town had two steam gristmills and cotton gins, three general stores, a grocer, two blacksmiths, two saloons, a hardware store, a bank, and an estimated population of 150. The first school had begun operating around the time of the Civil War, and by 1906 the town had a two-teacher school with an enrollment of seventy-five. Richland continued to prosper during the 1920s, reaching a peak population of 750 in 1929. During the 1930s its population began to decline, in part because of the Great Depression. By 1950 the town had twelve businesses and a population of 369. The decline continued during the 1960s and 1970s, and by 1990 Richland had 244 residents and one business.

The population was 2,478 at the 2010 census. History Both Newton County and its county seat, Newton, were named after John Newton, a supposed hero of the American Revolutionary War. However, John Newton's heroics are said to be a product of Parson Weems, who also fictionalized the story of George Washington and the cherry tree. In 1853, disputes led to the building of a courthouse and town in the county's geographical center instead of in Burkeville, a community 11 miles north northeast of Newton. A second courthouse in Newton, a Second Empire style structure, was built in 1902‚Äì03 with bricks from nearby Caney Creek, according to a Texas Historical Commission marker. The town was incorporated in 1935 and remains the only incorporated city in the county. The town's public school began when the W.H. Ford Male and Female College was chartered in 1889. The site of the college later became the Powell Hotel and now serves as a museum and houses the city's chamber of commerce. The growth of the city during the first half of the 20th century was largely due to the dominant timber industry in East Texas. The town had at least one newspaper prior to 1920s. The county courthouse, a focal point of a city square that featured extensive Christmas lighting in the early 1990s, was severely damaged by a fire in August 2000. Various funding and other problems pushed back the timeframe for the restoration of the interior for years. The historic building finally reopened in December 2012. Although almost 80 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, Newton suffered extensive damage in September 2005 from Hurricane Rita.

The Texas and Pacific Railway started service in 1881, with the first train arriving on March 12 of that year, beginning Sweetwater's long history as a railroad town. To encourage the railroads, Sweetwater increased its water supply by building a small town lake (where Newman Park is today) called City Lake in 1898; and three larger lakes thereafter. Construction began on the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway in 1903. Sweetwater became a railroad town, with businesses and homes built along the rail lines. Texas & Pacific Railroad passenger service was discontinued in 1969. Gulf Refinery operated there from 1929 to 1954, and at one time the town was a large telegraph center.

Fran Houser, owner of the Midpoint Caf√© restaurant, antique and souvenir shop from 1990 until 2012, is the basis for Flo of the \\"Flo's V-8 Caf√©\\" diner in Cars. The caf√©, built in 1928 and located between a motel and a former filling station, operated 24 hours a day during Route 66's heyday. Other US 66 attractions in Adrian include a Lions Antique Museum which displays farm and ranch equipment from the 1920s to 1950s, a Windmill which draws water from a well drilled by the Rock Island Railroad and an Antique Ranch which offers antiques and barbecue. The long-closed Bent Door Caf√© and trading post, built by Bob Harris in 1947 on the site of the 1940s Kozy Kottage Kamp, incorporates portions of a former air traffic control tower decommissioned after World War II; the tower windows originally slanted toward the runway, so the door is bent to match. The most recent Bent Door restoration efforts were made in 2009. History left Remnants of more prosperous times along Route 66 in Adrian The community originated in 1900, when the Rock Island Railroad survey marked the site as a future station and shipping point. Former Texas Ranger Calvin G. Aten was one of the area's first settlers. He built a dugout west of the site for his family. The town was named after another early settler, Adrian Cullen. In 1909, the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway was completed through Adrian. The Iowa-based American- Canadian Land and Townsite Company attracted prospective farmers and businessmen to the community. J.P. Collier set up a printing press and dug a water well, running water pipe for the town's first infrastructure. By 1910, Adrian had a post office, several stores, and a newspaper ‚Äì the Adrian Eagle. Approximately 50 people were living in the community in 1915. The slow growth rate was attributed to a lengthy drought and the difficulty of maintaining a sufficient water supply. Adrian became a stopping point for travelers on Route 66 and a shipping point for area wheat growers. A grain elevator was built in 1929 and the community organized a volunteer fire department during the 1940s. Adrian was incorporated in 1953 and adopted a mayor-council form of government. During the latter half of the twentieth century, the population hovered around 220. By 2000, Adrian's population had declined to 159. It is one of two incorporated places in Oldham County, the other being the city of Vega.

Downtown Vega, with courthouse to the right and City Hall to the left Vega is a city and county seat of Oldham County, Texas, United States. The population was 884 at the 2010 census, down from 936 at the 2000 census. History In 1879, the area was opened by the state for homesteading. The first settler, N.J. Whitfield, arrived in 1899. On October 17, 1899, he purchased an area of Oldham County known as 'Section 90' for $1.00 per acre. In 1903, Whitfield sold a 100-foot strip of land that extended across the southern part of Oldham County to the Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Texas (later Rock Island) Railroad as a right-of-way. He then sold portions of land on the south side of the right-of- way to other settlers. A. M. Miller and Howard Trigg surveyed the town site that eventually became Vega in May 1903. The name Vega, which is Spanish for \\"meadow,\\" was chosen because it reflected the vast prairie and surrounding countryside of the area. Soon after, Miller opened a store, and a post office, saloon, and a school that doubled as a Masonic Lodge were built in the community. In 1907, ranchers Patrick and John Landergin purchased a part of the LS Ranch from Swift & Company. Working in association with the Amarillo- based Pool Land Company, the Landergin brothers brought more prospective settlers to the community. The following year, they established a bank in Vega. When the railroad was completed, Vega began to thrive. There were several stores, a blacksmith, two churches, and a newspaper ‚Äì the Vega Sentinel ‚Äì operating in the community by early 1909. The nearby town of Tascosa, which was designated Oldham County seat in 1880, declined in both importance and population as Vega grew. A five-year battle over which community should serve as Oldham County's seat of government was put to a vote in 1915. In the special election, citizens chose to move the county seat from Tascosa to Vega. Until a permanent courthouse was built, county business was conducted in Vega's Oldham Hotel. Modern amenities, such as telephone service, were introduced during the 1920s. In 1926, Route 66 (superseded by Interstate 40) was commissioned as a link from Chicago to Los Angeles and ran through Vega along the Old Ozark Trail. The arrival of Route 66 provided an economic boost for the community. The Route 66 heritage is honored by a restored Magnolia gasoline station located adjacent to the courthouse, which appears as it would have in the 1920s or 1930s. Vega was officially incorporated in 1927, and the population was 519 in the 1930 census. On May 3, 1931, a fire destroyed six buildings west of the courthouse square. Two months later, a second fire burned two buildings on the north side of the square. These fires prompted the town to establish a municipal water system. Vega was home to 515 people in 1940, 619 in 1950, and 658 in 1960. By 1980, over one-third of the population of Oldham County resided in Vega. After a slight decline in the 1990s, the population had risen to 936 as of 2000. Geography Vega is located at (35.245547, -102.425112).

A short time later, in 1840, the town was renamed Madison in honor of President James Madison.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association To resolve the frequent post-office confusion with another Texas community called Madisonville, the town was renamed \\"Orange\\" in 1858. The area experienced rapid growth in the late 19th century due to 17 sawmills within the city limits, making Orange the center of the Texas lumber industry. Orange's growth led to the arrival of many immigrants in the late 19th century, including a moderately sized Jewish population by 1896.\\"Orange, Texas\\", found in the Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities, In 1898, the county built a courthouse in the city, which later burned down and was replaced by the Orange County Courthouse.

The city of Orange sustained a direct hit from Hurricane Rita in 2005, causing damage to the ship. The city decreed that the ship be moved because, as it claimed, the city needed the dock space. Orleck was not allowed to return to the port due to politics (as the city council was wanting the ship cut up and sold for scrap and had a long-running feud with the Restoration Association), so a new location was sought, including one in Arkansas and Lake Charles, Louisiana, for a new home.

A city of Southeast Texas, it lies at the intersection of Interstate 10 and Farm to Market Road 105, east of Beaumont. The town is mainly a bedroom community for the nearby refining complexes in Beaumont and Port Arthur and is part of the Beaumont-Port Arthur metropolitan statistical area. Its population was 10,579 at the 2010 census. History The area was heavily logged after the construction of the Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway that was later part of a line that ran from Kansas City to Port Arthur, Texas. The city was named after lumberman Charles Shelton Vidor, owner of the Miller-Vidor Lumber Company and father of director King Vidor. By 1909, the Vidor community had a post office and four years later a company tram road was built. Almost all Vidor residents worked for the company. In 1924, the Miller-Vidor Lumber Company moved to Lakeview, just north of Vidor, in search of virgin timber. A small settlement remained and the Miller-Vidor subdivision was laid out in 1929. Vidor is a \\"sundown town,\\" where African Americans were not allowed after sunset. It is long considered a haven for the Ku Klux Klan. In 1993, after a federal judge ordered that 36 counties in East Texas, including Vidor, desegregate public housing by making some units available for minorities, the Klan from Cleveland, Texas, held a march in the community. One of the first African- American residents, Bill Simpson, was murdered soon after he arrived. After several families moved in, the sheriff's office received threats to blow up one of the apartment complexes. Residents were threatened by their neighbors, and several families moved out under the pressure.. Vidor is also known in Southeast Texas as a \\"meth town\\" due to the large amount of drugs produced and used in the city. https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/investigations/12news-investigates-the- rise-of-meth-in-southeast-texas/502-42cc89dd-c468-47f5-a5cc-5d865699705d In 2005, 2008, and 2017, Vidor and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from Hurricanes Rita, Ike, and Harvey.

The nearest media market of notable size is in nearby Shreveport, Louisiana. 1996 murder of Marjorie Nugent After losing her husband, widow Marjorie Nugent, an 81-year-old resident of Carthage, became friends with Bernie Tiede, the assistant funeral director in town. In late 1996, townspeople did not see her, but thought perhaps she had moved to join her out-of-town family. When the family could not reach her, they filed a missing-person's report. Nine months after her death, her friend and companion, 39-year-old Bernie Tiede, was brought in for questioning by police and confessed to killing her. He claimed she had emotionally abused him. He shot her four times in the back with a .22 rifle in November 1996. A mortician, he cleaned her body and placed it in a freezer in her house, where it was not discovered until 1997. Tiede continued his community activities for several months after her death. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. After a habeas corpus challenge, he was paroled on a $10,000 bond in 2014, but in 2016, Tiede had a resentencing hearing, and was sentenced to 99 years to life. Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson said initially that few in the community questioned no longer seeing the elderly woman. He said, \\"That's what you do when you're a con guy and you move in. He had her cut all ties, so ultimately the only person she had to rely on was him. Mrs. Nugent was a human being. She didn't deserve her fate at the hands of Bernie.\\" Tiede apparently killed the wealthy woman to get control of her money, spending an estimated $3 million of Nugent's $10 million. Davidson said Tiede used some of it for philanthropy: \\"He sent people to college. He donated to musicals, plays and bought instruments at the college. That was all done with Mrs. Nugent's money. After she was in the freezer, he really jumped out there as a benefactor.\\" An article about these events in Texas Monthly by Skip Hollandsworth was adapted for Bernie, a 2011 dark comedy film which he co-wrote with director Richard Linklater. It starred Jack Black, Shirley MacLaine, and Matthew McConaughey, and was highly praised. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

The 2010 United States Census stated the population as being 25,250. History=Beginnings In 1854, Methodist Reverend Pleasant Tackett led 15 pioneer families into a land they called \\"Goshen,\\" which would later become part of Parker County, itself to be created the following year by the efforts of State Representative Isaac Parker and State Senator Thomas Jefferson Weatherford in the Texas State Legislature. Evidence of a prior, failed attempt to colonize the region can be found in the abandoned cabin from 1852-53 located south of modern Weatherford on the J.H. Voorhies farm. In 1856 The railroad arrived in June 1880. The Santa Fe Depot (which houses the Weatherford Chamber of Commerce) was built in 1908 under Jim Crow laws, with waiting rooms segregated and separated by the ticket office. In 1895, the town's still existing daily newspaper, the Weatherford Democrat, began publication. The Weatherford Telegram began publishing as a weekly newspaper in 2006. Western Heritage Cattle drover Oliver Loving is buried in Weatherford's Greenwood Cemetery. After being attacked by Indians in New Mexico in 1867, Loving's dying wish to his friend, Charles Goodnight, was to be buried at his home, Parker County. Goodnight brought the body back six hundred miles by wagon for burial. The story is the inspiration behind Texas author Larry McMurtry's novel, Lonesome Dove. A year earlier, Goodnight had invented the first chuckwagon which catered to cowboys on a cattle drive that would later become known as the Goodnight-Loving Trail. Bose Ikard, who served with Goodnight and for whom the McMurtry character \\"Deets\\" was modeled, was also laid to rest in the Greenwood Cemetery. Religion Weatherford lies in a geographic region commonly referred to as the \\"Bible Belt\\". As such, it is home to churches of several evangelical traditions including Bible church, Disciples of Christ, Church of Christ, Baptist, Pentecostal, Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Anglican, and Episcopal. There are other denominations such as Latter-day Saints and Catholic as well. There are no worship centers for any other major religions within the city limits. Practitioners of other religions commonly travel to nearby Fort Worth to attend religious services. Peach Capital of Texas The city was named by the Texas Legislature as the Peach Capital of Texas due to the peaches produced by area growers. The peach is celebrated each year at the Parker County Peach Festival, which is Weatherford's largest event and one of the best-attended festivals in Texas. Cutting Horse Capital of the World Weatherford is known as the Cutting Horse Capital of the World. Historic buildings Weatherford has a number of historic homes and buildings.

The population was 1,868 at the 2010 census. History Originally, the community was the Hay Hook Line Camp of the XIT Ranch, and the ranch headquarters was one of the county's earliest buildings. When the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway was built through the ranch in 1898, a switch was placed at the site to be used by cowboys to unload cottonseed shipped in as feed. Some of this feed was invariably spilled along the tracks, causing XIT cattle to gather at the unfenced right-of-way. Often, they lay down, compelling railroad workers to get off their trains and prod them off the tracks.

The population was 1,363 at the 2010 census. The city is located on the Texas-New Mexico border with the city of Texico, New Mexico across the border. History Farwell began as a cow-camp for the XIT Ranch, the huge ranch that was established in 1880. Farwell was named for brothers Charles B. and John V. Farwell of Lake Forest, Illinois, who built the Texas State Capitol building in exchange for 3,050,000 acres of ranchland. That region of Texas had been controlled by the Comanche from about 1725, when they defeated the Apache and forced them to migrate to the Rockies in New Mexico and to other regions. The Red River War of 1874-1875‚Äîthe biggest military operation the U.S. had between the Civil War and World War One‚Äîsaw five armies converge on that part of the High Plains, ultimately defeating the main Comanche force in Palo Duro Canyon (80 miles northeast of Farwell) by driving off and slaughtering the Comanches' horses. The Farwell brothers established the XIT on their new land, ultimately employing 800 cowboys, stringing over 6,000 miles of barbed wire, and hiring former Texas Rangers to defeat the hundreds of cattle rustlers operating across the state line in the New Mexico territory. Many researchers hold that the XIT ultimately failed because of that massive rustling operation, ultimately persuading stock-holders to begin selling off the ranch to families who came to that part of the High Plains drawn by the cheap price of land. It is not documented when the cow-camp that would become Farwell was established but when Parmer County was created in 1907 (previously part of Deaf Smith County to its north), the election was held for county seat in a contest between Farwell, Bovina, Parmerton, and Friona, all to Farwell's northeast, all which had started as cow-camps but had varying success thus far in attracting settlers who ran saloons, stores, stables, and other services for the cowboys. Parmerton was initially voted county seat that year and a one-story courthouse was built there. The election was hotly contested by politicians in the other towns and a new vote was scheduled. Cowboys, who were the largest demographic, lived in their saddles and sleeping bags most of the time with no fixed address. A new regulation was established that each man would vote in the place where he did his laundry. Farwell, possessing the only laundry at that time, thus received all the cowboy votes, even though Friona was, and remains, about four times the size of Farwell, and so Farwell became county seat in the 1908 vote. The Farwell courthouse was erected quickly thereafter. When the decision was made to begin selling off the XIT to settlers, they would arrive in Farwell on the railroad which had reached there in 1899, linking rail to the east with rail to the west of the Rockies Mountains via the track laid between Farwell (and her sister city on the other side of the state line, Texico, New Mexico, also about 1,300 people today) to Belen, New Mexico. Farwell lies at the junction of two branches of the Santa Fe Railway: one branch goes northeast toward Amarillo and the other southeast toward Lubbock. Families from across America arrived by train, stayed in the 4-story Farwell Hotel, and toured the available homestead sites by touring cars. Many of the families then arrived in Farwell and the rest of the region in covered wagons and established their homes in dug-outs in the prairie soil (there being no stone or trees indigenous to the area for construction). Dry-land farming and herding were always risky but families persevered year by year, often relying entirely on their small windmill pumping enough water for the home, a milk cow, some chickens, a few fruit trees, and vegetable gardens when crops and cattle withered during droughts and wind storms. When the premier historian of U.S. western history, Walter Prescott Webb, wrote that the American character sprang from the unforgiving conditions of the High Plains, he could have had Farwell and its surrounding ranchers and farmers in mind. One of the few obelisks marking the Ozark Trail (auto trail) is located at Farwell City Park. The lighted structure was unveiled in 2010 at a cost of $11,000. The Ozark Trail extended from St. Louis, Missouri, to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Other such markers are in Wellington, Dimmitt, and Tulia, Texas.Will Anderson of State Line Tribune in Farwell, \\"Resurrection of the Ozark Trail Marker in Farwell, Texas,\\" West Texas Historical Association annual meeting, Lubbock, Texas, April 2, 2011 For years there has been a simmering dispute over which state Farwell is lawfully a part of: Texas or New Mexico? The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line, making the current towns of Farwell, Texline and a part of Glenrio appear to be within the State of Texas. New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian. New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the land and towns for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas.

History Coyanosa was originally settled as a ranching community in the early 1900s. A post office was established in 1908, but was discontinued ten years later. Further development of the community resumed in the 1950s as numerous water wells were drilled in the area to irrigate nearby cotton farms. By 1958, approximately 200 people lived in Coyanosa. The post office reopened and by the early 1960s, the population had risen to 600. Increasing fuel prices in the mid-1970s made irrigation unprofitable and forced many area cotton farms out of business. A decline in the number of inhabitants soon followed.

History  Fort Lancaster sent 1st Infantry Co. H \\"to take post\\" along Comanche Springs on 12 April 1859. Fort Stockton (named Camp Stockton until 1860) grew up around Comanche Springs, one of the largest sources of spring water in Texas.Comanche Springs Texas Historical Marker, 1968 The fort was named for First Lieutenant Edward Dorsey Stockton of the US 1st infantry, who died in San Antonio on March 13, 1857. Comanche Springs was a favorite rest stop on the Great Comanche Trail to Chihuahua, San Antonio-El Paso Road, and the Butterfield Overland Mail route. In 1861, the fort was garrisoned by 39 men of Company C, 8th Infantry, under the command of Capt. Arthur Tracy Lee, who evacuated the fort by April. The Confederates took possession of the fort on 9 May by Charles L. Pyron at the outbreak of the Civil War, but soon turned command over to Capt. William C. Adams. With the failure of John Baylor's invasion of New Mexico, a general Confederate evacuation of West Texas occurred in 1862. In 1867, the Army rebuilt the fort on a larger and more permanent basis. Other forts in the frontier fort system were Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Richardson, Davis, Bliss, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 48 \\"Subposts or intermediate stations\\" also were used, including Bothwick's Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co., p. 49 On 21 July 1867, Fort Stockton was reoccupied by Companies A, B, E, and K of the 9th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, buffalo soldiers under the command of General Edward Hatch, while a new fort was built one-half mile north of the first post, on the west side of the creek. Major James F. Wade took command of Troops A, B, D, and E, 9th Cavalry, and Company G, 41st Infantry, on 2 Oct. 1868. Lt. Col. Wesley Merritt assumed command of Companies A and D, 9th Cavalry, G, 24th Infantry, and K, 25th Infantry in Feb. 1871. Major Zenas Randall Bliss assumed command on 15 May 1872. Troops B, G, and L, 10th Cavalry, and Companies A and I, 1st Infantry, under Lt. Col. J.F. Wade, were stationed at the fort when the Army decided to abandon it in 1882. Major George A. Purington was the last commander when the Army finally left on 27 June 1886. The old First National Bank building in Fort Stockton, which is now the Fort Stockton Police Station San Antonio entrepreneurs were convinced the water from the nearby Comanche and Leon Springs could be used for irrigation. They purchased large tracts of land for agricultural development. In 1868, Peter Gallagher bought the land that included the military garrison and Comanche Springs, platted for a town site named Saint Gaul, and established two stores at Comanche Springs. Later, Gallagher and John James purchased along Comanche Creek. By 1870, the Saint Gaul region had a population of 420 civilians, predominantly Irish, German, and Mexican Catholics who had come by way of San Antonio. The first church in Saint Gaul was Catholic. When Pecos County was organized in 1875, Saint Gaul became the county seat. The name, however, was never popular with the citizens, and on August 13, 1881, it was changed officially to Fort Stockton. By 1870, some settlers were using the water from the Pecos River for irrigation. Seven years later, irrigated farmland comprised , and by 1945, the total reached . In 1951, Clayton Williams, Sr., and other \\"pump farmers\\" west of town drilled irrigation wells that tapped into the aquifer that fed Comanche Springs. A lawsuit was filed by the Pecos County Water District #1, and 108 families who depended on the flow from the springs, to stop the pumping (Pecos County Water District #1 v. Clayton Williams et al.). On June 21, 1954, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals ruled in favor of Clayton Williams, et al. by upholding \\"the rule of capture\\", agreeing with the landmark 1904 Texas Supreme Court decision that groundwater was \\"too mysterious to regulate\\". The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the decision. By the late 1950s, Comanche Springs was dry due to the pumping. This ruling established what is known as \\"the rule of capture\\" and has regulated groundwater in Texas since. In his book, The Springs of Texas, author Gunnar Brune called the destruction of Comanche Springs, \\"the most spectacular example of man's abuse of nature.\\" After the military post was abandoned on June 30, 1886, and both the Texas and Pacific and the Southern Pacific railroads had bypassed it, Fort Stockton experienced a decline. By then, however, it was rapidly becoming the center for an extensive sheep- and cattle-ranching industry, and in 1926, the opening of the nearby Yates Oil Field brought on an economic boom. Fort Stockton was served by the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway. Since the 1920s, Fort Stockton has experienced the economic boom-bust cycle of the petroleum industry. As of 2012, Fort Stockton is in a state of economic expansion as oilfield drilling and production has increased. Fort Stockton is southwest of Midland International Airport. The town is within driving distance of the Big Bend country, including Big Bend National Park, , and the Big Bend Ranch State Park, , as well as the scenery of numerous day-drive locations in the area. Education The City of Fort Stockton is served by the Fort Stockton Independent School District. Fort Stockton has two elementary schools, Alamo Elementary and Apache Elementary, both of which house grades K-3. Fort Stockton Intermediate School houses grades 4‚Äì5, while Fort Stockton Middle School houses grades 6-8 and Fort Stockton High School houses grades 9-12. The city and district share the old Alamo school building, using it for the Recreation Department to host Little League games. Another older school, Comanche, is now privately owned. Butz High School now serves as the alternative education facility. Pre-K services, as well as other child-care facilities exist in town. Higher education The town has a Texas A&M; Agrilife Extension Office, offering environmental systems management courses. Fort Stockton is also home to the Midland College Williams Regional Technical Training Center. The center was built in 1996 through a joint effort by Midland College and leaders of Fort Stockton education, business, and government as a means to enhance higher education and workforce development in this part of West Texas.

It is the county seat of Presidio County, and its population as of the 2010 United States Census was 1,981. The city was founded in the early 1880s as a water stop; the population increased during World War II, but the growth stalled and reversed somewhat during the late 20th century. Today, Marfa is a tourist destination and a major center for minimalist art. Attractions include Building 98, the Chinati Foundation, artisan shops, historical architecture, a classic Texas town square, modern art installments, art galleries, and the Marfa lights. History Presidio County Courthouse in Marfa Marfa was founded in the early 1880s as a railroad water stop. The town was named \\"Marfa\\" (Russian for \\"Martha\\") at the suggestion of the wife of a railroad executive. Although some historians have hypothesized that the name came from a character in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov,\\" Marfa was actually named after Marfa Strogoff, a character in Jules Verne's novel Michael Strogoff. The town grew quickly during the 1920s. The Marfa Army Airfield served as a training facility for several thousand pilots during World War II, including the American actor Robert Sterling, before closing in 1945. The base was also used as the training ground for many of the United States Army's chemical mortar battalions. Geography Marfa is in northeastern Presidio County within the Chihuahuan Desert. The town is about 20 miles south of Fort Davis on Texas Route 17 and about 18 miles west of Alpine on US Route 67.Texas Atlas & Gazeteer, DeLorme, 4th edition, 2001, p. 63 According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Climate Marfa experiences a semiarid climate (BSk) with hot summers and cool winters. Due to its elevation and aridity, the diurnal temperature variation is substantial. Demographics As of the 2010 United States Census, 1,981 people, 864 households, and 555 families resided in the city. The population density was 1,354.6 people per square mile (521.6/km). The 1,126 housing units averaged 719.1 per square mile (276.9/km). The racial makeup of the city was 30% White, 0.4% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.05% Asian, 7.50% from other races, and 0.75% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 68.7% of the population. Of 863 households, 29.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.4% were married couples living together, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.6% were not families. About 31.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.99. The age distribution of the population shows 24.9% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 24.5% from 45 to 64, and 18.5% who were 65 years of age or older.

Arts and culture The area around Marfa is known as a cultural center for contemporary artists and artisans. In 1971, Minimalist artist Donald Judd moved to Marfa from New York City. After renting summer houses for a few years, he bought two large hangars and some smaller buildings and began to permanently install his art. While this started with his building in New York, the buildings in Marfa allowed him to install his works on a larger scale. In 1976, he bought the first of two ranches that became his primary places of residence, continuing a long love affair with the desert landscape surrounding Marfa. Later, with assistance from the Dia Art Foundation in New York, Judd acquired decommissioned Fort D.A. Russell, and began transforming the fort's buildings into art spaces in 1979. Judd's vision was to house large collections of individual artists' work on permanent display, as a sort of antimuseum. Judd believed the prevailing model of a museum, where art is shown for short periods of time, does not allow the viewer an understanding of the artist or their work as they intended. The Chinati Foundation Since Judd's death in 1994, two foundations have worked to maintain his legacy: the Chinati Foundation and Judd Foundation. Since its inauguration in 1986, Chinati has held an open-house event that attracts visitors from around the world to visit Marfa's art. Between 1997 and 2008, both foundations cosponsored this event. The Chinati Foundation now occupies more than 30 buildings in Marfa and has permanently displayed work by 13 artists. In recent years, a new wave of artists has moved to Marfa to live and work. As a result, new gallery spaces have opened in the downtown area. The Crowley Theater and its annex host public events with seating for over 175 as a public service to nonprofit foundations. Furthermore, The Lannan Foundation has established a writers-in-residency program, a Marfa theater group has formed, and a multifunctional art space called Ballroom Marfa has begun to show art films, host musical performances, and exhibit other art installations. The city is also from Prada Marfa, a pop art exhibit, and is home to Cobra Rock Boot Company and The Wrong Store. Marfa Myths, an annual music festival and multidisciplinary cultural program, was founded in 2014 by nonprofit contemporary arts foundation Ballroom Marfa and Brooklyn-based music label Mexican Summer. The festival brings together a diversity of emerging and established artists and musicians to work creatively and collaboratively across music, film, and visual arts contexts. The festival is inherently embedded in the landscape of Far West Texas, and deeply engaged with Marfa's cultural history and present-day community. Building 98, also located in Marfa, is a project of the International Woman's Foundation, which has operated an artist-in-residency program since 2002. The International Woman's Foundation was responsible for placing Fort D.A. Russell on the National Register of Historic Places as an effort to preserve the historic importance of the site. The facility's studio galleries host artists who desire to exhibit work in the region at a premier venue. In late September 2012 through early April 2013, the foundation held a major retrospective of the works of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong at Building 98 featuring over 75 unseen works of the early American woman modernist. Building 98 is located at historic Fort D. A. Russell; it is the home of Marfa's German POW murals.The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, The facility also features the George Sugarman sculpture courtyard. Marfa lights Official viewing platform for the Marfa lights Apart from Donald Judd and modern art, Marfa may be most famous for the Marfa lights, visible on clear nights between Marfa and the Paisano Pass when one is facing southwest (toward the Chinati Mountains). According to the Handbook of Texas Online, \\"at times they appear colored as they twinkle in the distance. They move about, split apart, melt together, disappear, and reappear. Presidio County residents have watched the lights for over a hundred years.\\" The first historical record of them dates to 1883.\\"Marfa lights.\\" Handbook of Texas. Presidio County has built a viewing station 9 miles east of town on US 67 near the site of the old air base. Each year, enthusiasts gather for the annual Marfa Lights Festival. The lights have been featured and mentioned in various media, including the television show Unsolved Mysteries and an episode of King of the Hill (\\"Of Mice and Little Green Men\\") and in an episode of the Disney Channel Original Series So Weird. A book by David Morrell, 2009's The Shimmer, was inspired by the lights. The Rolling Stones mention the \\"lights of Marfa\\" in the song \\"No Spare Parts\\" from the 2011 re-release of their 1978 album Some Girls. In popular culture 215x215px Various movie productions have filmed in and around parts of Marfa. The 1950 film High Lonesome and the 1956 Warner Bros. film Giant were filmed in Marfa. In August 2006, two movie production units filmed in Marfa: There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men.Whitney Joiner, \\"Postcard: Marfa.

Marfa houses the offices of the Big Bend Sentinel, a weekly newspaper covering the areas of Marfa, Fort Davis, Presidio, and far West Texas. Marfa Magazine is a yearly publication distributed from Marfa, founded and operated by Johnny Calderon Jr. It focuses on issues and general information about Marfa, Alpine, and Fort Davis. Infrastructure Marfa is served by the Marfa Independent School District. Within it, Marfa Elementary School and Marfa Junior/Senior High School serve the city. Marfa International School, a private school, opened its doors in 2012, serving students in grades 1‚Äì8, with scholarships available based on need. As of October 1, 2009, the city no longer has a local police department. The Presidio County Sheriff's Department and Texas Highway Patrol provide law enforcement for the city, as well as the county as a whole. Highways  Presidio County also operates the Marfa Municipal Airport, located north of the city in unincorporated Presidio County. Commercial air service is available at either Midland International Airport, northeast, or El Paso International Airport, northwest. Greyhound Lines operates an intercity bus service from the Western Union office.\\"Marfa, Texas.\\" Greyhound Lines. Amtrak's Sunset Limited, which operates between New Orleans and Los Angeles three days a week, passes through the city, but does not stop; the nearest station is located in Alpine, northeast. Marfa and the surrounding area are served by the Marfa Public Library, which houses a diverse collection in a variety of formats. The library began in 1947 when the Marfa Lions Club and the Marfa Study Club agreed to establish a library for the citizens of the area. The library was originally housed in the historic U.S.O. building, but was moved to a city- owned building after the city took over the project. After meeting the requirements of the Texas State Library, it became a member of the Texas Trans-Pecos Library System. The present library building was donated to the City of Marfa in 1973 by the first chairperson, Laura Bailey, and her husband Bishop. Future expansions and renovations to the current building are also planned.

Presidio is approximately 250 miles southeast of El Paso, 240 miles southwest of Odessa, and 145 miles northeast of Chihuahua City. History The junction of the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande at Presidio was settled thousands of years ago by hunting and gathering peoples. By 1200 AD, the local Native Americans had adopted agriculture and lived in small, closely knit settlements, which the Spaniards later called pueblos.Riley, Carroll L. The Frontier People: The Greater Southwest in the Protohistoric Period. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1987, pp. 285‚Äì310 (See La Junta Indians) The first Spaniards came to Presidio in , √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions stopped at the Native American pueblo, placed a cross on the mountainside, and called the village La Junta de las Cruces. On December 10, 1582, Antonio de Espejo and his company arrived at the site and called the pueblo San Juan Evangelista. By 1681, the area of Presidio was known as La Junta de los R√≠os, or the Junction of the Rivers. Five Jumano towns were located along the Rio Grande to the north of the junction, consisting largely of permanent houses.Gary Clayton Anderson, The Indian Southwest, 1580‚Äì1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999), p. 21 In 1683, Juan Sabeata, the chief of the Jumano nation, reported having seen a fiery cross on the mountain at Presidio and requested that a mission be established at La Junta. The settlement in 1684 became known as La Navidad en Las Cruces. The missions La Navidad en las Cruces, San Francisco de los Julimes, San Antonio de los Puliques, Apostol Santiago, and Santa Mar√≠a de la Redonda may have been established on the Texas side of the Rio Grande at La Junta.Mar√≠a Eva Flores, C.D.P., and Julia Cauble Smith, \\"LA JUNTA DE LOS RIOS\\", Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ryl01), accessed April 28, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. About 1760, a penal colony and military garrison of 60 men were established near Presidio. In 1830, the name of the area around Presidio was changed from La Junta de los Rios to Presidio del Norte. White American settlers came to Presidio in 1848 after the Mexican War. Among them was John Spencer, who operated a horse ranch on the United States side of the Rio Grande near Presidio. Ben Leaton and Milton Faver, former scalp hunters for the Mexican government, built private forts in the area. During the Mexican Revolution, General Pancho Villa often used Ojinaga as his headquarters for operations and visited Presidio on numerous occasions. In 1849, a Comanche raid almost destroyed Presidio, and in 1850, Indians drove off most of the cattle in town. A post office was established at Presidio in 1868, and the first public school was opened in 1887. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed George B. Jackson, an African American former buffalo soldier, as customs collector at Presidio, a position he held until his death in 1900. Jackson, a businessman from San Angelo, was considered the \\"wealthiest colored man in Texas\\" in the second half of the 19th century.Suzanne Campbell of Angelo State University, San Angelo, \\"George B. Jackson, Black (or African-American) Businessman, Rancher, and Entrepreneur\\", West Texas Historical Association, annual meeting, Lubbock, Texas, April 2, 2011 As a result of General Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa's force's raid and capture of Ojinaga on January 10, 1914, many Mexican army troops and civilians fled to Presidio, seeking safe-haven. U.S. forces detained 2,000 Mexican refugees in Presidio, eventually marching them north 60 miles to Camp Marfa. The refugees would later be sent by train to Ft. Bliss (El Paso). In 1930, the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway reached Presidio and the Presidio‚ÄìOjinaga International Rail Bridge was built. The population grew from 96 in 1925 to 1,671 in 1988, but the number of businesses declined from 70 in 1933 to 22 in 1988. At the end of 1988, Presidio experienced a population boom, due in part to previously undocumented immigrants enrolled in the amnesty program. The population in 1990 was 3,422. Despite Presidio's having been occupied continuously since ancient times, the community was finally incorporated in 1980, with Herb Myers elected as Presidio's first mayor. The 1959 movie Rio Bravo featured the town, and in 1964 the movie Rio Conchos. In 1986, the Texas Department of Transportation opened a two-lane bridge, connecting Presidio and Ojinaga, the Presidio‚ÄìOjinaga International Bridge. By 2019, a second span will be constructed, with the original bridge being refurbished. The increased bridge capacity is projected to meet higher traffic, mainly commercial and agricultural in nature. As of 2020, Presidio's local economy is based largely upon employment at Presidio Independent School District, United States Customs and Border Protection, and local retail businesses. In 2010, Presidio built the world's largest sodium-sulfur battery to provide power when the city's lone line to the United States power grid goes down.http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-04/texas-town-turns- monster-battery-backup-power Geography Presidio is located at (29.561272, -104.366522).

The Rio Conchos flows in a northeasterly direction from its source in the Sierra Madre in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico.

When that was rejected, the name Point was accepted. By 1890, the community had an estimated population of fifty, a public school, and four churches. Ten men, led by newspaperman Isaac Newton Gresham, met in Point on August 28, 1902, and signed a charter to establish the Farmers' Educational and Cooperative Union of America. The organization went national in 1905 and had a million members by 1908. In 1913, Point established the first independent school district in Rains County. The number of residents had risen to around 600 in 1914. The Great Depression severely impacted the community, leading to a rapid decline in population and the number of businesses in Point. The paving of U.S. Route 69 in the early 1940s bolstered the population to approximately 420, but that figure had again declined to 350 by the end of that decade. The MKT line was abandoned in the mid-1950s. In 1957, the Iron Bridge Dam was constructed on the Sabine River to form Lake Tawakoni. When the lake reached its fullest extent in 1960, it was only four miles from Point. Point was incorporated as a city in 1966. Development along the shores of Lake Tawakoni eventually became a separate community, East Tawakoni, which incorporated in 1967. Point's population was 419 in 1970 and slowly grew, due to a combination of tourism and its role as a local agricultural trade center.

As of the 2010 Census, the city population was 2,936. It is the county seat of Reagan County. The city takes its name from a dry lake, a unique dryland plains geographic feature situated atop the divide between the Rio Grande and Colorado River watersheds, located less than two miles south of the city, through which St Hwy 137 passes. The dry lake, with no outlet, is over two sections in size, making it the largest in Texas; it holds water temporarily and only after high-runoff rain events, being used for grazing the remainder of the time. Though seasonal and temporal, the \\"big playa lake\\", in wet periods, is significant in a semiarid, drought-frequented environment and has been utilized regularly as a food and water resource by man and animal, alike, since prehistoric times. Started as a small ranching community in the late 1880s, Big Lake owes its original existence to the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway, which passed through the area in 1912, as it was extended from Sherwood, west of San Angelo, to Girvin and beyond the Pecos River. The growth from the railroad, coupled with that from the Santa Rita discovery well in 1923, allowed it, in 1925, to take over the position of county seat from Stiles, a pioneer ranching community established in 1894 on Centrailia Draw, about 20 miles to the north. The main highway through the area, US 67, was extended through the region in 1934, on the way to a termination in Presidio. The city's current existence is based on agriculture (some farming, but mostly ranching) and oil and gas service and production throughout the area. History In 1919, Rupert Ricker began the process of leasing 674 sections of University of Texas land, part of their Permanent University Fund. Unable to fund any test wells, Ricker sold the prospect to Frank Pickrell and Haymon Krupp, who organized the Texon Oil and Land Company. The company geologist, Hugh H. Tucker, picked the drill site, claiming a structure wide and long. The drill site was north of the Orient Railroad tracks, and west of Best, Texas. They hired Carl G. Cromwell to spud the first test well in 1921, using cable tools. On the afternoon of 27 May, oil showed in the bailer. Then, on the morning of 28 May 1923, the Santa Rita No. 1 gushed oil after drilling to a depth of . Initial production was 100 BOPD, which overflowed the earthen tanks, and then onto the ground for over a month before casing could set. The oil was then shipped by tank car to a refinery in El Paso. Michael Late Benedum bought the Texon find, and formed the Big Lake Oil Company, in October 1923. By 1924, Benedum had established the Big Lake oil field as the first major oil field in the Permian Basin. In 1926, this field had 74 wells producing a total of 32,317 BOPD.

In the summer, low humidity helps temper the heat. Due to Big Lake's aridity and elevation, temperatures drop quickly after sunset, especially in the summer. Some precipitation falls in summer, mostly as fast-moving thunderstorms. Winters are dry. Winter temperatures occasionally drop below freezing at night, but sustained, bitter cold is uncommon. Snowfall is rare, never exceeds a few inches, and usually melts quickly. Education The City of Big Lake is served by the Reagan County Independent School District. Big Lake in popular culture The city of Big Lake was featured in the 2002 movie The Rookie, although the town portrayed in the movie was actually Thorndale, Texas, which is actually east of Austin.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265662/locations In the movie, the town lacked a proper baseball field, while the high school football stadium was the main focus of athletic attention.

The population was 425 at the 2010 census. The city is named for John H. Leakey (1824‚Äì1900), a pioneer from Tennessee. Leakey depends heavily on tourism because of the existence of the nearby Frio River and Garner State Park. The Alto Frio Baptist Encampment is located to the southeast of the community. Geography Leakey is located at (29.725243, -99.761463). It is situated at the intersection of U.S. Highway 83, RM 336, RM 337, and FM 1120 in southeastern Real County, approximately 35 miles north of Uvalde and 90 miles northwest of San Antonio.

September 3, 1973. Retrieved on September 7, 2013. History Archaeological excavations in the Frio Canyon region revealed Paleo-American, Archaic, and Neo-American occupations. Later, several Native American tribes, including Lipan Apache, Comanche, and Tonkawa inhabited or traversed the area. Anglo-American settlement of the area began in 1856 when John Leakey, his wife Nancy, and a few others settled near a spring along the banks of the Frio River. Shingles and lumber were produced from the abundant cypress and cedar trees. In its first few years, the community was a lonely outpost that was subject to frequent Indian raids, which continued until 1882. Growth accelerated after the Civil War as new families arrived. In 1883, A.G. Vogel moved a post office from the community of Floral to Leakey. That same year, the Texas State Legislature created Edwards County and designated Leakey as the county seat less than a year later. 1883 was also the year that the area's first school was established on land donated by the Leakeys. A new school building was completed in 1890. In 1891, the Edwards County seat was moved from Leakey to Rocksprings. During the early 1900s, ranching superseded lumber, cotton cultivation, and corn production in importance to the local economy. The raising of Angora goats was a major component of the ranching industry. In 1902, the school in Leakey had a total enrollment of 102 students. The town's population was estimated to be 318 in 1904. Real County was created from parts of Edwards, Bandera, and Kerr Counties in the spring of 1913, with Leakey as the county seat. In 1919, Real County Judge Ed Kelly established the Leakey Independent School District. By the mid-1920s, the population had declined to around 120. A larger school building was completed in 1930. Soon after, several nearby schools, including West Frio, Cypress Creek, Rio Frio, Exile, Stanford, Dry Frio, and Harper were consolidated with Leakey schools. Leakey was formally incorporated on June 11, 1951. The population fluctuated during the latter half of the 20th century. Leakey was home to 450 people in 1960, 393 in 1970, 468 in 1980, and 399 in 1990. By 2000, there were 387 residents living in Leakey, representing a 3.01% decrease in population since the last census was conducted in 1990. On March 29, 2017, thirteen senior citizens from the First Baptist Church of New Braunfels in Comal County who had completed a retreat at Alto Frio were killed when Jack D. Young, the 20-year-old driver of a pickup, crashed into the church minivan on U.S. Highway 83 inside Uvalde County near the state park. One person survived the crash in critical condition. The accident was one of the deadliest in memory in the Leakey area.\\"Speed a factor in deaths: It's not known if people on bus were using seat belts\\", San Antonio Express-News, March 31, 2017, pp. 1, A10. Young told a witness, \\"I'm sorry. I'm sorry\\" and said that he had been on his cell phone at the time of the accident.

The population was 482 at the 2010 census. From the 1920s through the early 1960s Avery was one of the largest tomato producing and shipping cities in northeastern Texas. History The town was established in the 1870s. Avery is located on U.S. Highway 82 sixteen miles southeast of Clarksville in eastern Red River County. When the Texas and Pacific railroad was being constructed through the county in the 1870s, the managers of the railroad planned a station at the site and named it Douglass. Settlement in the community was slow because the surrounding area was so sparsely populated. When a correspondent of the Clarksville Standard newspaper visited Douglass in early 1881 he found a collection of families living in tents. Later that year, when Isaac Bradford and his partner opened their general store, a post office was established there, and the name of the town was changed to Isaca. In 1902 the name was changed to Avery, in honor of Ed Avery, the first railway station agent. In 1884 the population was estimated at thirty, and by 1896 it had increased to forty-eight. By 1900 Avery had three churches, a school, and a population of 176. During the first decade of the twentieth century cotton ginning was an important local industry. By 1914 the town had two banks; a weekly newspaper, the Avery News, published by H. H. Morgan; and a population estimated at 500. The population reached its highest point in the late 1920s with a reported 800 residents, before falling sharply to a low of 300 in the early 1930s. Avery was incorporated before the 1940 census, when it reported 477 residents. The population subsequently remained relatively stable.

His nickname was given to him by John Lennon when he was involved with the group between 1965 and 1969, during which time he became head of Apple Electronics. Mardas arrived in England in 1965, exhibiting his Kinetic Light Sculptures at the Indica Gallery. He impressed John Lennon with the Nothing Box: a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights, and allegedly claimed that he could build a 72-track tape machine. Mardas was in India with the Beatles at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India and was then given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in Savile Row. His schemes lost Apple at least ¬£300,000 (¬£ in pounds). In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware, so Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs. King Hussein of Jordan bought a fleet of cars that Mardas had customised, but then reportedly had the changes reversed when tests demonstrated them to be useless. In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in electronic communications and security. He later returned to Greece. London and the Beatles The 23-year-old Yannis Alexis Mardas first arrived in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending John Dunbar of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in with him in a flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Known at this time as Yannis Mardas, he found employment as a television repairman. Dunbar later introduced Mardas to Brian Jones, after Mardas exhibited his Kinetic Light Sculptures at the Indica Gallery. Dunbar worked with Mardas on the ‚Äúpsychedelic light box‚Äù for The Rolling Stones' three-week tour of Europe in 1967, although they were not impressed with the results. Dunbar later said: \\"He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing. He knew enough to know how to wind people up and to what extent. He was a fucking TV repairman: Yannis Mardas, none of this 'Magic Alex' shit!\\" Jones introduced Mardas to Lennon, and it was at this point that Mardas impressed Lennon with the Nothing Box; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 8 - 0:29:53) George Martin talking about the toys that Mardas gave Lennon. Lennon later introduced the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his \\"new guru\\", calling him \\"Magic Alex\\". Mardas allegedly told Lennon about ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was \\"working on\\", which he later disavowed either promising or discussing: a telephone that responded to its owner's voice and could identify who was calling, a force field that would surround the Beatles' homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers, which would actually be a part of the wallpaper. Mardas later asked for the V-12 engines from Lennon's Rolls-Royce and George Harrison's Ferrari Berlinetta car, so he could build a flying saucer. Mardas had denied these in a formal statement. The Beatles set up a company for Mardas called Fiftyshapes Ltd. in September 1967; he later became one of the first employees of the newly formed Apple Corps, earning ¬£40 a week (equivalent to ¬£ in ). and receiving 10% of any profits made from his inventions. The Beatles often called Mardas the \\"Greek wizard\\",16 Magazine, September 1968. p48 and Paul McCartney remembered being interested in his ideas: ‚ÄúWell, if you [Mardas] could do that, we‚Äôd like one\\". It was always, 'We‚Äôd like one'‚Äù. Mardas' ideas were not confined to the realms of electronic wizardry, but included songwriting involvement, with a Lennon-Mardas composition, \\"What's the New Mary Jane\\", originally meant for inclusion on the Beatles' self-titled double album (also known as the White Album). Lennon later removed Mardas' songwriting credit for unknown reasons. Mardas was given his own laboratory called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped to obtain a British work visa. His pay eventually rose to ¬£6,000 per year (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and an American patent attorney, Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles Anthology DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, \\"Hello, I'm Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I would like to say 'Hello' to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics.\\" Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 8 - 0:30:02) Mardas in the Apple Electronics studio. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: \\"I'm a rock gardener, and now I'm doing electronics. Maybe next year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant\\". Greece The Beatles had tried in 1964 to buy the Trinity Island, (Greek: ŒëŒ≥ŒπŒ± Œ§œÅŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ±), off the coast of the Greek island of Euboea (pronounced EV-i-a) (resembling a guitar in shape) but the owners were not interested in a sale. Lennon was still interested in buying or leasing an island to live on together, and discussed it with the other Beatles on 19 July 1967. Mardas' father was a major in the Greek secret police, and Mardas explained that through him the Beatles would have access to Greek government connections, which would speed the acquisition of an island, because many islands did have the right certificates of ownership and were subject to government restrictions. On 22 July 1967, Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd, Ringo Starr and Neil Aspinall flew to Athens, where they stayed in Mardas' parents' house overnight, until Lennon, along with Cynthia Lennon and their son Julian Lennon, McCartney and Jane Asher, Pattie Boyd's 16-year-old sister Paula, Mal Evans and Alistair Taylor set off for Athens. Their chartered yacht, the MV Arvi, was detained in Crete because of bad weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days. Taylor complained that on a trip to a small hill village, \\"We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us\\", which Mardas had organised. McCartney later said that while sailing around Greek islands, everybody just sat around and took LSD.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 6 - 1:06:18) Harrison talking about the trip to Greece to buy an island. They eventually found what is referred to as the island of Leslo (although no Greek island is officially known by this name). The island had a small fishing village, four beaches, and a large olive grove. Four small neighbouring islands surrounded it (one for each Beatle). The Beatles sent Alistair Taylor back to London to handle the purchase of the island. Alistair received permission from the Greek government to purchase the island, and ¬£90,000 of special \\"export dollars\\" required for the transaction were purchased. However, the Beatles changed their minds before the deal went through, and the export dollars were sold for a ¬£11,400 profit a few months later when exchange rates went up (one of the few profitable business ventures for the Beatles). \\"The Beatles visit a Greek island they intended to purchase\\", The Beatles Bible. Retrieved on 30 March 2019. Apple Boutique and marriage On 1 August 1967, Mardas, Aspinall and Derek Taylor were invited by George Harrison to stay at the home of Robert Fitzpatrick, on Blue Jay Way, and on 7 August 1967, Harrison and his wife Pattie visited San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district with Mardas.The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 7 - 0:06:42) Harrison talking about visiting Haight-Ashbury, with photos of Mardas sitting/standing next to him. The Apple Boutique, at 94 Baker Street, London, was one of the first business ventures made by the Beatles' fledgling Apple Corps, and Mardas (at great expense) was commissioned to create one of his ideas; an \\"artificial sun\\" which would light up the night-time sky, for the opening on 7 December 1967. When the time came for Mardas to demonstrate his artificial sun for the Beatles, he claimed that there was not a strong enough energy supply to power it; the Beatles accepted this explanation. Mardas appeared (uncredited) in the Beatles' TV movie Magical Mystery Tour, which was first broadcast on BBC1 on Boxing Day in 1967. On 11 July 1968, 26-year-old Mardas married 22-year-old Eufrosyne Doxiades (the daughter of a respected Greek architect) at St Sophia's Church, London.16 Magazine, November 1968. p64 Harrison and his wife attended, and Lennon (who was there with Yoko Ono) was joint best man, along with Donovan. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and India Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Mardas and Aspinall joined Lennon and Harrison in India, where they were studying meditation under the tutelage of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; Starr had returned to England‚Äîcomplaining that the Indian food did not agree with him‚Äîand McCartney had left on 24 March 1968. When Mardas first met the Maharishi, he said sarcastically, \\"I know you! Didn‚Äôt I meet you in Greece years ago?\\" Mardas was jealous about the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and during one of their frequent walks through the woods he asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Lennon replied that the Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating a large part of their income to the Maharishi's bank accounts in Switzerland. When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build a high-powered radio station, so he could broadcast Maharishi's teachings to the whole of India. Alcohol was not allowed in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later reported to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi had sex with a young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: \\"Well, it must be true, because if George [Harrison] is doubting him, there must be something in it\\". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some \\"black magic\\" on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi. Cynthia Lennon personally believed that Mardas invented the story about sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on the Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention.Musician magazine, September 1992, p. 43 \\"There was nothing that ever happened except that there was a fella who was supposedly a friend of ours who stirred up and created this big fantasy. There was never anything that took place\\". Harrison and McCartney later offered their apologies to the Maharishi (McCartney said that he did not believe the accusation at all). In 2010, Mardas issued a statement to the New York Times denying that he had spread rumours. Lennon's divorce After returning to England in May 1968, Lennon suggested that Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, Boyd, and her sister.Hunt, Chris (Uncut) December 2005 Lennon said that he would be very busy recording what would become The White Album and that it would do her some good to take a break with Mardas, his girlfriend Jenny Boyd, and others. Cynthia arrived home one day early from Greece on 22 May 1968. She and Mardas discovered Lennon and Yoko Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring into each other's eyes, and found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' marital bedroom door. Cynthia asked Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but Mardas got Cynthia drunk and tried to convince her that they should both run away together. After Cynthia had vomited in the bathroom she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, but Mardas joined her and tried to kiss her until she (in her words) \\"pushed him away\\". Brian Epstein's personal assistant, Peter Brown, maintains that Cynthia did sleep with Mardas, saying: \\"She knew it was a mistake the moment it happened, especially with Alex [Mardas], whom she had never trusted, nor even liked\\". Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly afterward, telling Cynthia she could not go with them, so she went on a trip to Italy with her mother. During Cynthia's holiday in Italy, an \\"agitated\\" Mardas unexpectedly arrived (pacing up and down outside her hotel until she returned) and gave the news that Lennon was planning to sue Cynthia for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and send Cynthia \\"back to Hoylake\\". Mardas also said that he intended to testify in court that Cynthia had committed adultery with him. She said in 2005: \\"The mere fact that Magic Alex [Mardas] arrived in Italy in the middle of the night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy for John [Lennon] and Yoko to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad\\".The Loves Of John Lennon by Chris Hunt, Uncut, John Lennon Special, 2005. Apple Studio Apple Corps offices, at 3 Savile Row, where Mardas was asked to build a studio in the basement Mardas had often said that the Abbey Road studio was \\"no good\\",The Beatles Anthology DVD, (2003) (Episode 8 ‚Äì 0:29:56) George Martin talking about Mardas saying that Abbey Road was \\"No good\\". much to producer George Martin's annoyance: \\"The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios to see what we were doing and to learn from it, while at the same time saying 'These people are so out of date.' But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn't, a minor schism developed\\". Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road‚Äîwhich was being updated at the time to an 8-track‚Äîso he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr's drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some \\"huge\\" surplus computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but \\"they never left the barn\\", and were later sold as scrap metal. Mardas gave the Beatles regular reports of his progress, but when they required their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a patch bay to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like \\"bits of wood and an old oscilloscope\\". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was \\"chaos\\", and that they had to \\"rip it all out and start again,\\"The Beatles Anthology DVD (2003) (Episode 8 ‚Äì 0:30:32) Harrison talking about the chaos in the studio, and having to rip it all out. calling it \\"the biggest disaster of all time.\\" Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had \\"just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas\\". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone. The Beatles asked producer Martin to come to the rescue, so he borrowed two portable four-track recorders from EMI, and long-time Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick was given the task of building and setting up a recording studio with the loaned equipment. After Allen Klein was brought in to be the Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics and Mardas left the company. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost the Beatles at least ¬£300,000 (¬£ in pounds if it was essentially spent in 1968). Starr once approved of one of Mardas' ideas: \\"He [Mardas] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio ‚Äì you'd have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead. We brought EMI and Capitol in from America to look at it, but they weren't interested at all.\\" According to author Peter Doggett, in the Beatles' history, Mardas is the only individual who occupies a place close to Klein's in terms of vilification from commentators and biographers. Security consultant In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware. Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs, using the former King Constantine II of Greece as his principal salesman.Campbell, Duncan, New Statesman, 3 August 1979. pp. 158‚Äì160 Ex-King Constantine‚Äîwho at the time was exiled in Britain‚Äîprovided contacts to several royal families for Mardas, and had close contact with the deposed Shah of Iran, who had moved to Mexico. The Shah was one of the first people interested in the customised bullet-proof cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas‚Äô companies. In 1974, Mardas held an expensive party for the then heir to the throne of Spain, Prince Juan Carlos; this secured Mardas a contract. After the assassination of Admiral Carrero Blanco the Spanish royal family thought it ought to acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it was parked in Chobham for almost a year as nobody knew how to do the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over ¬£1/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of \\"Project Alcom\\") in St Albans Mews off Edgware Road, London, to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services. Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former Ministry of Defence official. North American‚Äìspec Mercedes- Benz 1978 450SEL 6.9 The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, but quickly discovered that they were not as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing guns at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which caused the fuel tank to explode, destroying the entire car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent. King Hussein of Jordan had a fleet of cars that Mardas customised, but carried out a safety test on them with live ammunition in November 1977. One eyewitness reported that the cars could be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the armour-plating, and the thick armoured glass broke into jagged splinters when struck. Hussein ordered that the cars be restored to their previous state. These failures convinced Mardas and Constantine to look at the growing European market for anti-terrorist protection, setting up a factory in London to produce \\"bullet-proof\\" cars in 1978. This was financed by an investment of over ¬£1 million through anonymous Monegasque and Swiss bank accounts, which were believed to be controlled by the Shah. The media and the courts On 28 February 1988, The Observer published an article naming Mardas as an arms dealer, but printed an apology on 30 April 1989. After an article on 18 September 1988 (\\"Joan's Secret Lover\\"), and another a week later, The People newspaper was taken to court by Mardas, who won ¬£75,000 in damages. The Daily Mail published an apology and gave an undisclosed sum in damages on 16 January 2004, after an article on 11 June 2003, which accused Mardas of dealings that would later resurface in his claim against The New York Times in 2008. The Independent newspaper apologised on 21 August 2006, writing that on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas had not been a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and had not been fired, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas \\"did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a 'sonic force field' or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors\\". In 2008, Mardas won the right to sue The New York Times in England, in relation to an online article which said he was a charlatan. In a story about the Maharishi, Allan Kozinn had written: \\"Alexis Mardas, a supposed inventor and charlatan who had become a Beatles' insider\\". After an appeal, Mardas won the right to continue his case of defamation against The New York Times in 2009. After The New York Times produced a witness, Sir Harold Evans, who gave evidence supporting the journalistic responsibility of the paper, Mardas said he would not pursue the case further, on condition that the paper would publicly explain that by labelling him as a charlatan, it did not mean to imply that he was a con man. On 4 March 2010, The New York Times published an editor's update to the 2008 article, saying: \\"While expressing skepticism about his work as an inventor during that period, the article did not accuse Mr. Mardas of engaging in fraudulent dealings or criminality. ... The Timess reporting on those events was attributed to Paul McCartney and based on widely published accounts from books and magazines\\". Later years and death Mardas put 15 items from his collection of Lennon memorabilia up for sale on 5 May 2004 at Christie's in South Kensington, London. Among the sale was Lennon's leather collar worn during 1967 and 1968 (at the launch party for the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP, and on the cover of Lennon and Ono's Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins), as well as a custom Vox Kensington guitar, a coloured felt pen drawing called \\"Strong\\", and a pen and ink drawing by Lennon entitled \\"Happy Fish\\". Mardas said he planned to donate the money to a charity in Greece. The \\"custom Vox Kensington guitar\\" later sold at an auction for ¬£269,000 on 19 May 2013. Mardas lived in Athens until his death on 13 January 2017 at age 74 from pneumonia.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,285. Geography Clarksville is located at (33.611086, -95.052448). Located northwest of Texarkana near the center of the county, it is at the junctions of U.S. Highway 82, State Highway 37, and Farm roads 114, 412, 909, 910, and 1159. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. History Clarksville was established by James Clark, who moved to the area in 1833 and laid out a town site. When Red River County was organized in 1835, Clarksville was chosen as the county seat, beating out the community of La Grange (later named Madras). Isaac Smathers built one of the first houses, which was later owned by Charles DeMorse. The town was incorporated by an act of the Texas Congress in 1837, and within a few years it became an educational and agricultural center. In 1841, John W.P. McKenzie, a Methodist minister, retired from serving as a missionary and moved to a former plantation about SSW of Clarksville. Naming his new home Itinerant's Retreat, he soon began offering classes for boys who lived in the surrounding area. During that same year, 16 boys enrolled in classes in his home. There was more demand than he could accommodate in his home, so he had a log cabin to the plantation to serve as a more conventional school. As the enrollment grew, he added 3 large wooden buildings to serve as dormitories and opened the school to girls and boarding students. By 1854, McKenzie College had 300 students and 9 faculty members participating in a 10-month school year. Before the American Civil War began, Rev. McKenzie's school was the largest institution of higher education in Texas during the 1850s, and trained almost all of the new Methodist ministers in the state. Although the school was always considered a Methodist institution, it actually continued to be owned by McKenzie. He tried to turn it over to the local Methodist Conference in 1855 and 1860, but each time the Conference declined to accept certain unspecified conditions, so the official transfer never occurred. By the fall of 1861, most of the male students had already enlisted in the Confederate Army. In 1863, the school had only 33 students. The average number rose to 74 during the years 1864‚Äì67. Unable to obtain sufficient financing to continue, Rev. McKenzie closed the school permanently on June 25, 1868. In 1844, Clarksville Female Academy opened, after moving from Pine Creek, where it was originally founded in 1840. A Clarksville post office opened in 1846, and by 1838 there was semiweekly mail service between Clarksville and Natchitoches, Louisiana. A frame courthouse was built in 1840, and replaced with a brick structure on the main square in 1850. A brick jail was built nearby in 1852. The First Presbyterian Church was organized in Shiloh, Gregg County, Texas in 1838, but relocated to Clarksville in 1844. The Texas State Historical Society says this is \\"...among the oldest continually operating Protestant churches in the state.\\" The Texas State Historical Society also reports that Clarksville was the most important commercial center in this part of Texas from the late 1830s until the Civil War. Once the Red River proved navigable by steamboats, goods could be shipped directly from New Orleans to Rowland's Landing, north of Clarksville, then hauled overland by wagon. By the time the war broke out, the city had a population of about 900. Economic recovery from the Civil War was stimulated when the Texas and Pacific Railway reached Clarksville in 1872, bringing new settlers and new businesses. The 1870 census showed a population of 613. By 1885, the population had grown to about 1,200. The city could then boast of a new limestone courthouse, five white and two black churches, a Catholic convent, three schools, two banks, two flour mills, and a weekly newspaper, the Clarksville Times. In 1914, the city had 3,000 residents and had added a waterworks, two newspapers, an ice plant, and an electric power plant. After that, outside events such as two world wars, the Great Depression, and increased competition from other cities (e.g., Dallas, Paris, Bonham, and Texarkana) had begun to slow Clarksville's growth. As shown by the census table, the population in 2000 was very near to that in 1920. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 3,883 people, 1,530 households, and 1,006 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,299.2 people per square mile (501.4/km2). There were 1,787 housing units at an average density of 597.9 per square mile (230.8/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 53.39% White, 42.18% African American, 0.21% Native American, 0.26% Asian, 3.01% from other races, and 0.95% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.29% of the population.

History Signpost in Pecos Water tower and the Santa Rosa church in Pecos, Texas Pecos is one of the numerous towns in West Texas organized around a train depot during the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railway. These towns were subsequently linked by the construction of U.S. Highway 80 and Interstate 20. Prior to the arrival of the railroad, a permanent camp existed nearby where cattle drives crossed the Pecos River. With the introduction of irrigation from underground aquifers, the city became a center of commerce for extensive local agricultural production of cotton, onions, and cantaloupes. The introduction of large-scale sulfur mining in adjacent Culberson County during the 1960s led to significant economic and population growth. The growth was reversed after mining operations ceased in the 1990s. In 1962, Pecos resident and tycoon Billie Sol Estes was indicted for fraud by a federal grand jury. Estes' extensive machinations caused a national-level scandal, resulting in a shakeup at the Department of Agriculture. Oscar Griffin, Jr., of the Pecos Independent and Enterprise newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking the story.

Education The City of Woodsboro is served by the Woodsboro Independent School District and home to the Woodsboro High School Eagles. History Woodsboro is in southwestern Refugio County five miles southwest of the city of Refugio at the intersection of U.S. Highway 77 (Future Interstate 69E) and Farm-to-Market Road 2441. The town began as part of a land development project organized in 1906 by W. C. Johnson and George P. Pugh, experienced developers from Danville, Illinois. The town was originally called Church because it was located just north of the Church siding on the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway, which built through the area in 1906. The town site was laid out in November and December 1906, and by February 1907 Johnson and Pugh had completed the town's first structure, a wooden hotel built to house prospective land buyers. (\\"This is the Real Garden of the Lord,\\" a large sign painted on the side of the hotel advised visitors.) A post office was established in the hotel later that year, and the town's name was changed to Woodsboro after Captain Tobias D. Wood, who had sold the Bonnie View Ranch to the developers. The surrounding farmlands were praised in advertisements distributed across Texas and midwestern states, and a number of settlers began to move into the area. By 1908, when Woodsboro was officially platted, a school had been established, and the town already had grown to include about twenty-five buildings, including the hotel, a cotton gin, a lumberyard, and a number of dwellings. Other stores and a Masonic temple were quickly added, and in 1910 the town's first newspaper, the Woodsboro Hustler, began publication. The Bank of Refugio opened a branch in Woodsboro in 1912, and in 1913 a contract was awarded to install electrical power and lights in the community. By 1914 there were about 500 people living in Woodsboro. The Commercial Club, a group of local businessmen organized soon after the town's creation, actively worked to improve the community. The club organized the town's first water works, which were turned over to the local government when Woodsboro incorporated in 1928. An estimated 450 people lived in Woodsboro in 1925, but the town experienced a small boom after 1928, when oil was discovered nearby. As construction and oilfield workers moved into the area, Woodsboro's population rapidly increased, rising to 1,286 by 1930. Though the town was touched by the Great Depression in the early 1930s, by the late 1930s oil activity had revived in the area, and the town continued to grow.

Years later, the new owner, cotton baron William Marsh Rice, whose first wife was Bremond's daughter, Margaret, had the town surveyed and named after Bremond. The town was incorporated in 1870. In the 1870s a large number of Polish immigrants came to the area to grow cotton. In 1878, local resident Francis Marion Wootan discovered that the local water had a high mineral content. Following a popular trend at the time, Wootan began bottling the water and marketing it for its curing properties. Wootan Wells soon became a popular resort community, with four hotels and hundreds of support staff. (See also Mineral Wells, Texas) In 1916, fire devastated the community, dealing a heavy blow to Wootan Wells also. Flooding and drought also contributed to the decline of the town, and in 1921 another fire shut down Wootan Wells permanently. Texas Highway 6 was once routed through Bremond coming into town with Texas Highway 14 and took a sharp turn to the left in the town onto what is now Farm to Market Road 46. Highway 6 was later realigned and bypassed Bremond to the west.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 1,192. It is located approximately halfway between Waco and Bryan-College Station at the intersection of Texas State Highway 6 and Farm to Market Roads 1644 and 979, on the Southern Pacific line nine miles north of Hearne in west central Robertson County. For the last 35 years, Calvert has enjoyed a relative success as an antique \\"capital\\". The town is named for Robert Calvert, an early settler who served in the Texas Legislature representing Robertson and Milam Counties. History=Founding & coming of the railroads The earliest known white settler in the area was Joseph Harlan, whose 1837 land grant laid five miles south of what is now the City of Calvert. In 1850, Robert Calvert, for whom the town was named, established a plantation west of the town. Calvert, who was a former Texas Representative and area farmer urged the Houston and Texas Central Railway to build through the area. The Houston and Texas Central Railroad agreed to stop in the town, at the encouragement of town leaders, in 1868. In January 1868, a group of investors purchased land at the townsite and platted the community; by February of that year, merchants from the nearby communities including Sterling and Owensville were uprooting and moving to the community. A post office also opened in Calvert in 1868. The first trains arrived in Calvert in 1869, and the town was incorporated the next year with an aldermanic form of municipal government. Although the Stroud family owned most of the land, the town was named for Robert Calvert because he was a driving force behind getting the railroad to stop in the town. The order of election for the incorporation of Calvert was issued July 5, 1869, but a majority actually voted against incorporation. This election was set aside because it was believed that \\"a fair expression of the qualified voters was not had,\\" and a new election was held Saturday, July 24, 1869, a majority voted for incorporation, and the town was ordered incorporated on August 13, 1869. After the railroad made Calvert the major trading center of the area, it was reported that: > It was a common sight to see six or eight wagons drawn by oxen slowly > passing through the one and only street of these towns enroute to Houston to > dispose of their cotton. These wagons averaged ten miles a day. The team- > masters usually owned their teams and were paid so much per hundred pounds > for hauling freight.  Named as county seat  In 1870, as Reconstruction sparked political maneuvering in Robertson County, the former county seat of Owensville was replaced by Calvert. The town had been briefly occupied by federal troops early in 1870. Just nine years later, however, the voters of Robertson County voted to move the county seat to nearby Morgan.  Development & decline  By 1871, the town claimed to have the largest cotton gin in the world. However, sources differ on when, exactly, the gin was built. The Handbook of Texas cites the 1871 date, while a 1931 Frontier Times piece on Calvert places the building of the gin by John H. Gibson as 1876. Eventually, P.C. and J.H. Gibson, Jr., took over the gin. It had 21 stands and a connected oil mill. The gin served a significant portion of the Brazos River bottoms. 32,000 bales were reported received in 1882. In 1873 a severe yellow fever epidemic killed many in the community, severely depopulating the town. An early judge, in speaking about the epidemic, noted: > The disease was brought to town by a traveling printer from Louisiana where > the fever was raging. He took a room over the restaurant in the Bailey > building and died there. As many persons as could made an exodus before the > town was quarantined. We lost between three and four hundred persons. The > fever was a terrible epidemic, and our people suffered because we did not > know how to treat the disease. The trains were not allowed to stop in > Calvert then and the windows of the coaches were closed until they were far > out of town. A county jail was built in 1875. By 1878, Calvert had 52 businesses. Today, the city of Calvert still exists as a Texas municipality. As of 2016, the town's mayor is Marcus D. Greaves. Modern controversies In December 2010, all three members of the town's police department resigned over a conflict with the city council. In June 2015, a TV station reported that cities of Calvert, Franklin, Hearne, Lott in a \\"Texas Triangle\\" were using their police departments to issue numerous speeding tickets to turn their municipal court into a \\"cash cow\\".Judge says he quit over speeding ticket quota; WFAA 8 TV; June 3, 2015.

It is situated along State Highway 205 in south central Rockwall County, about 6 miles southeast of Rockwall. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (0.90%) is covered by water. History The community of McLendon-Chisholm began as two separate settlements: McLendon and Chisholm. McLendon Named for landowner P.A. McLendon, the community of McLendon was settled around 1870. He built a combination store, cotton gin, and blacksmith shop that remained in operation until 1975. A post office opened in 1880, and by 1896, McLendon was home to an estimated 150 residents. The post office closed in 1905. Throughout the early 20th century, the population hovered around 50. Chisholm The land that eventually became the site of Chisholm was given to Mexican War veteran King Latham in 1847. Enoch Parson Chisholm and his brother B. Frank Chisholm, from whom the community's name was derived, purchased from Latham in 1856. A few years later, Enoch purchased an additional for $2.00/acre. He organized the Chisholm Methodist Church in 1871 and the community of Chisholm was officially platted in 1886. In that same year, Berry Creek Academy was formed through the merger of two local schools. Chisholm's first store opened in 1890 and a post office was established in 1891. By 1898, Berry Creek Academy was the second-largest school in Rockwall County, boasting a total enrollment of 301 students. The Chisholm post office closed in 1905, but the community continued to grow. The population was estimated at 102 in 1904 and peaked around 200 in 1940. By the 1960s, that figure had dropped to around 167. Incorporation On October 18, 1969, the two communities incorporated as McLendon-Chisholm. Residents seeking zoning protection and the preservation of their rural lifestyles was the main reason behind the incorporation effort. By the mid-1970s, the city had approximately 170 residents. That number rapidly grew to 480 in the 1980s and 646 by the 1990 census. By 2000, the population had increased to 914, a 41 percent increase over the 1990 figure.

In most contexts it means the inheritance of the firstborn son (agnatic primogeniture);\\"primogeniture, n.\\". OED Online. September 2019. Oxford University Press. https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/151368 (accessed October 26, 2019). it can also mean by the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture). The common definition given is also known as male-line primogeniture, the classical form popular in European jurisdictions among others until into the 20th century. In the absence of male-line offspring, variations were expounded to entitle a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture). Variations have tempered the traditional, sole-beneficiary, right (such as French appanage) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute male-preference primogeniture). Most monarchies in Western Europe have eliminated this, in succession: Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. English primogeniture endures mainly in titles of nobility: any first-placed direct male-line descendant (e.g. eldest son's son's son) inherits the title before siblings and similar, this being termed \\"by right of substitution\\" for the deceased heir; secondly where children were only daughters they would enjoy the fettered use (life use) of an equal amount of the underlying real asset and the substantive free use (such as one-half inheritance) would accrue to their most senior-line male descendant or contingent on her marriage (moieties); thirdly, where the late estate holder had no descendants his oldest brother would succeed, and his descendants would likewise enjoy the rule of substitution where he had died. The effect of English primogeniture was to keep estates undivided wherever possible and to disinherit real property from female relations unless only daughters survived in which case the estate thus normally results in division. The principle has applied in history to inheritance of land as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished. Other forms of inheritance in monarchies have existed or continue. The Holy Roman Emperor was selected for enthronement by a small number of powerful prince electors from among Europe's Christian males of inherited nobility. Currently, succession to the Saudi Arabian throne uses a form of lateral agnatic seniority, as did the Kievan Rus' (see Rota system), the early Kingdom of Scotland (see Tanistry), the Mongol Empire (see lateral succession) or the later Ottoman Empire (see succession practices). Research shows that authoritarian regimes that rely on primogeniture for succession were more stable than forms of authoritarian rule with alternative succession arrangements. Order of succession in monarchies today World monarchies by succession: European monarchies by succession: African monarchies by succession: Southeast Asian monarchies by succession: Middle Eastern monarchies by succession: Absolute primogeniture Absolute cognatic primogeniture diagram Absolute, equal, or lineal primogeniture is a form of primogeniture in which gender is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 implemented this.SOU 1977:5 Kvinnlig tronf√∂ljd, p. 16. An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, was consortium or coregency between husband and wife or other relatives. The most notable are the Egyptian cases of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, and the monarchs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. In 1980, Sweden amended its Act of Succession to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King Carl XVI Gustaf's infant son, Prince Carl Philip, in favor of his elder daughter, Princess Victoria, in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the Netherlands in 1983, Norway in 1990, Belgium in 1991, Denmark in 2009, Luxembourg in 2011, and the Commonwealth realms in 2015. Monaco, the Netherlands, and Norway also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of kinship to the most recent monarch. Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture: * With the birth of Infanta Leonor of Spain on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent Felipe, Prince of Asturias, and Princess Letizia, the Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative Partido Popular, making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as dynasts; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent. * In July 2006, the Nepalese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture, but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected. * In 2011, the governments of the 16 Commonwealth realms which have a common monarch announced the Perth Agreement, a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture. This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015. * In Japan, it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as Princess Aiko is the only child of Emperor Naruhito. However, the birth in 2006 of Prince Hisahito, a son of Prince Akishino (the younger brother of Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne) has suspended the debate. Agnatic primogeniture Agnatic primogeniture diagram Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors. Those who share agnatic kinship (through solely male ancestors) are termed \\"agnates\\"; those whose shared lineage includes a female ancestor are \\"cognates\\". There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to ultimogeniture) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or head of family, with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession. Male-preference primogeniture Male-preference primogeniture diagram Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a dynasty if and only if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A dynast's sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines. It was practised in the succession to the once-separate thrones of England and Scotland (until their union under James VI and I) and then the United Kingdom until 2015, when the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all Commonwealth realms that have the British monarch as their head of state. Male-preference primogeniture is currently practised in succession to the thrones of Monaco and Spain (before 1700 and since 1830). With respect to hereditary titles, it is usually the rule for Scotland and baronies by writ in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into abeyance when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder. Matrilineal primogeniture Matrilineal primogeniture, or female-preference uterine primogeniture, is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the Rain Queen is an example in an African culture of matrilineal primogeniture: not only is dynastic descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit. The Khasi Community of Meghalaya, India is an example of matrilineal, ultimogeniture inheritance where the youngest daughter inherits all or the largest chunk of the ancestral estate. Elder sisters may also inherit shares of the family estate, but their shares are much lesser when compared to the share of the youngest sister. The sons may inherit a relatively small portion, or in most cases, they do not inherit any immovable property at all. In South India, the throne of the erstwhile Kingdom of Travancore was inherited only by the sons of the Queen of Attingal. Preference for males The preference for males existing in most systems of primogeniture (and in other mechanisms of hereditary succession) comes mostly from the perceived nature of the tasks and role of the monarch: a monarch/prince (the latter means in latin chieftain) most usually was, first and foremost, a military leader, as in the millennia-old Book of Numbers.\\"you: Eleazor the Priest and Joshua son of Nun. And you shall also take a chieftain from each tribe through whom the land shall be apportioned. These are the names of the men... Social norms pointing to kings further flow from making clear, first-generation survivors, so to avoid civil war. Lacking advanced healthcare and resource-conscious family planning mothers faced high risk in enduring such regular childbirth. Also in pre-20th century medicine about 10% of women could not have children. Added to this, on any necessary remarriage from death in childbirth. The king would have socially entrenched powers over their new spouse: financial and any rivalry of a new queen consort by her personal and companions' physical strength was with in the chivalric norm far- fetched so far as it might present a challenge to her ruling husband, if proving relatively able. Times of turbulence were more likely when a queen regnant/female main heir allowed to inherit was married to or remarried to a similar-status foreign leader, as was conventional for high-status women for their family security and diplomacy. Such a situation was a major source of civil wars; one example is the Spanish Armada. Henry VIII of England did not wait until death and remarried twice on the basis of lack of producing a male heir, on the second occasion beheading his queen \\"for witchcraft\\". A small minority of monarchs in many countries have openly made their heir an illegitimate child; stories abound of others as newborns brought to the expectant queen consort such as to James II of England \\"in a bedpan\\". Under any of these considerations: sons, some of whose lives were in times of war likely to be lost in battle, could be expected to produce more heirs. Eldest daughters could find themselves under a situation of duress on remarriage, and the concept of the trophy bride if the husband were slain is one resonant in many cultures especially before the 20th century. Queen Elizabeth II is a descendant of Henry's illegitimate daughter Constance but so too her sister Empress Matilda (this main line being legitimate) and has two other known illegitimate ancestors. Arguments=Arguments in favour Primogeniture by definition prevents the subdivision of estates. This lessens family pressures to sell property, such as if two (or more) children inherit a house and cannot afford to buy out the other(s). In much of Europe younger sons of the nobility had no prospect of inheriting by death any property, and commonly sought careers in the Church, in military service (see purchase of commissions in the British Army), or in government. Some wills made bequests to a monastic order for an already suitably educated, disinherited son. Many of the Spanish Conquistadors were younger sons who had to make their fortune in war. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, many younger sons of English aristocrats specifically chose to leave England for Virginia in the Colonies. Many of the early Virginians who were plantation owners were younger sons of landed gentry who had left Britain and Ireland fortuneless due to primogeniture. These were key ancestors of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. In Japan, the Imperial chronologies include eight reigning empresses from ancient times up through the Edo period; however, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained.\\"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\\" Japan Times. 27 March 2007. Japanese empresses such as Empress Gensh≈ç (680‚Äì748), who succeeded her mother the Empress Gemmei (661‚Äì721) on the throne (but only because she was a Princess of the Imperial family, daughter of Prince Kusakabe), remain the sole exceptions to this conventional argument. Arguments against The fact that the eldest son \\"scooped the pool\\" often led to ill-feeling amongst younger sons (and of course daughters). Through marriage, estates inherited by primogeniture were combined and some nobles achieved wealth and power sufficient to pose a threat even to the crown itself. Finally, nobles tended to complain about and resist rules of primogeniture. In Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville observes that abolition of primogeniture and entail as to property results in faster division of land. However primogeniture's forcing landless people to seek wealth outside the family estate to maintain their standard of living accelerated the death of the landed aristocracy and, in his view, thus, quickened the shift to democracy. Other terms=Salic law An agnatic primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the \\"Salic law\\" (see Terra salica). This is something of a misnomer; although Salic law excludes female lines, it also mandates partible inheritance, rather than primogeniture. This rule developed among successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, Joan, the only surviving child of Louis X of France, was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, Philip, Count of Poitiers. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of Charles IV, Philip, Count of Valois (Charles IV's paternal cousin), became king, notwithstanding the claims of Edward III of England. By proximity of blood, Edward was closest related as eldest son of the sister of Charles, Isabella. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent Hundred Years War. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century Pactus Legis Salicae, which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the throne, as a governing rule for the French succession. In the lands of Napoleon Bonaparte's conquests, Salic law was adopted, including the French Empire, the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Kingdom of Holland and, under Napoleonic influence, the House of Bernadotte's Sweden. Other states adopted Salic primogeniture as well, including Belgium, Denmark (in 1853) and all of the eastern European monarchies except Greece, i.e. Albania, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia. During this era, Spain (in the Carlist conflicts) fought a civil war which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown. A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of female dynasts to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the Francoist succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947-1978\\\\. =British and French titles of nobility= Many descend by salic, male primogeniture so have a greater average rate of extinction. Many others if the title is otherwise to be extinct pass to the closest elder sister or a line of descendants to the last holder, as abeyant holders, such being parents or ancestors to whichever direct male descendant is first born to 'settle the abeyance'. Some senior agnatic cadets are granted from the outset courtesy or subsidiary titles. Notable English exceptions are the Duchy of Lancaster, which is merged with the British Crown which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century, and the Dukedom of Marlborough, which has done so since its establishment in 1702. Semi-Salic law Agnatic-cognatic primogeniture diagram Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or \\"agnatic-cognatic primogeniture\\", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.Nordisk familjebok, Tronf√∂ljd, 1920; SOU 1977:5 Kvinnlig tronf√∂ljd. Such were the cases of Bourbon Spain until 1833 and the dominions of Austria-Hungary, as well as most realms within the former Holy Roman Empire, i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of Russia under the Pauline Laws of 1797 and of Luxembourg until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011. There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning consanguinity or proximity of blood the dynasty's house law defines who among female relatives is \\"nearest\\" to the last male. Quasi-Salic law During High Medieval period there arose a trend where the extinction of agnatic lineage forced the consideration of women's claim, however the desire for a male heir saw the women themselves excluded from the succession in favor of their sons so that women could transmit claims but not inherit themselves, such system was called \\"Quasi-Salic\\". In 1316, to illegitimize Joan II of Navarre's claim on France, Philip V of France declared \\"women do not succeed to the throne of France\\". In 1328, Philip's successor, Charles IV of France too died sonless, Charles' sister, Isabella of France, claimed the throne not for herself, by through her to her son, Edward, however Philip VI of France took the throne and added another rule to illegitimate Edward, that being \\"one cannot transmit a right that she doesn't possess\\". History In Christian Europe, the Catholic Church originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. Its teachings forbid polygamy and state divorce is an impossibility per se. Consequently, in Europe, given morbidity and infertility succession could not be assured solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In Islamic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned polygyny, use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare. Biblical Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils, a 1728 engraving by Gerard Hoet The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of Isaac's sons Esau, who was born first, and Jacob, who was born second. Esau was entitled to the \\"birthright\\" (bekhorah ◊ë÷∞÷º◊õ◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊î), but he sold the right to Jacob for a mess of pottage, i. e. a small amount of food. Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its telling in this passage demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the Middle East for the passage to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the Roman Empire. In the Bible a woman's right and obligation to inherit property in the absence of a male heir in the family was established by the Daughters of Zelophehad in Numbers 27. Roman law During the Roman Empire, Roman law governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died intestate.HN.psu.edu Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312. Although admission to the two highest ordines (orders), i. e. the senators and equestrians, potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used. Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ordines merely by hereditary succession or title to land.Hopkins, Keith (2000). \\"The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,\\" in The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium (Oxford University Press), p. 188. Although the eldest son typically carried his father's name in some form, he was expected to construct his own career based on competence as an administrator or general and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.Hopkins, The Political Economy of the Roman Empire, p. 188. Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the dignitas (\\"esteem\\") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as vir illustris, that were not inherited.Millar. \\"Empire and City\\". p. 90, calls them \\"status-appellations\\". Most Roman emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the Praetorian Guard.Winterling, Aloys. Politics and Society in Imperial Rome. (John Wiley & Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16. Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent \\"right\\" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent. Reemergence in medieval and modern times The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in Medieval Europe; which due to the feudal system necessitated that the estates of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families. Adam Smith, in his book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way: Historical examples A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the French royal milieu, where the Salic Law (attributed to the Salian Franks) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the dispute over the legitimate successor of John I of France, the short-lived son of deceased Louis X of France in favour of Philip V of France (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over Joan II of Navarre (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the ruling that \\"Women do not succeed the kingdom of France\\". In 1328 it was further elaborated to solve the dispute over the legitimate successor of Philip V's brother, Charles IV of France, in favour of Philip VI of France (the son of Charles‚Äô uncle Charles of Valois) over Edward III of England (the son of Charles‚Äô sister Isabella). While Edward had a stronger claim by proximity of blood, the court ruled \\"Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess\\", reinforcing agnatic primogeniture. This dispute was among the factors behind the Hundred Years' War, which broke out in 1337. Conflict between the Salic law and the male- preferred system was also the genesis of Carlism in Spain and Miguelism in Portugal. The crowns of Hanover and Great Britain, which had been in personal union since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King William IV: his niece Victoria inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover. The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both subject to semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the Nassau House Treaty of 1783, which declared each prince of the House of Nassau to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)Nassau-Dietz, which was given in exchange to William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange, in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became King William I of the Netherlands. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant Queen Wilhelmina, whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-Duke Adolf of Nassau, who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the personal union of the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived. Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on male-preference primogeniture: A lord was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters. In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, ruling in right of his wife (jure uxoris), though on her death the title would not remain with him but pass to her heir. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of proximity of blood and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture. * The Burgundian succession in 1361 was resolved in favor of King John II, son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than Charles II of Navarre, grandson of the elder daughter and son of Jeanne. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles. * In dispute over the Scottish succession, 1290‚Äì92, the Bruce family pleaded tanistry and proximity of blood, whereas Balliol argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, Edward I of England, decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the Independence Wars reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency. * The Earldom of Gloucester (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half- siblings. However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries. Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, agnatic primogeniture (practically the same as Salic Law) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line. Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 Christina, Queen of Sweden, succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King Gustav II Adolf. In England all land passed (to any widow strictly for life) then by primogeniture. Until the Statute of Wills was passed in 1540, a will could control only personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant by operation of law. The statute gave power to landowners to \\"devise\\" land by the use of a new device, part of any will, including heading \\"testament\\". The default setting of such primogeniture applying absent express written words in England was not changed until the Administration of Estates Act in 1925. In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see knight). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England the 1540 Act permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, a fading custom of the gentry and farm owners in England and Wales. =United States and Canada= In British North America, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants. The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson took the lead in repealing the law in Virginia, where nearly three-fourths of Tidewater land and perhaps a majority of western lands were entailed. Canada had the same law but repealed it in 1851.Gerald Hallowell, ed., The Oxford Companion to Canadian History (2004), p 502. When Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, Roosevelt said he could not understand the British aristocracy's concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the ‚ÄúSpanish Curse‚Äù by the British upper classes: ‚ÄúWe give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks‚Äù. But as Churchill's father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than Roosevelt realised. Noble titles=Spain In 2006, King Juan Carlos I of Spain decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right. United Kingdom A bill to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law was tabled in 2013 for absolute primogeniture. The Equality (Titles) Bill was socially dubbed the \\"Downton law/bill\\" in reference to the British television drama Downton Abbey, in which the Earl's eldest daughter cannot inherit her Father's estate as entrusted, unless all of the adult beneficiaries amend the trust. A Lords' Committee was chosen for Committee Stage, which rejected it.

It is also informally known as the ICZN Code, for its publisher, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (which shares the acronym \\"ICZN\\"). The rules principally regulate: * How names are correctly established in the frame of binominal nomenclatureICZN Code Art. 5 * Which name must be used in case of name conflicts * How scientific literature must cite names Zoological nomenclature is independent of other systems of nomenclature, for example botanical nomenclature. This implies that animals can have the same generic names as plants. The rules and recommendations have one fundamental aim: to provide the maximum universality and continuity in the naming of all animals, except where taxonomic judgment dictates otherwise. The code is meant to guide only the nomenclature of animals, while leaving zoologists freedom in classifying new taxa. In other words, whether a species itself is or is not a recognized entity is a subjective decision, but what name should be applied to it is not. The code applies only to the latter. A new animal name published without adherence to the code may be deemed simply \\"unavailable\\" if it fails to meet certain criteria, or fall entirely out of the province of science (e.g., the \\"scientific name\\" for the Loch Ness Monster). The rules in the code determine what names are valid for any taxon in the family group, genus group, and species group. It has additional (but more limited) provisions on names in higher ranks. The code recognizes no case law. Any dispute is decided first by applying the code directly, and not by reference to precedent. The code is also retroactive or retrospective, which means that previous editions of the code, or previous other rules and conventions have no force any more today,ICZN Code Art. 86.3 and the nomenclatural acts published 'back in the old times' must be evaluated only under the present edition of the code. In cases of disputes concerning the interpretation, the usual procedure is to consult the French Code, lastly a case can be brought to the commission who has the right to publish a final decision.ICZN Code Art. 89  Principles  In regulating the names of animals it holds by six central principles, which were first set out (as principles) in the third edition of the code (1985): Principle of binominal nomenclature This is the principle that the scientific name of a species, and not of a taxon at any other rank, is a combination of two names; the use of a trinomen for the name of a subspecies and of uninominal names for taxa above the species group is in accord with this principle.ICZN Code Glossary This means that in the system of nomenclature for animals, the name of a species is composed of a combination of a generic name and a specific name; together they make a \\"binomen\\".ICZN Code Glossary, \\"binomen\\" No other rank can have a name composed of two names. Examples: :Species Giraffa camelopardalis * Subspecies have a name composed of three names, a \\"trinomen\\": generic name, specific name, subspecific name: :Subspecies Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi * Taxa at a rank above species have a name composed of one name, a \\"uninominal name\\". :Genus Giraffa, family Giraffidae In botanical nomenclature, the equivalent for \\"binominal nomenclature\\" is \\"binary nomenclature\\" (or sometimes \\"binomial nomenclature\\"). Principle of priority This is the principle that the correct formal scientific name for an animal taxon, the valid name, correct to use, is the oldest available name that applies to it. It is the most important principle‚Äîthe fundamental guiding precept that preserves zoological nomenclature stability. It was first formulated in 1842 by a committee appointed by the British Association to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature. Hugh Edwin Strickland wrote the committee's report. Example: :Nunneley 1837 established Limax maculatus (Gastropoda), Wiktor 2001 classified it as a junior synonym of Limax maximus Linn√¶us 1758 from S and W Europe. Limax maximus was established first, so if Wiktor's 2001 classification is accepted, Limax maximus takes precedence over Limax maculatus and must be used for the species. There are approximately 2-3 million cases of this kind for which this principle is applied in zoology. Principle of coordination The principle of coordination is that within the family group, genus group and species group, a name established for a taxon at any rank in the group is simultaneously established with the same author and date for taxa based on the same name-bearing type at other ranks in the corresponding group. In other words, publishing a new zoological name automatically and simultaneously establishes all corresponding names in the relevant other ranks with the same type. In the species-group, publishing a species name (the binomen) Giraffa camelopardalis Linnaeus, 1758 also establishes the subspecies name (the trinomen) Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis Linnaeus, 1758. The same applies to the name of a subspecies; this establishes the corresponding species name. In the genus-group, similarly, publishing the name of a genus also establishes the corresponding name of a subgenus (or vice versa): genus Giraffa Linnaeus, 1758 and subgenus Giraffa (Giraffa) Linnaeus, 1758. In the family-group, publication of the name of a family, subfamily, superfamily (or any other such rank) also establishes the names in all the other ranks in the family group (family Giraffidae, superfamily Giraffoidea, subfamily Giraffinae). Author citations for such names (for example a subgenus) are the same as for the name actually published (for example a genus). It is immaterial if there is an actual taxon to which the automatically established name applies; if ever such a taxon is recognised, there is a name available for it. Principle of the first reviser This is the principle that in cases of conflicts between simultaneously published divergent acts, the first subsequent author can decide which has precedence. It supplements the principle of priority, which states that the first published name takes precedence. The principle of the first reviser deals with situations that cannot be resolved by priority. These items may be two or more different names for the same taxon, two or more names with the same spelling used for different taxa, two or more different spellings of a particular name, etc. In such cases, the first subsequent author who deals with the matter and chooses and publishes the decision in the required manner is the first reviser, and is to be followed.ICZN Code Art. 24.2. Example: Linn√¶us 1758 established Strix scandiaca and Strix noctua (Aves), for which he gave different descriptions and referred to different types, but both taxa later turned out to refer to the same species, the snowy owl. The two names are subjective synonyms. L√∂nnberg 1931 acted as first reviser, cited both names and selected Strix scandiaca to have precedence. Principle of homonymy This is the principle that the name of each taxon must be unique. Consequently, a name that is a junior homonym of another name must not be used as a valid name. It means that any one animal name, in one particular spelling, may be used only once (within its group). This is usually the first-published name; any later name with the same spelling (a homonym) is barred from being used. The principles of priority and first reviser apply here. For family-group names the termination (which is rank-bound) is not taken into account. Genera are homonyms only if exactly the same ‚Äî a one- letter difference is enough to distinguish them. Examples: :Argus Bohadsch, 1761 (Gastropoda) (was made available for homonymy by ICZN in Opinion 429, Bohadsch 1761 was non-binominal - this had the effect that no other one of the various following names Argus can be used for a taxon) :Argus Scopoli, 1763 (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Polyommatinae) :Argus Scopoli, 1777 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) :Argus Poli, 1791 (Bivalvia) :Argus Temminck, 1807 (Aves) :Argus Lamarck, 1817 (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) :Argus Walckenaer, 1836 (Araneae) :Argus Gerhard, 1850 (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Theclinae) :Homonyms of Argus are not: :Argua Walker, 1863 (Lepidoptera), Argusa Kelham, 1888 (Aves), Argusina Hebard, 1927 (Dermaptera), Arcus Hong, 1983 (Diptera), Argas Latreille, 1795 (Araneae), Argulus M√ºller, 1785 (Crustacea). :Not homonyms of each others: Isomya Cutler & Cutler, 1985 (Sipunculida), Isomyia Walker, 1859 (Diptera). :Not homonyms of each others: Adelomya Mulsant & Verreaux, 1866 (Aves), Adelomyia Bonaparte, 1854 (Aves), Adelomys Gervais, 1853 (Mammalia), Adolomys Shevyreva, 1989 (Mammalia), Adulomya Kuroda, 1931 (Bivalvia). In species, there is a difference between primary and secondary homonyms. There can also be double homonyms (same genus and species). A slight difference in spelling is tolerated if Article 58 applies. Primary homonyms are those with the same genus and same species in their original combination. The difference between a primary junior homonym and a subsequent use of a name is undefined, but it is commonly accepted that if the name referred to another species or form, and if there is in addition no evidence the author knew that the name was previously used, it is considered as a junior homonym. Examples: :Drury (1773) established Cerambyx maculatus (Coleoptera) for a species from Jamaica. Fue√ülin (1775) established Cerambyx maculatus for a different species from Switzerland, and did not refer to Drury's name. Fue√ülin's name is a junior primary homonym. :Scopoli (1763) established Curculio fasciatus (Coleoptera) for a species from Slovenia. Str√∏m (1768) established Curculio fasciatus for another species from Norway. De Geer (1775) established Curculio fasciatus for a 3rd species from Sweden. M√ºller (1776) established Curculio fasciatus for a 4th species from Denmark. Fourcroy (1785) established Curculio fasciatus for a 5th species from France. Olivier (1790) established Curculio fasciatus for a 6th species from France. Marsham (1802) established Curculio fasciatus for a 7th species from Britain. All these names had descriptions that clarified that different species were meant, and that their authors did not know that the name had been established by a previous author. Secondary homonyms can be produced if taxa with the same specific name but different original genus are later classified in the same genus (Art. 57.3, 59). A secondary synonym is only a temporary state, it is only effective in this classification. If another classification is applied, the secondary homonymy may not be produced, and the involved name can be used again (Art. 59.1). A name does not become unavailable or unusable if it was once in the course of history placed in such a genus where it produced a secondary homonymy with another name. This is one of the rare cases where a zoological species does not have a stable specific name and a unique species-author-year combination, it can have two names at the same time. Example: :Nunneley (1837) established Limax maculatus (Gastropoda), Wiktor (2001) classified it as a junior synonym of Limax (Limax) maximus Linn√¶us, 1758 from S and W Europe. Kaleniczenko, 1851 established Krynickillus maculatus for a different species from Ukraine. Wiktor, 2001 classified both Limax maximus Linn√¶us, 1758 and Krynickillus maculatus Kaleniczenko, 1851 in the genus Limax. This meant that L. maculatus Nunneley, 1837 and K. maculatus Kaleniczenko, 1851 were classified in the same genus, so both names were secondary homonyms in the genus Limax, and the younger name (from 1851) could not be used for the Ukrainian species. This made it necessary to look for the next younger available name that could be used for the Ukrainian species. This was Limax ecarinatus Boettger, 1881, a junior synonym of K. maculatus Kaleniczenko, 1851. :For Wiktor (2001) and those authors who follow Wiktor's system the name of the Ukrainian species must be Limax ecarinatus Boettger, 1881. For the others who classify Limacus as a separate genus, the name of the Ukrainian species must be Limacus maculatus (Kaleniczenko, 1851). :So the Ukrainian species can have two names, depending from its generic classification. Limax ecarinatus, Limacus maculatus, the same species. Article 59.3 states that in exceptional cases, junior secondary homonyms replaced before 1961 by substitute names can become invalid, \\"...unless the substitute name is not in use,\\" an exception of the exception. However, the ICZN Code does not give an example for such a case. It seems that this passage in the ICZN Code is widely ignored. It also does not define what the expression \\"is not in use\\" should mean. Example: :Glischrus caelata Studer, 1820 (Gastropoda) was once classified in the genus Helix, and became a junior secondary homonym of Helix caelata [Vallot], 1801. Locard (1880) established a replacement name Helix glypta, which has very rarely been used. The species is now known as Trochulus caelatus (Studer, 1820), and Art. 59.3 is commonly ignored. Double homonymy (genus and species) is no homonymy: if the genera are homonyms and belong to different animal groups, the same specific names can be used in both groups. Examples: :The name Noctua Linn√¶us, 1758 was established for a lepidopteran subgenus. In 1764 he established a genus Noctua Linn√© ,1764 for birds, ignoring that he had already used this name a few years ago in Lepidoptera. Noctua Linn√©, 1764 (Aves) is a junior homonym of Noctua Linn√¶us, 1758 (Lepidoptera). :Garsault (1764) used Noctua for a bird and established a name Noctua caprimulgus Garsault, 1764 (Aves). Fabricius (1775) established a name Noctua caprimulgus Fabricius, 1775 (Lepidoptera), thus creating a double homonym. Double homonymy is no homonymy, both names are available. :The same happened with Noctua variegata Jung, 1792 (Lepidoptera) and Noctua variegata Quoy & Gaimard, 1830 (Aves). For disambiguating one genus-group name from its homonym, it is important to cite author and year. Citing the author alone is often not sufficient. Examples: : Echidna Forster, 1777 (Actinopterygii), not Echidna Cuvier, 1797 (Mammalia) : Ansa Walker, 1858 (Lepidoptera), not Ansa Walker, 1868 (Hemiptera) : Helix balcanica Kobelt, 1876, not Helix balcanica Kobelt, 1903 (both Gastropoda) : Conus catenatus Sowerby, 1850, not Conus catenatus Sowerby, 1875 (both Gastropoda) The name Ansa can only be used for a lepidopteran taxon. If that name cannot be used (for example because an older name established prior to 1858 takes precedence), this does not mean that the 1868 name can be used for a hemipteran genus. The only option to use the 1868 name for the hemipteran taxon is to get the 1858 name officially suppressed by the commission. In some cases, the same genus-group or species-group name was published in the same year by the same author. In these cases it is useful to cite the page where the name was established. :Amydona Walker, 1855 (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae) (p. 1110), not Amydona Walker, 1855 (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) (p. 1413) :Betousa Walker, 1865 (Lepidoptera: Thyridae) (p. 1111), not Betousa Walker, 1865 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (p. 1208). :Cicada variegata Fabricius, 1775 (p. 684), not Cicada variegata Fabricius, 1775 (p. 686) (both Auchenorrhyncha). :Noctua marginata Fabricius, 1775 (p. 597), not Noctua marginata Fabricius, 1775 (p. 610) (both Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). :Clausilia (Albinaria) oertzeni Boettger, 1889 (p. 42), not Clausilia (Albinaria) schuchi var. oertzeni Boettger, 1889 (p. 52) (both Gastropoda: Clausiliidae). There are cases where two homonyms were established by the same author in the same year on the same page: :Zonites verticillus var. graeca Kobelt, 1876 (Gastropoda) (p. 48), not Zonites albanicus var. graeca Kobelt, 1876 (p. 48). Animal, plant, and fungi nomenclature are entirely independent from each other. The most evident shortcoming of this situation (for their use in biodiversity informatics) is that the same generic name can be used simultaneously for animals and plants. For this kind of homonym the expression \\"hemihomonym\\" is sometimes used. Far more than 1000 such names are known. Examples: : The generic name Dryas L. (1753) represents a genus of magnoliophytan plants (family Rosaceae), and at the same time Dryas H√ºbner, 1807 is also a lepidopteran insect genus (family Nymphalidae). : The genus Tandonia was established in animals (Gastropoda: Tandonia), in plants (Euphorbiaceae) and in Fungi (Ascomycetes). : Other examples for sometimes well known plant names with zoological equivalents are Aotus (Fabaceae and Mammalia), Arenaria (Caryophyllaeceae and Aves), Betula(Betulaceae and Hymenoptera), Chloris (Cactaceae and Aves), Dugesia (Asteraceae and Plathelminthes), Erica (Ericaceae and Araneae), Hystrix (Poaceae and Mammalia), Iris (Asparagales and Orthoptera), Liparis (Orchidaceae and Actinopterygii), Phalaenopsis (Asparagales and Aves), Pinus (Pinaceae and Mollusca), Prunella (Lamiaceae and Aves), Ricinus (Fabaceae and Acari), Taxus (Taxaceae and Mammalia), Typha (Typhaceae and Porifera), Ulva (Ulvophyceae and Lepidoptera), Viola (Violaceae and Lepidoptera). For names above the family level, the principle of homonymy does not apply. Examples: : Pulmonata is usually used for a very prominent group in Gastropoda, but the name is also (rarely) used for a group in Arachnida. : Reticulata is used as an order in Foraminifera, and as an undefined higher group in Ephemeroptera. Homonyms occur relatively rarely in families (only if generic names are identical or very similar and adding an ending \\"-idae\\" produces identical results). Discovering such a homonymy usually produces the same problems as if there were no rules: conflicts between entirely independent and unconnected groups of taxonomists working in different animal groups. Very often the Commission must be asked to take a decision. Examples: : Bulimina (Foraminifera) and Buliminus (Gastropoda) give both Buliminidae, and both families were used since the 1880s. When the homonymy was discovered 110 years later in the 1990s, the younger (gastropod) taxon had to receive a new family name, and the commission needed was asked for a solution (Opinion 2018). : Claria (Rotifera) and Clarias (Actinopterygii) give both Clariidae, but only the actinopterygian fish name was used since 1845. Shortly after Clariidae had been proposed in Rotifera in 1990, the homonymy was discovered and the commission had to decide that the Rotiferan family had to be amended to Clariaidae (Opinion 2032). Principle of typification This is the principle that each nominal taxon in the family group, genus group, or species group has‚Äîactually or potentially‚Äîa name-bearing type fixed that provides the objective standard of reference that determines what the name applies to. This means that any named taxon has a name-bearing type, which allows the objective application of that name. Any family-group name must have a type genus, any genus-group name must have a type species, and any species-group name can (not must) have one or more type specimens (holotype, lectotype, neotype, syntypes, or others), usually deposited in a museum collection. The type genus for a family-group name is simply the genus that provided the stem to which was added the ending \\"-idae\\" (for families). Example: :The family name Spheniscidae has as its type genus the genus Spheniscus Brisson, 1760. The type species for a genus-group name is more complicated and follows exactly defined provisions in articles 67‚Äì69. Type species are very important, and no general zoological database has recorded the type species for all genera. Except in fishes and some minor groups, type species are rarely reliably recorded in online animal databases. In 60% of the cases the type species can be determined in the original publication. The type species is always the original name of the taxon (and not the currently used combination). Example: :The correctly cited type species of Locusta Linn√¶us, 1758 (Caelifera) is Gryllus migratorius Linn√¶us, 1758, not Locusta migratoria (Linn√¶us, 1758). Designation and fixation have different meanings. A designation is the proposal of the type species. It is not necessary to have spelled the name of the genus or species correctly with correct authors (articles 67.2.1, 67.6, 67.7), type species are always the correctly spelled name. If the designation is valid, the type species is fixed. A designation can also be invalid and ineffective‚Äîfor example‚Äîif the genus had already a previously fixed type species, or if a type species was proposed that was not originally included, or contradicted the description or figure for a genus for which no species had originally been included. There are various possible modes of type species designation. This is their order of legal importance, with approximate proportions of occurrence and examples: * Superior type fixation: ::Designation by ICZN under the plenary powers (3 %) :::Example: :::Galba Schrank, 1803 (Gastropoda) was established with one species included, Galba pusilla Schrank, 1803. This would be the type species by monotypy. In Opinion 1896 (published in 1998) this type fixation was set aside and Buccinum truncatulum M√ºller, 1774 was fixed as type species under the plenary power(s) (now Galba truncatula). ::Designation under Art. 70.3 (misidentified type species) (1 %) :::Examples: :::Bollingeria Forcart, 1940 (Gastropoda) was established with its type species Chondrus pupoides Krynicki, 1833 proposed by original designation. But Forcart 1940 misidentified the type species and meant Bulimus lamelliferus Rossm√§ssler, 1858. It would be convenient to designate Bulimus lamelliferus as type species under Art. 70.3. :::Helisoma Swainson, 1840 (Gastropoda) was established with one species included, cited by Swainson as \\"H. bicarinata Sow. Gen. f. 4\\". This suggested that the type species was misidentified, and that Planorbis campanulatus Say, 1821 and not Planorbis bicarinatus Say, 1819 was meant. But since the incorrect type species Planorbis bicarinatus has been regarded as type, it would be convenient to fix this as type under Art. 70.3. * Type fixation in the original work: ::Original designation (31 %) :::Examples: :::Montfort 1810 established the genus Theodoxus (Gastropoda) and designated Theodoxus lutetianus Montfort 1810 as type species (now Theodoxus fluviatilis). :::Vest 1867 established the subgenus Clausilia (Isabellaria) (Gastropoda) and designated Clausilia isabellina Pfeiffer, 1842 as type species (now Isabellaria isabellina). :::Riedel 1987 established the genus Turcozonites (Gastropoda) and designated Zonites wandae Riedel, 1982 as type species (now Turcozonites wandae). ::Monotypy (28 %) :::Examples: :::Anodonta Lamarck, 1799 (Bivalvia) was originally established with one included nominal species, Mytilus cygneus Linn√¶us, 1758. This is the type species fixed by monotypy (now Anodonta cygnea). :::Microcondylaea Vest 1866 (Bivalvia) was originally established with two included nominal species, Unio bonellii F√©russac, 1827 and with doubts Anodonta lata Rafinesque, 1820. Doubtfully included species do not count, type species is Unio bonellii fixed by monotypy (now Microcondylaea bonellii). ::Absolute tautonymy (2 %) :::Examples: :::Kobelt 1871 established the gastropod genus-group name Candidula and included 23 species. Among these was Glischrus candidula Studer 1820. Glischrus candidula is type species fixed by absolute tautonymy (now Candidula unifasciata). :::Draparnaud 1801 established the gastropod genus Succinea and included two species, Succinea amphibia Draparnaud 1801 and Succinea oblonga Draparnaud 1801. Among the synonyms of S. amphibia, Draparnaud listed a name Helix succinea M√ºller 1774. Synonyms do count here, so Helix succinea is type species by absolute tautonymy (now Succinea putris). :::Kobelt 1904 established the gastropod subgenus Iberus (Balearica) and included 10 species. Among these was Helix balearica Rossm√§ssler 1838, which Kobelt cited as Iberus (Balearica) balearicus. The ending -us is irrelevant here, Helix balearica is type species by absolute tautonymy (currently Iberellus balearicus or Iberellus hispanicus). :::Euxinolauria Lindholm, 1924 (Gastropoda: Lauriidae) was established as a new replacement name for Caucasica Caziot & Margier, 1909 (not Caucasica Boettger, 1877 (Gastropoda: Clausiliidae)). Caucasica Caziot & Margier, 1909 contained originally four species, among which was Pupa caucasica Pfeiffer, 1857. This is the type species for Caucasica Caziot & Margier, 1909 fixed by absolute tautonymy, and also for Euxinolauria (now Euxinolauria caucasica). :::The following examples do not represent absolute tautonymy: Scomber scombrus Linn√¶us, 1758 (Actinopterygii), Babyrousa babyrussa (Linn√¶us, 1758) (Mammalia), Suricata suricatta (Schreber, 1776) (Mammalia), Merlangius merlangus (Linn√¶us, 1758) (Actinopterygii), Isabellaria isabellina (Pfeiffer, 1842) (Gastropoda), Rupestrella rupestris (Philippi, 1836) (Gastropoda). ::Linnean tautonymy (0.3 %) :::Example: :::Linn√¶us 1758 established Castor (Mammalia) and included two species, Castor fiber and Castor moschatus. Among the synonyms of Castor fiber was cited the one-word name Castor with references to six pre-Linnean works (Gesner 1598, Rondelet 1554, Jonston 1650, Dodart 1676, Ray 1693 and Aldrovandi 1649). Castor fiber Linn√¶us 1758 is type species fixed by Linnean tautonymy (now Castor fiber). * Subsequent methods of type fixation: ::Subsequent monotypy (2 %) :::Examples: :::Valvata M√ºller, 1773 (Gastropoda) was established with a short description and without species. M√ºller 1774 included one species Valvata cristata M√ºller 1774. Valvata cristata is type species by subsequent monotypy (now Valvata cristata). :::Omphiscola Rafinesque, 1819 (Gastropoda) was established without species included. Beck 1837 [1838] included one species Buccinum glabrum M√ºller, 1774. Buccinum glabrum is type species by subsequent monotypy (now Omphiscola glabra). ::Subsequent absolute tautonymy (only very few cases) :::Examples: :::Alosa Garsault, 1764 (Actinopterygii) was established without included species. As first author, Cuvier, 1829 included two species Clupea alosa and Clupea fincta. Type species is Clupea alosa Linn√¶us 1758 by subsequent absolute tautonymy (now Alosa alosa). :::Rupicapra Garsault, 1764 (Mammalia) was established without included species. As first author, Blainville, 1816 included three species Capra rupicapra Linn√¶us, 1758, Capra pudu, and Capra americana. Type species is Capra rupicapra by subsequent absolute tautonymy (now Rupicapra rupicapra). ::Subsequent Linnean tautonymy (only theoretical, there might be no case) ::Subsequent designation (32 %) :::Examples: :::Aplexa Fleming, 1820 (Gastropoda) was established with two species, Bulla hypnorum Linn√¶us, 1758 and Bulla rivalis Turton, 1807. Herrmannsen 1846 fixed Bulla hypnorum as type by subsequent designation (now Aplexa hypnorum). :::Pseudanodonta Bourguignat 1877 (Bivalvia) was established with seven species, Anodonta complanata Rossm√§ssler 1835, and six others. Westerlund 1902 validly designated Anodonta complanata as type species (nowPseudanodonta complanata). A species-group name can have a name-bearing type specimen, but this is not a requirement. In many cases species-group names have no type specimens, or they are lost. In those cases the application of the species-group name is usually based on common acceptance. If there is no common acceptance, there are provisions in the Code to fix a name-bearing type specimen that is binding for users of that name. Fixing such a name- bearing type should only be done if this is taxonomically necessary (articles 74.7.3, 75.2, 75.3). Examples: : Aptenodytes patagonica Miller, 1778 is either based on a type specimen, perhaps deposited in the Natural History Museum London or somewhere else, or its type is lost. This is now irrelevant because the usage of the name (as Aptenodytes patagonicus) for the king penguin is unambiguously accepted. : The name-bearing type for Homo sapiens Linn√¶us, 1758 is deposited in Uppsala (the bones of Carl von Linn√©). This is a lectotype designated by Stearn 1959, correctly but unnecessarily because the usage of the name was unambiguous at that time, and still is.  Structure  The code divides names in the following manner: * Names above the family group * Family-group names * Genus-group names * Species-group names The names above the family group are regulated only as to the requirements for publication; there is no restriction to the number of ranks and the use of names is not restricted by priority. The names in the family, genus, and species groups are fully regulated by the provisions in the code. There is no limitation to the number of ranks allowed in the family group. The genus group has only two ranks: genus and subgenus. The species group has only two ranks: species and subspecies.  Gender agreement  In the species group gender agreement applies. The name of a species, in two parts, a binomen, say, Loxodonta africana, and of a subspecies, in three parts, a trinomen, say Canis lupus albus, is in the form of a Latin phrase, and must be grammatically correct Latin. If the second part, the specific name (or the third part, the subspecific name) is adjectival in nature, its ending must agree in gender with the name of the genus. If it is a noun, or an arbitrary combination of letters, this does not apply. * For instance, the generic name Equus is masculine; in the name Equus africanus the specific name africanus is an adjective, and its ending follows the gender of the generic name. * In Equus zebra the specific name zebra is a noun, it may not be \\"corrected\\" to \\"Equus zebrus\\". * In Equus quagga burchellii the subspecific name burchellii is a noun in the genitive case (\\"of Burchell\\"). If a species is moved, therefore, the spelling of an ending may need to change. If Gryllus migratorius is moved to the genus Locusta, it becomes Locusta migratoria. Confusion over Latin grammar has led to many incorrectly formed names appearing in print. An automated search may fail to find all the variant spellings of a given name (e.g., the spellings atra and ater may refer to the same species).  History  Written nomenclatural rules in zoology were compiled in various countries since the late 1830s, such as Merton's Rules and Strickland's codes going back to 1843. At the first and second International Zoological Congresses (Paris 1889, Moscow 1892) zoologists saw the need to establish commonly accepted international rules for all disciplines and countries to replace conventions and unwritten rules that varied across disciplines, countries, and languages. Compiling \\"International Rules on Zoological Nomenclature\\" was first proposed in 1895 in Leiden (3rd International Congress for Zoology) and officially published in three languages in 1905 (French, English, German; only French was official).Blanchard, R., Maehrenthal, F. von & Stiles, C. W. 1905. R√®gles internationales de la nomenclature zoologique adopt√©es par les Congr√®s Internationaux de Zoologie. International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature. Internationale Regeln der Zoologischen Nomenklatur. - Paris (Rudeval) From then on, amendments and modifications were subsequently passed by various zoological congresses (Boston 1907, Graz 1910, Monaco 1913, Budapest 1927, Padua 1930, Paris 1948, Copenhagen 1953, and London 1958). These were only published in English, and can only be found in the reports of these congresses or other official publications. The 1905 rules became increasingly outdated. They soon sold out, and it became increasingly difficult to obtain to a complete set of the Rules with all amendments.pp. V-VI in Kraus, O. 1962. Internationale Regeln f√ºr die Zoologische Nomenklatur. Beschlossen vom XV. Internationalen Kongress f√ºr Zoologie. - pp. I-VIII [= 1-8], 1-90. Frankfurt am Main. (Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft). In Copenhagen 1953 the French and English texts of the rules were declared of equivalent official force, and a declaration was approved to prepare a new compilation of the rules. In 1958, an Editorial Committee in London elaborated a completely new version of the nomenclatural rules, which were finally published as the first edition of the ICZN Code on 9 November 1961. The second edition of the code (only weakly modified) came in 1963. The last zoological congress to deal with nomenclatural problems took place in Monte Carlo 1972, since by then the official zoological organs no longer derived power from zoological congresses.ICZN Code Art. 77.2 The third edition of the code came out in 1985. The present edition is the 4th edition, effective since 2000. These code editions were elaborated on by editorial committeesICZN Constitution Art. 16.2 appointed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The ICZN Commission takes its power from a general biological congress (IUBS, International Union of Biological Sciences). The editorial committee for the fourth edition was composed of seven persons. Such new editions of the ICZN Code are not democratically approved by those taxonomists who are forced to follow the code's provisions, neither do taxonomists have the right to vote for the members of the commission or the editorial committee. As the commission may alter the code (by declarations and amendments) without issuing a new edition of the book, the current edition does not necessarily contain the actual provision that applies in a particular case. The Code consists of the original text of the fourth edition and Declaration 44. The code is published in an English and a FrenchFrench Code online version; both versions are official and equivalent in force, meaning, and authority.ICZN Code Art. 86.2 This means that if something in the English code is unclear or its interpretation ambiguous, the French version is decisive, and if there is something unclear in the French code, the English version is decisive.  Commission  The rules in the code apply to all users of zoological names. However, its provisions can be interpreted, waived, or modified in their application to a particular case when strict adherence would cause confusion. Such exceptions are not made by an individual scientist, no matter how well- respected within the field, but only by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, acting on behalf of all zoologists. The commission takes such action in response to proposals submitted to it. * Carl Linnaeus named the domestic cat Felis catus in 1758; Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber named the wildcat Felis silvestris in 1775. For taxonomists who consider these two kinds of cat a single species the principle of priority means that the species ought to be named F. catus, but in practice almost all biologists have used F. silvestris. In 2003, the commission issued a ruling (Opinion 2027) that \\"conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated, by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms\\", confirming F. silvestris for the wild cat. Taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat the same species as the wild cat should use F. silvestris; taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat a subspecies of the wild cat should use F. silvestris catus; taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat a separate species should use F. catus. The latest amendments enacted by the commission concern electronic publishing, which is now permitted for works published under an ISBN or ISSN after 2011 in a way that ensures registration with ZooBank as well as archival of multiple copies. Local usage and name changes The ICZN is used by the scientific community worldwide. Changes are governed by guidelines in the code.Scott L. Wing Causes and Consequences of Globally Warm Climates in the Early ... - 2003 No 369 - Page 288 \\"Following the general practice of naming species after localities by ending with \\"-ensis,\\" Schnack (2000) proposed to change the name Discorbis duwi to Discorbis duwiensis. However, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Chapter 7 Article 32) does not allow such a change\\" Local changes, such as the changes proposed by the Turkish government, are not recognised by ICZN.

The population was 447 at the 2010 census. History The city of Mount Enterprise, located south of Henderson in rural Rusk County, was named for a small elevation near the town and for the business enterprise of the Vinson brothers, who settled it in 1832. The town owes its existence to the presence of promising iron ore in the area. Charles Vinson considered the \\"old mountain\\" nearby to be an \\"iron mountain,\\" and he was not far off the mark; the brown, crumbly ore of the Weches formation that outcrops in the area has a better than 50 percent iron content. However, Vinson's real enterprise came in the form of manufacturing and retailing. His factory made wagons, buggies, furniture, plows, caskets, and a patented churn. He launched a chain of stores to sell these things operating out of Mount Enterprise and at one time had four stores. Lumbering was also an early industry of Mount Enterprise; the furniture factory it supported is dated as early as 1850. There were also numerous plantations in the area before the Civil War. In 1846 the Mulberry Grove post office was established with Henry Henson as postmaster. Three years later the name was changed to Mount Enterprise. Mount Enterprise Male and Female College was begun in 1851, and it lasted until 1855. In 1853 Mount Enterprise Male and Female Academy was established. In 1880 the town had three sawmills, a hotel, two cotton gins, a school, three churches, and a population of 150. In 1894 the Caro Northern Railway was chartered to operate as a logging road between Mount Enterprise and Caro, in Nacogdoches County, a distance of little over 16 miles. The railroad, which connected Mount Enterprise with the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, came to within a mile of Mount Enterprise, and the town then moved to the railroad. It became the new Mount Enterprise, and the old location was called the old Mount Enterprise. The railroad was abandoned in 1934, but by 1939 the town had incorporated and still had a number of businesses, a bank, a post office, a newspaper, and a population of 920. After 1940 the population gradually declined to 485 in 1982, when the town had a bank, a post office, and fifteen businesses. In 1990 the population was 501.

The population was 1,198 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Sabine County. It is located on State Highway 87 at the junction of State Highway 184, and is surrounded by the Sabine National Forest and the Toledo Bend Reservoir.

Hemphill is 484 miles (as the crow flies) from Hemphill County, Texas (which is in the northern Panhandle). This is the largest separation of a Texas city from a Texas county of the same name. Historical development In 1858 the Sabine county voters elected to move the county seat from Milam, in the east along the Sabine River, to a more central part of the county. The following year, the plans for the town were laid down, with the post office opening as well. The Town was named after John Hemphill, an early Texas judge and legal scholar, and later a United States Senator. The location was ideal in terms of being centrally located in relation to other settlements, but it initially had poor transportation access, as it was neither located on the Sabine River or existing rail lines. In 1912, the Lufkin, Hemphill and Gulf Railway provided Hemphill with rail connections. This construction also supported nearby lumber operations. After the timber was depleted and sawmills closed in these communities, by 1938 the line would be abandoned.  Recreation  The nearby Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn lakes attract many tourists during the summer months.

Education The City of Hemphill is served by the Hemphill Independent School District Killing of Loyal Garner Jr. On Christmas night 1987, Loyal Garner Jr. of Florien, Louisiana, a married father of six children and respected 34-year-old African-American truck driver, was arrested with two companions for alleged drunk driving in Sabine County. After being beaten on a bridge near the Toledo Bend area by the Hemphill Police Department's Chief of Police, Thomas Ladner, and two deputies which were called for by Ladner, Loyal Garner Jr. was taken to the Sabine County Jail. The following morning, he was found comatose in his cell. Garner was taken for treatment to a local hospital and then to one in the city of Tyler, Texas, seat of Smith County, where he died after neurosurgery. Officials in Tyler thought the death suspicious, as an autopsy showed evidence of beating, and they refused to return the body to Hemphill until completing their own investigation. Chief of Police Thomas Ladner and two sheriff deputies were tried in Hemphill of violating Garner's civil rights and acquitted, to cheers by whites in the courtroom. Garner's family sued city officials for his death, and the city settled with the family for an undisclosed amount. In 1990, Ladner and the two Sabine County Sheriff's Office deputies were convicted of murder of Garner by a jury in Tyler, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, especially for Ladner. The difference in the two trial verdicts has been attributed in part to the composition and attitudes of the juries. In Hemphill, the jury was mostly white and made up of local people had more loyalty to their own officials, against an outsider. The cases were covered nationally. African-Americans in Hemphill comprised about 20 percent of the small town's population. They conducted their first civil rights protest after Ladner's acquittal, and founded the first chapter here of the NAACP. The circumstances of Garner's death and the two trials of Hemphill law enforcement officers had attracted national media attention. The protest and associated events were also covered by CBS 60 Minutes. Space Shuttle Columbia disaster In February 2003, the town and its vicinity were one of the key search areas for wreckage from the Space Shuttle Columbia after it broke up over Texas. Search teams recovered some of the remains of the shuttle and crew members, and the Orbiter Experiment Support System recorder (OEX) was found near Hemphill. A memorial has been erected in Hemphill commemorating the deceased Columbia astronauts. The memorial is located at the intersection of Hwy 87 North and Hwy 83 East. On the eighth anniversary of the disaster, the Patricia Huffman Smith NASA \\"Remembering Columbia\\" Museum was opened in Hemphill on February 1, 2011 in a new building constructed next to the J.R. Huffman Public Library. The museum is named for the late wife of philanthropist Al Smith, who donated most of the money to build the museum.

It is the county seat of San Jacinto County which is named after the river that traverses it and shares its name with the battle which gave Texas its independence. The population was 853 at the 2010 census. History The history of Coldspring is linked to Stephen F. Austin's first colony in Texas, which established, among other locales, San Jacinto County. Austin's original colony extended to the Trinity River watershed, roughly along Texas 156, toward Point Blank. After receiving a commission from the Mexican government to settle the town, Joseph Vehlein, a German immigrant to Mexico, deeded to Robert Rankin, an American Revolutionary officer. This acreage included the site of Coldspring. The settlement of Cold Springs (old spelling) began around 1850. In 1848, there existed only a trading post called \\"Coonskin\\", later \\"Fireman's Hill\\" nearby. Coldspring had developed into a bustling county seat town by 1915, but disaster struck March 30, 1915, when the wooden courthouse burned, thus removing the economic foundation of the town. Plans for the present courthouse were made, and the building was completed in 1918. Thereafter, the townspeople moved their buildings near the new courthouse at its present location.Billie Trapp and Hilde Faulkner, \\"The History of Our Church,\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20120306225218/http://www.coldspringmethodist.org/History_of_Our_Church.html. Retrieved 2010-05-25 In 1983, San Jacinto County sheriff, James Cecil \\"Humpy\\" Parker, was arrested for, charged with, and convicted of six civil rights abuses of suspects using the form of torture called waterboarding and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison but served less than five before his medical release due to brain cancer; he died in 1994. Parker's son and deputy, Gary, was convicted in 1984 of conspiracy to violate suspects' rights.

Collateral damage is any death, injury, or other damage inflicted that is an incidental result of military operations. Since the development of precision guided munitions, military forces often claim to have gone to great lengths to minimize collateral damage. Critics of use of the term \\"collateral damage\\" see it as a euphemism that dehumanizes non-combatants killed or injured during combat, used to reduce the perceived culpability of military leadership in failing to prevent non-combatant casualties. Collateral damage does not include civilian casualties caused by military operations that are intended to terrorize or kill enemy civilians (e.g. some of the strategic bombing during World War II). Etymology The word \\"collateral\\" comes from medieval Latin word collateralis, from col-, \\"together with\\" + lateralis (from latus, later-, \\"side\\" ) and is otherwise mainly used as a synonym for \\"parallel\\" or \\"additional\\" in certain expressions (e.g. \\"collateral veins\\" meaning veins running parallel to each other, or \\"collateral security\\" meaning security additional to the main obligation in a contract). The oldest known usage of the term \\"collateral damage\\" in this context occurred in an article written in May 1961 by T. C. Schelling entitled \\"DISPERSAL, DETERRENCE, AND DAMAGE\\". The term \\"collateral damage\\" likely originated as a euphemism during the Vietnam War referring to friendly fire, or the intentional killing of non-combatants and destruction of their property. Non-military uses of the phrase The term has also been borrowed by the computing community to refer to the refusal of service to legitimate users when administrators take blanket preventative measures against some individuals who are abusing systems. For example, Realtime Blackhole Lists used to combat email spam generally block ranges of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses rather than individual IPs associated with spam, which can deny legitimate users within those ranges the ability to send email to some domains. The related term collateral mortality is also becoming prevalent, and probably derives from the term collateral damage. It has been applied to other spheres in addition to the original military context. Fisheries are an example of this, where bycatch of species such as dolphins are called collateral mortality; they are species that die in the pursuit of the legal death of fishing targets, such as tuna.Chuenpagdee, R., Morgan, L.E., Maxwell, S.M., Norse, E.A. & Pauly, D. (2003) Shifting gears: assessing collateral impacts of fishing methods in US waters. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 1, 517-524. Controversy During the 1991 Gulf War, Coalition forces used the phrase to describe the killing of civilians in attacks on legitimate targets. According to Scottish linguist Deborah Cameron,Deborah Cameron (1995). Verbal Hygiene. 2 ‚Äì Restrictive practices. The politics of style. \\"Collateral damage\\" and the politics of discourse. Routledge, p.72. . \\"the classic Orwellian arguments for finding this usage objectionable would be that * it is jargon, and to the extent that people cannot decode it, it conceals what is actually going on; * it is a euphemism; abstract, agentless, and affectless, so that even if people succeeded in associating it with a real act or event, they would be insulated from any feelings of repulsion or moral outrage\\". In 1999, \\"collateral damage\\" () was named the German Un-Word of the Year by a jury of linguistic scholars. With this choice, it was criticized that the term had been used by NATO forces to describe civilian casualties during the Kosovo War, which the jury considered to be an inhuman euphemism. International humanitarian law Military necessity, along with distinction and proportionality, are three important principles of international humanitarian law, governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict and how that relates to collateral damage. Luis Moreno- Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, investigated allegations of war crimes during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and published an open letter containing his findings. A section titled \\"Allegations concerning War Crimes\\" elucidates this usage of military necessity, distinction and proportionality: U.S. military approach The USAF Intelligence Targeting Guide defines the term as the \\"unintentional damage or incidental damage affecting facilities, equipment, or personnel, occurring as a result of military actions directed against targeted enemy forces or facilities\\", stating that \\"[s]uch damage can occur to friendly, neutral, and even enemy forces\\". Another United States Department of Defense document uses \\"[u]nintentional or incidental injury or damage to persons or objects that would not be lawful military targets in the circumstances ruling at the time\\", which also states that \\"[s]uch damage is not unlawful so long as it is not excessive in light of the overall military advantage anticipated from the attack.\\" In U.S. military terminology, the unintentional destruction of allied or neutral targets is called \\"friendly fire\\". The U.S. military follows a technology-based process for estimating and mitigating collateral damage. The software used is known as \\"FAST-CD\\" or \\"Fast Assessment Strike Tool‚ÄîCollateral Damage.\\" See also *Casualty recording *War *Principles of war *Legitimate military target ReferencesExternal links * Beyond Precision: Issues of Morality and Decision Making in Minimizing Collateral Casualties, ACDIS Occasional Paper by Lt.

Based in London, England, the paper is owned by the Japanese holding company, Nikkei, with core editorial offices across Britain, the United States, and continental Europe. In July 2015, Pearson sold the publication to Nikkei for ¬£844 million (US$1.32 billion) after owning it since 1957. In Spring 2019, it reported one million paying subscriptions, three- quarters of which are digital subscriptions. The newspaper has a prominent focus on financial journalism and economic analysis over generalist reporting, drawing both criticism and acclaim. The daily sponsors an annual book award and publishes a \\"Person of the Year\\" feature. The paper was founded in 1888 as the London Financial Guide before rebranding a year later as the Financial Times. It was first circulated around metropolitan London by James Sheridan, who, along with his brother and Horatio Bottomley, sought to report on city business opposite the Financial News. The succeeding half-century competition between the two papers would eventually culminate in a 1945 merger, led by Brendan Bracken, which established it as one of the largest business newspapers in the world. Globalisation from the late-19th to mid-20th century facilitated editorial expansion for the FT, with the paper adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, book reviews, technology articles, and global politics features. The paper is often recognisable by its light-pink (salmon) broadsheet and digital display. It is supplemented by its lifestyle magazine (FT Magazine), weekend edition (FT Weekend), and a small portfolio of industry publications. The editorial stance of the Financial Times centres on economic liberalism, particularly free trade and free markets. Since its founding it has supported liberal democracy, favouring classically liberal politics and policies from international governments. Its newsroom is independent from its editorial board. Due to its history of economic commentary, the FT publishes a variety of financial indices, primarily the FTSE All-Share Index. Its typical depth of coverage has, since the late-20th century, linked the paper with a white-collar and educated readership. The Financial Times is headquartered in Bracken House at 10 Cannon Street, near the city's financial centre, where it maintains its publishing house, corporate centre, and main editorial office. History 247x247px The FT was launched as the London Financial Guide on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the Financial Times on 13 February the same year. Describing itself as the friend of \\"The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator\\", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the City of London, its only rival being the more daring and slightly older (founded in 1884) Financial News. On 2 January 1893 the FT began printing on light pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named Financial News: at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as The Sporting Times, had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially. After 57 years of rivalry the Financial Times and the Financial News were merged in 1945 by Brendan Bracken to form a single six-page newspaper. The Financial Times brought a higher circulation while the Financial News provided much of the editorial talent. The Lex column was also introduced from Financial News. Pearson bought the paper in 1957. Over the years the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the world economy towards globalisation. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the FT began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first FT (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the FT has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. The European edition is distributed in continental Europe and Africa. It is printed Monday to Saturday at five centres across Europe, reporting on matters concerning the European Union, the euro and European corporate affairs. In 1994 FT launched a luxury lifestyle magazine, How To Spend It. In 2009 it launched a standalone website for the magazine. On 13 May 1995 the Financial Times group made its first foray into the online world with the launch of FT.com. This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage. The second- generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000 the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to changes online. FT introduced subscription services in 2002. FT.com is one of the few UK news sites successfully funded by individual subscription. In 1997 the FT launched a U.S. edition, printed in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C., although the newspaper was first printed outside New York City in 1985. In September 1998 the FT became the first UK-based newspaper to sell more copies internationally than within the UK. In 2000 the Financial Times started publishing a German-language edition, Financial Times Deutschland, with a news and editorial team based in Hamburg. Its initial circulation in 2003 was 90,000. It was originally a joint venture with a German publishing firm, Gruner + Jahr. In January 2008 the FT sold its 50% stake to its German partner. FT Deutschland never made a profit and is said to have accumulated losses of ‚Ç¨250 million over 12 years. It closed on 7 December 2012. The Financial Times launched a new weekly supplement for the fund management industry on 4 February 2002. FT fund management (FTfm) was and still is distributed with the paper every Monday. FTfm is the world's largest-circulation fund management title. Since 2005 the FT has sponsored the annual Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award. One Southwark Bridge, 2013.alt=225x225pxleft On 23 April 2007 the FT unveiled a \\"refreshed\\" version of the newspaper and introduced a new slogan, \\"We Live in Financial Times.\\" In 2007 the FT pioneered a metered paywall, which let visitors to its website read a limited number of free articles during any one month before asking them to pay. Four years later the FT launched its HTML5 mobile internet app. Smartphones and tablets now drive 12% of subscriptions and 19% of traffic to FT.com. In 2012 the number of digital subscribers surpassed the circulation of the newspaper for the first time and the FT drew almost half of its revenue from subscriptions rather than advertising. The FT has been available on Bloomberg Terminal since 2010 and on the Wisers platform since 2013. From 2015, instead of the metered paywall on the website, visitors were given unlimited free access for one month, after which they needed to subscribe. Pearson sold the Financial Times Group to Nikkei, Inc. for ¬£844 million (US$1.32 billion) in July 2015. In 2016, the Financial Times acquired a controlling stake in Alpha Grid, a London-based media company specialising in the development and production of quality branded content across a range of channels, including broadcast, video, digital, social and events. In 2018, the Financial Times acquired a controlling stake in Longitude, a specialist provider of thought leadership and research services to a multinational corporate and institutional client base. This investment built on the Financial Times‚Äôs recent growth in several business areas, including branded content via the acquisition of Alpha Grid, and conferences and events through Financial Times Live and extends the FT's traditional commercial offering into a wider set of integrated services. In 2020, reporter Mark Di Stefano resigned from the Financial Times after hacking into Zoom calls at other media organisations including The Independent and the Evening Standard.  Wirecard expos√©  In January 2019, the FT began a series of investigative articles detailing fraud suspicions at German payments group Wirecard. When the Wirecard share price plunged, German news media speculated that market manipulation was behind this attack on a German corporate, focusing on the lead author of the FT series, Dan McCrum. The Public prosecutor's office in Munich subsequently launched an investigation. After the formal complaint of an investor, Wirecard and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) the responsible state's attorney announced investigations into several FT journalists. On June 22, 2020 and after 18 months of investigations and an external audit, Wirecard announced that ‚Ç¨1.9 billion worth of cash reported in its accounts \\"may not exist\\". The company subsequently filed for insolvency. BaFin itself became subject of a European Securities and Markets Authority investigation for its response to the scandal. Audience According to the Global Capital Markets Survey, which measures readership habits amongst most senior financial decision makers in the world's largest financial institutions, the Financial Times is considered the most important business read, reaching 36% of the sample population, 11% more than The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), its main rival. The Economist, which was once 50% owned by FT, reaches 32%. FT's The Banker also proved vital reading, reaching 24%. In addition FT was regarded as the most credible publication in reporting financial and economic issues among the Worldwide Professional Investment Community audience. The Economist was also rated the third most credible title by most influential professional investors (those who personally managed asset funds worth $5 billion or more), while the WSJ was second. Content The FT is split into two sections. The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from FT journalists such as Martin Wolf, Gillian Tett and Edward Luce, and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators. The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets. Despite being generally regarded as primarily a financial newspaper, it does also contain TV listings, weather and other more informal articles. About 110 of its 475 journalists are outside the United Kingdom. The Lex column The Lex column is a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It features analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The FT calls Lex its agenda- setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for Lex Mercatoria, a Latin expression meaning literally \\"merchant law\\". It was conceived by Hargreaves Parkinson for the Financial News in the 1930s and moved to the Financial Times when the two merged. Lex boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government ‚Äì including Nigel Lawson (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Lambert (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), David Freud (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild's), George Graham (RBS banker), Andrew Balls (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and Jo Johnson (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington). FT Weekend The FT publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper called the Financial Times Weekend. It consists of international economic and political news, Companies & Markets, Life & Arts, House & Home and FT Magazine. How to Spend It How to Spend It is a monthly magazine published with FT Weekend. Founded and launched by Julia Carrick with Lucia van der Post as founding editor, its articles concern luxury goods such as yachts, mansions, apartments, horlogerie, haute couture and automobiles, as well as fashion and columns by individuals in the arts, gardening, food, and hotel and travel industries. How to Spend It started in 1967 as a one-page consumer goods feature in the newspaper, which was edited by Sheila Black, a former actor and FT‚Äôs first female journalist. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, FT launched the online version of this publication on 3 October 2009. Some media commentators were taken aback by the online launch of a website supporting conspicuous consumption during the financial austerity of the late-2000s recession. The magazine has been derided in rival publishers' blogs, as \\"repellent\\" in the Telegraph and \\"a latter-day Ab Fab manual\\" in the Guardian. A 'well-thumbed' copy of the supplement was found when rebel forces broke into Colonel Gaddafi's Tripoli compound during the 2011 Libyan Civil War. Editorial stance Russian president Vladimir Putin being interviewed by the Financial Times in 2019 The FT advocates free markets and is in favour of globalisation, as well as globalist policies. During the 1980s it supported Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan's monetarist policies. It has supported the UK Labour Party in the past, including at the general election in 1992 when Neil Kinnock was Labour leader. The FT's editorials tend to be pro-European, supporting the European Union (including Britain's membership thereof) in the context of a common economic market and opposing political integration. The FT was firmly opposed to the Iraq War. In the general election in the UK in 2010 the FT was receptive to the Liberal Democrats' positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, but on balance it backed the Conservatives while questioning their tendency to Euroscepticism. At the subsequent general election in 2015, the FT called for the continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years. In the 2017 UK general election a Financial Times editorial reluctantly backed Theresa May (Conservative Party) over Jeremy Corbyn (Labour Party) while warning about her stance on immigration and the eurosceptic elements in her party.  U.S. politics  In the U.S. presidential election in 2008 the Financial Times endorsed Barack Obama. While it raised concerns over hints of protectionism, it praised his ability to \\"engage the country's attention,\\" his calls for a bipartisan politics, and his plans for \\"comprehensive health-care reform\\". The FT favoured Obama again in 2012. The FT endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds, this contest allows people to use prediction markets to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes. The Financial Times also ran a business-related game called \\"In the Pink\\" (a phrase meaning \\"in good health\\", also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase \\"in the red\\" meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest profit when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of ¬£10,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006. Indices market indices, 2019 The Financial Times collates and publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former Financial News Index, started on 1 July 1935 by the Financial News. The FT published a similar index; this was replaced by the Financial News Index‚Äîwhich was then renamed the Financial Times (FT) Index‚Äîon 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP), British-American Tobacco, Lever Brothers (later Unilever) and Shell. The oil and financial sectors were included decades later.The Stock Market, John Littlewood. The FTSE All-Share Index, the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation. The letters F-T-S-E represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the Financial Times (F-T) and the London Stock Exchange (S-E). On 13 February 1984 the FTSE 100 was introduced, representing about eighty percent of the London Stock Exchange's value. In 1995 FTSE Group was made an independent company. The first of several overseas offices was opened in New York City in 1999; Paris followed in early 2000, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and San Francisco in 2001, Madrid in 2002 and Tokyo in 2003.

People In July 2006 the FT announced a \\"New Newsroom\\" project to integrate the newspaper more closely with FT.com. At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs. A number of former FT journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. Robert Thomson, previously the paper's US managing editor, was the editor of The Times and is now the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Will Lewis, a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the FT, is the current editor of the Daily Telegraph.

The population was 4,942 at the 2010 census. History In 1887, when the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad was laying tracks across San Patricio County, Thomas H. Mathis received naming rights when he donated for a townsite and school. Mathis and his brother J. M. Mathis, held in the vicinity. The brothers had dropped out of the Coleman, Mathis, Fulton Cattle Company in 1879. Thomas Mathis owned an additional around Mathis and built a fence enclosing the town. As late as 1906, Mathis was enclosed and arriving and departing trains had to be let in and out. Mathis' success was partially fueled by residents of Lagarto moving to be near the railroad. The Mathis post office opened in 1890 and the town's first school was held in a private residence in 1893. Two years later, a one-room school was built, and in 1913, a second railroad (the San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Pacific) arrived. Cotton and corn crops were raised and ranching was an important part of the economy. During the 1930s, winter vegetable crops were grown and both railroads maintained shipping sheds. Mathis incorporated in 1939. In the early 1950s, of land two miles (3 km) north of town were developed for vegetable crops - complete with irrigation and deep-water wells. Cotton, corn, and sorghum replaced vegetables in the 1960s. In the 1930s, the Nueces River was dammed and Lake Mathis (since renamed Lake Corpus Christi) was formed. Construction of the Wesley Seale Dam in the late 1950s raised the level of the lake to where it became desirable for weekend homes. In 1988, Mathis had a population of 5,910 which has since decreased to 5,034. The game mode \\"Longshot\\" in Madden 18 and 19 is set primarily in Mathis. Lake Corpus Christi (Lake Mathis) Lake Corpus Christi is a reservoir on the Nueces River, lying southwest of Mathis. The lake is a recreational spot in South Texas offering swimming, skiing, boating, and fishing. Large areas of submerged brush in the upper reaches of this lake provide prime fish habitat. All fishing is good, but it is noted for its excellent catfish - channels, flatheads, and blues; the record is a flathead weighing . Also, the lake is noted for its white, black, and striped bass, sunfish, and crappie. The record largemouth bass weighed . The area is a winter home for hundreds of winter Texans from all parts of the state and country, as well as Canada. Around its more than of shoreline, numerous camps and parks provide campsites, boat ramps, fishing piers, and RV and mobile home areas. A main attraction is Lake Corpus Christi State Park, whose surround a cove, protected from the prevailing southeasterly winds by high limestone cliffs, and provide a scenic view of the main body of the lake. Favorable climate offers opportunities for year-round activities. History abounds in the area, with former battlegrounds now lush with farmland, brush, and grass for grazing cattle. The Nueces River at one time divided Texas from Mexico. It was a much-disputed boundary, and only after the Mexican War was the issue was settled, making the Rio Grande the official boundary. One of the more famous battles between the two countries was fought at Old San Patricio, founded by the Irish and located south of Mathis. The area, once inhabited by Karankawa and Lipan Apache Indians, became the site of several unsuccessful settlement attempts in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Economy Pecans emerged as an important crop, largely because of the work of Edmund E. Risien, an Englishman who moved to San Saba County in 1874 and made improvement of the native nuts his life's work. Risien founded the West Texas Pecan Nursery at the junction of the San Saba and Colorado Rivers. The \\"Mother Pecan Tree\\", located in the heart of this orchard, has been used to produce many great pecan varieties. Some of these include the San Saba Improved, Texas Prolific, Onliwon, Squirrel Delight, No.60 and Western Schley, and these are just a few of the varieties this tree has produced. During his era, Risien's customer base included Queen Victoria of England, Alfred Lord Tennyson and the Post Cereals. Today, Risien is credited for laying the groundwork for the pecan industry that led San Saba County to proclaim itself 'Pecan Capital of the World'. Today the land and orchard is owned by the Millican family and six generations have worked in the pecan business.http://www.millicanpecan.com Education The City of San Saba is served by the San Saba Independent School District. Its schools include San Saba Elementary, serving students in grades K-4; San Saba Middle School, serving grades 5-8; and San Saba High School, grades 9-12. The school district opened two new facilities in October 2013, a new elementary building that houses all elementary grades under one roof for the first time in many years, and a new set of science labs in a building immediately across from the main entrance to the high school, named for science teacher George Dennis, who was on the faculty for over 50 years until his retirement in December 2012. The current superintendent of schools is Michael Bohensky, and the individual campuses are headed by Kay Shackelford (elementary), Dustin Anders (middle school), and Scott Snyder (high school).

History Hermleigh's history begins in 1907 when a townsite was surveyed on land donated by two men named R. C. Herm and Harry W. Harlin near the small community of Wheat. Citizens chose to name their new community \\"Hermlin\\" (an amalgam of the surnames of the two landowners) but this name was rejected by postal officials as being too close to the nearby town of Hamlin, potentially causing confusion between the two communities. The compromise of \\"Hermleigh\\" was settled upon, and the post office opened shortly thereafter. The Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway was built through the new community, and residents of Wheat began to relocate to Hermleigh. In 1911 the Santa Fe Railroad reached the community, and Hermleigh developed into a shipping point and trading center for local ranchers and cotton farmers. A school opened to serve area students in 1913, and by the late 1910s the community had its own newspaper (the Hermleigh Herald). Hermleigh briefly changed its name in the late 1910s to Foch to honor the French field marshal and World War I hero Ferdinand Foch, but reverted to the original name shortly thereafter and continued to flourish until the early 1930s, when the effects of the Great Depression brought an end to Hermleigh's growth. Though adversely effected by the Depression, Hermleigh remained stable throughout most of the twentieth century and by 1980 was home to over 700 residents. By 1990, however, the population had fallen dramatically to approximately 200 and some of the remaining businesses closed down. The community inexplicably rebounded during the 1990s, with the population reaching 393 by the 2000 Census. Hermleigh is the hometown of former head coach of the Baylor Bears football program, Grant Teaff. The most expensive pig ever sold was owned by a Hermleigh resident. Jefferey Roemisch of Hermleigh sold his cross-breed barrow named \\"Bud\\" for a record breaking $56,000 in 1983 to a man named Bud Olson and his partner, Phil Bonzio.

The population was 11,202 at the 2010 census.https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/popcity12010.html The city is located in the lower part of the Southwestern Tablelands ecological region. History Snyder is named for merchant and buffalo hunter William Henry (Pete) Snyder, who built a trading post on Deep Creek in 1878. It soon drew fellow hunters, and a small settlement grew up around the post. The nature of those early dwellings, mostly constructed of buffalo hide and tree branches, led to the community's first, if unofficial, name of \\"Hide Town\\". Another early name, \\"Robber's Roost\\", is said to owe its beginnings to the sometimes nefarious nature of a few residents and a lack of law enforcement. A statue of an albino buffalo on the grounds of the Scurry County courthouse in Snyder pays homage to the town's beginnings as a buffalo-trading post. Snyder antedates Scurry County by two years, with a town plan being drawn up in 1882, while the county was not organized until 1884. A population of 600 was reported in 1892, with a school, two churches, a grist mill, steam gin, two banks, and two weekly newspapers being part of the community. Significant change happened in 1907 when Snyder was granted a city charter, and construction began on the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway. The 1910 census indicated Snyder had grown to a population of 2,514. The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway tracks reached Snyder in 1911, spurring further growth. Ranching and farming were the primary economic backbone of Snyder through the first half of the 20th century. This changed in 1948 when oil was discovered in the Canyon Reef area north of town. Snyder became a boomtown, as the population jumped to about 12,000 in just a year's time. By the time the boom ended in 1951, an estimated peak population of 16,000 had been reached. This soon decreased to the 10,000 to 11,000 level and stabilized. Although the boom was over, oil still remained a vital part of the local economy, with the Snyder area being one of the leading oil-producing areas in Texas. In 1973, the one-billionth barrel of oil was pumped from the nearby oil fields. An industrial base was established in the 1960s and early 1970s, diversifying the town's economy and making it less susceptible to cycles of boom and bust. Higher education came to Snyder in 1971 with the founding of Western Texas College. One of the most successful Texas colleges for graduation and job placement, Western Texas offers associate of arts degree programs, as well as vocational-program certifications. Enrollment in 2009 was over 2,500 students. The Scurry County Coliseum in Snyder, operated by Western Texas College since 2008, is a large arena which hosts area events. Outside the Coliseum is a locomotive engine and a small restored historic village. Also located in Snyder is the Diamond M Museum. Established by local oilman and rancher Clarence T. McLaughlin, the museum houses over 80 bronze works and 200 paintings. Among the collection are works by Peter Hurd and Andrew Wyeth. Geography and climate Snyder is located on Deep Creek, a minor tributary of the Colorado River of Texas.

Economy Snyder enjoys a strong economy, driven by the oil, gas, and wind industries. In 2012, 994 jobs were created in Snyder, leading to 20% job growth in the community, according to the Development Corporation of Snyder. The Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators (SACROC) oilfield is among the largest and most productive in the nation. Two of the largest wind farms in the nation are located in Snyder area. Other important industries in Snyder include manufacturing and cotton. Oil In addition to the SACROC field, Snyder is also located within the footprint of the newly discovered Cline Shale. Devon Energy estimates the Cline Shale to produce 30 billion barrels of oil, surpassing the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. The thickness of the Cline Shale is equivalent to roughly 10 Eagle Ford shales stacked on top of each other. As exploration and development of this new shale continues in the Snyder area, the city is expected to see a large population increase with new restaurants, apartments, and retail shopping. Wind Energy A section of the second-largest wind farm in the United States, the Roscoe Wind Farm, is already located in the Snyder area. In late 2013 and 2014, Tri-Global Energy was to begin construction on two new wind farms near Snyder. Combined, the Fluvanna Renewable Energy Project and the Canyon Wind project will add 700 MW wind capacity and represent a $1.4 billion investment in the Snyder and surrounding areas. Industrial and Rail Park Two industrial parks are in Snyder, including one that has rail access. Current occupants in these two industrial parks include W.L Plastics, Tractor Supply, Mitsubishi Power Systems, Big Country Electric, Kyle Erwin Construction, Four Star Hose and Supply, and Total Truck and Trailer. With the impending Cline Shale oil boom, more companies are looking to Snyder for their expansion plans. Education The Snyder Independent School District serves Snyder. The schools are Snyder Primary, Snyder Intermediate, Snyder Junior High School, Snyder Academy, and Snyder High School. Western Texas College, a two-year community college, is located in Snyder.

Students graduating from Scurry County high schools can take advantage of the Opportunity Tuition Waiver. Qualified students can enroll in college courses tuition-free. Popular culture Snyder plays a key plot role, and is frequently mentioned, in the Southern Victory alternate history novel series in its final phase Settling Accounts by Harry Turtledove, where a camp a few miles out of Snyder becomes the timeline's equivalent of Auschwitz under a fascistic Confederate government. At the turn of the 20th century, Snyder was rocked by a deadly feud between the families of Billy Johnson and Ed Sims. Gladys Johnson, daughter of banker Billy Johnson, at the age of 14 in 1914, married Ed Sims. The young couple had two daughters, but soon divorced in July 1916. Sims was thereafter shot dead by a Johnson family member. The grand jury in Lamesa failed to bring a true bill against the killer. Gladys Johnson Sims in the spring of 1917 married Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, whose previous marriage ended in divorce. The Hamers raised four children, the daughters of Gladys and Ed Sims, and two of their own, including Frank Hamer, Jr. Frank Hamer died in 1955, but Gladys lived in their home in Austin until her death in 1986 at the age of 85.Bill O'Neal, \\"Romeo and Juliet --West Texas Style: The Johnson-Sims Feud,\\" West Texas Historical Association annual meeting, April 1, 2011, Lubbock, Texas Notable people * Kevin Alejandro (born 1976), who starred in Ugly Betty on ABC as Santos and Southland on TNT as Detective Nate Moretta, a recurring cast member of the HBO series True Blood, and stars in CBS series Golden Boy grew up in Snyder. * Powers Boothe (1948-2017), Emmy-Award-winning actor who portrayed the demonic clergyman Jim Jones in Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones, Curly Bill in Tombstone, Joshua Foss in Sudden Death, and Senator Roark in Sin City is a native of Snyder. * Charlene Holt, actress and model, starred in Western film El Dorado (1966 film) as Maudie, the love interest of Robert Mitchum and John Wayne, was born in Snyder. * Dick Jones (1927-2014), actor, starred in Buffalo Bill, Jr. in syndication in 1955 as \\"Dickie\\" Jones, and was voice of title character in 1940 Disney film Pinocchio, is a native of Snyder. * Charley Lockhart, born and raised in Snyder, was a politician - treasurer of Texas from 1931 to 1941, who received national media attention as a dwarf.

During the Civil War (1861‚Äì65), they built the temporary fortress settlement of Mugginsville on Deep Creek 5 miles north of the future town site of Moran. At one time, a branch of the Western Cattle Trail passed nearby. Population increased after the arrival of the Texas Central Railroad in 1881. Hulltown, the original name of the town, was established by Mary and George Washington \\"Swope\\" Hull of McDowell, Virginia, who opened a general store at the rail crossing on Deep Creek in 1883. Hull (1849-1911) was the first postmaster. He bought 160 acres between Post Oak and Deep Creeks and platted a town site in March 1884 (he and his family would later move to Oakland, California). Most of the property was bought by Bem Scott, a real estate developer from Indiana, who eventually sold his interests in 1890 to Matthew D. Bray (1845-1926), a prominent local merchant and landowner. For unknown reasons, the town's name was changed to Hicks in 1890. Later, in order to secure a new railroad depot, the town was renamed a third and final time to Moran in 1892 for Texas Central Railroad owner Charles Moran of New York. By 1900, the community had several businesses, a school and Baptist, Church of Christ, Cumberland Presbyterian, and Methodist congregations. A newspaper was begun in 1895 and bank in 1902. In November 1910, the Cottle No. 1 natural gas well discovery opened the nearby Moran Field, and was the first commercial gas well completed in this vast west Texas area. In the spring of 1911, gas was piped to Moran for residential and business use. Within two years (in 1913) the cities of Albany, Cisco, and Abilene were supplied for the first time with natural gas. By Oct. 1913, with five producing gas wells, the Moran Field won recognition as one of the most important sources of fossil fuels in Texas. For the next fifteen years, oil and gas discoveries in the area made Moran a boom town with a peak population of 5,000 - 10,000 at one point in the 1920s. By the 1930s, the boom was over and the population gradually began its decline to the present day. Note: much of the information above comes from the local historical markers to the town and to the Cottle No. 1 gas well. In the late 1980s, Moran achieved fame as the home of the National Fajita Cook-off, which brought thousands of visitors from all over the world to the sleepy town. In the 2000s, Moran became home to Slide Fire Solutions, a multi-million dollar bump stock production company. The local economy remains tied to farming, ranching, and oil and gas production. Local Texas historical markers are devoted to: Moran (#3468), Cottle No. 1 Natural Gas Well (#1076), Granville E. Waters (#13204), Moran Cemetery (#17708), and Moran Church of Christ (#17SF02).

History Shelby County was one of the original 13 counties in Texas, being organized by the Republic of Texas Congress in 1837. The county was named for Issac Shelby, an American military hero and Governor of Kentucky. Shelby County eventually became one of the most populous and prosperous counties in the state because of its proximity to Louisiana and location along the Sabine River. The settlement which eventually became the City of Center was originally called White Cottage. A post office was established at this settlement on April 6, 1848. Al Johnson, an East Texas State Representative, introduced a bill to have all county seats be as close to the center of the county as possible. R.L. Parker, the County Clerk at the time, arranged to have the county surveyed and the center located. The originally county seat was Shelbyville, Texas located approximately 7 miles from White Cottage. However, one night in 1866, a group of men led by Parker entered into the court house and stole all of the records and took them to a log cabin near White Cottage. Shortly after the incident, the community became known as Center, primarily to reflect the requisite location of the county seat. The Center post office opened in October 1866. In 1869, Confederate veterans Captain Jesse Amason and James C. Wilson, with wife Margaret Davis Wilson,S each donated 50 acres of land for the townsite of Center. According to one historical account, Amason would not give the land unless the new town would have a four-acre town square, and that is the reason that Center has such a large square. Mr. Wilson owned considerable land in the southern quarter of the town. Much of that area is called the \\"Wilson Addition\\". On the night of May 31, 1882, a fire erupted at the courthouse and the building was a complete loss. The county contracted with J.J. E. Gibson, an Irish immigrant, to construct a new courthouse and jail. When the bond of builders J.J. E. Gibson and Pat McLaughlin for the sum of $26,725 was issued in 1884 for them to erect a new courthouse for Shelby County, the firm of Wilson and Martin was among the securities. The courthouse, modeled after an Irish castle, was completed in November, 1885 and is still standing as the centerpiece of the Center Square. The town of Center made national news twice in 1920s for the lynchings of black murder suspects without a trial. On August 3, 1920, the Lige Daniels was seized by an angry mob that broke into the Shelby County Jail, where he was being held on charges of the beating death of a woman.\\"Mob Lynches Negro for Murder of Woman\\", Atlanta Constitution, August 3, 1920, p4\\"Negro Is Lynched By Mob of 1,000 In Center, Texas\\", Billings (MT) Gazette, August 3, 1920, p1 Daniels, an 18-year old black man, was dragged out and hanged from a tree in front of the courthouse, famous as the \\"Center Hanging Oak\\". The oak tree was used again as a gallows on May 21, 1928, when another mob intercepted another 18-year old African-American, accused murderer Eolis Evans, as he was being returned to the county jail.\\"Negro Slayer Is Hanged In Center\\", Longview (TX) News-Journal, May 21, 1928, p1 The hanging oak\\" tree itself died in 1990 and was cut down.\\"Center Hanging Oak\\", Famous Trees of Texas, Texas A & M University Forest Service\\"] At noon on February 12, 1950, an F3 tornado touched down in Center, destroying several buildings.

The population was 1,160 at the 2010 census. History Tenaha was established on February 2, 1886. The community was named by members of the Hicks family (Cherokee) for Tenehaw Municipality, from the Spanish, the original name of Shelby County. In 2009, Tenaha became a defendant in a class action lawsuit over allegations that local police regularly made improper seizures of cash, jewelry, and property from African-American and Latino motorists passing through the town. Arrested drivers were given a choice of either going to jail on money- laundering felony charges or handing over all their valuables in order to be allowed to walk free. In one case a couple surrendered $6,000 to keep their children out of child protection services.

Police department= Asset forfeiture controversy  Between 2006 and 2008, Tenaha Marshal‚Äôs Office used state forfeiture regulations to seize property from nearly 200 motorists. In about 50 of the cases, suspects were charged with drug possession. But in 147 incidents, marshals seized cash, jewelry, cell phones and automobiles even though no contraband was found and the motorist was not charged with any crime. Many of these were African-American or Latino drivers. At least 150 motorists had property seized by Tenaha marshal‚Äôs office, totaling more than US$3 million. Examples of seizures from non-whites included: #A mixed-race family of four traveling through Tenaha were pulled over by marshals for a moving violation. Officers found no contraband but seized $6,037 after a search. The marshals and the district attorney threatened to take the two children away from the parents and place them in Child Protective Services if they refused to hand over the cash. Tenaha marshals eventually returned the family's money without an apology. The parents are now plaintiffs in a federal class action lawsuit. #Linda Dorman, a great-grandmother from Akron, Ohio had $4,000 in cash taken from her by local authorities when she was stopped while driving through town after visiting Houston in April 2007. Court records make no mention that anything illegal was found in her van. Dorman still hopes for the return of what she calls her life savings. #Javier Flores and William Parsons were traveling through Tenaha on July 22, 2008 when they were stopped by police for speeding. Both men were arrested, and $8,400 was seized, after a police dog allegedly detected drugs in the vehicle although no contraband was found. The pair were then threatened with money laundering charges unless they forfeited the money. Both men were then released from custody without charge. # Two men had $50,000 seized even though court records show there was no evidence to indicate the cash was related in any way to criminal enterprise or that the men were engaged in any illegal activity. The town used the proceeds from the seizures to build a new marshals office and personally reward high-revenue generating officers. Other purchases included a $524 popcorn machine and $195 for candy. Donations to Little League teams and local chambers of commerce were also made using seized funds. Texas law states that forfeited money can only be used for official purposes by district attorney offices, and for law-enforcement purposes by police departments. Lynda Russell, Tenaha's district attorney, has denied any impropriety. However, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas re- prosecuted drug offenders after officials in Tenaha and Shelby County gave known traffickers lenient sentences in exchange for cash forfeitures. In 2008, Shelby county was investigated by the Department of Justice's civil rights division over an allegation made by its former auditor that seized funds had been used for campaign materials in local elections. = Class action lawsuit = In July 2008, 10 plaintiffs filed suit in federal court against Tenaha and Shelby county officials, alleging that police officers had stopped them without cause and unjustly seized their property. The plaintiffs allege that officers threatened them with criminal prosecution if they did not cooperate. Officials named in the suit included Tenaha mayor George Bowers, deputy city marshal Barry Washington and Shelby County district attorney Lynda Kay Russell. Texas State Senator John Whitmire stated, \\"If used properly, it's a good law-enforcement tool to see that crime doesn't pay. But in this instance, where people are being pulled over and their property is taken with no charges filed and no convictions, I think that's theft.\\" By March 2009, the plaintiff's attorney Timothy Garrigan was seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, citing many similar reports from other alleged victims. In response the Tenaha marshals said that would return at least one man's seized possessions, valued at around $8,500. In August 2011, a judge agreed the case could move forward as a class action because it was part of a larger legal battle \\"to stop illegal search and seizures and questionable 'interdiction' programs\\". In late 2012, the ACLU announced a settlement in the case, under which police must now observe rigorous rules during traffic stops in Tenaha and Shelby County: traffic stops will be videotaped, and the officer must give reason for the stop and for suspicion of criminal activity. Drivers are to be advised that they can refuse a search, and dogs will no longer be used in conducting traffic stops. Property determined to have been taken improperly must be returned within 30 business days. Also, asset forfeiture revenue from traffic stops must be donated to non-profit organizations, or used to pay for the officer training required by the settlement.

The Cherokee War of 1839 forced the Native Americans out. However, the area was again occupied by Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek Indians after 1845. The descendants of these people formed the Mount Tabor Indian Community and a number continue to reside in Smith and Rusk counties today. The settlement that would become Arp was called Bissa, from the Choctaw/Chickasaw word for blackberry, as early as the 1800s. It was later called Jarvis Junction and then Strawberry, after the fruit that was grown in the area. It was finally renamed \\"Arp\\" for Bill Arp (pen name of Charles Henry Smith), a Georgia humorist who was nationally known in the late 19th century. Supposedly, the three-letter name was also chosen for its brevity, which allowed local strawberry producers to spend less time hand-marking their crates.

Lindale City Hall Lillie Russell Memorial Library in Lindale Lindale () is a city in Smith County, Texas, United States. The population was 4,818 in the 2010 census. It is part of the Tyler, Texas, metropolitan statistical area. History The area of Smith County where Lindale sits was inhabited long before the town was founded in 1871. In the early 19th century, the Caddo Indians were the area's primary inhabitants; their artifacts can still be found along streams in the area. The area also was home to Cherokee Indians, who were forced out when the Republic of Texas was founded in 1836. After the Civil War, Richard B. Hubbard, a former officer in the Confederate Army and owner of a large plantation on what is today a gated community called Hideaway Lake, began searching for a more convenient way to ship the produce grown on his land. Hubbard convinced railroad officials to lay track between nearby Tyler and Mineola. Hubbard's brother-in-law, Elijah Lindsey, anticipating growth around the new railroad, opened the fledgling community's first general store in 1871, and Lindale had its start; Lindsey was elected the town's first mayor a year later. Several stories abound locally about how Lindale got its name, but the most common is that Lindsey's name was combined with the suffix \\"dale\\" to form \\"Lindseydale.\\" The name was shortened to Lindale in 1874 when the first Post Office opened in town. A year later, the International-Great Northern Railroad extended its line through Lindale, and the town's fledgling canning and fruit packing industries took off. By the late 1880s, some 300 people lived in the town, which was gaining fame for its fruit and berry canning industry. By 1900, the city had its own newspaper, two cotton gins, several shops, churches, a telephone exchange, a doctor and lawyer, as well as the ubiquitous canning factory. In 1905, the town was incorporated; it spanned about a square mile in total. Produce continued to be the city's main source of income, and by 1950 the town had gained a reputation for being the \\"blackberry capital of the world,\\" with tons of berries being canned and shipped each year. The 1949 comedy film release, Strike It Rich, starring Rod Cameron and Bonita Granville, was filmed in the Lindale, Tyler, and Kilgore area. An exhibit on the picture is found at the Old Mill Museum in Lindale. In 1996, Lindale's school board banned 32 books from its schools, including To Kill a Mockingbird, because they \\"conflicted with the values of the community.\\" According to school board president John Offutt, a Baptist minister, the board's action was an attempt to make students adhere to Christian beliefs. Currently, To Kill a Mockingbird is again required reading in the High School Pre-AP English II class. Present day Lindale's produce trade has declined significantly over the past two decades, with the closure of its canning factory, allowing other industries to grow, including cattle, hay production, and rose-growing. Several religious ministries (including Calvary Commission,Teen Mania Ministries, Mercy Ships, Keith Green and his Last Days Ministries, Youth With A Mission, and David Wilkerson and his Teen Challenge and World Challenge ministries) either are or were located near Lindale. With the growth of Tyler and the increased traffic on I-20 and US-69, Lindale has experienced a surge in residential, retail, and other commercial development.

History=Early history The Welcome to Whitehouse sign is built from rock used in the old \\"rock school house.\\" The school house and other public works were built during the Great Depression by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The sign itself was made and donated by local resident Lynn Canfield. The community was founded long before the city was officially incorporated by James Calhoun Hill (auctioneer in 1846 for Tyler land grants). The community was named in 1845, but was not incorporated until 1953. The school district (WISD) preceded incorporated municipal government, and was largely responsible for the eventual formation of the city. Residents of Whitehouse were predominantly farmers or worked in support of agriculture until transportation innovations following World War II lead to other employment options. Many streets and subdivisions in the community are named for these early agricultural and commercial leaders. According to oral tradition, the community was named \\"Whitehouse\\" by the railroad engineers who stopped near a white-washed community building during early settlement times. Several cherished historic resources include the various Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects located within the city. These projects, typically built with sandstone rockwork, are found throughout the city's historic Town Center. YesterYear Celebration Civic leaders established the YesterYear Celebration to educate residents about the community's history and heritage. The festival is held on the fourth weekend each June and includes activities such as parades, carnivals, historic battle reenactments, pageants, and trade days. Historic reading Several works documenting the community's history have been published in the recent past. Shirley Smith wrote and/or edited several books including Homefolks, a collection of letters from important figures who lived in the community throughout the early 20th century. The Tri-County Leader published a series of articles by Acker Hanks called \\"Growing up in Whitehouse.\\" The articles recounted Mr. Hanks' experience in the community starting in the early 1920s. The Whitehouse Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan (see Planning and Development) also included a history section. This section was based on oral history interviews from prominent Whitehouse residents such at Nancy Shahan Coats, Joe Pat Hagan, Acker Hanks, Gaylon Shackelford, and Richard Waller. Many of these resources are available at the Whitehouse Community Library. Planning and development=Past efforts The front and back cover of the Whitehouse Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan. The document was adopted by the City of Whitehouse in the spring of 2006. Whitehouse is in the first phase of an overhaul of its planning regulations. The city initially began regulating land use through zoning on December 4, 1987. The next major effort intended to improve quality of life in the city through planning was the completion of the community's first comprehensive plan in April 1996. The document was developed by J.T. Dunkin & Associates. Recent efforts The city's Planning & Zoning Commission has worked at the direction of the City Council to update various components of the 1987 zoning ordinance. The commission also recommended updates to the subdivision regulations which were adopted in February 2004. The city also contracted with Butler Planning Services to update the comprehensive plan from 1996. The firm, along with a citizen steering committee, produced the Whitehouse Vision 2020 Comprehensive Plan in the spring of 2006. Following this effort, the city is currently evaluating the need for a new zoning ordinance which can implement the recommendations of the Vision 2020 Plan.

Glen Rose is a city in and the county seat of Somervell County, Texas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,444. History=19th century The area was first settled in 1849 by Charles Barnard, who opened a trading post near Comanche Peak. After the region became a federal Indian reservation in 1855, Barnard moved his business to Fort Belknap. Circa 1859 when the reservation was abolished, he returned to the area and built the first store on what is now the site of Glen Rose. A three-story stone gristmill was constructed along the Paluxy River and the town that grew up around it became known as Barnard's Mill. The mill was sold to T.C. Jordan of Dallas in 1871 for $65,000. Jordan's wife, a native of Scotland, decided to rename the town Rose Glen to reflect the area's natural surroundings. The citizens later voted to call the community Glen Rose. A post office opened in 1874. When Somervell County was formed on March 15, 1875, Glen Rose was designated as its county seat. A Baptist college was organized in 1879 and was later sold to the Paluxy Baptist Association. In 1889, the northern Presbyterians opened Glen Rose Collegiate Institute (also known as Glen Rose College), which remained in operation for the next 15 to 20 years. A courthouse around Glen Rose's town square was completed around 1892, but burned down a year later. A newly built Romanesque Revival style courthouse was constructed soon after with locally quarried limestone. That building sustained damage in a 1902 tornado that also damaged part of the town square. 20th century Throughout the period from the 1900s to the 1920s, Glen Rose was home to approximately 1,000 people. The area's mineral springs attracted numerous doctors and self-styled healers to the community. During Prohibition, the area was a center of moonshining and Glen Rose became known as the \\"whiskey woods capital of the state.\\" The population remained steady during the Great Depression, although unemployment rates in both Glen Rose and Somervell County increased. As part of the New Deal, Glen Rose borrowed $80,000 under the Public Works Administration (PWA) to construct a new water and sewage system. Three low-water dams on the Paluxy River, several local school buildings, and a canning plant were built with Works Projects Administration (WPA) money. During the post-war years, the population of Somervell County declined from 3,071 in 1940 to 2,542 in 1950 as many residents moved in search of greater employment opportunities. At the same time, Glen Rose grew from 1,050 residents in 1940 to 1,248 in 1950. The construction of the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant in the mid-1970s brought financial advantages and new residents to the Glen Rose area. The city experienced a 34 percent increase in population between 1970 and 1980. The nuclear plant came to dominate the local economy. Other chief industries include farming, ranching, and tourism. 111 rated businesses were located in Glen Rose as of 1991.

The city is connected to Camargo, Tamaulipas, via the Rio Grande City‚ÄìCamargo International Bridge. The city is situated within the Rio Grande Valley. History Fort Ringgold in its prime. Fort Ringgold County Park in memory, but the original site is now occupied by an elementary and middle school. The area around Rio Grande City was first populated in 1846, when it served as a transfer point for supplies and soldiers supporting General Zachary Taylor's invasion of Mexico. It was a logical point for trade, as it was the highest point up the Rio Grande (known as the Rio Bravo in Mexico) for reliable steamboat traffic, and intersected a number of overland routes to Saltillo, Monterrey, and Northern Mexico. During the early stages of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, one of the soldiers stationed here, Henry Clay Davis, married Hilaria de la Garza Falcon, a resident of Camargo and heiress to the land on which Rio Grande City now sits. At the end of the war, Davis set out to organize this area into a formal city, breaking up the land into plots. At first, the area was referred to as \\"Rancho Davis\\" then the name was changed to \\"Rio Grande City\\" to encourage investors and settlers. From its founding, in 1848, until the Texas Mexican Railroad opened up in 1883, Rio Grande City was one of the most significant hubs of trade between Texas and Mexico, and was one of the major contemporary contributors to the American romanticized concept of the \\"wild West\\". Famous early residents include: Joshua H. Bean, brother of Judge Roy Bean, and the first mayor of San Diego, CA; Orlando C. Phelps, one of the few surviving members of the Mier Expedition; Edwin R. Rainwater, hero of the Texas Revolution; Edward R. Hord, an influential early South Texas statesman; and John L. Haynes, a native Virginian politician and writer who was an outspoken anti-secessionist and strong proponent of Mexican- American rights. Rio Grande City contains a historic district. One structure, the La Borde House, dates back to 1899. A French riverboat trader and merchant commissioned its design in Paris, had it refined by San Antonio architects, and then had it constructed along Main St. It was renovated around the early 1980s and now functions as a hotel, complete with a patio, parlor, shaded verandas, and restaurant. In the 1970s and into the 1980s, federal law enforcement officials concentrated their anti-drug smuggling efforts on Starr County.Miller, Tom.

In spite of Rio Grande City's rich architectural heritage, many buildings in the old downtown district are abandoned, dilapidated, or crumbling. While there are a good number of small shops and businesses operating in the district, most new development and commerce takes place in new shopping centers outside of the old downtown neighborhood. Rio Grande City has seen rapid growth in the past years. In August 2006, an HEB Plus (the regional supermarket chain of south Texas) was opened just east of the historic downtown and Fort Ringgold. Fort Ringgold Ringgold Barracks were established at Davis Landing on 26 October 1848 by the 1st US Infantry under the command of Captain J.H. La Motte, in honor of Major Ringgold who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Palo Alto.Texas Historical Marker #5061002012 Troops were withdrawn on 3 March 1859 but reoccupied again on 29 December 1859 during the Cortina War.

The population was 9,765 at the 2010 census. The city is located along the Rio Grande, across from Ciudad Miguel Alem√°n in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The city is also popularly known as Roma-Los Saenz, since the incorporated city also took the area known as Los Saenz. It serves as a port of entry from Mexico into the U.S. via the Roma‚ÄìCiudad Miguel Alem√°n International Bridge. Sights The town center has a number of picturesque historic buildings, now collected in the Roma Historic District. Roma is a popular birding site in the Rio Grande Valley, and a section of the World Birding Center is on Portsheller Street across from the city hall. The channel of the Rio Grande is less than 200 feet wide at Roma. The bluff adjacent to the town square overlooks the river, and parts of the Ciudad Miguel Aleman crossing are readily visible. Because of the arresting views, this location is frequently used by television journalists, public officials, and others who visit the region as a photo op to visualize the border region. History Roma was established in 1821 in what had been the Spanish province of Nuevo Santander. Prior to Texas's independence from Mexico in 1836, the town was listed as under the jurisdiction of the town of Mier, Tamaulipas, and prior to Mexican independence existed under Spanish rule.http://www.cityofroma.net/History.htm The site offered a convenient crossing on the Rio Grande, which became known as El Paso de la Mula (Pass of the Mules). The area was notable for a salt trade from the Roma area to Monterrey. The Roma area became the Mexican state of Tamaulipas with the Mexican Constitution of 1824. Texas claimed Roma with the establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1835. However, Mexico continued to control this area. A Texan force sought to take Roma in the Mier Expedition of 1842, which resulted in the death, capture, or execution of many volunteers. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War established U.S. control over the northern bank of the Rio Grande in 1846, Texas governed Roma. During the American Civil War the region became wealthy on the cotton trade, which was transshipped via Mexico to Europe. While steamboats were able to access Roma through the mid- nineteenth century, lowering water levels as a result of development upstream ended river shipment by the 1880s. Bypassed by railroads, Roma stagnated and inadvertently preserved itself from development. The Roma National Historic Landmark District contains over 30 structures built before 1900. Some of those buildings include: * the Customs House, (Casa de Aduanas, in Spanish) where shippers and brokers came to pay customs fees for imported goods from Europe and Mexico on steam boats, * the John Vale/Noah Cox House, built in 1853 by Swedish immigrant John Vale, and whose front elevation has finely carved sandstone with classical details on the cornice, * the Leocadia Garcia House, built in the 1840s, which served first as a dwelling for Jos√© Maria Garcia, husband of Leocadia, and then as a store and dance hall, * Ramirez Hall, two- story home of Lino Ramirez and three generations of the Ramirez family.

Geography and climate Sonora is located at (30.568166, -100.644163). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.1 km), all of it land. The area lies in the western portions of the Texas Hill Country, a region of limestone outcrops and rolling terrain dotted with areas of live oaks (Quercus fusiformis) and juniper (Juniperus ashei) in the form of a woodland or savanna, alternating with a blend of various grasses and other shrubs and cacti. Sonora's climate is subhumid and subtropical, though periods of long drought are not uncommon due to the proximity of deserts and steppes nearby, to the west. The upland location allows some of the periodic Gulf of Mexico moisture to interact with frontal systems and elevated terrain to create more clouds and precipitation than locations in the brush country to the south, or the steppes and deserts to the west and northwest. Thunderstorms with heavy rainfall are most frequent during spring and fall months, though some lighter, steady precipitation and low clouds can occur during the winter, due in large part to frontal systems originating on the plains and prairies to the north. Summers are long and hot, often with higher humidity, though a good breeze often moderates the heat. Fall through spring months are often pleasant, though winter can experience brief periods of cold or cloudy weather.

The population was 4,967 at the 2010 census; in the 2018 census estimate, it had fallen to 4,682.Estimate. - U.S. Census Bureau. - Census.gov. - April 2005. - (Microsoft Excel *.XLS document). The city is at the junction of U.S. Route 87 and Texas State Highway 86, about east of Interstate 27. Tulia is a center for farming and agribusiness activities. History Its site was originally on the acreage of the Tule Ranch division of the JA Ranch. In 1887, a post office was established in James A. Parrish's dugout on Middle Tule Draw, west of what is now the site of Tulia. Evidently, the name Tule, after the nearby creek, had been selected for this post office, but at some point a clerk's error changed the name to Tulia. By 1900, Tulia was prospering as a stopping point for freight-wagon traffic en route to the railheads of Colorado City and Amarillo. A booming new era began with the extension of the Santa Fe line to Tulia in December 1906; with it came more settlers. In the mid-1980s, local industrial plants manufactured products such as clothing and farm implements, and four large cattle-feeding enterprises were nearby. 1999 drug arrest scandal Tulia gained notoriety following a drug sting in July 1999 that rounded up 46 people, 40 of whom were innocent African Americans. The remaining detainees were Whites known to have ties within the Black community, and in fact lived in the \\"Black\\" part of town. Nearly one-third of Tulia's Black males were arrested, about 15% of the town's Black population. All charges were based on the word of undercover officer Tom Coleman, a so- called \\"gypsy cop\\" who made his living traveling through impoverished rural Texas offering to work undercover cheaply for short periods of time for underfunded police departments. Coleman claimed to have made over 100 drug buys in the small town. He never recorded any of the sales, but claimed to have written painstaking notes on his leg under his shorts and upper arm under his shirt sleeve when nobody was looking. During the roundup, no large sums of money, illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, nor illegal weapons were found. The accused drug dealers showed no signs of having any income associated with selling drugs. The drugs Coleman claimed to have bought from the accused did not have the fingerprints of the accused on them or their baggies. No independent witnesses could corroborate Coleman's claims. In his testimony, Coleman gave inaccurate descriptions of the \\"dealers\\" from whom he had allegedly bought cocaine. One suspect had his charges dropped when he was able to prove he had been at work during the times he had supposedly sold Coleman cocaine. Another produced bank and phone records indicating she was in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at the time of her alleged crime. Many of the accused, however, seeing the long sentences dealt by all-White juries in earlier cases, pled guilty in return for lighter sentences, despite their proclaimed innocence. The remaining defendants were convicted solely on the basis of Coleman's testimony. The Texas Department of Public Safety awarded \\"Lawman of the Year\\" to Coleman. Amarillo civil rights attorney Jeff Blackburn began investigating the Tulia defendants' cases, along with civil rights organizations and a handful of attorneys from firms around the country. Eventually, the case became a cause c√©l√®bre, and money was raised to legally challenge the cases. Many had already served several years in prison before this process gained momentum. By 2004, Blackburn and his team had freed most of the \\"Tulia 46\\" and a $6,000,000 collective settlement was reached to avoid further litigation in civil court. Local authorities remain defiant, promising their town will not become a \\"slot machine\\" in the face of a new lawsuit stemming from an alleged incident of police brutality during the sweep. In 2005, Coleman was convicted of perjury and sentenced to 10 years' probation and a $7,500 fine. Federal laws titled after Tulia have twice been introduced in the United States Congress, but not enacted, to increase the evidentiary standard required to convict a person for a drug offense and to require screening of law enforcement officers or others acting under color of law participating in drug task forces.

The population was 2,259 at the 2010 census. History The community was established in 1934 as a subsistence homestead project during the Great Depression under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act as part of the Subsistence Homesteads Division. The purpose of the homestead program was to help families attain a better standard of living through a combination of part-time industrial employment and subsistence agriculture. Dalworthington Gardens was one of five such projects located in Texas. Its inclusion in group was at the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, who happened upon the area while visiting the Fort Worth family of the woman to whom her and President Roosevelt's son Elliot had become engaged. Of the five sites selected for this program, Dalworthington \\"colony\\" as it was originally called, is the only one still in existence today. Since it has been in constant operation from its inception, it maintains its original zoning regulations, which allow subsistence farming and livestock on any lots over one half acre that remain owned and occupied from the time the zoning was first put into effect. Thus, one can see small, older frame homes with livestock on their lot, near and even adjacent to large modern homes with values in excess of one million dollars. The community's name is a portmanteau of the names of the three anchor cities of the Metroplex: Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington.

The population was 6,108 at the 2010 census. Former Texas Supreme Court Justice Steven Wayne Smith, who served from 2002‚Äì2005, was reared in Everman. History Everman is an incorporated residential community on the southern edge of Fort Worth near Interstate 820 in southeastern Tarrant County. Members of the Kiowa, Apache and Wichita tribes inhabited the area until the arrival of Anglo- Americans in the early to middle 1850s. A hamlet named Oak Grove existed in the area for several years. A small community to the east of present-day Everman was known as \\"Enon\\". The \\"Enon\\" community name had been taken from the Bible. They had a doctor's office, a drug store, and a general store. Upon the arrival of the International ‚Äì Great Northern Railroad in 1902, the more established community of Everman Village was developed. The town moved closer to the railway, which was convenient because it gave the citizens transportation and a means to ship freight both to Houston and to Fort Worth, the nearest city. It was much easier and more pleasant to ride the train than to ride a horse, buggy, or wagon. The people named this new community Everman after John Wesley Everman, the man who was the head of the surveying party that platted the town site. A native of Philadelphia, he came to Texas as an engineer for the IGN Railroad and eventually became the general superintendent and assistant general manager for the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. He died in Dallas in 1946 at the age of 85. The names of some of his descendants still appear in the Fort Worth telephone book, though none live in the city of Everman. The original streets were named after the men who were in that survey party: Noble, Trammell, Trice, Parker, and Hansbarger. Enon Street was named after the first settlement. After the railroad was established, the town put up a cotton gin and started a land office business. In 1905 postal service to the settlement began, and in 1906 Everman established an independent school district. In 1917 the community was one of three sites selected to serve as a flight training school for the Canadian Royal Flying Corps and the United States Signal Corps, Aviation Section. Barron Field, just outside the city, stimulated the local economy and increased population growth. In 1976, the Everman Garden Club obtained a Texas Historical Marker for the Barron Munitions Building, which after the war had served as a schoolhouse for African-American schoolchildren. By the mid-1920s Everman had eight businesses and an estimated population of 138. In 1924, a fire destroyed the bank, a lodge hall that was over the bank, and a grocery store. An election was held on July 7, 1945, launching the City of Everman. On August 25, 1945, a mayor, a marshal and five aldermen were elected. W. A. Wilson was the first mayor of Everman, and the first marshal was Buster Stephenson. The five aldermen were W. B. Dwiggins, Jack Neill, Clyde Pittman, Howard Easter and J. W. Bishop. Everman was on her way to becoming a city, but water was needed. Bonds were sold to build a public water supply system, and a volunteer fire department was organized. The city's water was first furnished by Claude Vaughan's well. In 1948 the name changed from the Village of Everman to the City of Everman. In 1966 there was another big fire in Everman. This time the town lost the post office, a drug store and a cafe. The businesses rebuilt in another location.

The name is taken from a Portuguese Joe (Joe Alves) song entitled \\"Teenage Riot\\" from the album Teen-age Riot, with the word 'Atari' added as an Atari ST computer was used to create compositions. Highly political, they fuse left-wing, anarchist, anti-fascist views with punk vocals and a techno sound called digital hardcore, which is a term band member Alec Empire used as the name of his record label. History The group was founded as an attack on the Neo-Nazi subculture by fusing hardcore punk views with German techno; it consisted of three Berliners‚ÄîAlec Empire, Hanin Elias and MC Carl Crack. ATR's early releases (which included the track \\"Hetzjagd Auf Nazis!\\"/\\"Hunt Down the Nazis!\\") were surrounded by controversy in Germany. After signing to major European label Phonogram Records in 1993, the band received a large financial advance which they duplicitously used to set up their own record label: Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR). ATR never delivered a commercially viable demo to Phonogram. The major label Intercord signed the group in 1995 for Germany. ATR's record label Digital Hardcore Recordings released the debut album \\"Delete Yourself!\\" internationally. In 1996 the Beastie Boys licensed the album and released it in the US with extra songs under the title \\"Burn Berlin Burn\\" on their label Grand Royal. The band toured with Wu-Tang Clan, Rage Against the Machine, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Moby and Beck. In 1996, ATR was joined by Nic Endo, a Japanese-German-American noise/soundscape artist, who played her first live show with ATR in the spring of 1997 during the South by South West festival in Austin, Texas. In 1999, ATR released the album 60 Second Wipe Out, which featured a number of guest artists, including New York City rappers The Arsonists. According to Magnet, \\"Empire's guitar- playing values speed-thrash malevolence, and when paired with Endo's painful skronkage, the album is decidedly denser than its predecessor\\". Elias left ATR at the Brixton Academy show in the winter of 1999. The plan had been to tour with Nine Inch Nails in the US during the spring of 2000, but ATR decided to cancel the show to recharge. Crack also needed time to recuperate from his psychosis attacks. In the autumn of 2000, ATR started working on their fourth album. The song \\"Rage\\", featuring Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, was chosen as an in-between single until the release of the fourth album. Rage was part of the recording sessions for 60 Second Wipe Out, but Empire did not feel it would fit the album. On 6 September 2001, Crack, who had long struggled with psychiatric issues, died from an overdose of unspecified pills.Corey Moss, Atari Teenage Riot Cofounder Dead At 30, MTV, 24 September 2001, retrieved 13 March 2007. The media hype surrounding Crack's death is disputed by ATR. According to a friend, he had spoken a few weeks before his death about a doctor's report which said his psychosis attacks would worsen with age. According to that friend, Crack said he would rather kill himself than become a \\"zombie\\" and not be in control of his life. Witnesses have said Crack tried to reach out to his friends because he felt the psychosis starting again. When his body was found by police with large quantities of medication in his stomach, this suggested suicide. It is still unclear if this happened while he was in a state of psychosis or not (while in a psychotic state, it could be interpreted as an accident rather than suicide). The other half of the band continue to work together. Endo assisted in the production of Empire's solo recordings, as well as being a key member of his live band. DHR released Atari Teenage Riot: 1992‚Äì2000, a collection of the band's best known recordings, on 3 July 2006. Reformation Hellfest 2013. In October 2009, Elias contacted Empire to play some concerts together, but had to refrain because of her voice.Interview with Alec Empire in the German newspaper \\"Der Tagesspiegel\\" on 7 September 2010 When it became clear that Elias would not show up to the first show, the band published a statement 30 minutes before show time. In January 2010, it was announced ATR would reunite for a few live shows in Europe. Later in the year, they announced additional shows in Europe, North America and Asia. In early March 2010, Empire released the new ATR track \\"Activate\\" via SoundCloud, which is the first song featuring their new MC, CX KiDTRONiK. Activate was recorded on 3 March 2010 in Berlin at the Hellish Vortex Studios. Female vocals were provided by Endo. The band played most major festivals throughout Europe in 2010, including Reading and Leeds, and headlined the Fusion Festival in front of approximately 20,000 people (which led to a massive stage invasion by thousands of fans). In the same year, ATR headlined a stage at Japan's Summersonic Festival, returning the following year to play at Fuji Rock Festival. Another triumph was the band's headline slot on the electronic stage at the Berlin Festival, which is held at an old military airport in the centre of the city. These live shows were perceived as better and more energetic by critics and fans than shows during the 1990s. Enthused, the band decided to add more dates. The live line-up of ATR, , consisted of Empire, Endo and CX KiDTRONiK. On 12 October 2010, Steve Aoki and Dim Mak Records announced the release of Atari Teenage Riot's new single \\"Activate\\", with the full-length album Is This Hyperreal? released in 2011. While the record was described as \\"redundant\\" by Pitchfork Media, in what Empire called \\"probably one of the dumbest reviews I‚Äôve ever read about any record.\\", other magazines gave it great reviews. New Musical Express wrote:\\"\\"Few bands have ever detonated as powerfully in the underground as Atari Teenage Riot. Put simply, they were the conscience of electronic music. They were a band that sounded the way you always wanted The Prodigy to sound. A band akin to Black Flag if that outfit had existed in an age where every home had a computer. And their influence burned big and bright\\". Artrocker Magazine put them on the cover in their May 2011 issue and wrote:\\"\\"Make no mistake, 'Activate' is the most exhilarating, futuristic and punk rock single of the month. (...) ATR aren't like any other band. They're the only group that could have cut a record with Rage Against the Machine and have it be their meekest recording. They're the only group that iTunes have censored on the grounds that their music could create riots! Ten years and several line-up changes makes no difference to tonight's immediate onslaught of rave, punk, screaming and pounding gabba. The finale consists of the fiercest white noise squall of the evening, and the audience's reaction (moshing, screaming, crowdsurfing, shoes flying through the air) seems to indicate they don't care either\\". That month the band headlined the Bang Face Weekender festival in the UK. Their album Is This Hyperreal? was celebrated as \\"the ultimate protest album of the google age,\\" dealing with WikiLeaks, Anonymous, hackers, the freedom the internet brought to the suppressed, censorship, the surveillance state, cyber terrorism and digital decay, a term which describes the disaffected masses abandoning the internet when they realised that it was not free but infested with government controls. The campaign for Is This Hyperreal? took an interesting turn when the Black Flags viral video was taken up by Anonymous whose members and supporters sent in clips from the Occupy Wall Street protests last autumn. Remixes, mash ups and alternate versions created by fans to represent their own dissatisfaction proliferated and captured the mood so accurately it was played in a CNN broadcast to summarise the zeitgeist behind Anonymous' cyber attacks. In December ATR got the news that WikiLeaks could provide exclusive footage from Julian Assange speaking at Occupy London. Boing Boing blog and Dangerous Minds were calling it the first anthem of the Occupy movement. Dangerous Minds: \\"While personally I would have thought it would be a new act to break through representing a new generation, no-one can doubt ATR‚Äôs credentials when it comes to this kind of thing. In fact, maybe in this age of ultra-commodified music it would HAVE to take a more veteran, established act to represent OWS and Anonymous so as to avoid claims of false appropriation? You have to hand it to ATR though; \\"Black Flags\\" is a pretty great tune. I'd say it's one of their most accessible yet while retaining all that dark techno-punk scuzzy energy we know and love.\\" In Spring 2012 the music video for \\"Black Flags\\" was nominated for the MTV O Music Awards in the US in the category \\"Best Protest Song of the Year\\".

In the case of Pantego, no Independent School District was ever established. The proximity of the already established Arlington ISD led to the entirety of Pantego being served by the AISD since the middle of the 20th century.

The population was 17,851 in 2019. History The city got its name because it was the lone settlement of White colonizers amid several Native American villages in the Fort Worth area in the Texas Republic territory in the 1840s. On October 14, 2005, city leaders, citing hurdles in attracting businesses, announced a plan to have local voters decide on a possible name change for the town from White Settlement to West Settlement. In the November 8 election, the name change was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of 2,388 to 219. The oldest street in White Settlement is White Settlement Road. This original trail led from the fort to the \\"white settlement\\" about eight miles west into Native American territory. The area was called \\"White\\" because it was a settlement of White homesteaders, as opposed to other settlements in the vicinity that were composed of both White and Native American residents. As the Native Americans were forced from the area and the settlement moved westward, the road followed. This was the only public road in White Settlement's early history. Two members of the city's West Freeway Church of Christ were killed by a gunman on December 29, 2019, during a morning service. The shooter was in turn killed by a church member, Jack Wilson, who shot him in the head. Wilson is a firearms instructor and a former reserve deputy sheriff, who is on the church's volunteer security team. Geography White Settlement is located at (32.759280, -97.460442).

It is part of the Abilene, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 464 at the 2010 census. It is the former county seat of Taylor County, having been supplanted in 1883 by the much larger Abilene to its north. Abilene won the referendum to be the county seat by a vote of 905-269. Buffalo Gap was settled at the site of a natural pass through which bison herds traveled. It was a point on the Great Western Cattle Trail. The community has a few restaurants and art handicraft shops and caters to tourists.Texas Transportation Commission, Texas State Travel Guide, 2007, p. 113 Buffalo Gap is the home of the large Buffalo Gap Historic Village, open year-round to visitors. History Buffalo Gap is located at the intersection of Farm-to- Market roads 89 and 1235. It was established in 1857 and procured a post office in 1878. The Callahan Divide, a topographic boundary between the Brazos and Colorado river basins, crosses Buffalo Gap from east to west. Elm Creek once provided a watering hole for buffalo. The Buffalo Gap Highway (Farm Road 89) was surveyed in 1874 and followed the old Center Line Trail, which extended from El Paso to Texarkana on the Texas-Arkansas boundary.Handbook of Texas Online, Susan J. Nix, \\"BUFFALO GAP, TX\\" Another major road passed through Buffalo Gap in the direction of the abandoned Fort Phantom Hill north of Abilene. The road forked at Buffalo Gap; one branch led southwest to Pecos County, and the other south to Tom Green County, which includes the county seat of San Angelo. Taylor County history centered upon the gap in the Callahan Divide, where during the 1860s and 1870s, buffalo hunters made winter camp and transported their hides to Fort Griffin northeast of Abilene. On April 30, 1874, then-Lieutenant Governor Richard B. Hubbard, through his role as the acting Texas secretary of state, approved the selection of Buffalo Gap as the temporary Taylor County seat. In July, the county judge, sheriff, clerk, and county commissioners first met. A general election was held for the first time with eighty-seven male voters. By 1880, Buffalo Gap had 200 people, a drugstore, carriage and blacksmith shop, large hotel, jail, several grocery stores, and a saloon. Presbyterians established the former Buffalo Gap College, which operated as an institution of higher education from 1885 until 1902, when its charter lapsed and enrollment declined. For a time, Buffalo Gap considered itself the \\"Athens of the West\\". The Baptist Church at Buffalo Gap is the oldest of its denomination in Taylor County. In the middle 19th century, Marshall G. Jenkins began a weekly newspaper, the Buffalo Gap Live Oak. A decade later it became the Buffalo Gap Messenger. Abilene petitioned to become the seat of Taylor County when the Texas and Pacific Railway established its headquarters there. By 1892, Buffalo Gap had decreased in population to 600. In addition to Presbyterian and Baptist churches, there were Methodist, Christian, and Episcopal congregations, as well as a newspaper, sixteen businesses, and a high school in the town. In 1914, the population declined to three hundred, and the number of businesses dropped to seven. In the 1920s, an \\"Old Settlers\\" picnic was particularly well attended, as residents showed their civic-mindedness and nostalgia for the bygone era. Between 1925 and 1980 the population fluctuated between 250 and 400 and the number of businesses between two and twelve. In the 1930s, Buffalo Gap had five churches, a park, and farms and habitations along major roads. In 1959, the Ernie Wilson Museum of the Old West, named for its benefactor, Ernest \\"Ernie\\" Wilson, a Buffalo Gap lawyer, opened its doors. The town jail, displayed at the museum, is made of limestone, with sandstone blocks concave in the center and mortared together with cannonballs to reduce the possibility of a prisoner escaping. The jail is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The town noted in the 1960s and 1970s for its restaurants and the fact that it was one of two \\"wet\\" spots in Taylor County where alcoholic beverages could be sold. Deutschlander Freshwater Catfish Company and the Bar B Q Barn still operate today. In 2019, Buffalo Gap recorded a population of 463, eleven businesses, Church of Christ and Baptist churches.

Floyd Earl In 1959, Buffalo Gap incorporated itself as a town in order to establish a municipal water system. The aldermen appointed a part-time city marshal, who began to enforce speed limits. The marshal's salary was based on a percent of the fines collected. When citizens rose up in opposition at the strict enforcement, the marshal resigned. Two more marshals came and went before Mayor C. P. Hendrix retained Floyd Earl, a Buffalo Gap native who described his position, accordingly: \\"I felt like I was just volunteering for military service.\\" Without a uniform or a police car, the new marshal pointed his flashlight, shouted frantically at speeders, and shot at them when they failed to stop, although he apparently never hit anyone. When some local men threatened to run Earl out of Buffalo Gap, he grabbed the ringleader and vowed to pistol-whip him if he talked back to the law. When citizens tried to remove Earl, the mayor and aldermen sided with the hard- pressed marshal. Earl collected few fines and faced multiple threats to his authority. \\"They threatened to kill me Saturday night. At least three times they've tried to run me over when I was on foot. I'll tell you, the only way I'm going to leave is if the town fires me, or if they carry me out to the family plot and bury me.\\" The plight of Marshal Floyd Earl was covered in Time Magazine in 1960.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2), all of it land. History The area that became known as Impact began as a poultry farm owned by advertising businessman Dallas Perkins. Prior to 1960, liquor sales were prohibited in all cities and counties surrounding Abilene.Beer and Impact, Texas ‚Äì AllBusiness.com. The prohibition of legal liquor sales encouraged bootleggers to produce illegal liquor commonly called \\"moonshine\\". Perkins capitalized on the potential market for legal liquor among the wets by purchasing 27 acres of land adjacent to his farm on the outskirts of Abilene and then pushing for its incorporation.Impact, Texas ‚Äì Texas Escapes Online Magazine. Calling the village \\"Impact\\" after his advertising business, 29 signatures of local residents were collected and it was incorporated in 1960.Impact, Texas ‚Äì Handbook of Texas. Soon after, the village's citizens - consisting mostly of Perkins' family and friends - voted 18 to 2 to permit liquor sales. Abilene lawyers immediately filed motions to oppose the town's incorporation, but a Texas Supreme Court ruling in 1963 upheld Impact's incorporation and its right to sell liquor. Two liquor stores opened in Impact in 1963. The first month's sales were $463,000 (equivalent to roughly $3.5 million in 2012). With the newfound revenues, the village's roads were paved and lighted, garbage pickup was introduced, and a policeman was hired. One of the liquor stores was Pinky's, which was owned by Perkins and his associates and used a logo of a pink elephant, thus the name.Bottled-up liquor sentiments enliven the history of Abilene ‚Äì Abilene Reporter-News, July 26, 2001. Impact remained the only wholly wet municipality in Taylor County until 1978, when Abilene voters narrowly legalized (by a 131-vote margin) liquor sales in the city.

Biography Around 1992 Crack, displayed little interest in the music scene as it was at the time. He felt that The Beatnigs (the original vehicle for social and political critic Michael Franti, later of the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and Spearhead) were one of the few significant bands around. Along with the other members of Atari Teenage Riot he was looking for a new direction. Crack initially had a significant influence on ATR's style, particularly on the first two albums where he developed an MC style which owed less to the U.S. than his own imagination. He also had his own musical ideas that could not be expressed within the confines of a group, leading to his only solo release, Black Ark, in 1998. It is, as the name suggests, heavily influenced by dub and in particular Lee Perry. After heavy touring to promote ATR's third album, 60 Second Wipe Out, the members of the group commenced work on follow ups to their various solo projects. Crack appeared on Cobra Killer's 2002 album, The Third Armpit.

The population was 837 at the 2010 census. Sanderson was created in 1882 as a part of neighboring Pecos County. It became the seat of Terrell County in 1905. History Sanderson was founded in 1882. It was a division point for the Southern Pacific Railroad, where refueling and crew changes on its main transcontinental route took place. Mohair and wool production on surrounding ranches formed a significant part of the economy. The community entered in an economic decline when the operations involving sheep and goats decreased. A devastating flood in June, 1965 killed 26 people and washed away homes and businesses near the usually dry Sanderson Creek. Since then, many flood-control dams have been erected across the arroyos upstream from the town.Swanya Howell Pitts, \\"SANDERSON, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online An illustrated tour brochure guides visitors past 50 historic sites,Terrell County~Cactus Capital of Texas including several notable buildings remaining from the town's more prosperous era.

Its population was 9,657 at the 2010 census. Located 39 miles southwest of Lubbock, it is the county seat of Terry County. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, Brownfield has a total area of , 0.32% of which is covered by water. Brownfield lies in the center of Terry County, within the southern portion of the South Plains and Llano Estacado. The city rests on a windblown deposit called the Blackwater Draw Formation, which is underlain by a thick layer of caliche, referred to locally as the \\"Caprock\\". Beneath the caliche layer lies fluvial deposits called the Ogallala Formation, which contains a portion of the vast Ogallala Aquifer. The Caprock Escarpment, about 50 miles east, forms a rather precipitous drop of about and exposes various geologic layers. In early days, climbing the Caprock Escarpment was not easy for horse- drawn covered wagons. The only terrain variation lies at the south end of the city, where Lost Draw carves a channel that runs across the entire county. Lost Draw formed over 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age, when the climate of the area was much wetter. When the vast glaciers of the north retreated, they left numerous dry river channels crisscrossing the Llano Estacado. When settlers during the 1800s ventured across this area, they often went into these channels expecting to find water, but unless significant rains had occurred recently, their search was in vain, with many of the parties becoming \\"lost\\", hence the name, Lost Draw. The most notable geographic feature of Brownfield remains its red soil. The soil creates an almost iridescent red color during sunrise and sunset due to the high iron oxide content. Climate Brownfield lies in a semiarid temperate zone, where high winds and extreme temperature variations are the norm. The summers reach over for multiple consecutive days. The winters often fall below freezing for extended periods, but snow remains unusual due to very little precipitation forming in the winter. The most significant time of the year for weather events starts in March and runs through September, when severe thunderstorms form on the Great Plains. Rain, winds, hail, and a few tornadoes are to be expected at this time of year. Late thunderstorms that produce hail are significantly harmful to the local economy, as it destroys the local cotton crop. Economics Cotton farming remains the backbone of not only Brownfield, but also the entire South Plains in general. Cotton fields stretch for miles, and the harvest season in October has a frenzy of activity as harvesters (locally called cotton strippers), module makers, and module trucks are seen all over the county. A significant haze also develops over the city as the local cotton gins go to work stripping the cotton from the burr, separating the seeds, and then compressing the cotton into 500-lb bales. The haze is actually fine cotton dust, and sometimes small drifts develop in the street resembling snow mixed with red soil. Peanut growing has found a toehold on the economy, as have vineyards. In recent years, grape growing has shown Terry County as a producer of wine grapes as filler for inexpensive wines. Currently, several wineries are now established in the county, which produce average- to poor- quality wine based on numerous reviews and wine review aggregator websites.https://www.vivino.com/search/wines?q=terry+county (Vivino wines of average quality rate at least a 4.0 aggregate)https://www.winemag.com/?s=high%20plains&drink;_type=wine&page;=1&search;_type=reviews (Wine Enthusiast rankings of wine for 90 points and below as average, and 86 and below as poor) Several older and more notable wineries are in the Lubbock area, about 30 miles northeast.

It has hot, dry summers and cold, dry winters. The creek bottoms have huge pecan trees, hackberry, willow, \\"china berry\\", \\"chitelm\\", elm, cottonwood, and wild plums of several kinds, as well as many other trees of various types occurring at times (bois d'arc and mulberry are seen). The ground along creeks may be covered in green briars, poison ivy, or oak, and Virginia creeper grows high into the trees in places. The land, as a whole, is a patchwork of mesquite, and farm fields dotted with old oil wells. It is home to white-tailed deer, wild turkey, cotton-tailed and jack rabbits, feral hogs, bobcats, raccoons, opossums, rattlesnakes, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, armadillos, coyotes, and occasionally a badger, beaver, fox, mountain lion, and even javalina is seen. Song birds and others thrive. Many small animals dwell there, such as fox squirrels, hispid cotton rats, soft-shelled turtles, and others too numerous to mention. Large yellow catfish live in the slow-moving rivers or in the local lake and stock tanks (ponds), along with many other fish such as channel catfish, large-mouthed bass, crappie, gar, carp, buffalo fish, drum, bream, and goggle-eyed sun perch. Red-horse minnows, top-water minnows, and a species locally known as bull-head minnows live in the ponds and thrive in the rippling shallows of the river and creeks. History The area was initially settled in 1875 by J.O. Wood and Henry McClintick. Wood's son, O.J. Wood, played a leading role in the shaping of the community and its economics. Woodson was originally called Jom, when it was established around a cotton gin built so that the ranchers could get cottonseed to feed to cattle. After Jom was established, O.J. Wood deeded lots measuring 100 by 190 ft (30 by 58 m) to anyone who would build a residence there, free of charge. This caused businesses to start popping up, as a post office and Wood and Sons grocery were established. Woodson has a few notable landmarks, such as the school and the First Christian Church. Since J.O. Wood and his son built the first schoolhouse in town, the town was decided to be called Wood and Son, to honor the two. Throughout time, it was changed to Woodson, which has become the official name. Woodson eventually became a booming town, with an official start date in 1903. The first highway to Breckenridge was built in 1920. Wood and his son also reportedly built the First Christian Church, located in the center of town on Highway 183, in the 1900s. When the original schoolhouse grew too small to hold all of Woodson's students, the First Christian Church was used as an additional educational space. Another result of the increase in people was the building of a railroad that came through Woodson. According to Big Country: People, Events and Places, Volume V, the line was owned and operated by the Texas and Pacific Railroad. The land for the right-of-way was obtained in three ways; some was bought outright from the owners. If the owners refused to sell, the Texas and Pacific took it by easement. Some landowners gave the land for the right-of-way; for instance, the Dickie family gave land through the East Woods to the company. Local men helped build the roadbed and lay the tracks. Once the train was built, it made one run from Cisco to Throckmorton each day. Due to the railroad and the oil-field boom, Woodson grew for a long time. The town had three gasoline service stations, two cotton gins, two barber shops, and a lumber yard. T Downtown Woodson has seen many changes over the years - and it is still growing. At one point, Woodson also had a movie theater (next to the Woodson Inn), a Chevrolet dealer, a drugstore, and a feed store, next to which a local physician, Doctor Turner, ran a practice. Woodson originally received its water from the city lake (south of town, on Highway 183, which is now known as Dickie Lake).  1948 tornado  When a tornado hit Woodson in 1948, the population had decreased to 500. Still, 32 houses were destroyed.Big Country: People, Events and Places, Volume V.  Japanese balloon bomb  On March 23, 1945, a rancher on the Barney Davis Ranch, 8 miles north of Woodson, Ivan Miller, found a balloon bomb in his field. The war in Europe was coming to an end, so attention was turned to finishing the job against the Japanese in the Pacific. However, the balloons obviously failed, as one ended up in a local field and the other was in Eastland County's Desdemona. Japan released over 9,000 hydrogen-filled balloons with antipersonnel and incendiary ordnance attached, and released them in the jetstream. Miller's widow recalled later that he described the balloon to be \\"as big around as a house,\\" with a large rising sun painted on its top and several smaller versions around the bottom. About 360 bombs were eventually found in North America, though government officials requested that all pieces be returned.  Surrounding communities  When Woodson was at its peak population, it had \\"suburbs\\" of sorts - surrounding communities with their own families, businesses, and school, which all eventually consolidated into Woodson ISD in the late 1930s. Woodson's water tower can be seen for miles outside of town. * Titus: located west of town at the corner of Highway 209 and FM 2850 * Lusk: located south of town * Masters: located north of town off of FM 1710 * Sunshine * Hustuttle: located off of the Crystal Falls highway, past the turn to Eliasville * Whiz Bang: Around 1930, a small boom town appeared near Woodson, on the road from Woodson to Masters (now 1710) Now, only a few crumbled cement blocks of the refinery remain. Demographics From 1920 to 1930, Woodson's population was at an all-time high, with a count of 2,800 people. Due to surrounding areas growing, Woodson has since decreased in size. In 1948, the population was down to about 500 people. Though Woodson's population once grew to 2,800, it has recently stayed between 250 and 300. As of the census of 2010, 264 people lived in the town, a decrease of 10.81% since 2000 (32 people). The racial makeup of the town was 92.80% White, 2.65% African American, 3.41% from other races, and 1.14% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 15.91% of the population. In 2014, the population was estimated to be 258. Education Public education is provided by the Woodson Independent School District. WISD is home of the Woodson Cowboys and Cowgirls, and the school colors are black and gold. The school motto is \\"Be The Best You Can Be\\". Woodson ISD is home of the Woodson Cowboys and Cowgirls. Prekindergarten through 12th grade can attend WISD, and as of 2016, 149 students were in school, with 29 faculty and staff members. Despite the small numbers, Woodson offers many extracurricular activities, such as: * Junior and high school basketball * Junior and high school volleyball * Junior and high school football * Junior and high school track and cross country * Junior and high school cheerleading * Tennis * Golf * FFA * National Honor Society * One Act Play * UIL academic events * School newspaper * Robotics  Sources of income  Farming and ranching were the main sources of income until 1923, when the first oil well was completed. In 1925, the Stubblefield #1 well drilled by the Texas Oil Company (Texaco) came in; it has since produced more than 1,000,000 barrels (160,000 m3) from that one well and in 2010 was still producing. This set off a local drilling boom, and Texaco even built a refinery north of Woodson, in Whiz Bang. Besides working the land and in the oil field, residents of Woodson can find employment through Woodson ISD, BJB Transport, and the Jones Trailer Company.

The population was 524 at the 2010 census. History Winfield's storied and colorful history includes (in addition to railroad operations) coal mining, brick and pottery manufacturing, and the famous Winfield Truck Stop. When the Texas and St. Louis Railway was being constructed through western Titus County in 1880, the citizens of Gray Rock, on the western boundary of the county, were asked to donate money and land to the company for routing the road through their community. When the merchants refused to cooperate, W. C. Barrett deeded a portion of his land a mile northeast of Gray Rock to railroad officials for a depot, and the road was built north of Gray Rock. At its earliest stages the community that began to emerge around the depot was called Barrett, but when the post office was opened there in 1887 with Patrick H. Carr as postmaster, the village was called Carr. In 1892 the name was changed to Winfield, in honor of the general passenger agent for the railroad, W. H. Winfield. In 1890 the population was reported at forty-seven. By 1896 the town had three churches, several stores, a pottery operated by J. S. Hogue, and a population estimated at 150. During the early years of the twentieth century, the town experienced its greatest period of growth. By 1914 it had a brick company, a newspaper, numerous stores and gins, two banks, and a population estimated at 700. The two banks merged in 1919, and the resulting bank closed in the early 1920s. By 1925 the population of Winfield had declined to 629, and by the 1940s it was 350. The town was incorporated in the 1940s and maintained a relatively stable population for several decades. In 1980 residents numbered 349, and in 1982 the town had five rated businesses. In 1990 the population was 345.

The population was 504 at the 2010 census. It is part of the San Angelo, Texas, metropolitan statistical area. Geography Christoval is located at (31.197614, -100.493296). It is situated about 20 miles south of San Angelo in southern Tom Green County around the area of Loop 110, U.S. Highway 277, and RM 2084. According to the United States Census Bureau in 2000, the CDP has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km), all land. Prior to the 2010 census, the CDP gained area, increasing to a total area of , all land. The South Concho River runs through Christoval, and serves as a water supply to the surrounding area. It was the location of a resort from the 1930s to the early 1960s, near where U.S. 277 crosses the river. History The community, which has also been known as South Concho and Delong, is said to be named after early settler Christopher Columbus Doty. A post office was established in 1889 and a local school was operating by 1901. By 1914, Christoval had an estimated population of 200, two general stores, and a newspaper ‚Äì the Christoval Observer. Through the 1930s, a Baptist encampment was held annually that attracted as many as 10,000 persons to the South Concho River area, and the mineral waters in nearby Christoval also attracted visitors and settlers. On September 17, 1936, a devastating flood hit the South Concho River. The flood destroyed the Baptist encampment facility, and parts of Christoval. Several people were killed in the flood, as they were swept away by the rapidly rising water. Following the flood, the encampment facilities were never rebuilt, and the property eventually became a public park. Playland Park was a popular local attraction from the 1950s through the 1980s. The park offered public access to the river, as well as boat rentals, a rope bridge, tree swings, and a concession stand. At its peak in the 1970s, the facility had amusement park rides and a small train. The facility was closed in the 1980s due to liability concerns and smaller crowds. Today, Pugh River Park and the historic, low-water river crossing on Loop 110 offer public access to the South Concho River. The population peaked at around 500 in the 1930s before declining to about 400 in the mid-1950s and 200 by the mid-1970s. The rerouting of U.S. Highway 277 in 1987 was expected to bring a further decline, but the population was not significantly impacted by the change. In 2000, 29 businesses were operating in Christoval.History of Christoval in the Handbook of Texas accessdate = 2015-01-01 Christoval is the hometown of Jack Pardee, a former American football linebacker and the only head coach to lead teams in college football, the NFL, the United States Football League, and the Canadian Football League. Mr. Pardee was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986. He was an All-American linebacker at Texas A&M; University and a two-time All-Pro with the Los Angeles Rams (1963) and the Washington Redskins (1971). Christoval is also hometown to reality TV personality Colby Donaldson, who appeared in several seasons of the CBS show Survivor. Local attractions Swimmers at Pugh River Park The South Concho River runs through Christoval, and around three-quarters of a mile of riverfront is part of a public park. The shoreline in this area is covered by large oak trees, and the trees have rope swings for visitors. This park, known as Pugh River Park, has visitors from across West Texas each weekend. Crowds over 500 people are not uncommon on the weekends in the summer. Public access to the South Concho River is also available at the Mineral Wells crossing, about a mile north of Christoval. Each Memorial Day weekend, the community of Christoval holds Old Toenail Trail days, which attracts visitors from around the region. Festivities include live music, parades, and food and craft vendors. The Christoval Winery, opened in 2010, serves as a gathering place for local meetings, and hosts a chapel catering weddings and parties on the scenic land along the South Concho River. The wine-tasting room is open to the general public. Demographics As of the census of 2000, 422 people, 167 households, and 124 families resided in the CDP.

He had received the highest decoration in France, the Legion of Honour, when he visited the 1881 International Exposition of Electricity, Paris. The exhibition included displays of his inventions, and the city was lit with his electric lighting. Early life Joseph Wilson Swan was born in 1828 at Pallion Hall in Pallion, in the Parish of Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, County Durham. His parents were John Swan and Isabella Cameron.Davidson, Michael W. and The Florida State University. \\"Molecular expressions. Science, optics and you. Pioneers in optics. Joseph Swan (1828‚Äì1914).\\" Last modification 26 February 2004. Retrieved 16 November 2009 Swan was apprenticed for six years to a Sunderland firm of druggists, Hudson and Osbaldiston. However, it is not known if Swan completed his six-year apprenticeship, as both partners subsequently died. He was said to have had an enquiring mind, even as a child. He augmented his education with a fascination of his surroundings, the industry of the area, and reading at Sunderland Library. He attended lectures at the Sunderland Atheneum. Swan subsequently joined Mawson's, a firm of manufacturing chemists in Newcastle upon Tyne, started in the year of Swan's birth by John Mawson (9 September 1819 ‚Äì 17 December 1867), the husband of his sister, Elizabeth Swan (22 November 1822 ‚Äì 2 August 1905). In 1846, Swan was offered a partnership at Mawson's. This company subsequently existed as Mawson, Swan and Morgan until 1973, formerly located on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne, near Grey's Monument. The premises, now occupied by burger chain restaurant Byron, can be identified by a line of Victorian-style electric street lamps in front of the store on Grey Street. Swan lived at Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, a large house on Kells Lane North, where he conducted most of his experiments in the large conservatory.Newton, Douglas (1978) New Scientist, 26 October 1978 Retrieved 30 December 2010 The house was later converted into a private fee paying, grant aided co-educational grammar school named Beaconsfield School.Electrical times, Volume 145 p. 220. Retrieved 30 December 2010 Here, students could still find examples of Swan's original electrical fittings. Electric light Carbon filament lamp (E27 socket, 220 volts, approx. 30 watts, left side: running with 100 volts) In 1850, Swan began working on a light bulb using carbonised paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device, but the lack of a good vacuum, and an adequate electric source, resulted in an inefficient light bulb with a short lifetime. In August 1863 he presented his own design for a vacuum pump to a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The design used mercury falling through a tube to trap air from the system to be evacuated. Swan's design was similar in construction to the Sprengel pump and predates Herman Sprengel's research by two years. Furthermore, it is notable that Sprengel conducted his research while visiting London, and would likely be aware of the annual reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Nonetheless, Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison are later reported to have used the Sprengel pump to evacuate their carbon filament lamps. In 1875, Swan returned to consider the problem of the light bulb with the aid of a better vacuum and a carbonised thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. However, his filament had low resistance, thus needing heavy copper wires to supply it. Swan first publicly demonstrated his incandescent carbon lamp at a lecture for the Newcastle upon Tyne Chemical Society on 18 December 1878. However, after burning with a bright light for some minutes in his laboratory, the lamp broke down due to excessive current. On 17 January 1879, this lecture was successfully repeated with the lamp shown in actual operation; Swan had solved the problem of incandescent electric lighting by means of a vacuum lamp. On 3 February 1879, he publicly demonstrated a working lamp to an audience of over seven hundred people in the lecture theatre of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, Sir William Armstrong of Cragside presiding. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament, and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce \\"parchmentised thread\\", and obtained British Patent 4933 on 27 November 1880.Swan K. R.

Pickering & Chatto, 2008, p.107, accessed 30 November 2010 The builder of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte, explained why he had introduced Swan's electric light: \\"The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat.\\"\\"Richard D'Oyly Carte\\" , at the Lyric Opera San Diego website, June 2009 The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped onstage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of Swan's new technology. On 29 December 1881, The Times described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight.Description of lightbulb experiment in The Times, 29 December 1881 The first private residence, other than the inventor's, lit by the new incandescent lamp was that of his friend, Sir William Armstrong at Cragside, near Rothbury, Northumberland. Swan personally supervised the installation there in December 1880. Swan had formed \\"The Swan Electric Light Company Ltd\\" with a factory at Benwell, Newcastle, and had established the first commercial manufacture of incandescent lightbulbs by the beginning of 1881. Swan's carbon rod lamp and carbon filament lamp, while functional, were still relatively impractical due to low resistance (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life. While searching for a better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881, he developed and patented a process for squeezing nitrocellulose through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan's cellulose filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process. The first ship to use Swan's invention was The City of Richmond, owned by the Inman Line. She was fitted with incandescent lamps in June 1881. The Royal Navy also introduced them to their ships soon after; with HMS Inflexible having the new lamps installed in the same year. An early employment in engineering was during the digging of the Severn Tunnel, where contractor Thomas Walker installed \\"20-candlepower lamps\\" in the temporary pilot tunnels. Swan was one of the early developers of the electric safety lamp for miners, exhibiting his first in Newcastle upon Tyne at the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers on 14 May 1881.Swan.

Whitten, Bessie Emrick Whitten, Handbook of American Business History: Manufacturing, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1990, pages 315-316 Swan's original lamp design, with its low resistance (the lamp could only be used in series) and short life span, was not suited for such an application. Swan's strong patents in Great Britain led, in 1883, to the two competing companies merging to exploit both Swan's and Edison's inventions, with the establishment of the Edison & Swan United Electric Light Company. Known commonly as \\"Ediswan\\", the company sold lamps made with a cellulose filament that Swan had invented in 1881, while the Edison Company continued using bamboo filaments outside of Britain. In 1892, General Electric (GE) began exploiting Swan's patents to produce cellulose filaments, until they were replaced in 1904 by a GE developed \\"General Electric Metallized\\" (GEM) baked cellulose filaments.Incandescent Lamps, History of the Incandescent Light (1802 ‚Äî today), EdisonTechCenter.org In 1886, Ediswan moved production to a former jute mill at Ponders End, North London.Pam, D.

This area, with nearby Brimsdown subsequently developed as a centre for the manufacture of thermionic valves, cathode ray tubes, etc., and nearby parts of Enfield became an important centre of the electronics industry for much of the 20th century. Ediswan became part of British Thomson-Houston and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in the late 1920s.Lewis J.(2001), London's Lea Valley: more secrets revealed, Phillimore, Photography Stone tablet of Sir Joseph Wilson Swan in Pilgrim Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, on former Electricity Board building When working with wet photographic plates, Swan noticed that heat increased the sensitivity of the silver bromide emulsion. By 1871, he had devised a method of using dry plates, and substituting nitrocellulose plastic for glass plates, thus initiating the age of convenience in photography. Eight years later, he patented bromide paper, developments of which are still used for black-and-white photographic prints. In 1864, Swan patented the transfer process for making carbon prints, a permanent photographic process. By adding the transfer step, Swan was able to easily make photographs with a full tonal range. Later life In 1894, Swan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), and in 1898 he was elected president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers; at the time, Swan was one of its three honorary members, the other two being Lord Kelvin and Henry Wilde. In September 1901, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from Durham University. He also served as president of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1901, and in 1903 he was chosen first president of the Faraday Society. In 1904, he was knighted, awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society.

History Grape Creek CDP is on Grape Creek just north of U.S. Highway 87 and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in north central Tom Green County. The area was populated as early as 1858, when the Butterfield Overland Mail established a Grape Creek station on the east bank of the east fork of Grape Creek near the present-day community. The community was founded before 1900. In 1901, the community had a school for 26 pupils and one teacher, and by 1934, it had three elementary schools and a high school. State highway maps in 1936 showed the school, a church, a nearby cemetery, and scattered dwellings in the community. By the 1980s, the Grape Creek-Pulliam School was in operation, and the area had become the site of a new subdivision known as Grape Creek Community.

Pecan Park (also known as Pecan Bottom) was officially turned into a public park after locals constantly maintained a rock dam in Sandy Creek. Jonestown is the last public boat ramp to close before Mansfield Dam. Reservations are available for the Large and Small pavilion and Oak Tree as well as several covered picnic tables. Fireman's Park, another City gem is located behind City Hall. With a permanent concrete stage and plenty of shade Fireman's is a perfect place for a music event or picnic. There is a large smoker pit and several tables there including a concession building which is also available to reserve. In addition, a waterfall and Canyonland's Trail connects Fireman's Park to Jones Brothers Park - a perfect nature walk. Although there were two in the 1980s, Jonestown currently has no open public pools as all of them have been filled in and turned into gardens.

In early 1962 three Houston business men associated with the Gulfmont Hotel Company‚ÄîG. Flint Sawtelle, John H. Crooker, Jr., and Lee Blocker‚Äîobtained a sixty-day option to purchase the land and plan a hotel and resort community. The name Lakeway was a natural sequel to Gulfmont's Fairway Motor Hotel in McAllen, Texas, so named because it overlooked the fairway of a golf course. Construction of the hotel began in October 1962 and the grand opening was July 12, 1963. Around the same time the Lakeway Land Company was formed with Flint Sawtelle as president, for the development of real estate.

The population was 749 at the 2010 census. It is surrounded on all sides by the city of Austin, therefore being an enclave. Geography Map of Sunset Valley Sunset Valley is located at (30.225631, -97.816133), 5 miles (8 km) southwest of downtown Austin. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.6 km2), all of it land. History The first land transaction in the area dates back to 1835, but it wasn't until the early 1950s that the community of Sunset Valley was developed. It was at that time that two brothers, Clarence and M.H. Flournoy purchased a large tract of land for a residential subdivision. The landscape, a wooded valley nestled among rolling hills on the western edge of Austin, inspired the name Sunset Valley. In September 1954, Sunset Valley was incorporated as a town and established a mayor/council form of government. Clinton Vilven became the first mayor of the newly incorporated community. About a month after incorporation, Sunset Valley experienced the first of a series of deannexations through the years as petitioners applied to deannex various tracts while the town annexed other tracts. During the 1960s, city services were developed, including the installation of natural gas lines and the paving of roads. The growth of nearby Austin began to impinge upon the boundaries of Sunset Valley in the 1970s, causing disputes over territory and jurisdiction. One example of this tense relationship occurred in 1970, when Sunset Valley residents objected to the Austin Independent School District's plans to build an athletic complex within the corporate limits of the city. A court would later rule in favor of Austin ISD's right to build the complex, which was completed in 1976. Sporadic disputes between the two cities would continue into the 1980s and 1990s. Sunset Valley's first city hall was completed in 1977 and a police department was established in 1979. By 1990, the population had grown to 327. A wastewater system was constructed in the early 1990s with a grant from the Texas Water Development Board. In 1998, Sunset Valley entered into an inter-local agreement with the city of Austin to provide firefighting services. The population rose to 365 by 2000, an 11.6 percent increase over the 1990 figure. In 2001, the U.S. Postal Service officially recognized Sunset Valley as a destination for mail delivery.

History Big Sandy is about southwest of Gilmer, Texas, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 80 and Texas State Highway 155 in Upshur County. It was established shortly after the American Civil War. The settlement was first known as Big Sandy Switch because a stretch of the Texas and Pacific Railroad was built through the area and eventually intersected with a narrow- gauge railroad called the Tyler Tap. A post office was followed by a newspaper, stores and churches. In 1926 the settlement was incorporated as Big Sandy, with a population of about 850. Worldwide Church of God During the 1950s, Big Sandy became linked to a religious movement that would greatly influence the community for four decades. Local resident Buck Hammer was a member of the Radio Church of God (which later became known as the Worldwide Church of God [WCG]), a California-based, Sabbatarian movement headed by radio evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong. Hammer donated a small parcel of land (less than 10 acres) to the church, which built a meeting hall and began holding annual church conventions there by the middle 1950s. The church in subsequent years bought hundreds more acres adjacent to the original site. Thousands of church members converged on Big Sandy and surrounding communities for the week-long Feast of Tabernacles each year, creating a significant economic impact. In the mid-1960s Armstrong developed more of the property and established a second campus of Ambassador College, the original campus of which continued to operate at the church's headquarters facility in Pasadena, California. The presence of the college, along with the annual convention operation, influenced hundreds of church members to relocate to Big Sandy and the surrounding area over the years. Although Ambassador ceased operations in 1997, many families once affiliated with it and the church chose to remain in the Big Sandy area. In March 2000, the campus was sold to the Green Family Trust (owner of Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.), which leased it to the Institute in Basic Life Principles.http://www.thejournal.org/issues/issue64/swan.html It was then developed as the International ALERT Academy, the home of the Air Land Emergency Resource Team (ALERT), a Christian program training young men in disaster relief and emergency services. The Academy also serves as a camp and conference center, and holds four-week summer programs for boys and girls. Needlecraft businesses In the late 1970s, local residents Jerry Gentry and Annie Potter began a mail-order business from their home in Big Sandy and called it Annie's Attic. The business grew rapidly into a multimillion-dollar enterprise, publishing magazines and catalogs for needlecraft enthusiasts. After the couple divorced in the early 1980s, Annie continued to preside over Annie's Attic, while Jerry launched a near-replicate business called The Needlecraft Shop, also in Big Sandy. By the 1990s, both businesses had been purchased in separate transactions by Dynamic Resource Group (DRG), a publishing company in Berne, Indiana. DRG management moved both companies' operations to Indiana. Before doing so it established a new company, Strategic Fulfillment Group (SFG), on the southwest edge of Big Sandy. SFG, which handles mailing and subscription fulfillment for DRG and other clients, is now Big Sandy's and Upshur County's largest employer. \\"Texas' Largest Manhunt\\" On July 10‚Äì11, 1986, more than 1,000 law enforcement officers responded to Big Sandy Chief of Police Richard Lingle's request for assistance after the convicted murderer Jerry \\"The Animal\\" McFadden escaped from the Upshur County jail. He took jailer Rosalie Williams, the wife of a Department of Public Safety trooper, as hostage.\\"A Town in Terror: How Jerry McFadden's 1986 Crime Spree Stole the Lives of Hawkins' Best and Brightest\\", Tyler Paper Lingle broadcast his call for help after Upshur County authorities were unable to track down McFadden and his hostage that evening. Responding officers securely cordoned off the city, leaving McFadden little chance of escape, and he was recaptured and returned to jail without a shot being fired. (Due to severe overcrowding in prisons, he had been paroled despite a past marked by violence, and committed additional crimes.) McFadden was executed in October 1999 for the murder of Suzanne Denise Harrison, a teen from nearby Hawkins. Sports The Big Sandy High School football team won three Texas Class B state championships, in consecutive years 1973-75. Although the state finals game in 1974 ended in a 0-0 tie (vs Celina), UIL granted both teams co- championships. In 2005, the Wildcats again reached the state 1-A finals, falling 21-20 to Stratford. The 1975 team set a then national record of 824 points scored in a season while posting a 14-0 record, a record which remained unbroken until 1994.https://www.nfhs.org/RecordBook/Record-book- result.aspx?CategoryId=23 The team included later notable NFL stars such as David Overstreet, a former running back for the Oklahoma Sooners and Miami Dolphins, and Lovie Smith, former head coach of the Chicago Bears.

History Originally part of the William Murray League, the area was first settled in the early 1850s by a group from Haywood County, Tennessee. They immediately started a church - \\"The Murray League Methodist Episcopal Church, South\\" as well as a school, the Murray League Institute. After the Civil War, rich iron ore deposits were discovered in the area and ore was mined sporadically from the 1860s through 1900. Around 1910, a commercial company led by Colonel L.P. Featherstone was formed to mine ore in the area. He persuaded the Santa Fe line to finance a rail link with Port Bolivar. Land for a new city was purchased and platted into streets and lots around 1911. The town was given the name Ore City and a post office was established soon after. By 1914, 30 miles of the line known as the Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railway had been built, connecting Ore City with Longview. The newly founded community had an estimated population of 400. Further construction on the railroad line was halted by the outbreak of World War I. Colonel Featherstone's company went into bankruptcy and the rail line was abandoned in 1927. Ore City survived and by 1936, around 500 people lived in the community. During World War II, the federal government built a steel plant 10 miles north of Ore City to mine the same ore that previously brought Colonel Featherstone to the area. The plant was completed just as the war ended and was sold to a Texas group as surplus property. They operated it as the Lone Star Steel Company. Ore City was incorporated in the early 1950s. At that time, the number of residents had fallen to 385. Growth resumed in the mid-1960s and by 1976, Ore City had a population of 900, with 34 businesses operating in the city.

The Texas legislature has declared McCamey \\"the Wind Energy Capital of Texas\\" because of the many wind farms that have been built in the area. Its history, however, is primarily that of an oil boomtown. McCamey: Wind Energy Capital of Texas Geography McCamey is located at (31.132300, -102.222106). The town is about 5 miles (8 km) east of the Pecos River along U.S. Route 67. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.2 km), all land. History McCamey is named for George B. McCamey, whose 1925 wildcat well brought about the oil boom in the region. He brought in a real estate developer from Corpus Christi, to lay out a townsite near the oil field and along the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway capable of housing 10,000 people. The town was initially a jumble of tents and frame shacks; order came slowly, replacing the lawlessness of the early boomtown environment. A post office was built in 1926, and the town was incorporated near the end of that year. In 1927, the McCamey Independent School District was formed, and an enterprising newspaperman printed the first issue of the Tri-County Record, the first town newspaper.McCamey, Texas, in the Handbook of Texas Online Water supply was a problem in the early years of McCamey, as the nearby water sources were not drinkable. Water came in by train from Alpine, almost away, at a cost of $1 a barrel. A potable water supply was found in a geologic unit only distant, and pipes were built to transport it to town in 1929.Upton County history from Handbook of Texas Online McCamey was the location of a Humble Oil Company Refinery, one of the first built in West Texas. Humble Oil & Refining Company was a corporate predecessor of Exxon Company. An early experiment by Shell Oil Company in massive oil storage in McCamey proved a failure; local oilmen built a reservoir to hold up to one million barrels of oil in an earthen tank, but the limestone formation underneath the tank cracked under the weight of the crude, allowing much of it to leak into the subsurface. The population of the town declined during the Great Depression along with the price of oil, and as the discovery of large oil fields elsewhere pulled workers away. In 1940, 2,600 people were in McCamey; in 1980, 2,436; and the 2000 census showed the population had shrunk to 1,805. In 1940, Texas oilman and industrialist Bill No√´l moved to McCamey, where he joined M. H. McWhirter of Monahans and J. B. Tubb of Crane County to establish the Trebol Oil Company. He worked 18-hour days as Trebol's tool pusher, pumper, and production supervisor. The company drilled 52 producing wells before it struck the first dry hole. No√´l was so occupied in the pursuits of the business that he claimed to have been unaware that he had become a millionaire until several years after the accumulation of his fortune.

Located within six miles of its namesake the Rio Grande, Del Rio is connected to Ciudad Acu√±a by the Lake Amistad Dam International Crossing and Del R√≠o ‚Äì Ciudad Acu√±a International Bridge. As of 2010, Del Rio had a population of 35,591. It is also home to Laughlin Air Force Base, the busiest pilot-training base in the United States Air Force. History The Spanish established a small settlement south of the Rio Grande in present-day Mexico, and some Spaniards settled on what became the United States side of the Rio Grande as early as the 18th century. Paula Losoya Taylor built the first hacienda in the area in 1862. U.S. development on the north shore of the Rio Grande did not begin until after the American Civil War. The San Felipe Springs, about east of the Rio Grande on the U.S. side of the border, produces of water a day. Developers acquired several thousand acres of land adjacent to the springs, and to San Felipe Creek formed by the springs, from the state of Texas in exchange for building a canal system to irrigate the area. The developers sold tracts of land surrounding the canals to recover their investment and show a profit. The initial investors (William C. Adams, John P. Grove, Donald Jackson, John Perry, Joseph Ney, Randolph Pafford, A. O. Strickland, and James H Taylor) formed the San Felipe Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Irrigation Company in 1868. The organization completed construction of a network of irrigation canals in 1871. Residents referred to the slowly developing town as San Felipe Del Rio because local lore said the name came from early Spanish explorers who offered a mass at the site on St. Philip's Day, 1635. In 1883, local residents requested a post office be established. The United States Postal Department shortened \\"San Felipe del Rio\\" to \\"Del Rio\\" to avoid confusion with San Felipe de Austin. In 1885, Val Verde County was organized and Del Rio became the county seat. The City of Del Rio was incorporated on November 15, 1911. The San Felipe community was started by the Arteaga family. Arteaga Street and Arteaga Park are named after them. Many historical artifacts from Del Rio, particularly from the 19th century, are preserved at the Whitehead Memorial Museum downtown. In 1930, the League of United Latin American Citizens brought a law suit against the school district, as it favored white American children and discriminated against Mexican Americans. The lawsuit came to known as Del Rio ISD v. Salvatierra. Del Rio is known as the American address of legendary Mexican radio stations XERA and XERF just over the U.S.-Mexico border in Ciudad Acu√±a; their 250,000-watt signals could be heard at night as far away as Canada. Legendary deejay Wolfman Jack operated XERF in the 1960s, using a Del Rio address to sell various products advertised on the station. Laughlin Air Force Base In 1942, the Army Air Corps opened Laughlin Field east of Del Rio, as a training base for the Martin B-26, but the base was deactivated in 1945. As the Cold War pressures built, along with new border-control issues, Laughlin Field was rebuilt and renamed Laughlin Air Force Base and was again used as a home for flight training. Laughlin plays a large part in the Del Rio community as the area's largest employer. Geography Val Verde Winery According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.24%, is covered by water. Del Rio lies on the northwestern edges of the Tamaulipan mezquital, also called the South Texas brush country. It is also near the southwestern corner of the Edwards Plateau, which is the western fringe of the famous, oak savanna-covered Texas Hill Country; that area is dotted with numerous small springs; one of these is the San Felipe Springs, which provides a constant flow of water to San Felipe Creek. The creek supplied fresh water for drinking and irrigation to early settlers of Del Rio, and the springs are still the town's water supply. The Del Rio region, west to about the Pecos River, has a mix of desert shrub and steppe vegetation, depending on soil type, with the gray-leafed cenizo (Leucophyllum spp.), several different acacias, cactuses, and grama grasses dominant members of local flora. The terrain is mostly level, but some areas are dissected with substantial canyons and drainages, though none of the upland areas is high or large enough to be considered a mountain. Climate The climate is semiarid in moisture and subtropical in temperature. Humidity is more often high than low, with periodic morning fog due to Gulf air masses moving northwest into the area. This gives Del Rio and adjacent areas the effect of being in a coastal dryland area, though the Gulf of Mexico is over away. Such humid periods alternate with periods of hot and dry desert air masses in the spring and fall, or cold and dry Great Plains air masses during winter. Moisture rarely lasts long enough for weather systems to react with it to create much precipitation, as happens more frequently to the north and east of the area; some exceptions occur during some autumn (tropical weather systems) and spring (stalled fronts to the north). During the spring season, as well occasionally during the fall season, severe thunderstorms often build on the Serranias Del Burro to the distant west of Del Rio. This is believed to occur due to the uplift of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico which is channeled along the Rio Grande River. In the event of an strong mid-to- upper troposphere trough positioned over the Desert Southwest, these severe thunderstorms can migrate off the higher terrain of the mountains and across the Rio Grande into the Ciudad Acu√±a and Del Rio area and cause significant damage when they impact populated areas. One of these storms caused several deaths in Ciudad Acu√±a on May 25, 2015, when a tornado destroyed several structures in the town. Del Rio itself was largely spared, but saw a massive hailstorm the following year on February 22, 2016, causing widespread damage, especially to Laughlin AFB. In April 2020, Del Rio was impacted by another hail storm resulting in several observations of up to 4-inch diameter hail stones, and two weeks later, was blasted by damaging winds recorded at . Both storms inflicted widespread damage across the city. Despite this, most of the severe storms across the region impact rural areas with little to no population and are routinely unreported. The Dry Line is often noticed near the Del Rio area during volatile weather seasons, and can lend additional support to severe weather activity in the region. Summers are long, hot, and frequently humid; winters vary between sunny, warm, cloudy, and cool weather, depending on the wind direction and jet stream location. Snow or freezing rain is rare, once about every 7‚Äì10 years, and such wintry precipitation does not last long enough to be of consequence. The coldest temperature recorded in Del Rio is on December 23, 1989, and the average window for freezing temperatures is December 2 to February 20. The most snowfall in a month is in January 1985, and that total is also the highest for any entire season. Since records began in 1905, the wettest calendar year has been 1914 with and the driest 1956 with only . The wettest single month has been August 1998 with 20.93 inches, of which a record fell on August 23 associated with the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley and brought widespread flooding through the city. This almost doubled the previous record daily rainfall of on June 13, 1935. The most days during a month with at least of rainfall has been 19 in May 2015. Typically, 41 days receive at least of rainfall, 13 days with at least , and five with rainfall totaling at least . During the winter from November to March, long periods normally pass with negligible rainfall: between October 1917 and March 1918, only of rain fell in 6 months and not one single day recorded as much as . Del Rio is home to a radiosonde launching site at Del Rio International Airport, where twice-daily weather balloons are launched to take atmospheric readings - once at 1200 UTC and once at 0000 UTC. An automated weather balloon launcher, controlled remotely by the National Weather Service replaced the federally contracted employees in early 2020. An Automated Surface Weather Observing System (ASOS) is also positioned at the airport and records the official climate data for Del Rio. The National Weather Service office in New Braunfels, Texas is responsible for the forecasting and warning of weather events in the Del Rio area, but this jurisdictional boundary does not extend across the border into Mexico.

Historic Canton Main Street banner Canton is the location of the Van Zandt County courthouse. A glimpse of Canton across the street from the courthouse Canton is a city in and the county seat of Van Zandt County in East Texas, United States. It is roughly east of Dallas, Texas. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 3,581. The city sustained severe damage on April 29, 2017, from several tornadoes, and two years later from another tornado that struck downtown on May 29, 2019.  History  Canton was surveyed as early as 1840 by a company of men under Dr. W. P. King. The community stands on the original survey of Jesse Stockwell, an early settler in the area. No settlement was made until 1850, when the town was laid out and named by settlers moving from Old Canton in Smith County, Texas. The first district courthouse at Canton opened in 1850, and a post office, the county's fourth, was established in that year. When the Texas and Pacific Railway was built across the county in 1872, it missed Canton by , and the citizens of Wills Point persuaded county officials to move the county seat there. In the resulting dispute in 1877, armed residents of Canton went to Wills Point to recover the records, and the county judge wired Governor Richard B. Hubbard for aid. The Texas Supreme Court finally decided in favor of Canton. Unwilling to use the railroad at Wills Point, Canton businessmen established Edgewood, to the northwest of town, and built an extension to the railroad at a siding formerly called Stevenson. Property for the town's first school, the Canton Academy, was acquired in 1853. Sid S. Johnson began publication of the Canton Weekly Times, the county's first newspaper, in 1860. A Grange was founded in 1876. By 1890, Canton had a population of 421, flour mills, sawmills, cotton gins, and a bank. Brick buildings were under construction by 1892, and a new brick courthouse was completed in 1894. Iron ore and anthracite coal were discovered in 1887 and 1891. By 1896, the town reached a population high of 800 and had several churches, a steam gristmill and gin, two weekly newspapers, three general stores, and two hotels, but the population had fallen back to 421 by 1904. Canton was incorporated in 1919, and elected a mayor and aldermen. Despite the Great Depression, development of the Van oilfield after 1929 brought further expansion. A Public Works Administration project in the 1930s had the completion of a new courthouse. In 1933, area schools registered 500 white and 28 black students. The population reached 715 in 1940, but dwindled again after 1949. In the 1950s, local business included a sweet-potato curing plant, an ice factory, a concrete-tile factory, lumberyards, and a cotton gin. Expansion of the Canton city limits doubled its territory in the 1960s. In 1970, the community had a municipal lake with recreational facilities, seven churches, a school, a bank, a library, a newspaper, and 86 businesses. The population doubled between 1960 and 1970 from roughly 1,000 to 2,000, and reached nearly 3,000 by 1990. The population was 3,292 in 2000. However, when the city council decided to recount the population, they found that the town had 5,100 residents instead of the previous census total of 3,292.

After apologizing to the people of Canton, South Dakota, Colbert called Canton, Texas, an \\"incorporated outhouse\\" and \\"one steaming pile of longhorn dung.\\" This jab at the Texas town had been predicted by Governor Sebelius at the end of her July 31, 2008 remarks.

Victoria was initially part of De Le√≥n's Colony, which had been founded that same year. By 1834, the town had a population of approximately 300. During the Texas Revolution, Guadalupe Victoria contributed soldiers and supplies to pro-revolutionary forces. However, after James Fannin was defeated by the Mexican army at the Battle of Coleto, the town was occupied by Mexican forces. After Santa Anna was defeated at the Battle of San Jacinto, the town's Mexican residents were driven out by Anglo settlers, who renamed it Victoria. In 1840, a Comanche raid on nearby Linnville killed many residents of the town. A cholera outbreak occurred in 1846. During the mid-19th century, the city developed a large population of European immigrants, particularly Germans. By the turn of the 20th century, Victoria was experiencing rapid population growth thanks to its position as a regional trade center. The city's advantageous proximity to Gulf Coast ports, the larger cities of San Antonio, Austin, and Corpus Christi, and prosperous industries in agriculture and petrochemicals solidified its prominence.

Numerous camps of instruction were established east of town along Clear Creek. Camp Hebert was established on the eastern bank of Clear Creek and south of the Washington Road. Camp Hebert was the earliest camp in the area, and served as the headquarters of the Post of Hempstead early in the war. Camp Groce CSA was established in spring 1862 on Liendo Plantation on the eastern bank of Clear Creek as a camp of instruction for Confederate infantry recruits. Originally named Camp Liendo, the name was changed to Camp Groce in honor of Leonard Waller Groce, the owner of Liendo Plantation, and the owner of over 100 slaves. A contract to construct the barracks at Camps Groce and Hebert was let in February 1862. Numerous Confederate infantry regiments were organized, trained, and equipped at Camps Groce and Hebert. In spring 1862, the camps were abandoned due to their sickly locations. Camp Groce was reused as a military camp until spring 1863, but was again abandoned. From 1861 to 1863, nearly 200 Confederate soldiers fell sick at Camps Groce and Hebert and died. Many were taken to the Post Hospital in the Planter's Exchange Hotel located at the southwest corner of 12th and Wilkins Streets in downtown Hempstead. Many died in the hospital and almost all of them are buried on McDade Plantation west of town, which became the hospital cemetery. =1863= In June 1863, Camp Groce was re-opened as a prison camp for Union prisoners captured in the Battles of Galveston (January 1, 1863) and Sabine Pass I (January 21, 1863). The Union prisoners of war taken at the Battle of Sabine Pass II (September 8, 1863) were also sent to Camp Groce. 427 Union prisoners were held at Camp Groce in 1863 and 21 died. Most of the dead were buried northeast of camp where most of them still rest today. =1864= Camp Groce was re-opened in May 1864 for 148 Union prisoners captured at the battle of Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana. The group of prisoners included the crew of the USS Granite City and USS Wave, Tinclad #45, and 37 soldiers. About 40 soldiers from the 1st Texas US Cavalry were sent to Camp Groce in June 1864, and 506 more Union prisoners were transferred to Camp Groce from Camp Ford in August 1864. Yellow fever and other diseases affected the prisoners. They were moved to Camp Gillespie near Bellville in late September 1864 and then to Camp Felder, 6.5 miles north-northwest of Chappell Hill, Texas. 221 prisoners died or were missing from Camps Groce, Gillespie, and Felder in 1864. 444 were paroled in December 1864. 1863: 427 POWs, 21 died, 2 escaped 1864: 683 POWs, 147 died, 28 missing, 18 escaped, 13 deserted to the enemy, 14 status unknown, and 1 political prisoner held by CS authorities until released in May 1865. Totals: 1,110 POWs held, 168 died, 28 missing, 20 escaped, 13 deserted to the enemy, 14 status unknown At least 277 Confederate soldiers died or went missing in and around Hempstead, Texas during the Civil War. Most of the US and CS soldiers who died in and around Hempstead, Texas during the Civil War are still buried in the area. They are buried in 3 primary locations in and around Camp Groce and west of town on the old McDade Plantation Cemetery on Austin Branch Road near Sorsby Road. There is a Texas State Historical Marker there entitled \\"Union Army POW Cemetery,\\" but there are also numerous US Navy POWs buried there along with numerous Confederate soldiers who died in the hospitals in downtown Hempstead. Recently, a Waller County Historical Marker was placed within the boundaries of Camp Groce. It is located on the east side of FM 359 just south of Clear Creek. Entitled \\"Camp Groce Cemetery,\\" the marker commemorates the deaths and burial location of US prisoners of war and Confederate soldiers who died and were buried within the boundaries of Camp Groce. Also, the Washington County Historical Commission has placed a Texas State Historical Marker entitled, \\"Camp Felder\\" on the west side of FM 1155 north of Chappell Hill, Texas to commemorate Camp Felder CSA. =1865= About 8,000 Confederate soldiers from Walker's Division (commanded by Maj. Gen. John H. Forney) were ordered to Hempstead from Louisiana in March 1865. Upon the arrival of the division on March 24‚Äì30, 1865, the division began waiting for Confederate President Jefferson Davis to arrive to make the Last Stand of the Confederacy at Hempstead, Texas. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865, Johnston surrendered on April 26, 1865, and Davis was captured in Georgia on May 10, 1865 all of which compelled Confederate Maj. Gen. Kirby Smith to surrender the Department of the Trans- Mississippi on June 2, 1865. All Confederate forces in Hempstead and all other CS posts in Texas mostly went home. Immediately after the surrender of CS forces in Texas, it took about a month before US troops entered the state. The first US forces to arrive in Hempstead after the war was the 29th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The 29th was relieved by the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment that garrisoned the US Post of Hempstead, Texas well into 1866. In August 1865, Maj. Gen. George A. Custer arrived in Hempstead with a division of volunteer US cavalry. The division camped in and around Liendo Plantation for about two months before moving to Austin or were mustered out of the service at Hempstead in 1865‚Äì66. The cavalry regiments under the command of Custer at Hempstead were the 1st Iowa, 2nd Wisconsin, 7th Indiana, and the 5th and 12th Illinois Cavalry. Company K of the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry occupied the town and guarded the railroad line until the regiment was mustered out in May 1866. The headquarters of US Post of Hempstead was located in town and not at Liendo Plantation. US Forces fanned out and set up camps in numerous towns. Their mission was to parole former Confederate troops, collect CS property, and to establish law and order. Many former CS troops did not report for their paroles, however, and many went to Mexico. The volunteer US regiments stationed in Texas were nearly gone from the state by the end of 1865. =1866‚Äì1869= In 1866, the 1st Battalion, Companies A and B of the 17th US Infantry, was stationed at Hempstead. The battalion arrived for duty in Hempstead in the Fall of 1866. They set up camp north of the US Post Office in downtown Hempstead. Their mission was primarily in support of the Freedmen's Bureau. In the Fall of 1867, a yellow fever epidemic devastated the civilian population of Hempstead, and nearly 40 soldiers of the 17th US Infantry died as well. =1873= German-American Scupltress, Elisabet Ney and her Husband, Scottish physician and philosopher, Edmund Montgomery purchased the Liendo plantation where they and their family split time between their home in Austin for the next 20 years. Ney died and was buried at Liendo. Twentieth century to present Hempstead is famous for its watermelon crop, and until the 1940s, the town was the top shipper of watermelons in the United States. Billy DiIorio was known as the Watermelon King and Angelina DiIorio was known as the Watermelon Queen. Both resided in Hempstead, Texas. The town holds an annual Watermelon Festival in July. Hempstead is also known for its early 20th century rough-and-tumble character. The town was informally called Six Shooter Junction. The town has grown in recent years because of its relative closeness to Houston along U.S. Highway 290. The current economy is based on county government, shipping, and a small but growing industrial base. However, the closing of a large auto dealership (Lawerence Marshall) in 2009 hurt the community's economy and correlated with a drop in the town's population. The town has, however, rebounded in its population since 2010. One of the town's residents was Lillie E. Drennan, who in 1929 became the first woman to hold a commercial driver's license in Texas. She ran a regional hauling company called the Drennan Truck Line while maintaining an excellent driving record. Drennan received periodic attention in national newspapers and radio broadcasts. In 2015, Sandra Bland was stopped by Texas State Trooper Brian Encinia for a traffic infraction. Three videos from varying perspectives confirm that the officer, looking at the woman's cellphone, was in no danger; but the officer drew his taser on the woman threatening to \\"light her up\\" because he claimed he was in danger; the videos confirm there was neither danger nor possibility of such reasonable inference. Three days later she was found dead in her jail cell, from, what was reported, a hanging suicide. Outrage over the unnecessary arrest and hostile behavior of officers sworn to protect its citizens led to passage of the \\"Sandra Bland Act,\\" named in the victim's honor, requiring law enforcement officers to receive de-escalation training. The woman's own cellphone recording of the traffic stop was released on May 6, 2019, confirming the officer knew that the supposed \\"threat\\" was merely the woman's phone. The trooper who pulled the taser on Bland, as part of a plea deal to have perjury charges dropped, was prohibited from ever working again in law enforcement. The Sandra Bland incident was just one in a series of incidents across the country that led to what has been called the \\"Black Lives Matter\\" movement, and is one of the central stories discussed in Malcolm Gladwell's Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don't Know where he writes that Bland's death \\"is what happens when a society does not know how to talk to strangers.\\" Geography Map of Hempstead Hempstead is located at (30.091427, -96.081252).

He lived in Switzerland from 1976 to 2014. Kamprad was born in Pj√§tteryd (now part of √Ñlmhult Municipality), Kronobergs l√§n, in Sm√•land, Sweden, to Feodor Kamprad (1893‚Äì1984) and Berta n√©e Nilsson (1903‚Äì1956). His mother was of Swedish origin, while his father was born in Germany and came to Sweden at age one with his parents. Kamprad's paternal grandfather Achim Erdmann Kamprad was originally from Altenburger Land in Thuringia, and his paternal grandmother Franzisca (\\"Fanny\\") Glatz was born in Radonitz (Radonice) in Bohemia in then-Austria-Hungary; they left Germany for Sweden in 1896. The surname Kamprad was a variant of \\"Comrade\\" and dates back to the 14th century; in the 19th century the Kamprad family had become wealthy estate owners in Thuringia. Achim Kamprad's mother was a distant relative of Paul von Hindenburg.Thomas Sj√µberg Ingvar Kamprad och hans IKEA: En svensk saga Chapter 3 Achim was the younger son of an estate owner and had bought the farm Elmtaryd (presently standardized √Ñlmtaryd) near the small village of Agunnaryd (now part of Ljungby Municipality) in the province of Sm√•land; with 449 hectares of land it was the largest farm in the area. He committed suicide a few years after Frans Feodor was born, leaving the farm to Franzisca and with time Franz Feodor. Ingvar Kamprad lived on the farm with his parents, sister and grandmother from the age of 6.Thomas Sj√µberg Ingvar Kamprad och hans IKEA: En svensk saga Chapter 3,4 and 5 Kamprad visited his family's ancestral town in Thuringia and kept in contact with relatives there.Sch√∂ne Gr√º√üe von Ingvar, zeit.de; accessed 28 January 2018. Career Kamprad began to develop a business as a young boy. He started selling matches at the age of five. When he was seven he began travelling further afield on his bicycle to sell to neighbours. He found he could buy matches in bulk very cheaply from Stockholm, sell them individually at a low price, and still make a good profit. From matches, he expanded to selling fish, Christmas tree decorations, seeds, and later ballpoint pens and pencils. When Kamprad was 17, his father gave him a cash reward for succeeding in his studies.Ingvar Kamprad: IKEA Founder and One of the World's Richest People About.com Entrepreneurs Ingvar attended G√∂teborgs handelsinstitut, now part of Hvitfeldtska Gymnasiet, from 1943 to 1945. In 1943, when he was 17, Kamprad founded IKEA, selling replicas of his uncle Ernst's kitchen table. In 1948, Kamprad diversified his portfolio, adding furniture. His business was mostly mail order. The acronym IKEA is made up of the initials of his name (Ingvar Kamprad) plus those of Elmtaryd, the family farm where he was born, and the nearby village Agunnaryd where he was raised.Jonas Fred√©n (24 September 2015)Ingvar Kamprad, founder of IKEA Sweden.se In June 2013, Kamprad resigned from the board of Inter IKEA Holding SA and his youngest son Mathias Kamprad replaced Per Ludvigsson as the chairman of the holding company. Following his decision to step down, the then-87-year-old founder explained, \\"I see this as a good time for me to leave the board of Inter IKEA Group. By that we are also taking another step in the generation shift that has been ongoing for some years.\\" Mathias and his two older brothers, who also have leadership roles at IKEA, work on the corporation's overall vision and long-term strategy.  Net worth and Stichting INGKA Foundation  The Dutch-registered Stichting INGKA Foundation is named after Ingvar Kamprad (i.e., ING + KA) which owns INGKA Holding, the parent company for all IKEA stores. In May 2006 the charitable foundation was reported by The Economist to be the world's wealthiest charity, however the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has since become larger. Despite its large endowment its primary purpose is corporate tax-minimisation and anti-takeover protection for IKEA. Kamprad was chairman of the foundation. According to an article in the Swedish business weekly Veckans Aff√§rer in 2004,\\"Who's really the world's richest?\\" CNNMoney.com, April 6, 2004 Kamprad was one of the world's wealthiest people. This report was based on the assumption that he owned the entire company, an approach both IKEA and the Kamprad family rejected. Kamprad retained little direct ownership in the company, having transferred his interest to Stichting INGKA Foundation and INGKA Holding as part of a complex tax sheltering scheme that leaves his actual degree of control vague. In March 2010, Forbes magazine estimated Kamprad's fortune at US$23 billion, making him the eleventh richest person in the world. A year later, he fell to 162nd after his lawyers produced documents proving that the foundation he established and heads in Liechtenstein owns IKEA, and that its bylaws bar him and his family from benefiting from its funds. In June 2015, Kamprad was listed as the eighth wealthiest person in the world in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with an estimated net worth of $58.7 billion. Forbes reported Kamprad's net worth as of February 2016 to be $3.4 billion.  Works  While generally a private person, Kamprad had published a few notable works. He first detailed his philosophies of frugality and simplicity in a manifesto entitled A Testament of a Furniture Dealer in 1976.The gospel according to Ikea The Guardian, 26 June 2000 Kamprad also worked with Swedish journalist Bertil Torekull on Leading by Design: The IKEA Story. In the autobiographical book, Kamprad further describes his philosophies and the trials and triumphs of the founding of IKEA.Kamprad, Ingvar and Torekull, Bertil Leading By Design: The IKEA Story Harper Collins, Sept.1, 1999.  Fascist involvement  In 1994, the personal letters of the Swedish fascist Per Engdahl were made public, posthumously revealing that Kamprad had joined Engdahl's pro-fascist New Swedish Movement (Nysvenska R√∂relsen) in 1942, at age 16. Kamprad had raised funds and recruited members for the group, at least as late as September 1945. When he quit the group is unknown, but he remained a friend of Engdahl until the early 1950s.Nilsson, Karl N. Alvar Svensk √∂verklass och h√∂gerextremism under 1900-talet pp. 155‚Äì156. Kamprad devoted two chapters to his time in Nysvenska R√∂relsen in his book Leading by Design: The IKEA Story and, in a 1994 letter to IKEA employees, called his affiliation with the organization the \\"greatest mistake of my life\\". Kamprad explained his teenage engagement in New Swedish Movement as being politically influenced by his father and grandmother in Sudet-Germany.Kamprad I, Torekull, B: \\"Historien om IKEA: Ingvar Kamprad ber√§ttar f√∂r Bertil Torekull\\", Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand, Stockholm 1998, . In 2011, journalist Elisabeth √Ösbrink published a book Made in Sweden: How the Swedes Are Not Nearly So Egalitarian, Tolerant, Hospitable or Cozy As They Would Like to (Have You) Think in which she revealed that, by 1943, the Swedish Security Service had created a file on Kamprad entitled \\"Nazi\\", and that Kamprad had told her, during a 2010 interview, that \\"Per Engdahl is a great man, and I will maintain that as long as I live.\\" (Kamprad deeply involved in Nazi movement) Writing in The Daily Telegraph, in August 2011, Richard Orange noted that the 1943 file proved for the first time that Kamprad \\"was an active member of Svensk Socialistisk Samling ‚Äì successor to the Swedish Nationalist Socialist Workers Party ‚Äì citing his membership number: 4013. It quotes letters intercepted from Mr Kamprad, then 17, in which he enthuses about recruiting new members and says that he \\"misses no opportunity to work for the movement.\\" Orange added, \\"The secret service concluded that, as Mr Kamprad received the party's youth newspaper, he must have held \\"some sort of official position within the organisation.\\" The following day, the BBC reported: \\"A Swedish expert on far-right extremism, Anna-Lena Lodenius, told Radio Sweden that Mr Kamprad's Nazi involvement could no longer be dismissed as the by-product of an accidental friendship with Per Engdahl. His involvement in another fascist organisation, she said, showed he must have been 'perfectly aware' of what it stood for.\\" The BBC report also noted that a spokesman said that Kamprad \\"had long admitted flirting with fascism, but that now, \\"there are no Nazi-sympathising thoughts in Ingvar's head whatsoever.\\"  Personal life  Kamprad and his first wife Kerstin Wadling adopted a daughter, Annika. In the 1960s, Kamprad married his second wife, Margaretha Kamprad-Stennert (1940‚Äì2011), whom he met when she was twenty years old.\\"Ikea founder mourns death of his wife\\". The Local.

In 2004 he said that his drinking was under control,\\"It started in a shed\\" The Age, July 15, 2004 and according to The New York Times, Kamprad \\"controlled it by drying out three times a year\\". According to an interview with TSR, the Swiss TV broadcaster, Kamprad drove a 1993 Volvo 240, flew only economy class, and encouraged IKEA employees to use both sides of pieces of paper. NZZ Online, March 27, 2006 He reportedly recycled tea bags and was known to pocket the salt and pepper packets at restaurants. Kamprad had also been known to visit IKEA for a \\"cheap meal\\". He was known for purchasing Christmas paper and presents in post-Christmas sales. The company he created is still known for the attention it gives to cost control, operational details and continuous product development, allowing it to lower its prices by an average of 2‚Äì3% over the decade to 2010, while continuing its global expansion. Kamprad explains his social philosophy in his Testament of a Furniture Dealer: \\"It is not only for cost reasons that we avoid the luxury hotels. We don't need flashy cars, impressive titles, uniforms or other status symbols. We rely on our strength and our will!\\" Kamprad owned a villa in Switzerland, a large country estate in Sweden and a vineyard in Provence, France. Kamprad drove a Porsche for several years.Ikea-Kamprads lyxvillor, Expressen, August 22, 2004Folkhemsm√∂bleraren 80 √•r , Dagens Industri, March 29, 2006Lyxhusen som Kamprad vill tala tyst om, Dagens Nyheter, August 19, 2004 Kamprad had named his sons as the sole heirs of an entity called the Ikano Group, which holds a substantial minority stake in IKEA estimated at US$1.5 billion.

The project created three generations of supercomputers, Blue Gene/L, Blue Gene/P, and Blue Gene/Q. Blue Gene systems have often led the TOP500 and Green500 rankings of the most powerful and most power efficient supercomputers, respectively. Blue Gene systems have also consistently scored top positions in the Graph500 list. The project was awarded the 2009 National Medal of Technology and Innovation. As of 2015, IBM seems to have ended the development of the Blue Gene family though no public announcement has been made. IBM's continuing efforts of the supercomputer scene seems to be concentrated around OpenPower, using accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs to battle the end of Moore's law. History In December 1999, IBM announced a US$100 million research initiative for a five-year effort to build a massively parallel computer, to be applied to the study of biomolecular phenomena such as protein folding. The project had two main goals: to advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind protein folding via large-scale simulation, and to explore novel ideas in massively parallel machine architecture and software. Major areas of investigation included: how to use this novel platform to effectively meet its scientific goals, how to make such massively parallel machines more usable, and how to achieve performance targets at a reasonable cost, through novel machine architectures. The initial design for Blue Gene was based on an early version of the Cyclops64 architecture, designed by Monty Denneau. The initial research and development work was pursued at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and led by William R. Pulleyblank.. At IBM, Alan Gara started working on an extension of the QCDOC architecture into a more general-purpose supercomputer: The 4D nearest-neighbor interconnection network was replaced by a network supporting routing of messages from any node to any other; and a parallel I/O subsystem was added. DOE started funding the development of this system and it became known as Blue Gene/L (L for Light); development of the original Blue Gene system continued under the name Blue Gene/C (C for Cyclops) and, later, Cyclops64. In November 2004 a 16-rack system, with each rack holding 1,024 compute nodes, achieved first place in the TOP500 list, with a Linpack performance of 70.72 TFLOPS. It thereby overtook NEC's Earth Simulator, which had held the title of the fastest computer in the world since 2002. From 2004 through 2007 the Blue Gene/L installation at LLNL gradually expanded to 104 racks, achieving 478 TFLOPS Linpack and 596 TFLOPS peak. The LLNL BlueGene/L installation held the first position in the TOP500 list for 3.5 years, until in June 2008 it was overtaken by IBM's Cell-based Roadrunner system at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which was the first system to surpass the 1 PetaFLOPS mark. The system was built in Rochester, MN IBM plant. While the LLNL installation was the largest Blue Gene/L installation, many smaller installations followed. In November 2006, there were 27 computers on the TOP500 list using the Blue Gene/L architecture. All these computers were listed as having an architecture of eServer Blue Gene Solution. For example, three racks of Blue Gene/L were housed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. While the TOP500 measures performance on a single benchmark application, Linpack, Blue Gene/L also set records for performance on a wider set of applications. Blue Gene/L was the first supercomputer ever to run over 100 TFLOPS sustained on a real-world application, namely a three-dimensional molecular dynamics code (ddcMD), simulating solidification (nucleation and growth processes) of molten metal under high pressure and temperature conditions. This achievement won the 2005 Gordon Bell Prize. In June 2006, NNSA and IBM announced that Blue Gene/L achieved 207.3 TFLOPS on a quantum chemical application (Qbox).hpcwire.com At Supercomputing 2006, Blue Gene/L was awarded the winning prize in all HPC Challenge Classes of awards. In 2007, a team from the IBM Almaden Research Center and the University of Nevada ran an artificial neural network almost half as complex as the brain of a mouse for the equivalent of a second (the network was run at 1/10 of normal speed for 10 seconds). Name The name Blue Gene comes from what it was originally designed to do, help biologists understand the processes of protein folding and gene development. \\"Blue\\" is a traditional moniker that IBM uses for many of its products and the company itself. The original Blue Gene design was renamed \\"Blue Gene/C\\" and eventually Cyclops64. The \\"L\\" in Blue Gene/L comes from \\"Light\\" as that design's original name was \\"Blue Light\\". The \\"P\\" version was designed to be a petascale design. \\"Q\\" is just the letter after \\"P\\". There is no Blue Gene/R. The computer is not named after Gene Amdahl. Major features The Blue Gene/L supercomputer was unique in the following aspects: * Trading the speed of processors for lower power consumption. Blue Gene/L used low frequency and low power embedded PowerPC cores with floating point accelerators. While the performance of each chip was relatively low, the system could achieve better power efficiency for applications that could use large numbers of nodes. * Dual processors per node with two working modes: co- processor mode where one processor handles computation and the other handles communication; and virtual-node mode, where both processors are available to run user code, but the processors share both the computation and the communication load. * System-on-a-chip design. All node components were embedded on one chip, with the exception of 512 MB external DRAM. * A large number of nodes (scalable in increments of 1024 up to at least 65,536) * Three-dimensional torus interconnect with auxiliary networks for global communications (broadcast and reductions), I/O, and management * Lightweight OS per node for minimum system overhead (system noise). Architecture The Blue Gene/L architecture was an evolution of the QCDSP and QCDOC architectures. Each Blue Gene/L Compute or I/O node was a single ASIC with associated DRAM memory chips. The ASIC integrated two 700 MHz PowerPC 440 embedded processors, each with a double-pipeline-double-precision Floating Point Unit (FPU), a cache sub-system with built-in DRAM controller and the logic to support multiple communication sub-systems. The dual FPUs gave each Blue Gene/L node a theoretical peak performance of 5.6 GFLOPS (gigaFLOPS). The two CPUs were not cache coherent with one another. Compute nodes were packaged two per compute card, with 16 compute cards plus up to 2 I/O nodes per node board. There were 32 node boards per cabinet/rack. By the integration of all essential sub-systems on a single chip, and the use of low-power logic, each Compute or I/O node dissipated low power (about 17 watts, including DRAMs). This allowed aggressive packaging of up to 1024 compute nodes, plus additional I/O nodes, in a standard 19-inch rack, within reasonable limits of electrical power supply and air cooling. The performance metrics, in terms of FLOPS per watt, FLOPS per m2 of floorspace and FLOPS per unit cost, allowed scaling up to very high performance. With so many nodes, component failures were inevitable. The system was able to electrically isolate faulty components, down to a granularity of half a rack (512 compute nodes), to allow the machine to continue to run. Each Blue Gene/L node was attached to three parallel communications networks: a 3D toroidal network for peer-to-peer communication between compute nodes, a collective network for collective communication (broadcasts and reduce operations), and a global interrupt network for fast barriers. The I/O nodes, which run the Linux operating system, provided communication to storage and external hosts via an Ethernet network. The I/O nodes handled filesystem operations on behalf of the compute nodes. Finally, a separate and private Ethernet network provided access to any node for configuration, booting and diagnostics. To allow multiple programs to run concurrently, a Blue Gene/L system could be partitioned into electronically isolated sets of nodes. The number of nodes in a partition had to be a positive integer power of 2, with at least 25 = 32 nodes. To run a program on Blue Gene/L, a partition of the computer was first to be reserved. The program was then loaded and run on all the nodes within the partition, and no other program could access nodes within the partition while it was in use. Upon completion, the partition nodes were released for future programs to use. Blue Gene/L compute nodes used a minimal operating system supporting a single user program. Only a subset of POSIX calls was supported, and only one process could run at a time on node in co-processor mode‚Äîor one process per CPU in virtual mode. Programmers needed to implement green threads in order to simulate local concurrency. Application development was usually performed in C, C++, or Fortran using MPI for communication. However, some scripting languages such as Rubyece.iastate.edu and Python have been ported to the compute nodes. IBM has published BlueMatter, the application developed to exercise Blue Gene/L, as open source here Blue Matter source code, retrieved February 28, 2020 . This serves to document how the torus and collective interfaces were used by applications, and may serve as a base for others to exercise the current generation of supercomputers. Blue Gene/P A Blue Gene/P node card A schematic overview of a Blue Gene/P supercomputer In June 2007, IBM unveiled Blue Gene/P, the second generation of the Blue Gene series of supercomputers and designed through a collaboration that included IBM, LLNL, and Argonne National Laboratory's Leadership Computing Facility. Design The design of Blue Gene/P is a technology evolution from Blue Gene/L. Each Blue Gene/P Compute chip contains four PowerPC 450 processor cores, running at 850 MHz. The cores are cache coherent and the chip can operate as a 4-way symmetric multiprocessor (SMP). The memory subsystem on the chip consists of small private L2 caches, a central shared 8 MB L3 cache, and dual DDR2 memory controllers. The chip also integrates the logic for node-to- node communication, using the same network topologies as Blue Gene/L, but at more than twice the bandwidth. A compute card contains a Blue Gene/P chip with 2 or 4 GB DRAM, comprising a \\"compute node\\". A single compute node has a peak performance of 13.6 GFLOPS. 32 Compute cards are plugged into an air-cooled node board. A rack contains 32 node boards (thus 1024 nodes, 4096 processor cores). By using many small, low-power, densely packaged chips, Blue Gene/P exceeded the power efficiency of other supercomputers of its generation, and at 371 MFLOPS/W Blue Gene/P installations ranked at or near the top of the Green500 lists in 2007-2008. Installations The following is an incomplete list of Blue Gene/P installations. Per November 2009, the TOP500 list contained 15 Blue Gene/P installations of 2-racks (2048 nodes, 8192 processor cores, 23.86 TFLOPS Linpack) and larger. * On November 12, 2007, the first Blue Gene/P installation, JUGENE, with 16 racks (16,384 nodes, 65,536 processors) was running at Forschungszentrum J√ºlich in Germany with a performance of 167 TFLOPS. When inaugurated it was the fastest supercomputer in Europe and the sixth fastest in the world. In 2009, JUGENE was upgraded to 72 racks (73,728 nodes, 294,912 processor cores) with 144 terabytes of memory and 6 petabytes of storage, and achieved a peak performance of 1 PetaFLOPS.

Blue Gene/Q The IBM Blue Gene/Q installed at Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, Illinois. The third supercomputer design in the Blue Gene series, Blue Gene/Q has a peak performance of 20 Petaflops, reaching LINPACK benchmarks performance of 17 Petaflops. Blue Gene/Q continues to expand and enhance the Blue Gene/L and /P architectures.  Design  The Blue Gene/Q Compute chip is an 18 core chip. The 64-bit A2 processor cores are 4-way simultaneously multithreaded, and run at 1.6 GHz. Each processor core has a SIMD Quad-vector double precision floating point unit (IBM QPX). 16 Processor cores are used for computing, and a 17th core for operating system assist functions such as interrupts, asynchronous I/O, MPI pacing and RAS. The 18th core is used as a redundant spare, used to increase manufacturing yield. The spared-out core is shut down in functional operation. The processor cores are linked by a crossbar switch to a 32 MB eDRAM L2 cache, operating at half core speed. The L2 cache is multi-versioned, supporting transactional memory and speculative execution, and has hardware support for atomic operations. L2 cache misses are handled by two built-in DDR3 memory controllers running at 1.33 GHz. The chip also integrates logic for chip-to-chip communications in a 5D torus configuration, with 2GB/s chip-to-chip links. The Blue Gene/Q chip is manufactured on IBM's copper SOI process at 45 nm. It delivers a peak performance of 204.8 GFLOPS at 1.6 GHz, drawing about 55 watts. The chip measures 19√ó19 mm (359.5 mm¬≤) and comprises 1.47 billion transistors. The chip is mounted on a compute card along with 16 GB DDR3 DRAM (i.e., 1 GB for each user processor core). A Q32 compute drawer contains 32 compute cards, each water cooled. A \\"midplane\\" (crate) contains 16 Q32 compute drawers for a total of 512 compute nodes, electrically interconnected in a 5D torus configuration (4x4x4x4x2). Beyond the midplane level, all connections are optical. Racks have two midplanes, thus 32 compute drawers, for a total of 1024 compute nodes, 16,384 user cores and 16 TB RAM. Separate I/O drawers, placed at the top of a rack or in a separate rack, are air cooled and contain 8 compute cards and 8 PCIe expansion slots for InfiniBand or 10 Gigabit Ethernet networking.  Performance  At the time of the Blue Gene/Q system announcement in November 2011, an initial 4-rack Blue Gene/Q system (4096 nodes, 65536 user processor cores) achieved #17 in the TOP500 list with 677.1 TeraFLOPS Linpack, outperforming the original 2007 104-rack BlueGene/L installation described above. The same 4-rack system achieved the top position in the Graph500 list with over 250 GTEPS (giga traversed edges per second). Blue Gene/Q systems also topped the Green500 list of most energy efficient supercomputers with up to 2.1 GFLOPS/W. In June 2012, Blue Gene/Q installations took the top positions in all three lists: TOP500, Graph500 and Green500.  Installations  The following is an incomplete list of Blue Gene/Q installations. Per June 2012, the TOP500 list contained 20 Blue Gene/Q installations of 1/2-rack (512 nodes, 8192 processor cores, 86.35 TFLOPS Linpack) and larger. At a (size-independent) power efficiency of about 2.1 GFLOPS/W, all these systems also populated the top of the June 2012 Green 500 list. * A Blue Gene/Q system called Sequoia was delivered to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) beginning in 2011 and was fully deployed in June 2012.

Education The Town of Wickett is served by the Monahans-Wickett-Pyote Independent School District. History The following is a short history of Wickett's beginnings. If it had not been for George W. O'Brien, the place which was to become Wickett might have remained as Aroya, merely a switch and a section house on the Texas and Pacific Railroad, established to house one of the maintenance crews for the railroad. O'Brien gave Southern Crude's camp (for employees), for offices, tank farm and loading racks. O'Brien furnished the land for the townsite which was to become Wickett (named for Fred H. Wickett, a chairman of the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Co., of which Southern Crude was a subsidiary.). Wickett's official \\"birthday\\" was February 14, 1927; and the rush for residence and business lots in the new town was like the early days of Nevada and California. After celebrating its four-weeks birthday on March 4, 1927, Wickett's \\"fathers\\" were planning to make it the county seat of Ward County. The new town's early arrivals lived in crude frame shacks, in tents and under wagons. A two-story, forty-two room hotel was constructed. The Bluebonnet Refinery was built in Wickett by a group of men under the leadership of B.L. Woolley of Dallas and H.B. Hassett of St. Louis, Missouri, to process crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel and other fuel oil. Onnie Mae O'Brien became the first Postmistress on June 14, 1927 after a petition was circulated for the designation of Wickett for a U.S. Post Office. Wickett Independent School District was created on August 20, 1928, by taking 14 sections from the Monahans District and 21 sections from the Pyote District. The Wickett School District was one of the richest of its size in the state. A two-room brick building was constructed and in about 1932 a two-room cafeteria was built. The 14 sections were returned to Monahans District in 1931. In 1928 Bluebonnet Refinery was sold and the name was changed to Wickett Refinery Co. Gulf Oil Corporation acquired the properties of Southern Crude. The Wickett Refinery was closed in May 1973. In 1936 a consolidation of the Wickett and Monahans schools was agreed upon because of declining enrollment. It was understood that an elementary school would remain in Wickett. On April 1, 1937, it was announced that the district was now the Monahans-Wickett Independent School District. Until 1953 the school was known as Wickett Ward School, but after the death of Mrs. Helen Gensler (a teacher), the Trustees on January 13, 1953 voted to change the name of the Helen Gensler Elementary School. Oblique air photo of Wickett, facing northeast, showing a multitude of natural gas wells, in 2011 In 1937, the Cabot Companies of Boston Mass., brought a sizeable new industry to Wickett. A plant was established to extract \\"natural gasoline\\" and other liquid hydrocarbons which could be extracted from natural gas. In addition, a factory for the production of carbon black was constructed to claim the residue available from the burning of the \\"dry\\" gas. At the height of its operations, Cabot was second only to Gulf Oil as the largest private employer in Ward County. Although Wickett, like many West Texas communities, lost population in the 1950s and 1960s, the community was incorporated in March 1962 so that water and sewer services would be available to its residents. The first mayor was Harold Massey, son-in-law of G.W. O'Brien. Other officials were: C.W. Ross Sr., City Marshall, and councilmen were: W.O. Luckie, D.P. Fambrough, Alvie Pardue, V.C. Moore and F.E. Parker. There were 100 votes for the incorporation of Wickett and 53 votes against the incorporation.[Water, Oil, Sand and Sky (Odessa; Texas Permian Historical Society, 1962) [Recollections, Polly O'Brien Massey, February 21, 1979 References Category:Towns in Ward County, Texas Category:Towns in Texas ","title":"Wickett, Texas"},{"id":"136767","text":"Map of the city 1873 Brenham ( ) is a city in east-central Texas in Washington County, United States, with a population of 15,716 according to the 2010 U.S. census.

It received a historical marker from the Webb County Historical Association on January 4, 2014.Philip Balli, \\"Historical Marker Dedication and Unveiling Ceremony: Lala's Caf√© served Honor: Iconic eatery gets marker\\", Laredo Morning Times, January 5, 2014 Founded by the late Eduarda Rodriguez, who died in 1973, the caf√© is now operated by her daughter, Mariana Rodriguez. Michael Black, who did the research for the historical association which led to the marker, said it was rare to know the subject of his work, but he had known Rodriguez for twenty- three years. Frank Staggs (born in 1960), recalls having eaten at Lala's since he was a young boy. Staggs told the Laredo Morning Times, \\"Lala was a wonderful lady, and she meant a lot to this town. I know people in Houston and East Texas who ask me if Lala's is still in Mirando City, and I tell them, 'Yes, it is.'\\" ReferencesExternal links * Mirando City website * Category:Census-designated places in Texas Category:Census-designated places in Webb County, Texas Category:1921 establishments in Texas ","title":"Mirando City, Texas"},{"id":"136777","text":"Oilton is a census-designated place (CDP) in Webb County, Texas, United States.

History The US Postal Service changed the name from Bolling in 1926. The first settlement in the area was known as Floyd's Lane which was on a trail that ran from a Colorado River crossing on the west to a San Bernard River crossing on the east. A trail that ran beside Caney Creek connected the area to Wharton. Boling was founded in 1900 when the New York, Texas & Mexican Railroad built a line through the area. The settlement was named for Mary Bolling Vineyard, the then-6-year-old daughter of Robert E. Vineyard who had the town surveyed. By 1907 the town had a school, a store, a blacksmith shop, and about ten families. The school had four teachers and 104 black students. These children descended from the African-American slaves who worked the area's plantations in the pre-Civil War era. Their parents were sharecroppers or hired hands on the large land tracts which survived from the earlier time.Hudgins, BOLING, TX Boling expanded in population from 20 in 1920 to 450 in 1930 after petroleum, sulphur, and natural gas were discovered locally in mid-decade. The post office opened in 1926, dropping the second L in the town's name to change it to Boling. The town's streets were named after the oil companies that operated nearby. There are still streets named Atlantic, Gulf, Humble, Magnolia, Sinclair, Sun, and Texas. The Boling Chamber of Commerce was set up in 1935. The town's population reached 800 in 1944, dipped to 521 in 1972, and increased to 1,297 in 1990. The community's economy was hard-hit in December 1993 when the sulphur plant in Newgulf closed.

The Boling salt dome is a major geological feature in the Boling-Iago area. The large oval-shaped structure is situated mostly between Boling and the San Bernard River to the northeast, with the longer axis running east-west. The caprock lies under the surface at the crest of the salt dome. Sulphur in water wells, natural gas seeps in the San Bernard River, and surface expressions indicated that the feature might be exploited for petroleum oil. In 1922 the first lease was bought and test wells were drilled. The first commercial well was the Texas Company's #3 Taylor in 1925; it produced about 10,000 barrels per day. In December 1937 there were 91 producing wells in the Boling Field, but by the end of 1946 many wells were played out and production dipped to 300,000 barrels per day.Cantrell, abstract In April 1947, new producing oil wells were drilled near Iago on the southwest edge of the Boling salt dome. Soon after, other successful wells were drilled on the north, northeast, and south flanks of the structure. Between 1947 and 1951, the field's production leaped to an average of 1 million barrels per year. At the end of 1952 there were 180 oil wells. In 1927, a sulphur-rich core sample was retrieved from the caprock and the production of sulphur began. From that year until 1952, about 38 million tons of sulphur were extracted from the Boling salt dome. Education Boling High School Boling-Iago is served by the Boling Independent School District.

East Bernard has its own school district, two auto dealerships and a number of other businesses. The San Bernard River flows past the city's eastern side. History M101 howitzer at American Legion Post 226 US Post Office and water tower Wharton County Precinct 2 Annex In 2000, East Bernard incorporated. As of 2007, East Bernard is one of Texas's newest cities. East Bernard is on the west side of the San Bernard River at the intersection of State Highway 60 and U.S. Highway 90A, fifteen miles (24 km) north of Wharton in northeast Wharton County. The community was originally on the east side of the river, where Jethro Spivi built the first residence around 1850; hence the name East Bernard. Settlement was slow until 1859 and the arrival of the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway. A bridge was built, and the depot, Bernard Station, though originally located on the east bank of the river, was moved by 1869 to the west side, to the site of East Bernard's future Main Street. The rest of the town grew up around the railway. The first post office was established in 1866, but the community was probably not officially named East Bernard until 1874. After the Civil War the community began to grow rapidly, as new settlers arrived with British surnames. Although Joseph Habermacher operated a store and saddle shop in Bernard Station some time before 1867, the main influx of German and Slavic immigrants came after the 1880s. In the mid-1890s the farming community had a population of 150, and businesses included a steam gin, a gristmill, a telegraph office, and two general stores. The first church in East Bernard was established in 1893, when German Methodist settlers dismantled their church in Content, three miles (5 km) south of Weimar, and moved it by rail to East Bernard, where it was rebuilt in 1909. Catholic and Baptist congregations started holding services in private homes around 1900; their sanctuaries were completed between 1905 and 1907. The present Catholic church, built in 1925, has stained glass windows from Czechoslovakia, mosaics from Munich, a statue of St. Anthony from Italy, and statuary carved in the German Tyrol. An Assembly of God congregation began Pentecostal services in a private home in 1970 and moved into a new building by 1978. East Bernard has had several newspapers, the first of which, the East Bernard Tribune, began in the 1920s. In the late 1980s the town was served by a weekly paper with the same name. Riverside Hall, built in 1927 on the east bank of the river, became a popular dance pavilion, where Paul Whiteman was once featured. In the early years of the settlement pioneer merchants H. P. Stockton and John G. Leveridge had operated a banking business in the back of Leveridge's General Store; by 1907 they had organized the Union State Bank. R. B. Boettcher purchased the controlling stock in 1911. In 1960 J. R. Peace, owner of a large furniture company, helped organize a chamber of commerce, which, since East Bernard was unincorporated, performed much of the duties of a city government. In the 1980s East Bernard's economy, though centered on agriculture, also included a gas pipeline company, a major kite-manufacturer, and several research corporations. In 1988 the population of 1,500 was served by sixty-three businesses. In 1990 the population was 1,544, and in 2000 it had grown to 1,729. East Bernard won the Texas state football championship in 1977 and 2012. East Bernard is widely known across the state of Texas as a volleyball powerhouse. In 2017, author Putt Riddle recorded 22 schools in Texas with at least 4 state championship titles in the book Above the Net - 50 Years of the Best Volleyball in Texas. The East Bernard Brahamarettes tied for the highest number of state championships with 13 wins.

U.S. Route 59, Texas State Highway 60, and Farm to Market Road 1161 intersect in the community. The Kansas City Southern Railway Co. passes through Hungerford. The population was 347 at the 2010 census. It is located on what in the 1820s was the Alexander Jackson league. By the 1870s, the Quinan settlement grew up a short distance away, but its residents moved to the new town when the railroad came through Hungerford. Geography Hungerford is located at (29.399122, -96.077019). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.8 square miles (4.7 km2), all of it land. History Alexander Jackson was one of the Old Three Hundred colonists from the United States who accepted land grants from Stephen F. Austin. The Alexander Jackson league was a strip of land which was bounded on the southwest by the Colorado River just northwest of present-day Wharton and ran northeast beyond West Bernard Creek. After the Texas Revolution, the Republic of Texas set up a short-lived ordnance depot called Post West Bernard Station at a location northwest of present-day Hungerford.See photo of Post West Bernard Station historical marker. Its purpose was to recondition weapons captured at the Battle of San Jacinto and to watch for a possible invasion by the Mexican army. In 1872 the village of Quinan was founded about west of present day Hungerford.See photo of Quinan Community historical marker. The Quinan post office was established in 1874 in the general store owned by John C. Habermacher, who also served as postmaster. Habermacher was once a member of Edwin Booth's acting troupe. His wife Annie Thatcher was Alexander Jackson's grand-daughter. In 1882 the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway was built through the newly-surveyed town of Hungerford which was in the adjacent George W. Singleton league. Most of Quinan's businesses moved to the railroad, followed by the post office in 1883. The new town was named after Daniel E. Hungerford, who was the father-in-law of the railroad's major investor John William Mackay. In 1885, Hungerford boasted 200 residents, several churches, a steam cotton gin, a gristmill, and a school. In 1908 the town became the headquarters for the J. D. Hudgins Ranch. In 1926 the Strouhal Tire Recapping Company opened in Hungerford. That year, the town had 13 businesses, including three general stores. Five different area schools counted a total of 259 black students, 189 white students, and 13 teachers. The 1927 poll tax enumerated 85 white voters and 64 black voters. In 1961 the population was 450 and 18 commercial establishments were in town. By that year, the train no longer stopped at Hungerford. In 1973, the local school district stopped operating and its students were absorbed by four nearby districts. In the 1980s there were 500 residents and most business was seasonal: hunting and harvesting cotton, grain, and pecans. In 1980 the Teen Challenge of South Texas New Life Rehabilitation Center bought the former black school. Between its opening and 1990, its enrollment increased from 150 to 250. In 2018 it was the Straightway Training Center, a Christian based drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In 1986, the Texas Historical Commission located four markers in Hungerford. In the late 1980s, U.S. Route 59 was rerouted to bypass Hungerford. In 2000 the population was 645.

It was the capital of the former district of Bad Doberan. In 2012, its population was 11,427. Geography Bad Doberan is situated just west of Rostock's city centre and is therefore part of one of the most developed regions in the north-eastern part of Germany. The town nestles between beautiful beech tree forests just 6 km from the Baltic Sea and is one of the earliest German settlements in Mecklenburg. Today the town is a very popular bathing resort, thanks to Heiligendamm, a district of Bad Doberan situated directly at the cliff line of the Baltic. Historically, Doberan used to be the summer residence for the Mecklenburg Dukes who resided in Schwerin, and for their entourage.  Name  The name Doberan, originally Dobran, is a place name that probably derives from a Slavic Old Polabian personal name, meaning \\"good\\" (dobry). According to legend, the name Doberan originated when the monastery was being built. It is said that a passing deer startled several swans, who shrieked with terror \\"dobre dobre\\". Whereupon the monks called the place Doberan. Even today, a deer and swan adorn the arms of the town.  History = Middle Ages  Bad Doberan was documented in 1177 as villa Slavica Doberan, but as early as 1171 Cistercian monks from Amelungsborn Abbey in the Weser Uplands founded a monastery in the Althof three kilometres southeast of the town, now a suburb of Bad Doberan. In 1179, these monasteries were largely destroyed in a Slavic uprising. Seven years later, the Cistercians made a second attempt to found a monastery on the site of today's abbey. The Romanesque abbey church, dedicated in 1232, was replaced by a high Gothic church after the fire of 1291, the construction of which probably began in 1295, with the remaining parts of the Romanesque church being incorporated into the new building. The Gothic church was consecrated in 1368. The Doberan Abbey became very rich due to its economic activities is and had a large estate. Until the dissolution of the monasteries during the Reformation in 1552, it shaped the development of the village of Doberan. In addition to the monastery, there was a craftsman's village, the Kammerhof (the old monastery farm), two pubs, a brickworks, a blacksmith and several cottagers (K√∂tter). It changed little after the monastery transferred in 1552 to the sovereign. A ducal office was established in the monastery, and a mill and hunter's lodge appeared.  Early Modern period  Bad Doberan around 1900 Stahlbad The Molli steam train in Bad Doberan Doberan suffered badly in the Thirty Years' War. The status of Doberan was considerably enhanced the 18th century when the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Frederick Francis I chose it for the recreation and entertainment of the ducal family, the Mecklenburg nobility and, later, some of the wealthy bourgeoisie too. From England it been realised that swimming in the sea was especially beneficial to health. As a result, in 1793, the duke bathed on the advice of his Rostock physician, Samuel Gottlieb Vogel, at the Heiliger Damm in the Baltic Sea, marking the birth of the first German seaside resort, Heiligendamm. The bathers stayed in Doberan and played on slot machines (the ducal resort coffers collected 30,000 thalers of royalties from Doberan's casinos), dancing, and horse racing (probably the first horse race in Germany took place here on 10 August 1822).  Late Modern period  Renowned architects, such as Carl Theodor Severin, students of the two old masters of Classicist architecture, Carl Gotthard Langhans and Friedrich Gilly, and Johann Christoph von Seydewitz built in rapid succession in the pure Classicist style: the guest house (Logierhaus), the parlour building (Salongeb√§ude) with its prestigious ballroom in the Empire style, the Prince's Palace (Prinzenpalais), the Stahlbad bathing house, several town houses and the critically acclaimed Chinese-style pavilions, including the gem of garden architecture, the so-called Kamp. The prince's gratitude to the builder who shaped the appearance of Doberan so much, was thin; Severin died in poverty and oblivion in Bad Doberan, where he is buried at an unknown location. The heyday (1793: 900, 1840, 3,000, 1870: 4,000 inhabitants) only lasted a few decades. Gradually Heiligendamm evolved, once just an appendage of Doberan's, into an independent resort, and around Doberan it became quiet again. Neither the granting of town rights to Doberan in 1879 (motto: Hirsch, crook and swan, are the arms of Doberan) nor the construction of the railway line from Rostock via Bad Doberan to Wismar in 1883/84, nor the establishment of a narrow gauge steam railway between 1886 and 1910 altered the situation much. The railway, known locally as Molli still runs today via Heiligendamm to K√ºhlungsborn, passing through the centre of the town. The town earned the status of a resort and the prefix Bad in 1921 (\\"Bad\\" means \\"spa\\" or \\"resort\\" and is a common prefix in Germany). In August 1932, Adolf Hitler was granted an honorary citizenship; Bad Doberan was the first town in Germany to do so. In fact, as the certificate was lost, there was disagreement for several years as to whether he had been granted honorary citizenship or not. However, in Spring 1932 the Nazi Party had an absolute majority in the town council assembly, and published articles still exist from that time, so it was generally accepted that Hitler was really honoured in this way. With the town hosting the G8 summit in June 2007, it was decided on April 2 that Hitler should be removed from the town's roll of honour, although normally an honorary citizenship of this kind ends upon the death of the person involved.Town embarrassed by Hitler link. 02/04/2007. ABC News Online On June 12, 2011, a document surfaced that most likely points to Rosenkopf as the first German town to grant Adolf Hitler honorary citizenship (July 22, 1932), not Bad Doberan.  Post-war period  Site of the G8 summit in 2007: the Grand Hotel Kempinski in Heiligendamm From about 1965 to 1985 the large residential areas of Buchenberg, with 1,049 homes, and Kammerhof with 589 homes, were built in Plattenbau style. After the end of the GDR in 1990, the historic town centre and the monastery of Bad Doberan were thoroughly renovated as part of its urban development. In 1994, the rural district (Landkreis) of Bad Doberan was formed from the districts of Bad Doberan and Rostock Land and Amt Schwaan. The rehabilitation clinic of Moorbad was opened in 1996 and the Median Clinic, Heiligendamm, in 1997. Since 2000, Bad Doberan has been a healing spa. In 2005 the new town hall was inaugurated. On 13 July 2006 the US president, George W. Bush, stayed overnight in Heiligendamm. From 6 to 8 June 2007, the G8 Summit took place in Heiligendamm, which included participation by Stephen Harper (Canada), Nicolas Sarkozy (France), Angela Merkel (Germany), Romano Prodi (Italy), Shinz≈ç Abe (Japan), Vladimir Putin (Russia), George W. Bush (USA), Tony Blair (UK) and Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso (EU).  Culture and sights  Grave of King Albert of Sweden in Doberan Minster  General  The classicist buildings characterizing the centres of Bad Doberan and Heiligendamm were all built between 1801 and 1836 by the architect, Carl Theodor Severin. However, the most famous building is the Doberan Minster (Doberaner M√ºnster, 1368), which was once the church of Doberan Abbey, and is one of the most impressive examples of Brick Gothic architecture in the Baltic Sea region. It is the most important religious sight on the European Route of Brick Gothic. The monumental grave of King Albert of Sweden can be found there. Bad Doberan is also home to the \\"Molli\\", a historic 19th century steam railway that is a tourist attraction as well as a daily commuter service in the town and to the nearby beach village. The town hosts an annual festival celebrating the music of Frank Zappa, the Zappanale, and also displays a bust of the artist.

History A Native American campsite was discovered about north of Louise on West Mustang Creek. This is the earliest known settlement near Louise. Stage Stand Creek is about east of Louise. The creek was supposedly named because the stagecoach once stopped there on its journey between Texana on the west and Egypt and Richmond on the east. A nearby location along East Mustang Creek was once known as Santa Anna's Crossing. Originally part of Jackson County, the area became part of Wharton County in 1846. During the mid-1800s, the region had few settlers and they were mostly ranchers who let their cattle roam freely. The town was named after Louise Mackay. In 1881‚Äì82, silver mine co-owner John William Mackay constructed the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway between Rosenberg and Victoria. Italian Count Joseph Telfener recruited many of the builders, which resulted in the nickname the \\"Macaroni Line\\". The railroad had six stations, one was named Louise after Mackay's wife Louise Hungerford Mackay. In 1888, there were 100 residents and the first post office was set up. G. M. Sadler and A. F. Brown soon bought the land. In June 1893, Sadler and Brown filed a plat of survey of Louise and began selling city lots and farm tracts. Their sales material called Louise \\"the greatest country on earth\\" and touted it as a rice-growing area. St. Procopius Catholic Church By 1900 the railroad was owned by the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway, which was represented by its local agent D. D. Hillyard. In 1901 Sadler and partners built a water-pumping plant. Sadler built the Rice Hotel in 1901. H. P. Stockton was traveling by train, stopped to eat dinner, and found that the train left without him. He stayed overnight in Louise and decided to make it his hometown. In 1903, Sadler sold Stockton the Rice Hotel, the Peoples Bank, and the Louise Trading Company. The same year, Sadler planted of rice and made a net profit of $18,000. Soon afterward K. H. Payne and William Thomas set up a well-drilling business and began drilling the first deep-water wells for rice irrigation found on the Texas Gulf Coast. Louise State Bank was chartered in 1905 and taken over by Peoples State Bank in 1927. Rice was the major crop, but farmers also planted corn, cotton, and milo. A number of ethnic groups moved to the area so that the population rose to 300 in 1925. In that year, Louise boasted 25 stores, three garages, two banks, two lumberyards, and two rice warehouses. The Methodist church was constructed in 1894; it was used as a community school until 1903. The Baptist church was built in 1905. Construction of Saint Procopius Catholic Church began in 1945. Until it was built, Catholics traveled to Hillje for mass. Wildcatters began exploring for oil and gas in the 1930s and oil wells were drilled nearby. R. H. B. Hancock transported a rice mill and dryer from Port Lavaca to Louise in 1938. The population reached a high of 900 in 1960. Louise featured a large billboard, called the \\"Outdoor Newspaper\\", which got national attention. Attracted by big cities, young people began moving away so that by 1980 the population sank to 310. In 1990 the recorded population was 310 again. Fiesta Rice was a major local corporation. The 2000 census recorded 977 residents living in Louise. Louise is home of the \\"Brezina Boys\\", six brothers who all played football for the University of Houston. Greg Brezina went on to play for the Atlanta Falcons. His five brothers were Bob, Gus, Bernie, Steve, and Mark. Education Louise is served by the Louise Independent School District which was incorporated in 1908. However, another source listed 97 students in Louise School District No. 51 in 1905‚Äì06. A 1922 photo shows four female and one male teachers. A photo of the 1926 high school senior class shows 11 females and four males. In 1927, there were 212 students and four teachers. The Louise district absorbed several surrounding school districts over time: Sandies in 1938, Adams, Carancahua, and Plainview in 1948, and Gobbler Creek in 1951. In 1990 the Louise schools counted 448 students and 36 faculty members.

This city is southwest of Houston. The population was 8,832 at the 2010 census. Wharton is located on the Colorado River of Texas. U.S. Highway 59 passes west of it. History The area now known as Wharton was part of the Caney Run mail route established in 1838 by the Republic of Texas. The community was named after two leaders in the Anglo-American struggle for Texas independence, brothers John and William Wharton. What developed as a plantation community along the Colorado River was first settled in 1846 by some of Stephen F. Austin's original colonists. A post office was established the next year in 1847. The first lieutenant governor of Texas, Albert Horton, was an early settler. Land for the courthouse square was donated by William Kincheloe and surveyed by Virgil Stewart and William J. E. Heard. Early settlers came from across the South: Alabama, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, and Mississippi. European Jewish immigrants, arriving as early as the 1850s from Germany, established additional businesses and began the Congregation Shearith Israel (Texas), the only synagogue in a three-county area.Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities, \\"Wharton, Texas\\" Other settlers in the community included Swiss, German, Mexican, and Czech immigrants and, after the Civil War and emancipation, descendants of plantation slaves. The area was first developed for agriculture, and planters used enslaved African Americans for labor before the Civil War. Early crops included potatoes, cotton, corn, rice, and sugar cane, and commercial enterprises included cattle, molasses, and sugar. At different times, the community had a cottonseed oil mill, a sugar cane factory, gristmills, cotton gins, a milk processing plant and dairy, an ice plant, and numerous other industries. Oil and sulfur production in the outlying areas contributes to the town's economy. The population of Wharton was about 200 in the early 1880s. In 1881 the New York, Texas and Mexican Railway was the first railroad to reach Wharton. It was more than a decade before the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe was constructed to the town in 1899. These two railroads carried new settlers and stimulated businesses, increasing the population to 1,689 in 1900 and 2,346 in 1920. In 1888, the first opera house opened. When Wharton was incorporated in 1902, most of the structures were of wood construction. A major fire on December 30 of that year destroyed a number of frame business buildings. Afterward, businessmen and the city government were convinced to use brick construction with fire walls for all buildings within the city limits and to construct a water system with fire hydrants. A free library was established in 1902 by the New Century Club and adopted by the city in 1904. In 1935, the majority of the library inventory was given to the Wharton Public School. The first public park was dedicated in 1913, and the Wharton Chamber of Commerce organized in 1919. The city had its greatest growth during the 1930s, despite the Great Depression, with the population increasing from 2,261 in 1930 to 4,386 in 1940. Wharton Little Theatre was organized in 1932, and Wharton County Junior College was established in 1946. The town's population reached 5,734 in 1960 and 7,881 in 1970. A community concert series was developed in the 1960s. By the 1980s, Wharton had such diverse industries as Health-focus, the largest physical rehabilitation and therapy service in the nation; M. I. Drilling Fluids, a subsidiary of Magcobar Division of Dresser Industries; the Formosa Plastics Group, consisting of Nan Ya Plastics and J-M Manufacturing; Coastal Warehouse Limited, serving the agricultural industry; and Gulf Coast Medical Center and South Texas Medical clinics. The economy was also dependent on the county government of this seat. In the 1980s, Horton Foote, an Academy Award‚Äìwinning screenwriter and a descendant of Lieutenant Governor Horton, lived in Wharton. The Wharton County Historical Museum features exhibits on notable residents: broadcast journalist Dan Rather and Medal of Honor recipient Roy Benavidez, as well as a wildlife collection. The Wharton population was stable at the end of the 20th century: 9,033 in 1980, 9,011 in 1990, and 9,237 in 2000.

The population was 101 at the 2010 census, six below the 2000 figure. History Mobeetie (formerly known as \\"Cantonment Sweetwater\\") was a trading post for hunters and trappers for nearby United States Army outpost Fort Elliott. It was first a buffalo hunter's camp unofficially called \\"Hidetown\\". Connected to the major cattle- drive town of Dodge City, Kansas by the Jones-Plummer Trail, Mobeetie was a destination for stagecoach freight and buffalo skinners. As it grew, the town supported the development of cattle ranches within a hundred-mile radius by supplying the staple crops.1 The first formal name for the town was \\"Sweetwater.\\" It was located on the North Fork Red River, a tributary of the Red River of the South. Nearby Fort Elliott, developed to protect the buffalo trade from Indian raiders, stimulated further growth of the town. On January 24, 1876, occurred the \\"Sweetwater Shootout\\". Anthony Cook (Corporal \\"Sergeant\\" Melvin A. King; of the then-4th Cavalry Company H, stationed at Fort Elliot) shot and killed Mollie Brennan (a dancehall girl and former prostitute). Sgt. King then wounded Bat Masterson, who in turn killed him (King may have shot Masterson first and then killed Brennan; accounts vary). Texas cattleman Charles Goodnight said about the town: \\"I think it was the hardest place I ever saw on the frontier except Cheyenne, Wyoming.\\" When the town applied for a post office in 1879, the name \\"Sweetwater\\" was already in use. The town took the new name of \\"Mobeetie\\", believed to be a Native American word for Sweetwater. Because of the presence of Fort Elliott and Mobeetie's importance as a commercial center, Wheeler County became the first politically organized county in the Texas Panhandle, in 1879, followed by Oldham County at Tascosa, now a ghost town. Mobeetie became the first county seat for Wheeler County. From 1880 to 1883, the notorious Robert Clay Allison ranched with his two brothers, John William and Jeremiah Monroe, 12 miles northeast of town, at the junction of the Washita River and Gageby Creek. One day, Allison rode through Mobeetie drunk and naked.Clay at Legends of America Allison married America Medora \\"Dora\\" McCulloch in Mobeetie on February 15, 1881.\\"The Allison Clan - A Visit\\" by Sharon Cunningham Lester Fields Sheffy, in The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart, 1855-1935: Colonization of West Texas (1950), describes Mobeetie as: > Mobeetie was perhaps the most typical frontier town in the American > Southwest on account of its background and the cosmopolitan character of its > people.

When Army Lieutenant Colonel John Porter Hatch was reassigned from Fort Elliott in 1881, the Wheeler County Commissioners Court authorized a resolution honoring Hatch for his service: \\"He has proven himself at all times agreeable to the citizens of this section and willing to aid them as a community or as individuals whenever such aid has been required, and to the fullest extent of his power.\\" Tenth Cavalry, display at Pioneer West Museum In the 1880s, Temple Lea Houston, the youngest son of Sam Houston, was the district attorney of the 35th Judicial District of Texas, when then encompassed 15 counties in the Texas Panhandle. The district was based at the time in the courthouse at Mobeetie. Houston was also a member of the Texas State Senate from 1885 to 1889 and later moved to Oklahoma, where he worked for statehood. An NBC television series, Temple Houston, which aired from 1963 to 1964, is loosely based on his life, with Jeffrey Hunter in the starring role.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106-109 At its peak in 1890, the town had over 400 people, but Mobeetie's boom days ended when Fort Elliott closed that same year. Further decline came with the tornado of May 1, 1898, and then the loss of the county seat, in 1907, to Wheeler. In 1929, Wheeler moved two miles when the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway built nearby tracks. The town steadily grew again until the start of World War II brought a peak around 500. Little remains of the Old Mobeetie. Sheffy, in The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart writes: > The new Mobeetie stands almost within gunshot of the old town in the midst > of a great agricultural and stock-raising region.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 1,910. The city is located in the eastern portion of the Texas Panhandle centered along the crossroads of Interstate 40 (formerly U.S. Route 66) and U.S. Route 83. It is east of Amarillo, west of Oklahoma City, and northwest of Dallas. History Located in south-central Wheeler County, Shamrock was the largest town in the county in the late 19th century. George and Dora Nickel consented to keep the first post office in their dugout there in 1890. The mail was to be carried once a week from Mobeetie, Texas. The neighbors decided to let George name the office. His Irish-American mother had told him always to depend on a shamrock to bring him good luck, so holding true to his Irish descent, he suggested \\"Shamrock\\" for the name of the office. When a mysterious fire destroyed his dugout, however, George Nickel's post office never opened. Mary Ruth Jones became Shamrock's first postmistress, running the Shamrock post office out of the Jones family home. In 1902, the Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railway set up a station in the town, calling it \\"Wheeler\\" like the county, but later changing it back to the original name of Shamrock in 1903, which prompted the reopening of the Shamrock post office. By 1907, the town was competing with the towns of Story and Benonine as trade centers. The town continued its growth as other businesses moved into the city, including the county newspaper, which moved from Story and renamed itself from the Wheeler County Texan to the Shamrock Texan, several banks, and Shamrock Cotton Oil Mill. In 1911, E. L. Woodley became the mayor of the newly incorporated city. In 1926, the discovery of oil and the operation of natural gas wells by Shamrock Gas Company helped spur the city's continuing growth. A decline in the oil industry caused the population to drop in the 1940s, but it rebounded in the next decade with the improvement of Route 66. By the 1980s, the town was home to an established modern school system, a chemical plant, oil and gas processing plants, and a hospital. At its peak in 1930, Shamrock had a population of 3,778. Despite some rebounds, the city population continues to fluctuate. According to the 2000 census, the city population has dropped to its lowest recorded point with 2,029 residents. Despite this, Shamrock is the second-largest Texas city on Route 66, after Amarillo. Shamrock holds an annual Saint Patrick's Day observance. Astronaut Alan Bean, a native of nearby Wheeler, visited the community on March 13 as the kickoff for the 2015 ceremony.

At the time of opening, the U-Drop was the only caf√© within of Shamrock, enjoying brisk business and becoming a successful establishment. Once considered a beautiful and impressive example of Route 66 architecture in Texas, the U-Drop Inn fell into disrepair with the decommissioning of Route 66. Referred to as \\"one of the most impressive examples\\" of Route 66 architecture by the Texas Historical Commission, the U-Drop Inn was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. In May 1999, the First National Bank of Shamrock purchased the then-closed U-Drop Inn and gave it to the city of Shamrock. With a $1.7 million federal grant, the city was able to hire a firm specializing in historical renovation to restore the building to its original condition and adapt it into a museum, visitors' center, gift shop, and the city's chamber of commerce. The revived U-Drop Inn was featured in the 2006 animated film Cars as the inspiration for the fictional Ramone's body shop. \\"Top O' the Mornin' to Ya'\\" slogan in Shamrock, Texas, which hosts an annual St. Patrick's Day observance Pioneer West Museum Pioneer West Museum is housed in the former Reynolds Hotel in Shamrock. 10th Cavalry, display at Pioneer West Museum Downtown Shamrock on U.S. Highway 83 U.S. Post Office in Shamrock The Old Reynolds Hotel, a historic building, was saved from demolition and converted into a museum by local residents.

It was named in honor of Electra Waggoner, an heiress to the Waggoner Ranch. History Daniel Waggoner started a ranch in present-day Electra in 1852. Around 30 years later, the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway was built, and its railroad tracks ran through the area. In 1885, Waggoner's son, William Thomas Waggoner, successfully lobbied railroad executives to build a railroad station at the site. By this time, the Waggoner ranch covered a half-million acres. Until this time, the town was called Waggoner, but following the building of the station and a post office in 1889, it was dubbed Beaver Switch, after the nearby Beaver Creek. The opening of of land north of the railroad station brought more farmers to the area. The town was renamed again in 1907, this time after Waggoner's daughter, Electra Waggoner. Water can be scarce in this region of Texas, so Waggoner started drilling for water for the town's new residents. Most of these drilling sites were befouled by crude oil, which made the water unfit for drinking. Three years later, a developer from Fort Worth named Solomon Williams bought the land from Waggoner. Soon thereafter, he annexed nearby land, subdivided the land, and placed advertisements in national media trying to increase the population. His efforts were successful, and the town grew from a population of 500 to 1,000 between 1907 and 1910. The Waggoner family still owns much of the same land they did in the beginning and still drills for oil there. In 1911, the Electra Independent School District was created. On 1 April 1911, the Clayco Oil gusher brought in an oil strike at a depth of , producing 260 BOPD. Word spread quickly, and the population increased to over a 1000, with many more oil workers commuting from Wichita Falls. The town soon had brick buildings, cement sidewalks, and a telephone exchange. Jasper \\"Jake\\" Smith, III (born 1935) of Vivian, Louisiana, worked in the summer of 1954 in the oil field of Electra.

Georgetown is the 7th fastest growing city in the U.S as of May 14 2019. It is 30 miles (48 km) north of Austin. Southwestern University, the oldest university in Texas, founded in 1840, is located in Georgetown about one-half mile from the historic square. Georgetown has a notable range of Victorian commercial and residential architecture. In 1976, a local historic ordinance was passed to recognize and protect the significance of the historic central business district, and in 1977, the Williamson County Courthouse Historical District, containing some 46 contributing structures, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Georgetown is also known as the \\"Red Poppy\\" Capital of Texas for the red poppy (Papaver rhoeas) wildflowers planted throughout the city. Georgetown's Red Poppy Festival, which attracts up to 30,000 visitors annually, is held in April each year on the historic square. History=Prehistoric era Example of a Clovis fluted blade that is 11,000 years old Georgetown has been the site of human habitation since at least 9,000 BC, and possibly considerably before that. The earliest known inhabitants of the county, during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age), can be linked to the Clovis culture, a Paleo-Indian culture characterized by the manufacture of distinctive \\"Clovis points\\" that first appeared around 9200 BC, and possibly as early as 11,500 BC, at the end of the last glacial period. One of the most important discoveries in recent times is that of the ancient skeletal remains dubbed the \\"Leanderthal Lady\\" because of its age and proximity to a nearby community Leander, Texas. The site is immediately southwest of Georgetown and was discovered by accident by Texas Department of Transportation workers while core samples for a new highway were being drilled. The site has been extensively studied for many years, and samples carbon date the findings to the Pleistocene period, about 10,500 years ago (8500 BC). Archeological dig sites showing a much greater evidence of Archaic period inhabitants have been found in burned rock middens at several sites along the San Gabriel that are now inundated by Granger Lake and at the confluence of the North and South San Gabriel Rivers in Georgetown. Early history The earliest known historical occupants of the county, the Tonkawas, were a flint-working, hunting people who followed buffalo on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, they made the transition to a horse culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Also, small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye Indians apparently were living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements. As these native populations thinned due to non-indigenous settlements, the Comanches still continued to raid native peoples settlements in the county until the 1860s. Modern history Georgetown was named for George Washington Glasscock, who donated the land for the new town. Early American and Swedish pioneers were attracted to the area's abundance of timber and good, clear water. In addition, the land was inexpensive and fertile. Georgetown is the county seat of Williamson County, which was formed on March 13, 1848, after the early settlers petitioned the state legislature to create it out of Milam County. The county was originally to have been named San Gabriel County, but was instead named after Robert McAlpin Williamson (Three-legged Willie), a Texas statesman and judge at the time.\\"Williamson, Robert McAlpin (Three Legged Willie)\\" . Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved 2010-07-26. The Cullen Building on the campus of Southwestern University shortly after completion (circa 1900) Georgetown was an agrarian community for most of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Shawnee Trail, a cattle trail that led from Texas to the rail centers in Kansas and Missouri, crossed through Georgetown. The establishment of Southwestern University in 1873 and construction of a railroad in 1878 contributed to the town's growth and importance. A stable economy developed, based largely on agricultural activity. Cotton was the dominant crop in the area between the 1880s and the 1920s. Williamson County was once the top producer of cotton in Texas. Primarily to transport cattle and bales of cotton, at one time, Georgetown was served by two national railroads, the International-Great Northern Railroad, which eventually was merged into the Missouri Pacific, and the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad. The regional Georgetown and Granger Railroad (GGR) was completed to Austin in 1904. Currently, Georgetown is served by the appropriately named Georgetown Railroad, a 'short line' railroad that uses portions of the former M-K-T and the I-GN to connect with the Union Pacific Railroad at Round Rock and at Granger. Extensive damage and loss of life throughout the county from a 1921 flood led Georgetown to seek flood control. A low-pressure system from a hurricane settled in over Williamson County and brought more than 23 inches of rain in Taylor and more than 18 inches of rain in Georgetown. An estimated 156 persons perished in the flood, many of them farm laborers. The flood and its horrific destruction culminated in the building of a dam on the north fork of the San Gabriel River to create and impound Lake Georgetown, which opened officially on October 5, 1979. Both Georgetown and Round Rock own the water rights to Lake Georgetown for municipal water use. Population growth and industrial expansion continued modestly in the 20th century until about 1960, when residential, commercial, and industrial development, due to major growth and urban expansion of nearby Austin, greatly accelerated. In 2008, Fortune Small Business magazine named Georgetown the number-two best city in the nation to \\"live and launch\\" a new business. In March 2015, Georgetown announced that their municipal-owned utility, Georgetown Utility Systems, would begin buying 100% of its power for its customers from wind and solar farms by 2017, effectively making the city 100% green-powered. Typical downtown Georgetown buildings on \\"The Square\\" This 1900‚Äì1910 \\"pattern book\\" house was moved to Georgetown from Round Rock, Texas, in 2006 and is now located in Georgetown, overlooking the South San Gabriel River. Burkland- Frisk House A densely overgrown 1908‚Äì1910 Victorian house was found in Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera project now sits. It was cut into pieces, moved to Georgetown, and restored. It is known locally as the Burkland-Frisk House, as it was built by an early settler in Williamson County, Leonard Frisk, and was later owned by Tony Burkland, a relative of the Frisk family. The house originally was set across the street from an identical house which was used in the filming of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and which was also cut into seven pieces and was moved to Kingsland, Texas, to become part of the Antlers Hotel. It was moved in 2006 and restored by the developers of La Frontera, Don Martin and Bill Smalling (1953‚Äì2008), and sits on San Gabriel Village Blvd, prominently overlooking the South San Gabriel River. The house was a \\"pattern book\\" house, ordered from a catalog and assembled on site from a package of materials brought by wagon from a local lumber company. It was likely built between 1908 and 1910, and is now used as an office. Historic neighborhoods In the 1970s, Georgetown's downtown was bleak and featureless. In an effort to modernize and compete with suburban retail development, building owners in the '50s and '60s obscured one of their most priceless resources ‚Äì their retail buildings. The Texas-Victorian streetscape was plastered with stucco, aluminum covers, brick, and multiple layers of white paint, but community leaders had begun putting new stock back into their architectural heritage. Georgetown's resurrected interest in its historic resources came at a time when the cost of borrowing money was soaring. Interest rates near 20% might have been a deterrent elsewhere. In Georgetown, every bank offered significantly lower interest loans for the renewal of the town's grand Victorian buildings and facades. And rehabilitation tax credit programs in the 1980s made investing in historic property an even more lucrative enterprise. By 1984, 40 rehabilitations were complete. A mere two years after its Main Street program was founded, more than half the Main Street district had undergone some kind of positive transition.Georgetown Texas. National Trust for Historic Places. 1977. The city was recently named one of the best places to purchase a historic house. Today, Georgetown is home to one of the best preserved Victorian and pre-WW1 downtown historic districts, with the Beaux-Arts Williamson County Courthouse (1911) as its centerpiece. Due to its successful preservation efforts, Georgetown was named a national Main Street City in 1997, the first Texas city so designated.Georgetown Texas.

Georgetown has three National Register Historic Districts: *Williamson County Courthouse District *Belford National District *The University Avenue/Elm Street District Geography Blue Hole Park is a popular swimming area in Georgetown, located on the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. Georgetown is located at (30.651187, ‚àí97.681333), 26 miles (42 km) north of Austin's central business district. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 24.9 square miles (64.6 km2), of which 22.8 square miles (59.1 km2) are land and 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) (8.42%) are covered by water. Prior to the 2010 census, the city annexed part of the Serenada CDP, increasing its total area to , of which, of it is land and is water-covered. The city is located on the northeastern edge of Texas Hill Country. Portions of Georgetown are located on either side of the Balcones Escarpment, Texas State Historical Association a fault line in which the areas roughly east of IH-35 are flat and characterized by having black, fertile soils of the Blackland Prairie, and the west side of the escarpment which consists mostly of hilly, karst-like terrain with little topsoil and higher elevations and which is part of the Texas Hill Country. Inner Space Cavern, a large cave, is a major tourist attraction found on the south side of the city, just west of Interstate 35, and is a large- scale example of limestone karst formations. The North and Middle Forks of the San Gabriel River both run through the city, providing over 30 miles of hike and bike trails, several parks, and recreation for both residents and visitors. ;Major highways *20px Interstate 35 *20px State Highway 29 *20px State Highway 195 *20px State Highway 130 (Toll Road) Endangered species Georgetown is home to five endangered species. Two are songbirds protected by the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve in Travis and Williamson Counties. Invertebrate species found only in Williamson County live in the cave-like fissures on the west side of Georgetown. Karst topography is the name for the honeycomb-type limestone formations (including caves, sinkholes, and fissures) that are typical in the county's limestone geology west of I-35. In the 1990s, a small group of concerned landowners and developers formed the Northern Edwards Aquifer Resource Council, with the goal of obtaining a United States Fish and Wildlife Service 10-A permit (known as an Incidental Take Permit) for the entire county by identifying and preserving a sufficient number of caves with endangered species to ensure survival of the species. These species would be preserved through voluntary donations of land rather than required setbacks and other involuntary means typically enforced on landowners without an incidental take permit. The group transferred their successful work on an environmental impact statement to the county in 2002 and a county-wide 10-A permit was obtained in October 2008. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Georgetown has a humid subtropical climate, Cfa on climate maps. Georgetown, like much of Central Texas, is characterized by its long and hot summers with cooler, mild winters. The average summer temperature typically reaches 100 ¬∞F for several days during July and August. It is common for highs to be near 90 ¬∞F well into October, but by this time, the nights are noticeably cooler. Winters in Georgetown have highs in the 50s and 60s, with a few days dropping near freezing, providing the region with one or two ice storms per season. However, a few days reach well above the average. The region not uncommonly experiences the 80s well into December and 70s in January. Fall, winter, and spring all average about two to three inches of rain per month, while July and August are the driest, averaging only one to two inches and sometimes no precipitation at all. Most of what rain does fall during the long summer comes from the outflow of Gulf storms that are often pushed away from the region by a large summer high-pressure system. Georgetown has over 300 days of at least partly cloudy skies per year, with over 225 of them being mostly sunny to sunny. Demographics As of the 2010 census, the population density was 990.4 people per square mile (382.4/km2).

Photo by Don Martin. Without question, the single most important issue relating to economic development was the location of Interstate 35 through Georgetown. Originally, when first conceived, a Georgetown route was very much in doubt, as most alignments had the road going through or near Taylor. At the time, Taylor was the economic hub of Williamson County as the center for cotton and cattle. While the Taylor leadership supported the Taylor route, local farmers opposed it. The interstate required then-unheard-of 300 feet of right of way across the entire county and through nearby Taylor farms, and many farmers worried that their homes might get cut off from their fields. Also, concerns were expressed about noise relating to cattle and other farm animals. Meanwhile, Round Rock and Georgetown leadership strongly lobbied for a route along the Balcones Escarpment fault line, which would later become U.S. Highway 81 and then eventually I-35. Sun City Sun City has had a significant impact on Georgetown in terms of population and demographics. A Sun City Texas pool at the most recent neighborhood amenity center at Cowan Creek The second-largest economic development activity in Georgetown history was the selection in 1995 of Georgetown as the site for the first-ever Sun City location in Texas. Originally called Sun City Georgetown, the project today is called Sun City Texas due to its size and because it draws residents from all over the state. As of 2010, about 11,500 people live in the massive, 5,300-acre (and expanding) community, with an average net worth over $1,000,000 per person. The economic stimulus, creation of sales tax, banking and investment, and the high rate of community support and volunteerism has had an enormous effect on Georgetown. Opened in June 1995, Sun City Texas is a 5,300-acre (21 km2) age-restricted community located in Georgetown, about 10 miles west of I-35 on Williams Drive (RM 2338). It is part of the chain of Sun City communities started by the Del Webb Corporation (now a division of Pulte Homes). Residency is restricted to persons over age 55 (at least one person in a couple has to be 55 or older). Sun City Texas is made up mostly of single-family dwellings, but also has duplexes. It is legal to drive golf carts on the streets in the development (under a special Texas license exemption with help from Del Webb), and most shopping and the community facilities all have special parking slots for them. Opposition to the project has been vocal at times, especially at the start during the zoning process, with arguments against the size of the community, its effect on Georgetown as a family-oriented town, concerns about the costs of providing city utilities, concern about lowered property taxes fixed for retirees under Texas law, and the disproportionate effect of city voting. Georgetown is considered to be one of the best places to retire in the nation because of its fairly warm climate year round, close proximity to both the countryside and Austin, excellent medical care including Alzheimer's care, and its increasing population of retirees. In 2007, Georgetown was named by Retirement Places Rated (seventh edition) as the Best Place in America to Retire. Part of this is because Sun City Texas, a large master-planned community for \\"active adults 55 and over\\", calls Georgetown home. Fifteen years after the project groundbreaking, Sun City is now home to nearly 11,000 residents‚Äînearly 70% retired with a median age of 65‚Äîand has been a driving force behind growth, development, and the very shape of Georgetown since its inception. Numerous other active adult communities are also found in Georgetown, including the well-respected Wesleyan at Estrella, the Oaks at Wildwood, Heritage Oaks, and many others. Various projects offer differing levels of care, including assisted living. The city, county, and churches also maintain compassionate- care facilities for the elderly at the Bluebonnet Community Residence.  Energy policy  Georgetown is the first Texas city to operate entirely on renewable energy. Georgetown's projected power expenditures were $33 million for 2016 (spent $40 million); $39 million for 2017 (spent $46 million) and $45 million for 2018 (spent $53 million). It made up the shortfall through lower capital investments, rate adjustments, and \\"higher revenue\\" (tax). The average home power bill in the city increased 22% in 2019 compared to 2018. Government and politics=City government The City of Georgetown is a home rule city and adopted its initial home-rule charter on April 24, 1970. As provided by its charter, Georgetown has a council-manager form of government. Under this form of government, the city council provides leadership by establishing the city's goals and policies. The city council appoints a full- time city manager to achieve the desired end set by the city council. The manager oversees the day-to-day activities of the city and all city departments and executes council-established laws and policies. The city council is composed of seven council members elected by geographic districts: *District 1 ‚Äì Mary Calixtro *District 2 - Empty Seat *District 3 ‚Äì Michael Triggs *District 4 ‚Äì Steve Fought *District 5 ‚Äì Kevin Pitts *District 6 ‚Äì Rachael Jonrowe *District 7 ‚Äì Tommy Gonzalez A mayor is elected at-large. Each position is elected for a term of three years, with council districts with staggered election dates. Dale Ross was elected mayor in 2014 and was re- elected in 2017 with 72% of the vote. David Morgan was hired by the City Council as the City Manager in 2015.

Georgetown opened a second high school, East View High, in 2008. The graduating class of 2014 was the first class of students to graduate from East View as a full high school. Up to that point, East View High School had started as a freshman-only campus and added on one grade at a time as those students moved up. Georgetown is also the home of Southwestern University, a private, four-year, undergraduate, liberal arts college. Founded in 1873, Southwestern is the oldest university in Texas. The school is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, although the curriculum is nonsectarian. Southwestern offers 40 bachelor's degrees in the arts, sciences, fine arts, and music, as well as interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Music.

History Tennessee-native Thomas Calvin Weir (1826‚Äì1901) came to Williamson County in 1856. He bought land in this area and became a prosperous farmer. Alabamian James Francis Towns (1850‚Äì1937) came in 1870 and settled nearby on the San Gabriel River. He and his brother, Robert W. Towns (1848‚Äì1938), operated a gin and blacksmith shop, as well as Towns Mill. In the late 19th century, the communities of Weir and Townsville (or Towns Mill) grew around these early settlers. Churches included Baptist and Presbyterian congregations that met at the prairie springs school, as well as an African American church that met in a school near Mankins Crossing. Calvin Weir's daughter, Lucy, served as postmaster at the post office in Townsville, where she also ran a small store. The communities developed similarly until 1893, when the Georgetown and Granger Railroad came through Weir, bypassing Townsville. In 1903, after the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Rail-Road (Mkt) bought the line, known as the Katy, most area residents moved into the town of Weir, officially established that same year. The Katy Lake Resort, created by Mkt on the river at Towns Mill Dam, attracted tourists to the area. The Townsville post office moved to Weir, and with several new businesses, the town began to thrive. A flood in 1913 damaged the resort and several local businesses, and after a severe drought, World War I and the great depression, Weir's population faltered but began to prosper again in the mid-20th century. Following voter approval, Weir incorporated as a city in 1987. Education The City of Weir is served by the Georgetown Independent School District.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population was at 6,448 at the 2010 Census. It is the county seat of Wilson County. The city is also part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area. Floresville was also the birthplace of Vicente T. Ximenes (1919‚Äì2014), a former member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a civil rights activist. Geography Floresville is located at (29.139805, ‚àí98.161692). The city has a total area of , all land. This is about 35 miles southeast of Downtown San Antonio. History Historic dwellers of the area were Lipan Apache tribes. After the Spanish discovery of the Americas, western settlement came in the form of Christian missions. Thus, in the mid 18th century Mision de las Cabras, \\"the goat ranch,\\" was established near Floresville as a mission ranching operation for Mission Espada. Indian and Spanish vaqueros would live and worship here, while caring for the herds of animals. This would be the precursor of the Texas ranching industry. The land and name for this town would be given to honor the Flores de Abrego family, who were descendants of the former Canary Islanders. Don Francisco Flores de Abrego was early settler of this area, his ranch was six miles (10 km) northwest of the site of present Floresville. Four of his sons, Salvador, Manuel N., Nepomuceno, and Jose Maria would serve Texas in the 1835‚Äì1836 Revolution. Don Erasmo Seguin (b. 1782, in San Antonio) also settled in this area in late 1824, purchasing a ranch, and with his wife raised a family here. His ranch, \\"Casa Blanca\\", began as a tract near present Floresville. The Erasmo Seguin family had previously lived in San Antonio de Bexar, and also owned a ranch further south (in present Karnes County), but now chose to build and live in Floresville. Juan Segu√≠n (b. 1806, in San Antonio), one of Erasmo Seguin's sons, was also a prominent Texas military and political figure. He would return with his family to again reside on his father's Floresville ranch from 1848 to 1852. Juan then built a home in 1852 on a property adjacent to his father's, 3 miles NW of Floresville's center, living there until about 1883. He had come back from a necessary self-imposed exile in Mexico, from 1842 to 1848. As a Texian Army Colonel, Juan Seguin, a true Texas Revolution (1835-1836) hero, had later been blamed by some Anglo Texans for the loss of San Antonio (then part of the Republic of Texas), from attacks by Gra. Rafael V√°squez under Gra. Santa Anna's command in 1842, and his life was threatened. Santa Anna was trying to restore Texas to Mexican control. Even though Col. Seguin had beat Gra. V√°squez's forces back across the Rio Grande, he was disparaged as having Mexican sympathies and loyalties. In exile (from 1842), once in Mexico, he then agreed to serve under Santa Anna in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848. Gra. Santa Anna had attempted to regain Texas from the United States in 1846, after Texas was willingly annexed by the US in 1845. After that war, Juan Seguin then left Mexico behind in 1848 and returned to the now US state of Texas, to his father's Floresville ranch. 2015 tornado In the early hours of October 30, an EF2 tornado touched down south of downtown.

History The La Vernia area was first inhabited by the Coahuiltecan speaking peoples of Texas and subsequently by nomadic bands of Apache and Comanche who migrated to Texas in the 17th century. One of the earliest land grants made was to Erastus \\"Deaf\\" Smith. Smith married Guadalupe Ruiz Dur√°n, a Mexican citizen, who was descended from one of the original Tejano or Spanish Texas families; and as such, received a land grant from the Mexican government on Cibolo Creek, north of present-day La Vernia in 1825. This area remained primarily unsettled by Europeans until 1837, when veterans from the Texas Revolution began to arrive. La Vernia was first settled in earnest around 1850. W. R. Wiseman of Mississippi, who organized a Presbyterian church at the site around 1851, is said to have named the place Live Oak Grove, for a grove of trees nearby. Brahan Masonic Lodge In 1853 a post office was established under the name Post Oak. The town's name was changed to La Vernia in 1859. The name came from the local Spanish vernacular for green oaks.

Retrieved 2009-12-21 Establishment Kermit began as a convenient supply center for the scattered ranches of the area and became the seat of Winkler County when the county was organized in 1910. The first public school and the post office opened the same year. The town's namesake, Kermit Roosevelt, once visited the T Bar Ranch in northern Winkler County to hunt antelope a few months before the town was named. In 1916, the county suffered a drought. Many homesteaders and ranchers were forced to leave. In 1924, only Ern Baird's family remained in the town. Only one student attended school in the county for five months of 1924. Only three houses and the courthouse were in use by 1926. Discovery of oil On July 16, 1926, however, oil was discovered in Hendrick oilfield, near Kermit, and the town experienced a boom. In 1927, a population of 1,000 was reported; by 1929 that number increased to 1,500. On March 4, 1929, the Texas-New Mexico Railway reached the town. Great Depression and incorporation The Great Depression had little effect on the city throughout much of the 1930s, but the population decreased significantly in the early 1930s, and both population and business figures rose at the end of the 1930s, when 2,700 residents and 180 businesses were listed. On February 15, 1938, residents voted to incorporate. During the 1940s, the oil boom caused real estate prices to double. Housing was scarce, and some people lived in tents. A bank was opened by 1945. The grade school had to be enlarged, and a hospital was built. Oil boom days In the 1950s, the town continued to grow; housing additions were built. By 1960, the city had a population of 10,465 and 260 businesses, and additional growth estimated to be over 12,000 during the decade. Flooding became a problem because of the flat terrain, so new crown streets were constructed to solve the flooding problem, and more housing additions were built. The town moved the last working wooden derrick in the Permian Basin from Loving County to Pioneer Park in Kermit in 1966 as a symbol of the importance of the oil industry to the economy of Kermit and Winkler County. In the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Kermit bounced between 8,500 and 6,912, and the number of businesses moved between 200 and 116.

(Amburn, pp. 11‚Äì20.) History Wink began in 1926, when oil was discovered in Hendrick oilfield in Winkler County. By mid-1927, the Wink Townsite Company was selling lots in Horse Wells pasture of the T. G. Hendrick Ranch. The oil boom brought new people to Wink, causing a shortage of housing. Newcomers set up tents and built makeshift houses. Wink was originally named Winkler, Texas, for the county. When a post office was requested, postal authorities notified the applicant that a post office bearing that name already was in operation. The citizens shortened the name to Wink and received a post office in 1927. In that year, the first public school was organized, and a temporary building was constructed. A Sunday school was started by November 1927, and the population of the town was reported at 3,500. By 1929, that number climbed to 6,000. The actual population could have been around 10,000 to 25,000 people.Wylene Kirk, \\"Early Post Offices and Towns in the Permian Basin Area,\\" Texas Permian Historical Annual 1 (August 1961).

Even the city government, which was organized on June 4, 1928, came under the control of a well-organized underworld. On October 16, 1928, District Judge Charles Klapproth declared the incorporation election void, and the city government was reorganized. In December 1928, the first municipal building, a jail, was constructed. In 1929, the Texas-New Mexico Railroad built its tracks from Wink Junction to Wink, connecting the town to Monahans and New Mexico. In the 1930s, the boom declined; the population hovered under 4,000, and the number of businesses fluctuated between 50 and 180. By 1933, the town was legally incorporated. Five hospitals and 15 doctors served injured oilfield workers, expectant mothers, and epidemic victims. Throughout the 1940s, the population continued to decline from 1,945 to 1,521, and the number of businesses decreased from 130 to 40. In December 1947, Winkler County State Bank opened in Wink. Wink entered the 1950s with a stable community, including a population just over 1,500. The number of businesses varied in the decade from 25 to 50. In 1958, the railroad from Wink Junction to Wink was abandoned. During the early 1960s, the population rose to over 1,800, but dipped to under 1,200. By 1968, the number of businesses varied between 55 and 20. In July 1960, the federal government approved an application by Wink for more than a million dollars in urban renewal funds to upgrade and rehabilitate within the city limits of Wink. National attention focused on the small oil town, which used the money for paving and curb and gutter work. The population continued to decline to under 1,200 in the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1970s, the oil economy improved, but the number of businesses slipped to a low of five by the late 1980s. At the end of the 1980s, Wink operated on a limited budget, based on low tax rates. In 1990, Wink remained a small oil town with a population of 1,189. This had fallen to 919 by 2000, but the 2010 count indicated a slight rebound, with 940 citizens residing in Wink. Geography Wink is located at (31.754497, 103.154117).

History Bridgeport's history began in February 1860 when William H. Hunt was granted a charter from the West Fork Bridge Company to build a bridge across the West Fork of the Trinity River. The bridge was located approximately one mile southwest of the present townsite. A Texas State Historical Marker alongside Farm To Market Road 920 denotes the spot of the original bridge today . The wooden bridge was used for a portion of the Butterfield Overland Mail stage route used for only a few months between August 1860 and March 1861. After the American Civil War began, the mail route was no longer used and the original wooden bridge was abandoned, deteriorated and collapsed into the river. In 1873 a new iron bridge was built and a post office established, thus formally creating the city of Bridgeport, TX. Its future was assured in 1882 when Charles Cates discovered a vein of bituminous coal while drilling for water. The Wise County Coal Company was formed and was a leading producer of coal for the state until competition from natural gas and petroleum closed the coal mines in 1929. In 1893 the Rock Island Railroad established a line east of the town, so the town moved approximately one mile east to its present site. In 1913 the town was incorporated. Gas and Oil production became a local industry prior to 1917. The 1920s census showed a town of 1,872. During the 1920s, limestone quarries that produced aggregate for road construction and a brick factory were established. In 1931, a dam was constructed approximately three miles west of town on the West Fork of the Trinity River, creating Lake Bridgeport. The lake was a local center for recreation and remains so today. During the latter half of the 20th century, Bridgeport's oil, gas, and limestone industries continued to flourish and the town became the second largest town in Wise County. These industries continue to be the local economic leaders. Education Bridgeport is served by the Bridgeport Independent School District.

Green, W.W. \\"Wilson\\" Ray, and M.L. Manoushagian.

It is the county seat. Decatur is northwest of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex and is located 25 miles north-northwest of Fort Worth and 45 miles northwest of Dallas. The population was 6,042 at the 2010 census. History Wise County was established in 1856, and Taylorsville (in honor of Zachary Taylor) was made the county seat. Absalom Bishop, an early settler and member of the Texas Legislature, opposed naming the town after a Whig Party member, and in 1858 arranged to have the name changed to Decatur, in honor of naval hero Stephen Decatur. In 1857, a post office was opened, and the first school was established in 1857. In the early 1860s, a courthouse was erected. Civil War Early settlers to northern Texas came from a variety of eastern states, and only about half came from the \\"Deep South\\". Most of the rest came from the Upper South and a number sympathized with the Unionist side at the outset of the Civil War. Cooke County and others voted against secession in this part of the state. Violence against Unionists by Confederate troops and militia was common, especially after the Confederate legislature passed an unpopular conscription law. In October 1862, several Unionist sympathizers from Decatur were arrested by Confederate troops and taken to nearby Gainesville, the Cooke County seat, for trial on charges of treason and insurrection. About 150-200 suspects were arrested by Confederate troops. A \\"Citizens Court\\" was pulled together by local colonels, although it had no standing in state law. It quickly convicted seven men, who were executed by hanging. Mob pressure against the court arose, and it turned over 14 suspects, who were lynched - executed by hanging without any judicial process. Nineteen men who had been acquitted were returned to the court, and a new jury convicted them without any new evidence, sentencing them to death. They were also hanged. Another two men were shot trying to escape. In all, 42 men were killed in Gainesville in these actions.McCaslin, Richard B. Tainted Breeze: The Great Hanging at Gainesville, Texas 1862, Louisiana State University Press, 1994 North Texas was in chaos, with dissenting citizens at risk from military forces. A few weeks later, more suspected Unionist supporters were hanged without trial in several north Texas communities. Five were lynched in Decatur, under the supervision of Confederate Capt. John Hale. The Great Hanging at Gainesville is believed to have been the largest single incident of vigilante violence in U.S. history. Post-Civil War By the late 1860s, several stores and a hotel had been established. In 1882, the Fort Worth and Denver Railway reached the town, and Decatur was added to the Butterfield Overland mail route. In 1881, the Wise County Old Settlers Reunion held their first meeting. This has become an annual tradition in Decatur, and the reunion continues to take place during the last full week of July. Decatur Baptist College (now Dallas Baptist University) was established in Decatur in 1898. It was the first two-year institution of higher education in Texas. In 1965, the college moved to Dallas to be in a larger population center. The former Administration Building now houses the Wise County Heritage Museum. It is one of five sites in Decatur listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Wise County Courthouse was designed by James Riely Gordon, the master architect of Texas courthouses. Completed in 1896, the building is an example of Gordon's Signature Plan. He used corner entrances (making for short halls) to draw in the breeze, which was pulled up through a central atrium like a chimney, providing excellent air circulation. The exterior is Texas red granite (like the Capitol) with terra cotta ornamentation. The almost pyramidal mass refers to 1,000-year-old churches in the south of France. The building has been praised, with its \\"sister\\" courthouse in Waxahachie, as \\"the zenith of Gordon's Richardsonian Romanesque work\\". It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1962, Eddie Wayne Hill, lead guitarist for Tommy & the Tom Toms, and drummer Joel Colbert, were killed when their convertible collided head-on with a gravel truck on State Highway 114 south of Decatur. Country singer Charley Pride was more fortunate, surviving a mid-air crash with another plane over Decatur in 1980, though two people died in the crash.

It is the county seat and largest city of Young County, and as of the 2010 Census had a population of 8,903. History The site was first settled in 1871 by brothers Gustavus A. and Edwin S. Graham, primary shareholders in the Texas Emigration and Land Company of Louisville, Kentucky. The brothers moved to Texas after the Civil War, and after buying in then-vast Young County, helped to revitalize the area, the population of which had become badly depleted during the war. During that same year as when Graham was settled, the Warren Wagon Train Raid occurred about 12 miles north of the city. In 1872 the Graham brothers purchased a local saltworks and established the town of Graham and set up the Graham Land Office. The saltworks was not a profitable venture as the salt was too expensive to ship and was closed in a few years. New families started to arrive, and the brothers began promoting the sale of homesites and doing civic improvements. A post office opened in 1873, and after Young County reorganized the following year, Graham became the county seat. The town's newspaper, known as the Leader and still in existence today, was first printed in 1876, the same year that the first temporary courthouse was built. Other businesses from these early years included a gristmill, sawmill, cotton gin, a brick kiln, two hotels, and several stores. On February 15, 1877 the city was the site of the organizational meeting of the group that became the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, created to police ranching and put a stop to cattle rustling. Founding officers included pioneer ranchers James C. Loving (son of Oliver Loving), Col. C. L. (Kit) Carter, and C.C. Slaughter. A three- story limestone courthouse was built in 1884, and it was replaced by a new courthouse in the early 1930s. The 1884 structure's east door still stands on the courthouse square. From 1879‚Äì1896, Graham was the seat of a Federal District Court overseen by Judge A.P. McCormick; his jurisdiction extended over all of Texas north and west to New Mexico. Edwin Graham had married Addie Mary Kintner in 1865. They had five children. Throughout the 1870s they divided their time between Texas and their families back north, but in 1879, with the town flourishing, they moved their wives and children to Graham permanently. Edwin and Addie lived there until 1891, then moved to Spokane, Washington, where Edwin died on May 7, 1899. His body was brought back to Graham for burial. Addie moved back to Graham and became a leading civic booster and philanthropist. In 1921, with her son Malcolm, she set up the Graham Foundation as a continuing fund for the city's growth and improvement. Addie died in 1929Morrison Funeral Home records and was responsible for the establishment of the Eden Home for the aged. By 1900, Graham had incorporated as a town, and railroad service began in 1903, through the Chicago, Rock Island & Texas Railroad, part of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific system. In 1921 the Wichita Falls and Southern Railroad, one of the Frank Kell and Joseph A. Kemp properties extended its line into Graham from Newcastle. The WF&S; was abandoned in 1954 and the Rock Island sold its line to the Texas Export Railroad in 1972 but was abandoned just two years later. Public Square 1915‚Äì1920.

Education All of Zapata County is a part of the Zapata County Independent School District. History The development of the area began c. 1747 when Col. Jos√© de Escand√≥n began bringing colonists to establish permanent settlements along Mexico's northern frontier, when parcels of land were granted to the colonists by the Spanish government. In 1767 Ysabel Mar√≠a S√°nchez, widow of early settler and rancher Joseph L√≥pez, was allotted more than 6000 acres. The village of Lope√±o, later developed on this land, was named after the L√≥pez family. During the early 1800s, part of the L√≥pez land passed to the ownership of the Ram√≠rez family founders of the nearby village of Falc√≥n. In 182, Benito Ram√≠rez built a combination home, fort, and chapel that came to be Fort Lope√±o. Federal troops briefly occupied the fort during 1856 to ease border disturbances. A general store, established in the early 1900s by Seraf√≠n Benavides, served as the area's only supply point at the time. A post office was established in 1920 and in 1934 oil and gas were drilled in the area.

San Ygnacio is a census-designated place (CDP) in Zapata County, Texas, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the CDP population was 667. It is named for the prominent Spanish saint, Ignatius of Loyola. The portion of the community between the Rio Grande and U.S. Highway 83 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as San Ygnacio Historic District.  History  San Ygnacio, originally a Mexican pueblo, was founded in 1830 by settlers from nearby Guerrero, Tamaulipas on the outskirts of the recently established Uribeno Ranch. Frequent Comanche attacks in the early days of San Ygnacio necessitated the use of defensive stone architecture which has endowed the present area with uncharacteristically enduring historical sites from that period. San Ygnacio is also historically notable for its involvement in the short-lived revolution of the Rio Grande Republic, which was established at meetings which were convened in the town in 1839. San Ygnacio played an important role in the Garza Revolution from 1891 to 1893. Multiple small battles were fought near the town in both Mexican and American territory. San Ygnacio was attacked in June 1916 by either Mexican Carrancistas of Seditionists. On June 10, over 100 Mexicans fought a losing battle with about 150 American soldiers from the 14th Cavalry. San Ygnacio was the site of the filming of the 1952 film Viva Zapata. Although many of San Ygnacio's neighboring municipalities were evacuated and consolidated in the deliberate 1953 flooding of the region which created Falcon Lake and \\"New\\" Zapata, San Ygnacio's residents petitioned for the right to remain on their land, which was high enough to escape substantial damage. Having survived, its architectural heritage was acknowledged in 1972 when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, being the last standing collection of Mexican Ranch vernacular architecture, representing the 19th century settlement of the lower Rio Grande valley. Its oldest building is now a National Historic Landmark, the Trevi√±o-Uribe Rancho, built 1830.

The population was 7,138 at the 2010 census. It was settled as a farming and ranching community and was a major railroad stop being from San Antonio. Spinach became a major crop and the city has promoted itself as \\"Spinach Capital of the World.\\" During World War II, a large internment camp was located here. The town is also noteworthy in the history of Mexican American political self-determination for the founding of the La Raza Unida Party. History=Farming, ranching, railroad A view of downtown Crystal City Crystal City was originally settled by American farmers and ranchers producing cattle and various crops. It was a major stop along with San Antonio, Uvalde, Carrizo Springs, and Corpus Christi on the defunct San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad, which operated from 1909 until it was merged into the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1956. From 1909 to 1912, the SAU&G; was known as the Crystal City and Uvalde Railroad. Also, an eastern link led to Fowlerton near Cotulla in La Salle County. The remaining San Antonio-to-Corpus Christi route is now under the Union Pacific system. The successful production of spinach evolved into a dominant industry. By March 26, 1937, the growers had erected a statue of the cartoon character Popeye in the town because his reliance on spinach for strength led to greater popularity for the vegetable, which had become a staple cash crop of the local economy. Early in its history, the area known as the \\"Winter Garden District\\" was deemed the \\"Spinach Capital of the World\\" (a title contested by Alma, Arkansas). The first Spinach Festival was held in 1936. It was put on hold during World War II and later years. The festival resumed in 1982. The Spinach Festival is traditionally held on the second weekend in November, and draws former residents (many of them former migrant farm workers) from Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Washington, and beyond. Internment camp During World War II, Crystal City was home to the largest of the World War II internment camps, having housed American civilians of German, Japanese, and Italian ancestry. Oasis Drive Inn on U.S. Highway 83 in Crystal City Political activism With the stream of refugees fleeing the Mexican Revolution of 1910, and later added to by Mexican migrant workers lured by the local spinach industry, the demographics of the small rural city began to shift over the years since its 1910 incorporation, due to its proximity to the U.S./Mexico border. By 1963, Crystal City experienced a tumultuous Mexican American electoral victory, as the swiftly emerging Mexican American majority elected fellow Mexican Americans to the city council, led by Juan Cornejo, a local representative of the Teamsters Union at the Del Monte cannery in Crystal City. The newly elected all Mexican American city council, and the succeeding administration, had trouble governing the city because of political factions among the new officials. Cornejo was selected mayor from among the five new council members. His quest for control of the city government eventually led to his loss of political support. Although these five elected officials known as \\"Los Cinco\\" only held office for two years, many consider this moment the \\"spark\\" or starting point of what became known as the Chicano movement. A new group made up of both Anglos and Mexican Americans, the Citizens Association Serving All Americans, announced its plans to run candidates for countywide offices in 1964, and won. In 1969, it was no longer allowed for Mexican Americans to speak Spanish in school, and there were no more classes or lessons on Mexican history, culture, or literature, despite the fact that Mexican Americans were in the majority in Crystal City. Chicano School Walkouts Mexican Americans were and continue to be the majority of the population of Crystal City. In the late 1960s, over half of these were migrant farmers who would take their children out of school in the spring and sometimes would not return from the migrant circuit until the fall semester had already begun. During the summer interim, government officials and school board members would pass rules and regulations to maintain control of the absentee population. However, not just in these positions of power was a lack of Mexican Americans noticeable. A faculty committee of the local high school ruled that only one Mexican American cheerleader was allowed and the rest had to be Anglo. In the 1969 school year, students were outraged when two cheerleading spots became vacant, but no Mexican American students were allowed to fill the spots because one Mexican American cheerleader was already on the team. That year, the school board also required that any candidate for cheerleader had to have at least one parent who graduated from the high school. When Mexican American students complained to the superintendent, a new rule was created that stated that there were to be three Mexican American cheerleaders and three Anglo cheerleaders. The Anglo parents complained that the superintendent was \\"caving in\\" to the Mexican American students, which resulted in the school board nullifying the superintendent's solution and creating a new resolution stating that any future unrest among the students would be met with expulsion. Student leaders took their concerns to the school board, who refused to hear their demands, which included the \\"hiring of more Hispanic teachers and counselors; more classes to challenge students and fewer shop and home economics electives; bilingual-bicultural education at the elementary and secondary levels; Mexican American studies classes to reflect the contributions made by Latinos; and the edition of a student representative to the school board.\\" https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/spring-2009/walkout- in-crystal-city After the school board refused to hear their demands, the students staged a walkout on December 9, 1969. Students continued to join each day until the number of students walking the picket line exceeded 2,000. When elementary and junior high students began to join the walkout, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) sent negotiators to attempt to try to get the students back in school. The TEA recommended closing schools early for the Christmas holidays, but the schoolboard nixed this idea. Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough invited three student leaders to come to Washington, DC, to discuss discrimination in their schools. These students also met with Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator George McGovern, who notified the Civil Rights division of the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare of situation going on in Texas. Texans for the Educational Advancement of Mexican Americans (TEAMA) provided the striking students with instruction during the Christmas holidays. The school board finally agreed to a hearing, and on January 9, 1970, student demands were approved. This victory energized the community and that spring, \\"Mexican American candidates swept the school board and city council elections.\\" Within two years, the faculty of the school, as well as administrators and the superintendent, reflected the Mexican American majority of the population. The school had an increase in graduating students and a majority of the students were attending some form of higher education. Some of the student leaders of the walkout have gone on to hold key positions at the school and in government. La Raza Unida Party By the late 1960s, Crystal City became the location of continued activism in the civil rights movement among its Mexican American majority population, and the birthplace of the third-party political movement known as La Raza Unida Party founded by three Chicanos, including Jos√© √Ångel Guti√©rrez over a conflict about the ethnicity of cheerleaders at Crystal City High School. La Raza Unida, and related organizations, then won election to most offices in Crystal City and Zavala County in the periods between 1969 and 1980, when the party declined at the local level. In the 1970s, following protests of charges (essentially nonpayment of services) on the part of La Raza Unida, Crystal City's natural gas supply was shut off by its only supplier. Crystal City residents were forced to resort to mostly wood-burning stoves and individual propane gas tanks for cooking. To this day, no natural gas supplier operates in the Crystal City area, although most residents purchase propane from the city. 1976 indictments Zavala County Bank in Crystal City In 1976, 11 officials in Crystal City were indicted on various counts. Angel Noe Gonzalez, the former Crystal City Independent School District superintendent who later worked in the United States Department of Education in Washington, DC, upon his indictment retained the San Antonio lawyer and later mayor, Phil Hardberger. Gonzalez was charged with paying Adan Cantu for doing no work. Hardberger, however, documented to the court specific duties that Cantu had performed and disputed all the witnesses called against Cantu. The jury unanimously acquitted Gonzalez. Many newspapers reported on the indictments, but not on the acquittal. John Luke Hill, the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, had sought to weaken La Raza Unida so that he would not lose general election votes to a third-party candidate. Victory, however, went not to Hill, but narrowly to his successful Republican rival, Bill Clements. Compean received only 15,000 votes, or 0.6%, just under Clements's 17,000-vote plurality over Hill. Political corruption In February 2016, almost every top official of the city was arrested under a federal indictment accusing them of taking bribes from contractors and providing city workers to assist an illegal gambling operator, Ngoc Tri Nguyen. Included were Mayor Ricardo Lopez, city attorney William Jonas, Mayor pro tem Rogelio Mata, council member Roel Mata, and former council member Gilbert Urrabazo. A second councilman, Marco Rodriguez, was already charged in a separate case with smuggling Mexican immigrants. A week earlier, Lopez was taken into custody for assault and disorderly conduct during a city council meeting in which a recall election to remove two other city council members and him was discussed. In December, Jonas surrendered to authorities after being charged with assault for allegedly manhandling an elderly woman who was trying to enter a city council meeting. That left one councilman free of federal charges.Federal Corruption Case Snares Leaders of South Texas City; ABC News; February 4, 2016.Almost every top official in Texas city arrested in federal corruption case; Fox News; February 5, 2016.

It also serves as the county seat. The population was 3,112 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Beaver County. History Mt. Baldy viewed from Beaver, photographed by William Bell during the 1872 Wheeler Survey Indigenous peoples lived in this area for thousands of years, as shown by archeological evidence. A number of identified prehistoric sites have been found in Beaver County, dating to the Archaic and Sevier Fremont periods. A prehistoric obsidian quarry site has been identified in the nearby Mineral Mountains. The historic Southern Paiute inhabited the region well before encounter with the first European explorers. The 1776 Dominguez‚ÄìEscalante Expedition is the first known European exploration in this area. In 1847‚Äì1848, Mormons from the United States developed a trade route through the Beaver River valley between their new settlements at Salt Lake City in the Utah Territory and Los Angeles, which was still part of Alta California, Mexico. The original route crossed the river 3 miles downstream from Beaver at the site that later was developed as Greenville. This route became known during the California Gold Rush as the Southern Route of the California Trail. Later called the Mormon Road or California Road, it passed over the Black Mountains between the crossing and Muley Point. Following United States victory in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), it took over California and the Southwest. In 1855, as part of improvements, the Mormon Road over the Black Mountains was realigned eastward. It was routed from the site that developed as Beaver to Muley Point through more wagon-friendly terrain in Nevershine Hollow and over Beaver Ridge into the canyon of Fremont Wash, rejoining the original road above Muley Point. This road became a winter commercial wagon road, known in California as the Los Angeles ‚Äì Salt Lake Road, and in Mormon settlements in Utah and Arizona Territory (now southern Nevada) as the California Road. Beaver was settled in 1856 by Mormon pioneers traveling this road; it was one of a string of Mormon settlements along the road through Utah. By design, these settlements were located a day's ride on horseback apart, which explains the regularity of their spacing. They were generally apart. Where intervening settlements failed or were absorbed, they became apart. Beaver was developed between the settlements in the Pahvant Valley and those in the Parowan Valley. In 1873 the US Army established Fort Cameron two miles from Beaver because of Indian raids on the area Mormon settlements. To serve this isolated area, the territorial government placed the Second Judicial Court of the Utah Territory in Beaver from 1870 until 1896, when Utah became a state. Also included in this court's jurisdiction were Iron, Washington, Kane, Garfield, and Piute counties. In 1856 Mormons migrated to the Beaver Valley from Parowan to the south. George A. Smith called a council meeting in February 1856, and the men elected Simeon F. Howd as presiding elder and Edward W. Thompson, clerk. In 1858, numerous migrants from San Bernardino, California, settled here.Sketches from Life and Labors of Wilson Gates Nowers by Reinhard Maeser, PD.B.B.D Beaver City, Utah, 1914. In December 1859, W. W. Willis and P. K. Smith were authorized by the council to build a sawmill and gristmill on North Creek, and given control of all water on the mill site.A History of Beaver County, Martha Sonntag Bradley, Utah Centennial County History Series. By 1869, the Mormon settlers in Beaver were numerous enough to organize a stake. The first stake president was John Murdock.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941) p. 53 During the 1870s, settlers made an effort to establish a woolen mill, a tannery, and a dairy industry. Most were engaged in stock raising. Beaver was the first town in Utah to be electrified. A hydroelectric generation plant was constructed on the Beaver River early in the 20th century. The plant continues to provide a large part of Beaver's power requirements today. In 2006, Beaver won a contest for best tasting rural water in the United States. In 2010, Beaver took top honors in the world for best tasting water. Its welcome billboards along I-15 highlight the water quality.

Close-up view of several shops, 1869. Corinne ( ) is a town in Box Elder County, Utah, United States. The population was 685 at the 2010 census. Geography Corinne is located in southeastern Box Elder County, on the west side of the Bear River. It is the last town on the river before it enters the marsh complexes leading to the Great Salt Lake. Brigham City is to the southeast, and Bear River City is to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.53%, is water. History For almost ten years from its founding on March 25, 1869, the town of Corinne prospered as the unofficial \\"Gentile Capital of Utah\\". As the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads approached their historic meeting place at Promontory Summit early in 1869, a group of former Union Army officers and some determined non- Mormon merchants from Salt Lake City decided to locate a Gentile town on the Union Pacific line, believing that the town could compete economically and politically with the Saints of Utah. They chose a location about six miles west of Brigham City on the west bank of the Bear River where the railroad crossed that stream. Named by one of the founders (General J. A. Williamson) for his fourteen-year-old daughter, Corinne was designed to be the freight- transfer point for the shipment of goods and supplies to the mining towns of western Montana along the Montana Trail. In its heyday Corinne had some 1,000 permanent residents, not one of whom was a Mormon, according to the boast of the local newspaper. As an end-of-the-trail town, Corinne reflected a very different atmosphere and culture from the staid and quiet Mormon settlements of Utah, containing not only a number of commission and supply houses but also fifteen saloons and sixteen liquor stores, with an elected town marshal to keep order in this \\"Dodge City\\" of Utah. The permanent residents of Corinne did their best to promote a sense of community pride and peaceful, cultural pursuits but had a raucous and independent clientele of freighters and stagecoach drivers to control. With some support from political leaders in the nation's capital and from eastern newspapers, the town fathers attempted to use their position as a Gentile city to break the political and economic monopoly held by the Mormons in Utah Territory. They sought to have J. A. Williamson named territorial governor, tried to have the northern one degree of latitude of Utah added to Idaho so as to dismember the territory, and attempted to have Corinne named as the capital of Utah. The citizens of Corinne failed in each case to achieve their wishes, although their leaders and newspapers bombarded Washington, D.C. for help in their fight with Brigham Young and the Mormon hierarchy. First meeting in Corinne in 1872, Corinne Lodge No.5 was chartered as the first Utah Masonic Lodge north of Salt Lake City on November 11, 1873, by the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Utah. Edmond P. Johnson, the first Master of the Lodge and a past jurisdictional judge in Box Elder County, along with many other prominent Masons of the day, are buried in the Corinne City Cemetery. Brigham Young assured the demise of Corinne when he and the Mormon people built the narrow- gauge Utah Northern Railroad from Ogden to Franklin, Idaho. Although construction of the line beyond that point ceased for four years as a result of the Panic of 1873, in the autumn of 1877 the Union Pacific bought the spur line and began pushing it northward through Idaho. The tracks reached Marsh Valley and cut the Montana Trail at that place, thereby supplanting wagon traffic from Corinne with rail transport from Ogden. The Gentile merchants soon abandoned Corinne in favor of Ogden or the terminus of the rail line, while Mormon farmers moved in to buy the land around Corinne and make it into another Mormon settlement. In 1877 an LDS ward was organized, but was dissolved when the town suffered a decline in population. As farmers again settled the region, a Corinne Ward was again organized; during the interim it was part of the Bear River Ward. A meetinghouse was built in 1914, and the Corinne Ward was reorganized that year with Alma Jensen as Bishop.Jenson, Andrew.

In pioneer days, River Road was known as the Hackensack Turnpike,Hall, Edgewater, p. 9. and Ox [sic] Hill Road was an important route to the top of the Palisades Cliff. While Oxen Hill Road still exists as a thoroughfare, another Colonial hallmark and major local industry has only recently disappeared: shad fishing. The Undercliff section in the northern section of Edgewater was originally a colony of fishermen.Adams, Hudson River Guidebook, p. 101 In the 1980s there were still about 100 commercial fishermen in New Jersey harvesting shad from their annual spring run from the Atlantic Ocean up the Hudson River to spawn.

The ferry functioned as the link for supplies, information and transportation between Fort Lee on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River and Fort Washington on the New York side.Adams, Hudson River Guide, pp. 103, 104 In the century following the Revolutionary war, north Edgewater developed into a resort area with large hotels built in the mid- and late 19th century. It was in the 19th century that Burdett's Landing became known as \\"Old Stone Dock\\", as cobblestones quarried from the Palisades Cliffs by Russell & Read were shipped across the Hudson to fill the demand for paving Manhattan streets.Hall, Edgewater, p. 25.

Early in the 20th century the addition of landfill to the Hudson River changed the borough's appearance. Until that time, the Hudson River lay closer to River Road from just above Veteran's field southward to what is now the Binghamton Ferry Plaza.Hall, Edgewater, p. 8. The 20th century brought great change to Edgewater with industrialization, which overwhelmed the boroughHall, Edgewater, p. 49 and filled of the shoreline with its operations. Transportation of factory goods was facilitated when the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway cut the Edgewater Tunnel through the Palisades in 1894 to connect the borough to its main line. Edgewater was also well situated for shipping, with deep water piers on the Hudson River and access to abundant labor from Manhattan. Generally, industrial development occurred in the southern end of the borough, while the northern end remained residential. As industrialization increased in the borough, picnic grounds lost their appeal and resort hotels faded.Hall, Edgewater, p. 21 By 1918, there were 8,044 workers employed by Edgewater's manufacturing facilities, producing primarily chemicals, dyes, and confectionery products such as oils and sugars. Prominent industries of Edgewater included a Ford assembly plant, Alcoa, Valvoline, and the American Can Company.Hall, Edgewater, p. 28 and pp. 33-37 Railroad trains served various factories, traversing tracks laid in River Road. During the first 30 years of the century, Edgewater's population quadrupled, and the transient workforce increased tenfold. Eventually the factories closed. The reasons were varied, but they included the globalization of industry, obsolete facilities and the replacement of railroad shipping by trucking, which could not run its large tractor trailer trucks on Edgewater's narrow streets. Joseph Mitchell's essay The Rivermen, which was published in The New Yorker and is included in his book The Bottom of the Harbor, provides an evocative portrait of life in Edgewater in the early 20th century.Mitchell, Joseph.

The population had been mostly in the 4,000 to 5,000 range from 1930 to 1990, then increased by 50% to 7,677 in 2000 and again by 50% to 11,513 in the 2010 Census. Borough council members and residents acknowledge that population growth has exacerbated the problem of increased traffic. With the transition from industrial to residential, crime statistics were down, with the police chief describing how bar fights between factory workers were commonplace in the early 1970s,Cheslow, Jerry. \\"If You're Thinking of Living In: Edgewater; Factory Town Is Now Bedroom Community\\", The New York Times, July 30, 1995.

Because of the expense of buying property, some currently refer to Edgewater as part of the Gold Coast. A photographic history of Edgewater describes the population and demographics change and its possible consequence this way: > Now a good number of residents live on the river in condominiums and rental > apartments and town houses on land that was once the province of heavy > industry.

A southward view of Edgewater (foreground) from the George Washington Bridge, with the skyline of Jersey City in the background Although the borough is unrecognizable as the industrial town it once was, growing pains have left marks. When the old Alcoa plant site from 1916 began to be converted to condominiums, construction was forced to halt for cleanup of industrial contaminants, including excessively high concentrations of PCBs. In another case, construction of a condominium/shopping center in south Edgewater was interrupted for six months by safety measures to protect workers from chemical exposure in the lead- and arsenic-riddled soil. Next to this structure, behind a chain link fence lies a Superfund site. Operational Hess Oil tanks, beside the derelict Alcoa rolling mill, once the second-largest in the world, are a reminder of the borough's industrial phase. The building, occupying 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) of space, was designed in 1914 and was used to roll ingots of aluminum into sheets that were used to create everything from toothpaste tubes to aircraft frames, before the facility was abandoned in 1967 due to lack of space needed to expand the facility.Hall, Edgewater, p. 28Barbanel, Josh. \\"A 'New Ft.

Ho-Ho-Kus versus Hohokus  A constant source of confusion has been the manner in which the borough's name has been styled, with each syllable capitalized and separated by hyphens. The confusion is only exacerbated by the existence of Hohokus Township, which comprised the area of present-day Ho-Ho-Kus and other surrounding communities, yet was styled without the multiple capitalization or the hyphens.

One is that it was intended to differentiate between the borough and Hohokus Township, which was formed on April 9, 1849, and continued to exist until November 7, 1944, when a referendum was passed changing the name to present-day Mahwah. Another explanation was that it was meant to avoid confusion by postal clerks with mail being sent to Hoboken.

Accessed November 13, 2008. History The ridge above the New Jersey Meadowlands upon which Rutherford sits was settled by Lenape Native Americans long before the arrival of Walling Van Winkle in 1687. Union Avenue, which runs from the Meadowlands to the Passaic River, may have been an Indian trail, but was more likely a property boundary line; it was referenced in the 1668 grant of land by proprietary Governor Philip Carteret to John Berry. Bird's-eye view of Rutherford in 1904 During the early days of settlement, the land that is now Rutherford was part of New Barbadoes Township, as Berry had lived in Barbados, another English colony, before claiming his grant in New Jersey. New Barbadoes was part of Essex County from 1693 to 1710, when Bergen County was formed. In 1826, the land became part of Lodi Township (of which today's remaining portion is now South Hackensack). When Hudson County was formed in 1840, the area that is today North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford and East Rutherford became part of Harrison Township (of which today's remaining portion is Harrison town). However, the area reverted to Bergen County in 1852 and became known as Union Township. Part of the region was known as Boiling Springs for a powerful and ceaseless spring located in the vicinity. Despite its name, the spring actually consisted of cold groundwater seeps rather than hot springs.J. M. Van Valen. History of Bergen County, New Jersey, New Jersey Publishing and Engraving Company, NY, 1900. See Page 413, Chapter XXVI - Union Township. The Erie Railroad built its Main Line from Jersey City across the Meadowlands in the 1840s. Daniel Van Winkle, a descendant of Walling, donated land in 1866 for a train station at Boiling Springs. Several resorts were built along the Passaic, with guests disembarking at Boiling Springs station and taking Union Avenue to the river. Later, the railroad opened a station closer to the river, at Carlton Hill. At the time, much of the property in Rutherford was farmland owned by the estate of John Rutherfurd, a former New Jersey legislator and U.S. Senator, whose homestead was along the Passaic River, near present-day Rutherford Avenue.Hutchinson, Viola L. The Origin of New Jersey Place Names, New Jersey Public Library Commission, May 1945. Accessed November 14, 2015. Van Winkle opened a real estate office at Depot Square (now Station Square) to sell the land of the Rutherfurd Park Association, and began to lay out the area's street grid. The main roads were Orient Way, a wide boulevard heading south-southwest from Station Square, and Park Avenue, which headed west- southwest from Station Square to bring traffic to the new Valley Brook Race Course in what is now Lyndhurst. In the 1870s, the area began to be called \\"Rutherford\\". The definitive reason for the change in spelling of the final syllable from \\"furd\\" to \\"ford\\" is unknown, though the change may have been the result of name recognition of the Ohio politician Rutherford B. Hayes, who was elected President in 1876, or could have been because of a clerical error done by the United States Postal Service.2007 Master Plan - Final Draft 6.28.07, Borough of Rutherford, p. 47. Accessed February 28, 2013. \\"In the 1870s, the area came to be known as Rutherford.

It was incorporated by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey's original group of 104 townships. Parts of the township were taken to form Washington Township (November 19, 1802), Medford Township (March 1, 1847) and Mount Laurel Township (March 7, 1872). The Township was substantially larger than it is today, originally including what are now Mount Laurel, Medford, Lumberton, Hainesport, Shamong, and Washington Townships. The South Branch of the Rancocas on the East Side and Cropwell Creek on the West Side bound this area. Evesham Township was eventually incorporated in 1692 as one of the thirteen Townships in Burlington County. In 1802, a tract was cut off for Washington Township; in 1847, the Township was then divided in half, with the eastern half becoming Medford Township; and in 1872, Evesham was divided again, for the last time, with the northern part becoming Mount Laurel Township. Marlton is a name commonly associated and interchangeable with the name Evesham, derived from the census- designated place within Evesham. The name Marlton came about in the early 19th century and stems from the word \\"marl\\", a naturally occurring mixture of green clay with remnants of shells used as a fertilizer, like manure. Its discovery helped local commerce and fueled the first \\"building boom\\", which took place in the 1830s and 1840s. Marl was mined locally until 1930, when the pits were closed. The Marlton area was recognized as a village in 1758. The village was named Marlton in 1845. The same year the \\"Evesham\\" Post Office and the \\"Evesham\\" Baptist Church both had their names changed to \\"Marlton\\" Post Office and the \\"Marlton\\" Baptist Church.

History The area known as Medford was sold to Samual Coles in 1670, in all it consisted of . Within the next few years the Braddock, Prickett, Stratton, Branin, and Wilkins families moved to the area (many of whom continue to live in the area today). Upper Evesham, as it was then known, continued to grow from scattered homesteads into a small village. Many of the building and roads built between the sale of the land and the American Revolutionary War are still in existence, which include Oliphant's Mill, Christopher's Mill and the Shamong Trail (now known as Stokes Road). In 1820, when the Post Office opened, the area was officially called Medford of Upper Evesham, using a name that had been pushed by Mark Reeve, a developer who had recently visited Medford, Massachusetts.Tergesen, Anne. \\"Welcome To Medford's Inexact History Its Signs Say 'Established 1692.'

The first township meeting was held at the Cross Roads (County Route 541 and Church Road) on March 9, 1847. The seat of township government remained there for several years. Part of Medford Township was taken on February 19, 1852, to form Shamong Township, on March 14, 1860, portions were taken to form Lumberton Township.

A thriving glass making industry developed in Medford as early as 1825 with a glass making furnace making window panes. By 1850, William Porter was operating a glass factory on a triangle of property formed by South Main Street, Mill Street, and Trimble Street. Glass making operating continued on the property throughout the 1880s under company names including Medford Glass Works and Star Glass, which at its peak employed about 250 workers and built up a \\"company town\\" of sorts with houses for owners and managers and housing for workers. A company store enabled workers to exchange scrip for food and necessities. Glassmaking operations ended around 1925 and the factory was torn down by the mid-1940s. Today, many of the nearly 30 workers' homes are neatly kept homes on Trimble and Mill Streets, as well as the owners' / managers' residence at 126 South Main Street and the company store at 132 South Main Street.Medford Historical Society, Medford: Pioneering Township, 1975, Burlington County College.

History Howell lies in the Blue Creek Valley that stretches north-south between four mountain ranges, Promontory Mountains, south, North Promontory Mountains, west, West Hills, northeast, and Blue Spring Hills, southeast. The northeast Great Salt Lake lies to the south of Howell, and north of Howell finds Interstate 84, roughly the area known to locals as Blue Creek. Nomadic Shoshone Indians used the area to travel between the Great Salt Lake and areas to the north. Charles Crocker, a California developer and business man oversaw development of the First Transcontinental Railroad, which passed through Promontory, Utah\\\\Promontory, about south of Howell. The Golden Spike was driven near Promontory (at Lampo) in 1869. Crocker formed the Promontory Land and Livestock Company in this time period, which had land holdings that stretched from the Great Salt Lake north to Idaho, and west to Nevada. The area was used for cattle ranching, with headquarters in Promontory, Howell, and the Dilly Ranch. The company disbanded in 1909. In 1909 the newly created Promontory-Curlew Land Company purchased the Promontory Land and Livestock Company's Utah and Idaho land holdings. Howell is named after Utah Congressman Joseph Howell who was involved with the Promontory-Curlew Land Company. In 1910 Nephi Nessen purchased from the Promontory-Curlew Land Company, and established the first private and permanent residence in Howell. Nessen was born in Logan, Utah in 1867, the son of Danish immigrants and converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who crossed the plains from the east as part of a Handcart company. Other settler families included Andersen, Baxter, Cravens, Gunnell, Bailey, Carlsen, Douglas, Fonnesbeck, Rock, Wood, Allen, Barber, and Maughn. The Bar M Ranch was headquartered near what is now the town center. A school was opened in 1910 in a Bar M Ranch building. In 1911, a new school was opened (pictured above), which has now been converted into a community center. In 1980, a modern school was built for kindergarten through third grades. It remained active until the end of 2008, when it was closed. It will remain closed through the 2009-2010 school year, with former students attending North Park elementary school in nearby Tremonton. In 1904, the Blue Creek Reservoir was built on Blue Creek, northwest of Howell. However, the reservoir is now located almost entirely within the town limits Transportation While I‚Äë84 only passes through the northeastern corner of the town, SR‚Äë83 heads south from the interstate to pass through the town (and continues on to Corinne).

Medford Lakes was originally developed as a resort community in which all construction would be made of logs. Shiploads of cedar logs were imported and craftsmen fashioned them into palatial homes. Inside and out, the walls were of solid log. Some of the logs had their bark scraped off while other logs were used bark and all. As a porous wood, cedar is an excellent insulator so the cabins were cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The resort enjoyed an extended season because the big stone fireplaces could heat the rustic houses even in the chilliest weather.

The population of the town was 687 at the 2010 census. Description Spring in the foothills on the west side of Mantua, May 2015 Mantua was settled in the mid-19th century when members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were sent by Lorenzo Snow to the valley to grow flax. The first group arrived in Mantua in 1863, and were all emigres from Denmark and their local leader was Hans Jens Jensen. Snow was from Mantua, Ohio, and the town was named after the Ohio community in his honor. Prior to receiving its current name, the community had various name, including: Box Elder Valley, Copenhagen, Flaxville, Geneva, Hunsaker Valley, Little Copenhagen, and Little Valley. Geography Mantua lies at the head of Box Elder Canyon on the northern, western, and southern sides of the Mantua Reservoir. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and (13.21%) is water. Climate According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Mantua has a dry summer continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dsa\\" on climate maps. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 791 people, 218 households, and 189 families residing in the town. The population density was 162.5 people per square mile (62.7/km2). There were 231 housing units at an average density of 47.5 per square mile (18.3/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 96.33% White, 0.63% African American, 0.51% Native American, 0.25% Asian, 0.51% from other races, and 1.77% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.88% of the population. There were 218 households, out of which 52.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 79.4% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 13.3% were non-families. 12.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.63 and the average family size was 4.01. In the town, the population was spread out, with 38.2% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 23.3% from 25 to 44, 20.1% from 45 to 64, and 8.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.8 males. The median income for a household in the town was $60,234, and the median income for a family was $61,964. Males had a median income of $42,100 versus $26,875 for females.

Government Mantua is still considered by some to be a speed trap. In 1997, its two police officers issued over 1,300 speeding tickets, amounting to fines of approximately $60,000, or more than half of the city's total yearly revenue. In 2014, it issued over 2,100 traffic tickets, amounting to approximately $220,000 in fines, or more than one-third of total yearly revenue. The sole full-time police officer (and now also mayor) objected to the term \\"speed trap\\" as he said he did not hide his truck, and fatal accidents have decreased since he began patrolling. Most tickets are issued along the town's section of U.S. Routes 89/91. However, a state legislator counters that reduced speed limits, installed barriers, and rumble strips have reduced traffic fatalities, calling into question the justification for such a large ratio (compared to number of residents) of issued traffic tickets in the area. In January 2020 Mantua once again came under fire for unethical revenue sources, as they were issuing parking tickets on land not owned by the city, and with signage knowingly being installed wrong. They had also increased their budget for parking fines 24% over the previous year. When questioned about this the city claims they lose money on parking tickets which is in contrast to the rest of the state. Brigham City owns the land which the tickets were written on, and the Mantua PD was operating with unapproved Brigham City employees telling them when to issue citations.

History  Curlew Valley Settler's Bell at the Snowville City Park. Curlew Valley, named after the curlew snipe that nests there, extends from Snowville, Utah, to the Idaho towns of Stone and Holbrook. The first recorded settlers were Peter Skene Ogden's large party of trappers that camped on Deep Creek December 27, 1828. Some of the discharged members of the Mormon Battalion, on their way home from California to Salt Lake City on September 18, 1848, camped on Deep Creek and also in a cave one mile (1.6 km) east called Hollow Rock. The beginning of Deep Creek is a large spring at Holbrook which runs through the center of the valley and has never varied even in dry years. About one mile (1.6 km) southwest is Rocky Ford, where the pioneers were able to pass on solid rock. In 1869, William Robbins, Thomas Showell, and William M. Harris settled at the Curlew Sinks, ten miles (16 km) west of here, where Deep Creek sinks into the ground. The old pioneer trail and the stage line went through their ranch. The first townsite in the Curlew Valley was Snowville. Settled at the direction of Brigham Young, the community was named in honor of Lorenzo Snow, an apostle who became President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1898‚Äì1901.

The population was 7,647 at the 2010 census. History Although the first settlers came to the Tremonton area in 1888, it remained largely uninhabited until just before 1900, when land agents started promoting the Bear River Valley as a place for Midwestern farmers to relocate. Small groups from Nebraska and Illinois began to arrive in 1898. These settlers were a diverse blend of Protestant faiths, in contrast to their mostly Mormon neighbors. Then an Apostolic Christian Church group came in 1901‚Äì1904. The main body was from Tremont, Illinois, joined by a few families from Ohio and Kansas. Mostly of German descent, this group was referred to as the \\"German colony\\".Huchel, pp.178‚Äì180. When a townsite was laid out in 1903, the new town was named \\"Tremont\\" at the request of the German colony. Within four years, the post office had it renamed \\"Tremonton\\" due to confusion with the central Utah town of Fremont. Around 1907 the congregation was caught up in a larger schism of the Apostolic Church. Some moved back to the Midwest, and the German colony came to an end. But the church left a permanent mark in the name of Tremonton, and a nearby cemetery filled with German names. Geography Tremonton lies in the Bear River Valley in northeastern Box Elder County.
